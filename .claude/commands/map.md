$ARGUMENTS

You are given a screenshot of a region. Follow this workflow:

---

## 1. Explore Stage (Name Discovery + Regional Context)

Use one or more explore agents as needed. Their responsibilities are to:

### a. Name Discovery
- Identify all readable names on the screenshot, accounting for spelling variations.
- Search across:
  - The atlas
  - The states
  - `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/heart-rush-tools/heart_rush/races`
- Confirm canonical matches when possible.

### b. Regional Understanding
- Investigate:
  - Geography and terrain
  - Nearby regions and their relationships
  - Inhabitants, species, cultures, political entities
  - Relevant history or thematic context from the available sources

### c. Gap Identification (No Proposals Yet)
- Clearly list all gaps, including:
  - Unidentified or unverifiable names
  - Missing lore or unclear relationships
  - Unlabeled areas on the map
  - Incomplete information in the source materials
- Do not invent or propose content here. Only highlight what is missing.

### d. Investigation Reports
Each explore agent provides:
- Confirmed matches
- Candidate matches (with uncertainty)
- Regional context gathered
- A structured list of gaps

---

## 2. Consolidation Stage

Summarize across all explore reports:
- Confirmed names
- Verified regional information
- All discovered gaps, cleanly aggregated
- Any contradictions or ambiguities between sources

---

## 3. Gap-Filling (After Consolidation)

Only after gaps are identified:
- Propose lore and world content to fill those gaps
- Ensure new content is consistent with all established material

---

## 4. High-Level Outline (Pre-Write)

Provide a high-level plan covering:
- The key features of the region
- Interesting cultural, geographic, narrative, or combat-relevant elements
- Which components will be expanded into detailed documents

Wait for my approval before writing.

## 5. Final Documents

Upon approval:
- Produce the full detailed documents according to the outline, editing and creating files as necessary.
