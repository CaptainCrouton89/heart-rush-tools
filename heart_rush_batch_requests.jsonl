The chaser starts\nat 0, and the prey start at some distance from chaser,\nusually between 2 and 4.\nOver the course of the chase, the chaser and prey\nwill move up the number line. If the difference\nbetween them ever grows to 6 or more (the GM\nshould feel free to adjust this before the chase,\ndepending on the environment), or if the person\nbeing chased reaches a target number (a safe\nlocation, determined by the GM), then the chase\nends and the prey has escaped. If at any time the\nchaser and the prey are on the same space on the\nnumber line, the chase is over, and the prey has been\ncaught.\nAlternating turns, starting with the chasing party,\neach party can take up to one action and then move\nonce.\nThe action can be literally anything logical that\nyou should be able to do in a chase. Leaping up to\nthe rooftops, ordering for people to move out of the\nway, disappearing into a crowd\u2014these are all valid\nactions, depending on the situation. When you take\none of these actions, the GM should set a CN for\nhow difficult it is to pull the action off successfully.\nOn a success, and if the GM thinks it would provide\na reasonable advantage, they give you an appropriate\nreward from the following: Take A Shortcut, Fast\nLane, and Slow \u2018Em Down. These are detailed\nbelow.\nNote that not every situation necessarily has an\naction that can be taken to effectively change the\ndistance between parties.\n\n```\nTake a Shortcut\nYou go someplace hard to find, access, or pass\nthrough, allowing you to make substantial progress\ntowards your goal. When you leave this space, you\nmay skip the next space.\n```\n\n```\nFast Lane\nEither by finding a faster means of travel or\nusing a vehicle of some sort, you have found a way\nto consistently move faster than your opposition.\nWhenever you move, you may move one additional\ntime.\n```\n\n```\nSlow \u2018em Down\nYou disrupt the terrain behind you, forcing those\nfollowing you to slow down. Your current space\nrequires one additional movement to leave for\nanyone else.\n```\n\n```\nMovement\nAfter possibly taking an action, the active party\nmay move once, incrementing their position on the\nnumber line by one.\nIn addition to actions and moving, on each turn\nyou may also choose to exert. When you exert, make\na CN 8 endurance skill check. On a success, you\nmay move an additional time at the end of your turn.\nRegardless of if you succeed or fail, the CN\nincreases by 2. If you rolled less than or equal to half\nof the CN, your means of transport is exhausted. If\nyou were moving under your own power, you are too\ntired to continue. If you were in a vehicle, your\nvehicle crashes.\n```\n\nCatching the Prey\n\nIf the chaser catches the prey, the chaser starts\nwherever they wish in a spot behind the prey. If they\nwish to enter combat, they automatically go first,\neven if the other party wishes to retreat.\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

They can provide income, followers,\ninfluence in exchange for maintenance and care.\nExamples of strongholds include palaces, forges,\ncolleges, and inns, though many more exist.\nStrongholds can be owned by multiple players.\n\nBuilding Your Stronghold\n\nIn order to gain a stronghold, the owner must pay\nan amount of ducat equal to the square footage of the\nstronghold they wish to construct. If there are special\nfeatures of the stronghold, such as those listed in the\nprice modifiers table, then those price modifiers are\nmultiplied by the base price for the final cost.\nDifferent types of strongholds have different\nminimum levels, which you must also meet in order\nto build them. It is up to the GM to determine how\nlong building any particular stronghold takes, though\nit is suggested that building it takes between six\nmonths and two years, and upgrades take about half\nas much time.\n\n```\nDuring construction, and upon completion, it is\nassumed that your stronghold becomes populated\nwith whatever folks are typical of the type of\nresidence. Shopkeepers, stable masters, craftsmen,\nservants\u2014these people and more will arrive and\nbegin working in your stronghold. Some of these\npeople would typically require payment to work\nhere, while others would typically pay taxes; don\u2019t\nbother keeping track of the specifics\u2014all of this\nflow of money is wrapped up in the initial cost of\nconstruction and income generated by your\nstronghold thereafter.\n```\n\nMiscellaneous Rules\n\n```\nUpgrading Your Stronghold\nUpgrading your strong hold is as easy as paying\nthe difference in prices between the current value of\nyour stronghold and the new value of your\nstronghold.\n```\n\n```\nOption Price Modifier\nIsland x2\nMountain-top x3\nUnderground x3\nUnderwater x5\nFloating in the air x10\nWondrous materials x15\n```\n\n```\nLe v e l Building Area Sq.

The language is\nextremely complex, but whatever is spoken in the\nlanguage, when fueled with enough energy, simply\nbecome true. Hypothetically, you could do anything\nfrom changing the color of your freckles to altering\nthe nature of time. However, energy for Deoric\nmagic comes only from living sacrifice, and using\nDeoric magic to affect other living things is even\nmore difficult. For these reasons, Deoric is\nfrequently referred to as ritual magic, or witchcraft,\nbecause it is usually performed in private, over long\nperiods of time, at the cost of life.\nMaking things even more difficult, Deoric is an\nabsurdly cryptic and complex language. In order to\nmake the magic occur, the desired outcome must be\ndescribed in excruciating detail and with perfect\ngrammar, pronunciation, and rhythm. Simply\nknowing the words to a few common objects will not\ncome even close to allowing you to control them.\nFurthermore, the consequences of misspeaking can\nbe enormous. While in general, a mispronunciation\nresults in nothing more than the spell fizzling out,\nmixing up words can also lead to equally powerful,\nbut unintended effects. The subject of Deoric\nresearch is an intense one\u2014riddled with catastrophic\nand lethal failures throughout.\nMany people don\u2019t know any Deoric, and those\nwho do, very little. Instead, people read from\nexisting texts, sounding out familiar words and\nsequences of sounds as they go. Entire books exist\ndescribing how to perform only a handful of Deoric\nspells. Due to the intense costs of failures, most\nchoose to chant Deoric spells many times before\nreleasing the energy with the sacrifice, thereby\n\n```\nreducing the risk of a single misspoken syllable\nnegating the entire spell.\nDeoric is also used in handmagic, oaths, and\nmost magical artifacts. In each of these cases, the\nDeoric is stored in some object (your hand, a scroll,\nan item), and can then be activated for its effect. We\nwill cover these aspects of Deoric magic in a later\nsection.\n```\n\nCasting a Spell\n\n```\nAlthough anyone could theoretically cast Deoric\nmagic simply by sounding out the words, the odds of\nsuccessfully casting are nearly nonexistent. On the\nother hand, learning the entire language in all of its\nminute complexities would take eons\u2014both to learn,\nas well as to track down the tens of thousands of\nancient and obscure words, lost to history. Instead,\npeople generally choose to focus on different\ndomains of Deoric to specialize in. This way, a\nDeoric magician may be proficient in spells\ninvolving the creation and manipulation of stone, but\nincapable of destroying it, or turning it into water.\nThere are many different domains of Deoric, and\nyour proficiency in any domain will be given a rank,\nstarting at 0. Although your rank in a domain could\ntheoretically go up indefinitely, most people don't\nachieve over a 3 in their lifetime, and the knowledge\nof the gods rarely range above 5 or 6.\n```\n\n```\nSpell Components\nOne of the most important factors in casting\nDeoric spells is determining the spell\u2019s stats. There\n```\n\nare no predetermined spells in this rulebook\u2014\ninstead, each spell is made up by the players or the\nGM. However, there is some consistency between\nspells. **Every spell is made up of varying ranks in\nat least one domain, one technique, and three\nmodifiers.** These ranks determine the energy cost of\nthe spell, as well as how difficult it is to cast, if you\ncan cast it at all. The first step is determining the\nranks of the components of the spell.\nTo assign ranks to the spell\u2019s components, the\nspell should be described in detail, explaining\nexactly what it does and how it causes whatever\neffect it creates. Then, use the domain, technique,\n\n```\nand modifier charts to assign that spell a rank in each\nof its components. Examples are included in a later\nsection.\n```\n\n```\nDomains\nThere are twelve domains of Deoric knowledge.\nThe ranks assigned to each level of control over that\nelement are rough\u2014they are designed to help you\narrive at a value, not explicitly point one out to you.\nBased off the description of the spell, assign it a rank\nin ever domain relevant to the spell. Every spell\nshould have at least one domain.\n```\n\nTe ch n iqu e Next choose the relevant technique for the spell.\nTheir are five techniques of Deoric magic, listed in\n\n```\nDomains\nRank\nDeoric Domain 1 2 3 4\nIil \u2013 Life, spirit,\nfreedom\n```\n\n```\nInsects, small\nanimals\n```\n\n```\nLarger animals,\nhumans\n```\n\n```\nMuch larger animals Megafauna\n```\n\n```\nSu \u2013 Air, gasses 1-foot cube 10-foot cube 100-foot cube 1000 feet and\nbeyond\nYol \u2013 Fire, hot, cold,\ntemperature\n```\n\n```\n1-foot cube 10-foot cube 100-foot cube 1000 feet and\nbeyond\nGol \u2013 Earth, dirt,\nstone, minerals\n```\n\n```\n1-foot cube 10-foot cube 100-foot cube 1000 feet and\nbeyond\nPel \u2013 Water, liquids 1-foot cube 10-foot cube 100-foot cube 1000 feet and\nbeyond\nVul \u2013 Darkness, night 5-foot radius of\nsmall effect\n```\n\n```\n50-foot radius of\ngreat effect\n```\n\n```\n500-foot radius of\ngreat effect\n```\n\n```\n5000 feet and\nbeyond\nKun \u2013 Light, day 5-foot radius of\nsmall effect\n```\n\n```\n50-foot radius of\ngreat effect\n```\n\n```\n500-foot radius of\ngreat effect\n```\n\n```\n5000 feet and\nbeyond\nNil \u2013 Void Very minor void\neffect\n```\n\n```\nMinor void effect Major void effect Massive void effect\n```\n\n```\nIzzuk \u2013 Time, order 1 second About 5 seconds A minute An hour or more\nNaji \u2013 Emotion,\nthoughts, the mind\n```\n\n```\nSimple desires that\ndon't contradict\nexisting desires\n```\n\n```\nComplex desires that\ndon\u2019t contradict\nexisting desires\n```\n\n```\nDesires that\ncontradict one\u2019s own\ndesires\n```\n\n```\nExtremely powerful\ndesires\n```\n\n```\nSutin \u2013 Flesh, body,\nwood\n```\n\n```\n3-inch cube 2-foot cube 10-foot cube 50-foot cube and\nbeyond\n```\n\nthe table below.

However, in some circumstances a\n\n```\ntechnique will be harder or easier. In these cases,\nadjust the rank of the technique up or down by one,\nor even two, if the technique is especially easy or\nhard.\n```\n\nModifiers\n\nThere are three modifiers to every spells, which\nchange their behavior, listed in the table below.\n\n```\nChoose a rank for each modifier for your spell, based\noff of the range at which your spell works, the\nduration it lasts, and amount of precision it requires.\n```\n\nSome Ex amples Make a wooden chair glow when you touch it:\n\n```\nTe ch n iqu e\nTe ch n iqu e Notes\nRibas\n(Summoning)\n```\n\n```\nNothing can be created or destroyed using Deoric\u2014but you can summon things from the\nsurrounding area. Unless specified, it could come from anywhere. Some things are more\ndifficult to summon than others, due to their scarcity (e.g. gold, titan blood). After\nsummoning something, it does not return to wherever it was summoned from.\nMindoran\n(Understanding)\n```\n\n```\nUsed for comprehension, scrying, and effects on the mind.

Keep note of this number and save it\nfor later.\nFor example, making the wooden chair glow\nwould be level 1 (1 x 1 x 1 x 1) , while making a\nsmall tornado would be level 36 (3 x 2 x 3 x 2), and\ndestroying the poison would be 3 (3 x 1 x 1).\nWhen determining spell cost, the GM is at full\nliberty to increase or decrease ranks of individual\ncomponents of a spell at their discretion. These\nvariations can be explained by the finicky nature of\nDeoric spell casting.\n\nTa r g e t i n g a S u b j e c t\n\nIf you wish to target a living creature with your\nspell, you must first determine your intent. There are\ntwo levels of intent one can have: neutral or positive\nintent, and negative intent.\n\nyou must also take into account the subject cost\nof your target. Living things are extremely complex,\nand without knowing a creature\u2019s true name, you\nhave to describe the creature in all of its complexity\nrather than use a single word to identify it. This\nmakes casting spells targeting living things much\nmore difficult. If you do cast a spell targeting a\ncreature, first determine the subject cost, using the\nfollowing table.\n\n```\nAfter determining the subject cost of your spell,\nmultiply the spell cost by the square of the subject\ncost. For example, let\u2019s say the spell to remove\npoison from a dead human body costs 5 energy. If\nthat body is alive, that same spell now costs 45 (5 x\n32 ). If you know the true name of the subject, the\nsubject cost becomes one.\n```\n\n```\nDeoric Knowledge\nIn order to actually cast a spell, you must meet\ntwo requirements: energy, and knowledge. We have\nalready covered calculating the spell cost, so we will\nnow cover how knowledge of domains and\ntechniques affects the casting.\nFor each domain and technique of Deoric, you\nwill have an associated rank of knowledge. By\ndefault, a new character starts with zero ranks of\nknowledge in each domain and technique. As you\nincrease your ranks of knowledge, it will allow you\nto invent new Deoric spells, as well as have higher\nodds of success at casting Deoric spells.\n```\n\n```\nCasting the Spell\nWhen casting a spell, there are two things to\ndetermine. The first is if you are reading the spell, or\nreciting it from memory. Reading it is more likely to\nresult in a successful casting, but is often less\nconvenient.\n```\n\n```\nSubject Costs\nSubject Cost\nSmall creatures 1\nMedium-sized, non-sentient creatures 2\nMagical, non-sentient creatures, most\nhumans\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

For example, a sword that can be always\nactivated to erupt in flames, or a magnifying glass\nthat reveals an examined object\u2019s history when used.\nDifferent materials have different magical properties,\nwhich can make them more or less suited for\ndifferent enchantments.\nIn order to create an artifact, you must have the\ncrafting skill to create the item if it doesn\u2019t exist\nalready, the runescribing skills to engrave the artifact\nin Deoric runes, and the Deoric knowledge of the\nspell in order to know what to write. In addition, the\nobject you are enchanting must have the magical\ncapacity for the spell you wish to enchant it with.\nLarger objects have more magical capacity, and more\nmagical (and typically therefore more expensive)\nmaterials have more magical capacity.\n\nMagical Capacity\n\nEvery artifact has some magical capacity which\ndefines how powerful the spells contained can be.\nLarger artifacts, made of more magically potent\nmaterials, can store more powerful spells, while\nsmaller artifacts with less valuable materials can\nhold only weaker spells. To determine the capacity\nof an item, sum the value of the all of the magical\n\n```\nmaterials used in the item. You can see the values of\neach material in the chart below.\nWhen you enchant an item, the item must have\nmagical capacity greater than or equal to the spell\ncost of the spell you wish to enchant the item with.\nUpon enchanting the item, subtract the spell\u2019s spell\ncost from the capacity of the item to get the new,\nremaining capacity of the item. A single item can\nhave multiple enchantments on it, so long as it has\nthe capacity for all of them.\n```\n\n```\nEnchanting the Artifact\nTo enchant an artifact with a Deoric spell, you\nmust meet all of the knowledge requirements for the\ndomain and technique of the spell, as well as the\nadditional energy costs.\nAlthough the materials of the artifact provide\nsome of the energy, sacrifice is still required to\nenchant an item. With higher sacrifice, the item can\nbe used more frequently, while with less sacrifice, it\n```\n\n```\nMaterials With Magical Potency\nMaterial Cost per Lb\nObsidian 5\nSilver 20\nDragon Bone 60\nDragon Blood 100\nGold 6,000\nGems 7,500\nPlatinum 10,000\nRed Gold 20,000\nTitan Blood 25,000\nTitan Bone 25,000\nAstrum 50,000\nMalstaric Ash 50,000\n```\n\ncan only be used rarely. To determine how much\nadditional soul energy is required for a specific\nfrequency of casting, refer to the table below, and\nmultiply the energy cost of the spell by the energy\nmultiplier from that row.\nWhile enchanting an artifact, the required soul\nenergy is used up and channeled into the artifact\nthroughout the process. Each day, you must spend 8\nhours in a workshop with access to engraving tools,\nand must contribute an amount of spirit energy no\nless than the energy required for a full casting of that\nspell. Once you have contributed an amount of spirit\nenergy equal to or greater than the total soul energy\nrequired for the enchantment, you are finished\nenchanting the item. This takes a minimum of one\nday.\n\nSetting the Activation\n\nThe last step in the enchantment process is\ndetermining the activation trigger for the spell stored\nwithin your artifact. There are several types of\ntriggers you can create, determined by your skill as a\nrunescribe and enchanter. Unless otherwise stated,\nyou can only craft items that can be activated at\nextremely slow speed.\n\n```\nExtremely Slow\nThe spell is activated after one hour of use.\n```\n\n```\nVery Slow\nThe spell is activated after one minute of use.\n```\n\n```\nSlow\nThe spell can be activated as an action.\n```\n\n```\nQuick\nThe spell can be activated without an action.\n```\n\n```\nImmediate\nThe spell can be activated without an action at\ninstant speed.\n```\n\n```\nPas s i v e\nThe spell is always active.\n```\n\n```\nSacrifices to Regeneration Rate\nUse Freqyency Energy Multiplier\n1 per 10 years 1\n1 per year 4\n1 per month 20\n1 per week 50\n1 per day 100\n3 per day 200\nPassive* 500\n```\n\n```\n* Not available unless explicitly permitted by a player ability\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

If your rank in knowledge for the\ndomains and techniques is greater than or equal to\nthe ranks defined in the spell, than you are much less\nlikely to fail. On the other hand, if you do not meet\nthe knowledge requirements, you won\u2019t even be able\nto cast the spell unless you are reading from a\nwritten source, and even then, you may fail.\n\nSituation 1: You Are Reading, and You Have\n\nthe Knowledge\n\nIf you are reading the spell, and your knowledge\nrank for each component in the spell is equal or\nhigher, then there is no check you need to make\u2014\nyou pass.\n\nSituation 2: You Are Reading, and You Don\u2019t\n\nHave the Knowledge\n\nIf you are reading the spell, but you don\u2019t meet\nthe knowledge rank for each component in the spell,\nthen for each difference in ranks, square it and add it\nto a running total. Then add 12. This is the challenge\nnumber for casting the spell. After casting the spell\nbut before the spell takes effect, make a Deoric spell\ncasting (cunning) skill check against the CN. On a\nfailure, the spell fizzles out, or worse, backfires.\nRefer to the Miscasting & Fizzling Spells section\nlater in this chapter.\n\nSituation 3: You Are Reciting, and You Have\n\nthe Knowledge\n\nIf you are reciting the spell from memory, and\nyour knowledge rank for each component in the spell\nis equal or higher, then there is a chance for you to\nmisremember the spell and mess it up. Take the spell\ncost for a spell before accounting for its subject cost\n(if any). Make a Deoric spell casting (cunning) skill\ncheck against this number. On a failure, the spell\n\n```\nfizzles out, or worse, backfires. Refer to the\nMiscasting & Fizzling Spells section later in this\nchapter.\n```\n\n```\nSituation 4: You Are Reciting, and You Do\nNot Have the Knowledge\nUnless otherwise stated, you can not cast the\nspell. Attempting to do so automatically results in a\nspell failure. Refer to the Miscasting & Fizzling\nSpells section later in this chapter.\n```\n\n```\nSupplying the Energy\nWhen you cast a spell, you must also have the\nnecessary energy to power the spell. This energy is\ncalled spirit energy, and it comes from spirits,\nfunneled into a spell. Since spirits disappear shortly\nafter death, this usually requires live sacrifice.\nTo determine how much spirit energy is required\nto cast a spell, refer to the spell cost of the spell.\nEach sacrifice provides energy equal to its subject\ncost (see the Subject Costs table above) towards the\nspell. So long as the sacrifice is made within a\nminute before the spell ends, the spirits go towards\nfueling the spell.\nWhen casting a spell with a subject, the spirits\nmust be powerful enough to overcome your target. In\nthese cases, the sacrificed spirits must be of equal or\ngreater subject cost when compared to the target of\nyour spell. For example, if you wanted to cast a spell\non an average human, you could use human\nsacrifices, or even dragon sacrifices, but wouldn\u2019t be\nable to use rodents.\nLikewise, when the spell is complex or powerful\nenough, it also requires higher level sacrifices. Look\nat the highest rank of domains used in a spell. To cast\nthat spell, sacrifices must come from a creature with\na cost equal to that number or higher.\nIf upon casting a spell, there is not enough\nenergy to cast the spell, the spell misfires. The\n```\n\nenergy must be available before the spell ends. If it is\nnot, you may achieve partial success, though the\nexact results are up to your GM to determine.\n\nTi me To C ast\n\nThe last factor to consider when casting a spell is\nthe time it takes to cast. Although spells are just\nspoken sentences, they are long and complex, and\nensuring their perfect enunciation requires time.\nFurthermore, most mages choose to repeat the spell\nover and over again to increase the likelihood of\nfixing any minor mistakes made in the first runs. The\ncorrect and incorrect pronunciations average out\nover time, thereby reducing the odds of a single\nmistake sabotaging the spell. For this reason, the\ntime to cast a spell is variable; you can always\nchoose to cast faster, at greater risk.\nTo determine the time and risk of casting a spell,\nuse the _Spell Speed_ table below. Use the rank of the\nspell\u2019s technique component to determine the spell\nspeed. The column on the right determines how long\nit takes to cast the spell safely. Note that you cannot\nchange the nature of a spell once you have begun\ncasting it. For example, if your spell is going to\ncreate a large rock over someone\u2019s head so that it\nfalls and kills them, you would have to pay the\nsubject cost if you wanted the rock to be created\nwherever they had moved to by the end of the spell\ncast.\nIf you wish you may choose to cast the spell in\nthe time from the row above its position. If you do,\nmake a CN 10 Deoric spell casting skill check\n(cunning). On a success, you cast the spell in the\nshorter time. If roll less than a 10, but greater than or\nequal to a 7, you are aware of your mistake, and may\nchoose to use the rest of the time. If you roll less\nthan a 7, you are unaware of your error, and miscast\nthe spell at the end of the duration.\n\n```\nIf you wish to cast a spell even more quickly, you\nmay go up two rows instead of one, although the CN\nis 20 instead of 10.\n```\n\n```\nMiscasting & Fizzling Spells\nSometimes, deoric casting goes awry. When\nevery word is critical to the execution of a spell,\neven the slightest mistake can lead to disaster.\nWhenever you fail the deoric knowledge check\nto speak the spell, or if you attempt and fail to cast\nthe spell more quickly than is safe, roll Xd6, where\nX is the amount you missed the CN by. Add the\nresults of the dice. The GM may now describe the\nresult of your spell. Nothing worse than the\ndescription in your result\u2019s corresponding row can\nhappen.\n```\n\n```\nSpell Speed\nSpell Speed Time To Cast Safely\n1 5 seconds\n2 1 minute\n3 5 minutes\n4 30 minutes\n5 3 hours\n6 24 hours\n7 1 week\n```\n\n```\nMiscasts & Fizzles\nRank Number of Successes\n1\u20135 Nothing happens\n6\u201310 Something neutral happens, minor\ndamage to surroundings\n11\u201315 Some people take nonlethal\ndamage, or have some\nnonpermanent negative effect on\nthem, some damage to surrounding\narea\n```\n\nLe a r n i n g D e o r i c\n\nOne of the key ways to increasing Deoric power\nis by gaining ranks in the domains and techniques of\nDeoric power. Gaining ranks in either spell\ncomponent happens in the same way.\n\nLe a r n i n g D o m a i n s a n d\n\nTe ch n iqu e s\n\nLearning Deoric is similar to the way in which\nyou learn any language\u2014just much harder. Use the\nCN from the Learning a Language section to\ndetermine the CN for each check. Rather than\nmaking monthly checks to learn, you must make\nchecks only once per year, after studying for the\nduration. The number of successes required to reach\nthe next rank in a domain or technique is listed in the\ntable below.\n\n```\nIn addition to time, you also need source\nmaterial. In order to increase your rank in a domain\nor modifier, you must be able to study a spell that\ncontains a component of the rank you seek to reach.\nOnce you have used that spell to gain a success at the\nend of the year with your language learning check,\nyou cannot use that spell for further successes\ntowards the same rank. For example, if I want to\nreach rank two in Vul, I need to have access to a\nspell that I can read that requires Vul 2 as one of its\ncomponents. If I succeed on my language check at\nthe end of the year, I cannot use that same spell to\ncontinue learning towards rank two in Vul. If that\nbook also contains a spell that requires Vul 3, I\ncannot use that to satisfy the requirement for source\nmaterial, since it is too advanced.\n```\n\n```\nInventing Spells\nSpells can be invented, as well as learned. In\norder to invent a spell, you must first describe and\ndetermine stats for that spell, as described in the\nprevious sections. If you do not have the ranks in the\ndomains or techniques corresponding to the spell\u2019s\ndomain and technique ranks, you cannot invent the\nspell. The GM may also determine that the spell you\ndescribed requires specialty knowledge, even more\nspecific than the general ranks in each domain you\ncould gain, in which case you may have to achieve\nother, specific conditions set by the GM.\nIf you do meet the requirements, however, then\nyou may begin work. Each week you may make a\nCN 15 Deoric spell invention (cunning) check. Once\nyou have a number of successes equal to the spell\ncost of the spell, you have learned how to cast the\nspell, and can write it down or commit it to memory.\n```\n\n```\n16\u201320 Something negative and permanent\nbut not lethal occurs to one or more\npeople, major destruction to\nimmediate area\n21\u201325 One or more people are lethally or\nvery negatively and permanently\naffected, mass destruction\n26 Catastrophe occurs\n```\n\n```\nRank Number of Successes\n```\n\n```\nGaining Ranks\nRank Number of Successes\n1 1\n2 5\n3 25\n4 50\n5 50\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

If you are\ninterested in making money at a large scale through\ntrade, this section is for you.\n\nMaking Money\n\nEvery settlement has an economy around buying\nand selling roughly the same goods. For example,\nalmost everyone needs food and clothing, and most\nsettlements also need stone, lumber, beer, salt, and a\nlarge number of other \u201ccore\u201d resources. However,\nsome settlements are producers of those goods, or\nare adjacent to one, and therefore have a surplus of\nthat good, and others have deficits of that good, and\ntherefore have high demand for that good. This is\nwhere you come in.\n\nPrices\n\nEvery settlement has a rating for its size, which\ndetermines how many buyers and sellers there are, as\nwell as at what level. Then, for every common good\n(see the _Common Goods_ table below), there is a level\nof need. This reflects if this good is in demand, or in\nsurplus, and at what level of magnitude. The rating is\nsecretly determined by the GM, but will reflect\navailability of that good in the area. Also note that a\nsettlement will only ever have demand or surplus for\na good\u2014never both (since then those people would\njust trade amongst themselves until there was no\nmore surplus or demand). This rating determines the\nprice of any given good within a settlement.\n\n```\nTo find that price, look at the demand/surplus\nmodifier for that good. If the good is in demand,\nmultiply the price of the good by this number. If the\ngood is in surplus, divide the good\u2019s price by this\nnumber. The end result is the approximate price for\nthat good in that location. While you, as a merchant,\nmay (and should) approximate this value yourself,\nthe \u201ctrue\u201d value is determined, and held secretly, by\nthe GM.\n```\n\n```\nBu yers and Sellers\nIn order to take advantage of this price, you must\nbe able to find buyers and sellers. Even if individual\npeople want to buy or sell some good, you cannot\nturn profit by making individual sales\u2014you must\nbuy or sell in bulk. For this, usually only\nshopkeepers and other local merchants can be your\ncustomers.\nTo determine the number of buyers or sellers in a\nsettlement, the GM should first look at the good you\nare interested in buying or selling. If it is in surplus\nin this settlement, there are only sellers. In contrast,\nif there is demand for this good, then there are only\nbuyers. If the rating is 0, then there are an equal\ndivision of buyers and sellers (rounded in either\ndirection, at GM discretion). Then, take the value in\nthe bonus traders column of the Surplus & Demand\ntable, and add it to the value listed in the buyers/\nsellers column of the Settlements table.\nFor example, if furs were in moderate demand\n(1d4 - 1) in a small town (+1), then the number of\nbuyers would be equal to 1d4. Or, for example, if\nbricks were in extreme surplus (1d4 + 1) in a hamlet\n(+0), then the number of sellers would be equal to\n```\n\n1d4 + 1. Or, if honey was neutral (1d4 - 3) in a\nmetropolis (+4), then there would be 1d4 + 1 buyers\nand sellers, split evenly between the two.\n\nSecuring a Buyer or Seller\n\nWhen you come to a settlement, you can choose\nto spend a day looking for a buyer or seller of a\nparticular good. That time is spent perusing shops,\nvisiting guilds, and performing more general\ninformation gathering techniques. While this part of\nthe day will likely not be played out, actually\nmeeting the buyer or seller will.\nWhen you meet a buyer or seller, the GM will\nroll a die equal to the value in the buyer/seller level\ncolumn of the _Settlement_ table, and then add your\ninfluence, up to the maximum level listed in the max\nlevel column. This is the level of the trader, and\nrepresents how many units of goods they may be\nwilling to buy or sell to you at the given price. From\nthis point on, it is up to you to secure a price you\nwant. Although an approximate base price has been\ncalculated by the GM using the supply/demand table,\nit is up to you to find the best deal that you can.\nOnce you have agreed upon a price, you may\ntransfer a number of goods to the trader up to or\nequal to their level, and get paid your agreed upon\nprice.\nIf you wish, you may continue looking for buyers\nand sellers of the same good, or you may look for a\nbuyer or seller of a different good. In either case, this\nstill takes a day, and follows the same process.\nOnce you have a made a deal with a one or more\nbuyers or sellers in a settlement, you may always\nreturn to that settlement to make the exact same\nexchange of money for goods, once per month. You\ndo not need to find new buyers or sellers, and you do\nnot have to haggle for a new price (though you may\ndo either of these things if you wish). Although a\ntrader may disappear, or wish to renegotiate prices,\n\n```\nthis will not typically happen except when the GM\ndecides it makes sense.\n```\n\n```\nTr a de R ou t e s\nAt the heart of being a successful merchant is\nidentifying and exploiting lucrative trade routes.\nWhile it\u2019s possible for a trader to constantly travel,\nbuying and selling whatever they deem fit, it is much\nbetter to automate this so that the merchant\u2019s time\ncan be spent elsewhere. This automation takes the\nform of trade routes.\nTrade routes are cyclical paths connecting a\ncollection of settlements, in which the starting and\nending settlement are the same, and the quantity of\npurchases and sales in every settlement along the\nway remains in equilibrium with each pass through\nthe cycle.\nAlthough there are no specific rules dictating\nspecial properties of trade routes, it is heavily\nrecommended that you develop them, as they allow\nyou assign the job of actually traveling between\nsettlements and executing the trades to someone else.\nIn order to count as a trade route, there must not\nbe any sort renegotiating on prices and quantities for\neach good at each stop in the trade route, and there\nmust be a settlement of origin, where your trade\nroute begins and ends. Once this has been confirmed,\nyour trade route\u2019s profit can be calculated by looking\nat the total revenue from completing a trade route\nand then subtracting the maintenance costs for\nwhatever vehicles were used for that time. This\nmoney can then be picked up from your settlement\nof origin after each cycle of the trade route is\ncompleted.\n```\n\n```\nMilestones\nAs you improve as a trader, you unlock certain\nbenefits, due to a combination of your influence,\n```\n\nwealth, and experience. Each milestone is unlocked\nonce you achieve its prerequisite achievements.\n\nTr a de r: Novice\n\n_Establish 20 miles worth of trade routes._\nYou know how to identify who\u2019s more likely to\nbuy or sell a lot. When you enter a new settlement,\nyou may ask the GM to roll the level for each buyer\nor seller in the settlement, and announce their levels\nto you. You may meet them in any order.\n\nTr a de r: Amateur\n_Establish 100 miles worth of trade routes._\n\n```\nYour minimum influence level becomes two.\n```\n\nTr a de r: Professional\n\n_Establish 500 miles worth of trade routes_\nYou have gained an intuition about where pirates\nand thieves may lie. You have A3 on all checks to\npredict their presence, including when you research a\ntrade route as well as while actually traveling it.\nYour minimum influence level becomes three.\n\nTr a de r: Expert\n\n_Establish 2,000 miles worth of trade routes._\nYou can find a better deal on most things. If you\nfind an item being sold, if it is not a unique item, and\nit costs less than 50,000 ducat, roll 1d100. If you roll\nunder 50, you know someone else who\u2019s selling it at\na price at that percentage discount on the price you\noriginally found. The GM will tell you their name\nand how you know how to contact them.You may\nuse this ability once per month.\nFor example, if you found a magical knife that\ncosted 40,000 ducat, you could use this ability and\nroll 1d100. If you rolled a 25, then the GM would\ntell you that you actually know a friend, \u201cAndre\u201d\nwho sells that exact item for 30,000 (40,000 - 25% x\n40,000). The GM will tell you how you know (or\n\n```\nknow of ) this person, as well as where they are and\nhow you could contact them.\nYou may use this ability on bulk purchases as\nwell, so long as each individual item of the bulk\npurchase costs less than 50,000.\nAdditionally, your minimum influence level\nbecomes four.\n```\n\n```\nTr a de r: Master\nEstablish 10,000 miles worth of trade routes.\nYou have connections everywhere. If an item is\non the market in any of the markets your trade route\ntouches, you can use your trade network to locate a\nbuyer or a seller. You may use this ability any\nnumber of times for items that not unique, and only\nonce per month for unique items.\nAdditionally, your minimum influence level\nbecomes five.\n```\n\nComplications &\n\nOther Factors\n\n```\nThese rules outline what things will look like\nwhen everything is going nicely. However, there are\nseveral other factors to consider when implemented\nin an actual game.\n```\n\n```\nTa x e s\nTaxes are a huge concern for merchants, and\nthey\u2019re often a pain to avoid. Most cities and large\nports have tariffs on imported resources. These\nusually range from 2\u20135% of imported value, but their\nexact rates are us up to the GM, as well as if they\nexist at all. Fortunately, bribes, smuggling, and other\ntrickery can be used to get around these. As a player,\n```\n\nit is up to you to decide if you want to avoid these,\nand if so, how.\n\nWeather\n\nThe second bane of the merchant lifestyle is the\nweather. Weather can lead to delays, damaged\nshipments, or no shipments at all, such as if a ship\nsinks at sea. When the GM approximates the time it\ntakes from one settlement to another, they should\ntake this into account. In addition, if you are\ntraveling some place where shipments could be\ndamaged, the GM may choose to place a percentage\nloss on profits based off of how likely they estimate\nthese damages to occur.\nLastly, the GM may decide that weather has\ncaused an entire shipment to disappear. Usually, this\nis cause for player investigation, but if you are\nshipping goods through a dangerous area, this may\njust be a cost of doing business.\n\n```\nPirates & Thieves\nThe last thorn in the side of merchants come\nfrom the pirates and thieves who steal merchandise\nin transit. As with weather, this may just be a\nconstant cost to your shipments, or, it may be a\nsource of further adventure. The GM should think\ncarefully about where pirates and thieves reside, and\nwhere and how they go about stealing.\nSurplus & Demand\nNeed Demand/Surplus\nModifier\n```\n\n```\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

They are the three most critical\ncomponents to any ship, and their state of repair\nshould be tracked when players own their own ship\nand its management is central to the game. Sky ships\nand ice breakers will have a fourth component\u2014the\nengine\u2014with rules listed here as well.\nEach component on a ship can be in four states\nof repair: new, weathered, broken, and irreparable.\nWhen bad stuff happens to a ship, it can cause the\nstate of one or more of its components to fall. A new\nship will start with all of its components in the\n\u201cnew\u201d state. If the ship is used but nothing is broken,\nthe ship\u2019s components will all be either \u201cnew\u201d or\n\u201cweathered\u201d. Components in the \u201cweathered\u201d state\nhave no penalties, but are closer to breaking. When a\ncomponent becomes broken or irreparable, it comes\nwith special consequences to the ship and crew,\nlisted in the next sections.\n\nSails\n\nSails include all their related equipment, such as\nmasts, sails, and lines. When sails become broken,\nthe ship moves at half speed. Broken sails represent\nshredded sails, a crack forming in the mast, or\ndestroyed or missing lines. If the sails become\nirreparably broken, the ship cannot move. If your\nmast breaks or your sails are destroyed, then the sails\nare irreparable.\n\n```\nHull\nThe hull is critical to the structural integrity of\nthe ship, making up the entire outer shell of the boat\nmaking contact with the water. When the hull is\nbroken, the ship has sprung one or more minor leaks.\nIf the leak/s are not addressed soon, the ship will\neventually sink. A ship with a broken hull will\nautomatically enter the irreparable state after 24\nhours if the hull is not repaired. An irreparable hull is\none that has one or more massive leaks, and is no\nlonger capable of staying afloat. The ship cannot be\nrepaired, and will sink in the next hour.\n```\n\n```\nSteering\nThe steering includes all parts of the ship critical\nto maneuvering the ship, such as the rudder, keel,\nhelm, and gears and shafts connecting the helm to\nthe rudder. These parts of the ship are generally more\nfragile and will break easily if exposed to\nunexpected forces. When the steering is broken, you\ncannot change course or make course corrections.\nYou move in the direction of the wind (chosen at\nrandom by the GM). You may choose to move at full\nspeed in that direction if your sails are unfurled.\nWhen the steering is broken,\n```\n\n```\nEngine\nIcebreakers and airships have aether engines,\ncritical to their locomotion. Aether engines require\nmassive fuel tanks of aether and some complex\nmachinery for turning that aether into physical\nrotation used to turn massive propellers. When the\nengine is broken, it will not run. Any benefits\nconferred by your ships engine are lost. In an airship,\n```\n\nthis means you cannot change altitude or exit an\nastral current. In an icebreaker, this means you\ncannot break ice.\n\nShip Repair\n\nWhen a component of your ship is weathered or\nbroken, it can be repaired. Repairing your ship is a\ncamp action. It takes four camp actions to return a\ncomponent from broken to weathered. To return a\ncomponent to the new state, a brand new component\nmust be installed. The cost and work required for this\nis up to the GM.\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

This is\nimportant because it allows units to block\nchokepoints; one army can\u2019t slip past another in a\nmountain pass\u2014if one wants to fight, they have to\nfight.\n\nBattle\n\nWhen carrying out a battle, the player should\ntake the size of their unit and divide it by the\ncombined sizes of both units, then multiply it by 100.\nThis is the target number. They then roll a d100. If\nthey roll under the target number, the player is\nvictorious! Otherwise, they suffer defeat.\n\n```\nRegardless of win or loss, both units must\ndisband 10% of their troops from casualties. Then,\ncompare the target number to the number rolled. If\nthe victor rolled between 1 and 20 more than the\ntarget number, it was a minor victory. The defender\nmust choose to either give up ground, or to disband\n20% of the troops in their unit, rather than just 10%.\nIf the victor rolled between 21 and 50 more than the\ntarget number, it was a major victory. The defender\nmust give up ground and disband 30% of the troops\nin their unit, rather than just 10%. If the victor rolled\nmore than 51 greater than the target number, it was a\nroute, and the defender must give up ground and\ndisband 60% of the troops in their unit, rather than\njust 10%.\n```\n\n```\nGiving Up Ground\nWhen you give up ground, your unit no longer\nprevents the other unit from moving past it for a day,\nand your unit cannot move for a day. In the case of\nfailing to defend the mountain pass, the opposing\narmy would now free to march through the pass, on\ntowards your towns and cities. In the case of\ndefending a city, it means retreating from the city\u2014\nthereby granting the city to the attackers. Sometimes,\nwhen in the case of a siege for example, the attacker\ngiving up ground has little to no effect, since the\ntroops within the walls of a castle have no reason to\nleave.\n```\n\n```\nDisbanding Troops\nDisbanded troops are troops that have either died\nor fled the battle, never to return. When you disband\ntroops, remove that many troops from your unit,\nrounded up.\n```\n\n```\nSituational Effects\nIn every battle, there is an attacker, and a\ndefender. The attacker is instigating, and the\n```\n\ndefender is trying to hold a position. The attacker\nwins if they can eventually destroy or dislodge the\ndefender, and the defender wins if the attacker gives\nup. Before figuring out situational bonuses,\ndetermine who is the attacker, and who is the\ndefender. If there truly is no attacker or defender,\nthere are no bonuses that are awarded. Otherwise,\napply any of the following bonuses and penalties, if\napplicable:\n\n- High ground: If the defenders have a clear\n  terrain advantage, such as a narrow chokepoint or\n  the high ground, multiply their effective troop\n  count by 1.5.\n- Fortified: If the defenders are behind fortified\n  walls, multiply their effective troop count by 3.\n- Unprepared: If the defenders were caught\n  completely off guard by the attack, multiply their\n  effective troop count by 1/3.\n\nPlayer Intervention\n\nPlayers may wish to participate in battles with\ntheir units.

These rules are intended to\nmake large battles play out in a way that feels\ncinematic and more narratively satisfying than\nsimply rolling a single die and declaring a victor.\nThey allow one or more players to control troops in a\nbattle against one or more other enemy forces.\n\nUnits\n\nEvery army is composed of units\u2014similarly\nsized groups of combatants who fight as a group.\nBecause different battles happen at different scales, a\nunit consists of however many soldiers can fit on a\nsingle square of a battle map. If the battle map scale\nis 1:25, this may mean that a single mountain giant\ncounts as a unit, while 25 human soldiers also count\nas a single unit. If the scale is instead 1:100, then one\nunit could consist of four mountain giants, or 400\nsoldiers. Before any big battle, it is important to\n\n```\ndetermine the scale so that you can allocate your\nsoldiers into units. Scales that result in 5\u201315 units are\nusually best.\n```\n\n```\nAllocating Units\nOnce you have determined the scale of the battle,\nit is time to allocate your soldiers into units. For\nexample, if the scale of our battle was 1:25, if you\nhad 300 infantrymen, 100 cavalry, and 50 archers,\nthen you would have 12 infantry units, 4 cavalry\nunits, and 2 archer units.\nAfter determining which units are included in\nyour army, you can assign their stats. Details on how\nthese stats are used will be described later, but for\nnow, just focus on the troop name in the table below,\nand whether it accurately describes your unit. If you\nhave a unit that is not included in the table, find its\nclosest approximation, or else come up with your\nown stats. It is ultimately up to the GM to approve\nthe stats of your unit, but they will be using the same\nguidance as you.\n```\n\n```\nUnits\nTr o op ML MV POWR NG Notes\n```\n\n```\nStandard Light\nInfantry\n```\n\n```\n5 5 d4 1 This unit can be up to ten spaces from an officer or commander\nwithout disbanding.\nStandard\nMedium\nInfantry\n```\n\n```\n5 3 d6 1 This unit can be up to six spaces from an officer or commander\nwithout disbanding.\n```\n\n```\nStandard Heavy\nInfantry\n```\n\n```\n5 1 d8 1\n```\n\n```\nDwarven\nGoatriders\n```\n\n```\n5 6 d6 1\n```\n\nOfficer Units\n\nWhen there are troops, there must also be\nofficers\u2014those in control of managing those troops\non the battlefield. For every four units in an army,\nselect one of them to contain an officer. If a troop is\never more than four spaces from an officer, then the\nunit loses discipline and is disbanded. This means\nthat the troop either flees, surrenders, or gives up at\nfighting, and should be removed from the board.\nIf the unit containing the officer is ever\ndisbanded, or if the officer is killed, isolated, or\notherwise prevented from communicated, then the\nunit no longer counts as containing an officer,\npotentially causing nearby troops to be disbanded as\nwell.\n\n```\nCommanders\nAt the head of every army is its commander\u2014the\nperson in charge of the operations and tactics of their\ntroops, and in charge of all of the officers. This could\nbe a trustworthy NPC, or even a player. In either\ncase, they must be chosen before a battle begins, and\na new commander cannot be selected until the battle\nis over. As with officers, they reside in a unit.\nChoose one of your units to contain the commander.\nJust like with officers, if an officer unit is ever more\nthan eight spaces from the commander, then the\nofficer unit is disbanded.\nIf the commander dies during a battle, is isolated\nfrom their army, or is otherwise no longer capable of\ngiving commands to their troops, they lose. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter if all of their troops are still healthy\u2014all order\nand discipline is lost, the battle is over, and the\n```\n\n```\nElven\nBladedancers\n```\n\n```\n4 4 d8 1 This unit has advantage on defense rolls against melee attackers.

If there are walls or\nbarricades, draw them out as lines between spaces. If\nthere is a river, fill in squares as impassable or\ndifficult. All of these things should be drawn out on a\nbattle map, at a scale equal to the unit size of the\ntroops in the battle.\nAfter drawing the map, determine which army is\ndefending. In nearly every battle, there are the\npeople who are occupying a location, and there are\nthe people who want to take that location from\nthem^1. The first are the defenders, and the latter are\nthe attackers.\nFirst, the commander of the attacking army must\ndetermine in which direction they are attacking from.\nThis should be announced to the defending army, as\nunless otherwise stated, they would be able to see\ntheir attackers\nOnce the attacker has declared a direction of\nattack, if you are the defending army, you get to lay\nout your units, wherever and however you wish.\nMake sure to keep all troops within range of an\nofficer, and all officers within range of your\ncommander.\nAfter the defending army has done this, the\nattacking army may place their troops. Unless\nexplicitly allowed, each unit must be placed at least\n6 spaces away from the closest enemy troop, or\nfurther, and must be in a position that the GM deems\nreasonable, given their direction of approach. If the\ndefender would have been able to see the attacker\u2019s\napproach from further away, they may choose to\n\n```\nforce the attackers to place their troops at a more\ndistant range instead.\n```\n\nBattle\n\n```\nA battle takes course over rounds\u2014each\ncontaining a turn for the attackers, and then the\ndefenders.\nOn the attackers turn, each unit can be moved in\na straight line up a number of spaces equal to that\nunit\u2019s movement speed. The line must not intersect\nwith any other unit on the map\u2014even diagonally,\nand it must end in an open space. When determining\ndiagonal distances, count the first diagonal as one\nspace, the next diagonal as two spaces, and then one\nagain, and so on.\nAfter each unit has been moved, that player may\nmake attacks for each of their units. To make an\nattack with a unit, that unit must have an enemy unit\nwithin range. For melee units, that means it must be\nadjacent (this includes diagonals).\nWhen making the attack, the attacking and\ndefending units should each roll their power die. If\nthe defender rolled lower than the attacker, the\ndefender loses morale equal to the difference. If this\nwould result in the defender have zero or less\nmorale, then the unit is disbanded, and removed\nfrom battle.\n```\n\n```\nSpecial Units\nAt the most basic level, that is all there is to\ncombat. However, there are a few, common types of\nspecial units that have unique rules.\n```\n\n(^1) If you are certain that both sides are attackers (such as the unlikely scenario in which both sides are meeting in open ground with the sole purpose of\nkilling each other), then have the commander of each participating army making an operations (cunning) check. The loser must place their troops\nfirst. If there are more than two armies clashing, proceed in order from lowest to highest.\n\nRanged Units\n\nRanged units usually have a range greater than\none, allowing them to attack units more than one\nspace away. All units have disadvantage when\nmaking defense rolls against ranged units. When\nranged units make defense rolls, they automatically\nroll 1s.\n\nAerial Units\n\nAerial units are units that can fly. When they\nmove, they can move through other units, and they\ncan end their movement on top of another unit. In\naddition, they can only be attacked by ranged units\nand other aerial units.\n\nSiege Units\n\nSiege units are really just spaces that have\nequipment on them (such as siege engines, or\nmounted ballista). Rather than attacking, a unit may\nchoose to man a siege unit. While doing so, that unit\ntakes on all of the stats of the siege unit except for\nmorale, which is inherited from the unit that is\nmanning the siege unit.\nWhen siege units make defense rolls, they\nautomatically roll 1s.\n\nFortifications & Terrain\n\nBesides units, there may also be fortifications\nand terrain effects on the battlefield. A space can be\nmarked as a fortification. If so, it will have some\nnumber of hit points. So long as it has hit points\nremaining, all troops within the space gain a flat\nbonus to their defense rolls determined by the stats\nof that fortification. Additionally, melee attacks\ncannot be made from a fortified area to a non-\nfortified area, and vice-versa.\nFortifications can only be damaged by siege\nweapons. When a siege unit attacks, it can choose to\n\n```\ntarget a fortification, in which case all of its damage\ngoes directly to the fortification.\n```\n\n```\nPlayers on the Battlefield\nCan be officers, can be commanders, can be elite\nfighting force.\n```\n\n```\nDuring combat, a unit can move a number of\nsquares equal to its movement speed. It can only\nmove in a straight line, and that line cannot pass\nthrough any other units. It can then attack any unit.\nWhenever you attack with a unit, roll that unit\u2019s\npower die. The defending unit also rolls their power\ndie. The defender takes damage equal to the\ndifference.\nInfantry and other non-cavalry grounded, melee\nunits have disadvantage on defense rolls against non-\nadjacent (ranged) attackers.\nRanged defenders automatically roll the\nminimum on any defense roll.\nCannot move through another troop, and your\nown troops count as difficult terrain.\nPeople with better commander take their turn\nfirst.\nAerial units can only be attacked by ranged\nattackers and other aerial attackers. They can be on\nthe same square as another unit.\n```\n\n```\nTac t i cs\nPassive ability. You are commander.\nCan force a unit to come forward one space if\nyou retreat (taunting it, luring it in. This could cause\nit to leave the range of commander/officers).\n```\n\n```\nCommander\n```\n\nMust move first, then attack. No movement after.\nCan move extra space if you don\u2019t attack.\n\n```\nMisc terrain effects:\n```\n\n- High ground: advantage on attack and defense\n  rolls.

For example, Erasnus has a front of\n\n```\n\u201cRemove myorna from the trade alliance.\u201d Myorna\ncontains factions with conflicting fronts: \u201cRemain in\nthe alliance\u201d and \u201cRemove ourselves from the\nalliance and retreat underground\u201d.\nWithout player interaction, the greater front wins\nwhen appropriate.\nFronts don\u2019t have to be explicitly carried out\u2014\nthey just succeed.

You can increase it by .5% as many\ntimes thereafter for another surplus each. Army only\nexists after number of months equal to country size.\nCan hired in a single month for double the surplus.\n\nInternal Projects\n\nWhen you wish to improve your faction\ninternally, unopposed, it costs a single surplus to\nbegin work on a single project. Projects take a\nminimum number of months equal to the size of\nfaction. Projects are any big task that wouldn\u2019t\nhappen automatically for any faction of your size. It\ncan be difficult to judge what counts as a faction\nproject, but as a rough guideline, it should be at least\nas rare as something that only some factions of\nequivalent caliber have. For example, a harbor would\ncount as a project for a city state, since many city\nstates don\u2019t have harbors. However, you don\u2019t have\nto spend surplus on a harbor if your faction\nrepresents an entire country, since many countries\nhave many harbors.\n\nIf you want to deal with a front without having to\ninteract with it, GM may allow you to fight it by\nmaking your own, counter-front. Requires surplus\nequal to front value, plus your size rank. Counts as a\nproject, therefore costs an extra surplus. For\nexample, if they are pressuring your country to\ncollapse in revolution, with force 11 (their country\u2019s\nrank), if you are rank 9, you\u2019d have to spend 3\nsurplus fending that off. Even if you are higher rank\nthan them, still requires one surplus to apply your\nrank as a counter-front.\nIf you want to destroy a kingdom from internal\nrebellion, or some other way act directly hostile to\nanother country, you can\u2019t apply rank. That is a new\n\n```\nfront from your kingdom. Requires 1 surplus\u2014new\nfront. Expected to treat it like normal front that has\nto be chipped away at with player action.\n```\n\n```\nPersuade neighbors to allow passage of your\nships through their channel. They are 2 bigger, so\nrank 2 challenge. 1 surplus because it is a new\nproject from country.

First is its level.\nThis determines how powerful of an effect that\nmaterial can create. Second are its tags. Tags are\nused to describe the type of magical ability\nassociated with a material. For example, pixie dust\ncould be a magical component. The GM may then\ndecide that it is a level 4 component with the tags\n\u201cpsychic\u201d, \u201cair\u201d, and \u201cillusion\u201d. The GM may also\ndecide that they want silver to be a level 2 magical\nsubstance, and because they don't think it has any\nspecific magical properties, give it the \u201cneutral\u201d tag.\nThe GM should refer to the following sections to\ndetermine the power level and tags of a component.\nFor examples of magic items, and their level and\ntags, refer to Appendix C.\n\nPower Level\n\nThe power level table is used for determining the\nlevel of magical items as well as their components.\nWhen determining the power level of a component,\nthe GM should assign it a level corresponding to the\nhighest power level one could feasibly achieve if the\ncomponent was the most critical component to an\nitem\u2019s function. For example, let\u2019s assign the power\nlevel to a unicorn horn. As the GM, imagine that the\nmost powerful item we think the horn could\nreasonably be used as the center piece for was a\n\n```\n\u201cunicorn horn wand\u201d that could powerfully charm\nmultiple people at a time. With this vague idea in\nmind, we can assign it a power level of 4, since that\u2019s\nroughly the power level of that wand.\n```\n\n```\nTag s\nThe tags table is used for determining which tags\nbelong to a component. With the exception of the\n\u201cneutral\u201d tag, all tags have a specific flavor of magic.\nIf a component feels like it meets the description for\na tag, that tag belongs on the component. For any\nmaterial or component that feels like it might be used\n```\n\n```\nPower Level\nLe v e l Power Level Description\n1 Not powerful. More cosmetic, or flavorful\nthan anything else. +1 bonus to skill\nchecks..\n2 The power of a talent. Roughly 2.5 damage\nper round, or a +2 bonus to skill checks.\n3 The power of a talent with its destiny level.\nRoughly 5 damage per round, or a +3\nbonus to skill checks.\n4 A substantially powerful effect, such as a\nparagon level. Roughly 8 damage per\nround, or a +5 bonus to skill checks.\n5 An incredible effect, but not one that could\nbe described as legendary. Multiple\nparagon levels, for example. Roughly 20\ndamage per round.\n6 Wondrous effects, potentially able to\ninstantly kill commoners. Not necessarily\none-of-a-kind, but probably. Their locations\nare likely known throughout history\u2014they\nare viewed as legendary artifacts.\n7 Beyond legendary.\n```\n\nin a magic item, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have a\nspecific use, it should likely receive the \u201cneutral\u201d\ntag. For example, as the GM, if you want precious\nmetals and gems to be prevalent in all sorts of\nmagical items, they should have the \u201cneutral\u201d tag.\n\nCrafting the Item\n\n```\nBefore you can begin crafting the item, you must\nfirst determine if you are following a procedure or if\nyou are inventing. If you have a blueprint, plan, or\nrecipe, or have one memorized, then you are\nfollowing a procedure. If you\u2019ve never made\nsomething before and are hoping to create a desired\neffect, then you are inventing. Each involves\ndifferent steps.\n```\n\n```\nFollowing Procedure\nWhen following procedure, the GM will tell you\nthe level of the item you are crafting and the required\ncomponents. You must have each of the required\ncomponents, and you must have an aspect related to\ncrafting of rank equal to or greater than the level of\nthe item you are creating. Proceed to the Crafting\nCheck section.\n```\n\n```\nInventing\nWhen inventing, the details of what you are\ntrying to make need to be ironed out first. Describe\nto the GM what you want to make. Work with them\nto determine the exact details of what the magical\nitem does, how often it can be used, and any other\nproperties of the item. As the player, it is ultimately\nup to you to determine the stats of the item you wish\nto create. With the stats clearly defined, the GM\n```\n\n```\nTag s\nTag Description\nAerial Associated with the element of air\nAcidic Associated with acid and corrosion\nAqueous Associated with the element of water\nCold Associated with anything magically\ncold\nCorporeal Associated with the body\nDark Associated with the element of\ndarkness, rot, and decay\nEarthen Associated with the element of earth\nElectric Associated with lightning effects\nFiery Associated with the element of fire\nForceful Associated with the element of force\nIllusioned Associated with anything related to\nillusions and imagination\nInert Associated with anything that is\nresistant to change, magic, or anything\nelse\nLight Associated with the element of light,\nhealing, or radiant power\nMercurial Associated with anything related to\nexceptional movement or change\nPlanar Associated with the planes\nPoisonous Associated with anything poisonous,\nvenomous, or toxic\nPsychic Associated with effects of the mind,\nincluding telepathy, mind reading, and\nunderstanding\nSonic Associated with anything related to\nsound\nSoulful Associated with anything related to\ncreatures\u2019 souls\n```\n\n```\nTemporal Associated with the element of time\nVoid Associated with the element of void,\nand dimensions.\nNeutral Associated with nothing, but still\nmagically charged. Frequently metals\nand gems.\n```\n\n```\nTag Description\n```\n\nshould then determine the power level of the\ndescribed item using the _Power Level_ chart. This\nprocess should be collaborative between the player\nand GM.\nAfter determining the level, the GM should\ndecide what types of components the item requires.\nAn item recipe should require at least one\ncomponent with a tag relating to each unique effect\nof the item, and should require a total number of\ncomponents equal to the level of the item. If the total\nnumber of specific types of components don\u2019t sum to\nthe level of the item, the remaining components\nshould be neutral components. All components must\nbe of an equal or greater level than the crafted item\nitself.\n\nCrafting\n\nOnce you have determined the level and the tags\nof the magic item, you can attempt to craft it. For\neach tag on the magic item, you must have a\ncorresponding, distinct component of level equal or\ngreater than the level of the magic item you are\ntrying to craft. You must also have an aspect of rank\nequal to or greater than the level of the item you are\ncreating.\n\nCrafting Check\n\nYou have the necessary ingredients, it is now\ntime to actually make the item. Successfully crafting\nan item requires X successful crafting skill checks,\n\n```\nwhere X is the level of the item you are trying to\ncraft. Crafting must also be done in a crafting\nworkshop, of level equal to or greater than the level\nof the item being crafted. After every X days you\nspend working in the workshop, make the crafting\nskill check. The CN is equal to 8 + 2 * X.\nOn a failed skill check, progress for that period\nof work does not count\u2014you must work another X\ndays to make another check. On three consecutive\nfailed skill checks, the item is ruined, all progress is\nlost, and a random component is wasted in the\nprocess.\nHowever, once you have a number of successful\ncrafting checks equal to the level of the item, you\nhave finished.\n```\n\n```\nFollowing Procedure\nIf you were following a procedure, it is much\neasier to make craft an item without making\nmistakes. You have a +8 on your crafting skill\nchecks.\n```\n\n```\nInventing\nIf you were inventing, make one final crafting\nskill check upon completing an item, representing\nyour skill as an inventor. On a success, you have\ncrafted the item with the desired effects. If you fail,\nyou have still successfully crafted a magical item,\nbut it does not have the exact intended behavior. It is\nentirely up to the GM what the properties are of the\nmagic item you have created.\n```\n\n```\nRefining Components\nSometimes the components you have are not\nhigh enough level to make what you want. If this is\nthe case, you may wish to use alchemy to refine a\ncomponent into a shard. A shard is a purer form of a\nmagical material, distilled to its magical essence.\n```\n\n```\nExample\nLet\u2019s say you want to craft a fiery great sword.\nYou describe it as giving a creature one level of\nburning whenever you deal damage to it with the\nsword. The GM would determine that this is of\nroughly level 3, and would have the tag \u201cfire\u201d but\nnothing else. It would therefore require one level 3\nfire component, and two level 3 neutral components.\n```\n\nTo craft shard you must have two, non-shard\nmaterials of the same level and with the same tags,\nand you must have access to an alchemy lab of level\nequal to or greater than the level of the components\nfor the duration of the refinement. You may then\nspend a number of days refining equal to the level of\nthe components. After those days, both components\nare destroyed and you gain a shard\u2014a magical\ncomponent with the same tags as its ingredients, and\nof one higher level. Components with only a neutral\ntag cannot be refined into shards, and shards cannot\nbe refined into more shards.\n\nCrafting\n\nWor kshop\n\n```\nIn order to craft magical items, it is necessary to\nhave at least some type of workshop dedicated to the\ntask. A workshop contains all the necessary tools,\nreference materials, and specialized workstations\nnecessary for magical crafting. Every workstation\nhas a level. Higher level workstations are larger and\nmore expensive, but can make it easier to craft\nmagical items.\nThe following table contains the requirements for\neach level of workshop.

As rare as they are valuable, arcane\ntuning forks are never for sale.\n\n```\nn/a\n```\n\nItem Description Cost\n\nAnimal Products\n\nIn most cases of magical crafting, the\ncomponents will come from animals. Below are the\nmost commonly used animal parts used in magical\ncrafting.\nIn order to harvest items from a creature, you\nwill likely have to make a harvest check with a CN\nset by the GM. The difficulty of this will vary by\nproduct and creature.\n\nLe a t h e r\n\nHides can be used for armors and some crafting.\nNearly all hides can be fashioned into light or\nmedium armors, though some will also work as\nheavy armor.\n\nFeathers\n\nFeathers provide very little protection, but\nmagically aided abilities in flight are sometimes held\nwithin a creature\u2019s feathers.\n\nScale s\n\nScales are much harder to harvest than leather,\nbut can be used in both armors as well as some\ncrafting.\n\nFangs, Spines & Horns\n\nFangs, spines, and horns can usually be crafted\ninto piercing melee weapons. In the case of\nparticularly straight edges, they can also be used as\narrowheads.\n\nClaws & Talons\n\nClaws and talons can be crafted into slashing\nweapons. Usually the weapons cannot be heavy, as\nthe slashing area is relatively small.\n\n```\nBones\nBones are versatile. They can be shaped into\nweapons or trinkets, or they can be ground up and\nused as powders in alchemy. Usually bones do not\npossess much magical capacity, though if there is\nany, it is usually concentrated in the creature\u2019s skull.\n```\n\n```\nBlood\nBlood can be used in crafting potions, or it can\nbe dried and used as a powder or paste applied\nduring crafting. In the case of magical creatures, the\npotion may grant the drinker some of the properties\nof the creature during its life.\n```\n\n```\nHeart\nLike blood, the heart may be used in potion\ncrafting. In some cases, the heart can also be used for\ncrafting by harvesting the heart-strings. The heart is\ngenerally more potent than the blood. Sometimes,\nthe heart might have some magical effects even if the\nblood does not.\n```\n\n```\nBrain\nIn creatures with powerful mind effects, the brain\ncan sometimes be used in potion crafting to capture\nsome of the creature\u2019s magical ability.\n```\n\n```\nVocal C hords\nIn creatures with magically superior voices,\nvocal chords can be harvested to capture some of the\ncreature\u2019s magical ability.\n```\n\n```\nEyes\nIn creatures with magically superior sense of\nsight, the eyes can usually be harvested to capture\nsome of the creature\u2019s magical ability. They can\neither be ground up for alchemy, or petrified in use\nwith crafting.\n```\n\nVenoms, Poisons & Toxins\n\nVenoms, poisons, and toxins can be turned into\npoisons and contact poisons. Some can also be\nturned into poisonous gasses. Most creatures can\nproduce one dose of poison per day while alive, and\ncan have 3 doses harvested off of them on death.\n\nInk\n\nSome creatures produce ink, such as octopus.\nbesides more mundane uses, such as for writing or\nart, the ink may have magical properties that can be\nused in alchemy or crafting.\n\nTe ar s\n\nTears are some of the most difficult and taboo\nalchemical components to procure, as they require\n\n```\nthe creature to be alive and crying when they are\nharvested. However, some of the most powerful\nmagic is occasionally held within a creature\u2019s tears.\n```\n\n```\nHooves\nThe hooves of a creature with magical movement\nspeed may contain some magical power.\n```\n\n```\nhigh level smithing requires a \u201cgod forge\u201d,\nsomething-crucible\nAlchemy: Something-crucible.\n```\n\nAll possible properties, as well as a brief\ndescription of each can be found below:\n\nThe first is that all crafting has a difficulty. The\ndifficulty is a CN which determines how challenging\nthat item is to make.\nThe second is a duration. Different items take\ndifferent amounts of time to craft.\nLastly is a material cost. Material is measured in\nweight, and is used up when you craft items.\n\nThe first thing to know is that the magic of\nmagical crafting comes from the components of the\nobjects made. Unlike Deoric or Kethic, making\nmagical items does not require any magical\ncapability of the crafter\u2014it uses the magic entirely\nfrom its materials.\n\nSmithing\n\n```\nSmithing is the general descriptor for any sort of\nforging, smithing, or crafting of weapons, shields, or\narmor. For example, a bone mask that provides a\nbonus to defense, an arrow made of a basilisk spine,\nand a shield of astral steel are all examples of\nsmithing.\nIf you want to make something that falls under\nthe category of smithing, then there are three\nimportant values to know\u2014the\nUse the following table to calculate the smithing\ndifficulty, time to craft, and material mass required.\nTo determine the difficulty, take the difficulty and\nadd any modifiers for the item type that applies. For\nexample, a heavy, bludgeoning, stone club would be\ncalculated as follows:\n7 (base CN for adapting) + 1 (material cost) + 2\n(heavy weight) + 0 (bludgeoning) + 0 (melee) = 10.\n```\n\n```\nDifficulty Duration Materials\nBase Value Crafting method base\nCN 4 days 5 lbs\nWeight Weapons\n```\n\nUltralight +0 x0.25 x0.5\n\nLight +1 x1 x1\n\nHeavy +2 x1.5 x2\n\n```\nDamage Type WEapons\n```\n\nBludgeoning +0 x0.25 x1.25\n\nPiercing +1 x0.5 x0.75\n\nSlashing +2 x1 x1\n\n```\nRange Weapons\n```\n\nMelee +0 x1 x1\n\nRanged +1 x0.75 x0.5\n\n```\nWeight Armor\n```\n\nLight +0 x1 x1\n\nMedium +1 x1 x4\n\nHeavy +3 x4 x10\n\n```\nWeight Shield\n```\n\nLight +0 x0.25 x1\n\nHeavy +1 x0.5 x2\n\nAlchemy\n\nAlchemy is the process of transforming raw\ningredients into magical substances. Brewing\npotions, refining magical components, and\nconcocting arcane substances are all examples of\nalchemy. For example, making poisons, explosives,\nand invisibility paint are all examples of alchemy.\nAlchemy differs from artificing in that the\nalchemical products are used up rather than sticking\naround forever.\nDespite this difference, the rules of alchemy are\nnearly identical to those of magical crafting. The\nlevel of your final product is estimated, tags are\ndetermined, and components with corresponding\nlevel and tags are used to produce a final product.\nDifferences are laid out below.\n\nInventing\n\nWhenever you produce something new via\nalchemy, you must determine how much of the\nproduct you intend to create. By default, you\nproduce 10 uses of that item. For example, if you are\nmaking a poison, you have 10 doses of that poison.\nIf you are producing flash bangs, you make 10 flash\nbangs. In cases with more vague units of\nmeasurements (such as invisibility paint) it is up to\nyou as the player, though it must be approved by the\nGM.\n\nAlchemy Laboratory\n\nIn order to perform alchemy, you must have the\ntools, space, and knowledge to do so. All of those\nthings are centered in your laboratory\u2014necessary for\nany alchemical experiment.\nWhile working in an alchemy lab, you get a\nbonus to all alchemy checks equal to the level of the\nlab.\n\n```\nLe v e l 1\nAt level 1, you need basic alchemy tools, and 2\nor more alchemy books.\n```\n\n```\nLe v e l 2\nAt level 2, you need basic alchemy tools, and 5\nor more alchemy books.\n```\n\n```\nLe v e l 3\nAt level 3, you need advanced alchemy tools,\nand 10 or more alchemy books.\n```\n\n```\nLe v e l 4\nAt level 4, you need advanced alchemy tools,\nand 20 or more alchemy books.\n```\n\n```\nLe v e l 5\nAt level 5, you need expert alchemy tools, and 40\nor more alchemy books.\n```\n\n```\nCrafting\nIn order to craft an alchemical brew, you must\nspend time and resources to prepare the substance. In\naddition, you must have access to the recipe, either\nfrom a book, or memorized, and you must be in an\nalchemy lab of a level equal or greater than the\nrecipe you are crafting.\nWhen you wish to craft something, it takes a\nnumber of days equal to the recipe\u2019s level. Only two\nhours each day must be spent actively working on\nthe recipe, since the rest of the time is spent waiting\nfor chemical reactions to occur. If you do not have\nthe recipe memorized, you must have access to a\nwritten form of the recipe each day.\nWhen you start the crafting process, remove all\nthe required remarkable materials from your\ninventory. Those materials are used up in the\nalchemy process. Any gold cost in addition to the\nunique materials is spent at a rate of 10 * X ducat at\n```\n\nthe start of each day, where X is the level of the\nalchemical product.\nAfter each day of crafting, make an alchemy skill\ncheck against 8 + 2 \\* X, where X is the level of the\nrecipe. On a success, you make another day of\nprogress towards finishing the product, potentially\nfinishing the product immediately. On a failure, all\nprogress is lost, and you ruin the product.\n\nRecipes\n\nIn order to craft an alchemical solution, you must\nknow the recipe, or be able to follow a recipe from a\nbook. Memorizing a recipe takes a number of\nsuccessful daily memorization checks equal to the\nrecipe\u2019s level. The CN for the memorization check is\nequal to 8 + 2 \\* X, where X is the recipe\u2019s level.\n\nInventing Alchemy\n\nAs you progress as an alchemist, you may gain\nthe ability to invent alchemical products. If you do,\nyou may work with your GM to define the\nproperties, costs, remarkable materials, and levels of\nany alchemical product. As a player, your\nresponsibility is to define the properties of a\nhypothetical alchemical product. As the GM, their\nresponsibility is to determine if such a product could\neven exist, and if so, to assign it its costs, material\nrequirements, and level.\n\nAssigning Materials and Level\n\nTo determine the level and materials required for\nan alchemical product, its level should be equal to\nthe number of special materials in the product or the\nmaximum level of the materials used in the product,\nwhichever is higher.\n\nLe v e l 1\n\n```\nLevel 1 Magical Substance Preparation\nMost magical resources harvested require some\nsort of alchemical processing to occur before they\ncan be incorporated in whatever they are being used\nin. At level 1, you can process level 1 magical\nsubstances in preparation for use. This preparation\ncosts 1/3 of the end substances value.\n```\n\nLe v e l 2\n\n```\nLevel 2 Magical Substance Preparation\nMost magical resources harvested require some\nsort of alchemical processing to occur before they\ncan be incorporated in whatever they are being used\nin.

There aren\u2019t tons of tables, and the\nmath isn\u2019t too bad, but this is far from \u201crules-lite\u201d.\n\n- ** It\u2019s grittier and more simulationist **. Healing\n  is slow, and fighting is dangerous. You probably\n  won't die, but it\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re going to.\n- ** Each round of combat is unique**. The core\n  mechanics of combat discourage being predictable.\n  This is a cornerstone of the Heart Rush rules.\n  **- Fast, tactical combat. Seriously**. You\u2019ve got\n  lots of important decisions to make each round,\n  and it doesn\u2019t slow down the game since\n  everyone\u2019s making decisions in parallel.\n  **- Highly cooperative **. Each class is designed to\n  be played with the other classes, and will be best at\n  allowing the other classes to shine. Everyone feels\n  special.\n- ** You\u2019ll feel heroic eventually, but not for a\n  while**. And when you do, it\u2019s mainly because\n  you\u2019ve done really difficult things, not because\n  you have heroic abilities.\n  **- Constant leveling**. You don't have to wait for\n  the level up\u2014spend XP on a variety of stuff at\n  different costs to improve your character.\n  **- Wild character design.** A barbarian wizard,\n  ninja detective, or fire-bender assassin are all\n  totally viable builds.\n  **- Extremely flexible trait system**. Plain English\n  descriptions of your character result in mechanical\n  bonuses and concrete hooks that drive the story\n  forward.\n  **- Hyper-flexible elemental magic**. For example,\n  you can be an air-bender and do all the things you\n  should be able to do as an air-bender. And it's not\n  tied to any class, so you can tack that onto\n  whatever type of build you want.\n  **- Fail-forward mechanics**. The story won\u2019t\n  always grind to a halt on failures.\n\n```\nOrigin of the Name\nWhen initial rounds of feedback on the\nrules came in, people derided the game as a\n\u201cheartbreaker\u201d\u2014a term in the TTRPG design\ncommunity given to games into which their\nauthors pour their hearts, only to have fail since\nthe games don\u2019t differentiate themselves\nenough from D&D. And it was fair\u2014these\nrules originally stemmed from my frustrations\nwith D&D; I had wanted to make a game that\nwas essentially D&D, but just better at doing it\nthan D&D itself. Of course, that\u2019s not possible,\nand I was rightly made fun of.\nHowever, Heart Rush has come a long way\nsince then. It still has some overlapping design\ngoals, but there are major differences. It relies\nmore on skillful GMs. It\u2019s much grittier. And\nit\u2019s got more tactical combat that is frequently\nextremely tense, and can feel very terrifying.\nIt\u2019s a rush.\nAnd thus, the name was born. Yes, this\ngame was, and to some degree always will be,\na little bit of a heartbreaker. But also, no game\ngets my heart pumping in the same way. And\nthus: Heart Rush.\n```\n\nI\u2019m a GM...\n\nWhy Should I Run This?\n\nHeart Rush is probably not going to feel that\ndifferent to run compared to most crunchy fantasy\nTTRPGs. However, it does try to balance the crunch\nwith more narrative-forward elements. The two I\nwant to highlight are the aspect system, and the skill\ncheck complications.\nWith aspects, players will describe their character\nin plain English. The mechanics will incentivize\nthem to have both positive and negative descriptions,\nand then to actually RP them out in play. As the GM,\nyou don\u2019t have to keep track of your players and\ntheir flaws and reward them when they\u2019re good;\nthey\u2019ll let you know exactly when, and they will go\nout of their way to complicate the story in a way\n\n```\nappropriate to their character, because doing so is the\nonly way they can use the positive sides of their\naspects. The system is self balancing, and places the\nvast majority of the work on the players themselves.\nThe end result is players helping you tell a more\ninteresting story.\nComplications are a mechanic that come in to\nplay when players are making skill checks. When\nthey roll, they sometimes have the chance to replace\na bad roll with a better roll that has negative,\nunrelated side effects. Those negative, unrelated side\neffects are up to you to decide, but in my experience\nthey\u2019re quite easy to come up with. When the players\nhave voluntarily chosen to take a complication, it\u2019s a\ngolden ticket for you to make the situation worse in\nthe most narratively satisfying way, without players\nfeeling like it\u2019s unfair.\n```\n\n```\nHeart Rush Combat\nHeart Rush is a highly specialized combat machine. Sure, it\u2019s got enough framework to handle all of\nthe noncombatant stuff, but when combat begins is when its engine purrs to life and you see Heart Rush\ntake off.\nThis was intentional\u2014both the specialization, and lack of great depth out of combat. From my\nexperience, most fun that happens outside of combat isn\u2019t due to great mechanics, but due to how the\nstory unfolds, and the interactions with NPCs. These things are very dependent on who the GM is and\nhow they want to run it, and I didn\u2019t want to get in the way of that. Talk more, roll less is a motto I stand\nbehind. However, when it comes to combat, having that framework matters. Combat has high stakes,\nevery maneuver makes a difference, and everyone has different but potentially equally high impact on it,\nsecond by second. I don\u2019t think that argument can be made for the other pillars of a fantasy adventure. For\nthis reason, combat rules got special privileges. I didn\u2019t want them to merely facilitate the fiction\u2014I\nwanted them to be thrilling, cooperative, and exciting. So that\u2019s what I did.\nWhile designing the rules, I had to make sure they passed the blank-room combat test. This is a test\nwhere you run combat in which none of the combatants have abilities, and there\u2019s no terrain. In many\ngames, this can be a disaster\u2014those are core features. However, I believe they\u2019re both crutches. First,\nrelying on fun abilities scratches only one kind of itch, and it\u2019s something that any game can employ.\nSecond, using terrain places the onus on the GM to make the combat fun, rather than the rules themselves.\nIf the combat is still fun without either of those things, it means that those rules are solid. That\u2019s what\nmakes Heart Rush special.\n```\n\nI\u2019m a Player...\n\nWhy Should I Play?\n\nThis game is for people who like combat and\nmechanics and getting into the weeds of character\ndesign and optimization. Heart Rush has other stuff\ngoing on too, but if you actively _don\u2019t_ like those\nthings, you\u2019ll be missing out on a lot of what Heart\nRush has to offer. As a quick list, you will like Heart\nRush if...\n\n- You like making a smart tactical play, but hate\n  having to wait five minutes every round to do so.\n- You like spending hours theory crafting strange\n  character concepts that actually work.\n- You like coordinating with your allies and\n  dunking on enemies through the power of synergy.\n- You like roleplaying flaws in your character,\n  but want to get mechanically rewarded for it in\n  gameplay.\n- You want to mix and match fantasy character\n  tropes to make your own, creative archetypes.\n- You like grittier settings with crunch.\n  Heart Rush isn\u2019t the perfect solution for every\n  desire in a TTRPG. But it\u2019s a damn good one for\n  some of them.\n\n```\nTe a m F ig h t He ro G a me s\nA core inspiration for Heart Rush came\nfrom team fighting video games. In these\ngames, each team has a squad of players with\ntheir own specializations, and then the teams\nwould duke it out and eventually one prevails.\nOne of things that stood out to me about\nthese games was how important it was for a\nsolid team composition. If the team was\nmissing someone of a certain role, the entire\nteam fell apart. Players weren\u2019t prioritizing\nmaximizing their damage, they were\nprioritizing their ability to perform their\nspecific role. That was very appealing to me\u2014\npeople like feeling like they\u2019re the best, and\neveryone can be the best when they\u2019re all\ntrying to be the best at something different.\nAlthough many tactical TTRPGs have\nsome concept of different roles and combat\nspecialization, I\u2019ve felt they were somewhat\nweak, and more thematic than functional. I\nwanted to change that. In Heart Rush, there are\nonly three core classes\u2014tanks, damage, and\nsupport. You can layer a bunch of flavor and\nadditional mechanics on top of them, but those\nclasses form a foundation for your character.\nThis framework let me build a system where\neach class is vastly benefited by having the\nother classes present, and will vastly benefit\nthem in turn. Everyone feels extremely\nvaluable, even if they haven\u2019t min-maxed to the\nsame degree as another player.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

As you gain fame or infamy,\nyour influence will increase, opening doors that were\npreviously closed to you.\nWhen you first create your character, unless\notherwise noted, you start at zero levels of influence.\nYou can consult the following table to see the\napproximate levels of influence of other people in\nsociety.\n\n```\nTr a de\nSee the Traders & Merchants rules section for\ndetails. However, in summary, higher influence\nallows you to find buyers and sellers who are willing\nto buy or sell more product.\n```\n\n```\nSocial Encou n ters\nWhenever you are interacting with someone who\nhas influence greater or less than you, the imbalance\nof power can have powerful affect on the\neffectiveness of your communication. At the GM\u2019s\ndiscretion, they may add levels of advantage or\ndisadvantage to rolls to intimidate, persuade, or\ndeceive to either member of a social interaction\u2014\nusually equal to half the difference in levels of\ninfluence, rounded down.\nFor example, if a king, of influence 6 is trying to\npersuade one of his subjects of influence 2, the king\nwould reasonably be granted 2 levels of advantage\non the roll. Likewise, if a peasant of influence 1 was\ntrying to intimidate a nobleman of influence 4, they\nwould have a level of disadvantage.\n```\n\n```\nInfluence Ranking\nLe v e l Examples\n1 Unlikely to be known by anyone outside\ntheir community. Ex: Local smith, stable\nboy, farmer\n2 Likely known by a dozen or more people\noutside their local community. Ex: Sherif,\ntrader, minor gang leader\n3 Well known by dozens of people outside\ntheir local community. Ex: Wealthy\nmerchant, local representative, expert\ncraftsman\n4 Known by many people inside and outside\ntheir immediate community who haven\u2019t\nmet them but recognize the name. Ex:\nLeader of a moderately sized settlement,\nimportant sage, crime boss\n5 Their name is known by at least some\npeople across the entire region; they wield\ngreat power. Ex: Minor to middling nobility,\nmilitary general, minor regional hero\n6 Their name is known everywhere within the\nregion and even beyond; they wield stately\npower. Ex: state leaders, minor dragons,\nregional heroes, minor daemons\n```\n\n```\n7 There name is well known by nearly\neveryone across multiple countries in a\nregion. Ex: very powerful state leaders,\ndragons, legendary heroes, major daemons\n8 Their name is widely known by most people\nacross multiple continents. These figures are\nliving myths, and exist in single digit\nquantities across the world. Ex: the most\npowerful daemons, figures from widely\nshared mythology\n```\n\n```\nLe v e l Examples\n```\n\nAt t e n dan ts\n\nAs you gain influence, you may gain attendants\nas well. Attendants are close servants who personally\nserve you. You may get to know your attendants, but\nthey will not fight for you\u2014they stick around to\nserve your mundane needs in exchange for a share of\nyour prestige. They travel with you wherever you go,\nhave no cost, and if they die, a new one can usually\nbe found to take their place.\nDifferent types of attendants exist that serve\ndifferent kinds of purposes. Each attendant, with the\nexception of the generic type, will only do things\nrelated to their title. For example, a footpad could\nnot make checks to heal you, and an interpreter\ncould not make checks to find clues at a crime scene.\nHowever, occasionally, your attendants\u2019 skills or\nsafety may be challenged. In these cases, you make\nall rolls for your attendants. Treat all of your\nattendants\u2019 abilities as d6s. They have a 40 maximum\nhit points and a d8 heart die, but will always retreat\nor surrender in a fight. When making skill checks,\nyou may add your influence to their roll.\nAlthough you can hire more attendants to cover\nmore of your needs, additional attendants will\nrequire personal investment of game-time and/or\ncurrency, while the ones granted from your influence\ncome for free.\nWhen you reach level 4 influence, you gain one\nattendant. At each level beyond 4, you gain an\nadditional attendant, and may switch out any number\nof your attendants. You may gain attendants at any\nsettlement that is not hostile to you.\n\nCook\n\nA personal cook prepares your meals for you.\nThey know what foods are edible and which ones\naren\u2019t, and they can prepare a hearty meal to keep\nyou healthy.\n\n```\nWhile you have a cook, you cannot be poisoned\nfrom foraged food. Additionally, so long as your\ncook has a properly stocked kitchen, eating their\nbreakfast increases your hit points by 2X (but not\ngreater than your hit point capacity), where X is your\ninfluence. Your cook can prepare food for up to 6\npeople, who all gain these benefits.\nMultiple cooks do not cause stacking effects.\n```\n\n```\nDisciple\nA disciple is a student of your form of combat.\nThey seek to learn to fight the way you do, and will\nfollow you into combat unless told otherwise.\nWhile you have a disciple, they will participate\nin any fights you get into unless forbidden or\notherwise unable. They remain by your side\nwhenever possible, though are controlled by you.\nRather than roll combat for them, it is assumed they\nhelp you. You may add half of your influence to your\nA/D rolls.\n```\n\n```\nFootpad\nA footpad is your trusted, undercover servant,\ncapable of minor scouting missions and petty theft.\nWhile you have a footpad, you can have them\nscout out a settlement for a number of interesting and\nvaluable people, objects, and locations equal to your\ninfluence.\nAdditionally, you may task your footpad with\nshadowing a person. They make a stealth check\ncontested by the cunning challenge number of the\ntarget. On a success, you can receive daily updates\non the target\u2019s activities and location.\n```\n\n```\nHealer\nA healer may act as your assistant in your own\nhealing, or may personally attend to you when you\nget back from a fight.\nWhile you have a healer, they automatically\nsucceed on any checks to treat wounds less than or\n```\n\nequal to your influence, and automatically succeed\non checks to perform first aid on creatures with a\nmaximum wound level equal to or less than your\ninfluence.\n\nInterpreter\n\nAn interpreter understands, can speak, read, and\nwrite many languages. They will act as a personal\ntranslator for yourself and your company.\nWhen you gain an interpreter, they can\ncommunicate in all mediums in a number of\nlanguages equal to your influence. Whenever you\ngain influence, you can add a language. Your\ninterpreter can interpret for you and your party and\nanyone you wish to speak to.\nIf you wish to switch languages known by your\ninterpreter, you will need a new interpreter.\nInterpreters can not interpret magical languages.\n\nPorter\n\nA porter carries your gear for you, so you don\u2019t\nhave to.\nA porter can carry a number of slots equal to 30\ntimes your influence level.\n\nSage\n\nA sage is an expert in a field, and acts as your\npersonal, small walking library of knowledge on a\nsubject.\nWhen you gain a sage, choose a subject. Rather\nthan make your own knowledge checks on that\nsubject, you may query your sage. They make the\nsame check, but add your full influence level rather\nthan half to the roll. They have advantage on the roll.\n\nApprentice\n\nApprentices are your personal mentees. They\nseek your guidance and tutelage in a particular field\nthat you have become experienced in.\n\n```\nWhen you gain an apprentice, choose a field of\nwork, such as alchemy, smithing, or Deoric casting.\nIt can be nearly any profession, though your GM has\nfinal say.\nWhile you have your apprentice, you have\nadvantage on all skill checks made on tasks related\nto your profession.\nYou can only have one apprentice at a time.\n```\n\n```\nSmith\nA personal smith will keep you and your party\u2019s\nweapons and armor in pristine condition, and can\nmake minor adjustments and tools out of metal.\nWhile you have a smith, you and your party have\n+ 1 to all A/D rolls, so long as you have allowed your\nsmit to tune up the weapons within the last month.\nMultiple smiths do not cause stacking effects.\n```\n\n```\nStable Hand\nA stable hand takes care of your animals. They\nmake sure they are well fed, taken care of, and in\ngood condition.\nWhile you have a stable hand, you can travel\n20% further each day while riding on an animal\ncared for by your stablehand.\nA stable hand can take care of up to 6 large\ncreatures, or 2 L2 creatures. For creatures larger than\nL2, it requires a number of stable hands equal to the\nsize of the creature (L3 requires 3, L4 requires 4,\netc).\n```\n\n```\nBody Guard\nBody guards act as the last line of defense\nbetween you and those who seek to have you dead.\nThey remain with you at nearly all times, and will\nsacrifice themselves to keep you alive.\nBody guards will not fight for you, and they\nnever partake in typical combat. However, if you\nwould take potentially lethal damage while outside a\ntypical combat (such as a falling rock, a sneak attack,\n```\n\nor a midnight assassination), they may be able to\nsave you. Whenever such an event might occur, they\ntake damage up to 10 times your influence level\nbefore they die and any leftover damage is dealt to\nyou. This might take the form of them tackling you\nout of the way of a large source of damage, or using\ntheir life as the necessary distraction to prevent a\npotential killer.\nMultiple body guards do not cause stacking\neffects. If you want additional safeguards, you will\nneed to find them through other means.\n\n```\nGaining Influence\nInfluence is hard to gain, though not impossible.\nUltimately, it is up to the GM to determine when a\nplayer should gain influence, but they should consult\nthe following table as guideline. In each table, the\nright two column are ways that a player could gain\ninfluence, while on the left column it shows the\nminimum influence level of a player who\u2019s met any\nof the criteria in the row.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Other Rules\n\nLe a r n i n g a La n g u a g e\n\nWith structured, high quality lessons, learning a\nnew language will take from six months to a couple\nyears, depending on the complexity of the language.\nWhen you wish to learn a new language, the GM\nwill select a difficulty for that language. That is the\nnumber of successes you need on monthly cunning\nchecks to become fluent in that language (generally\n6\u201330). It takes half that number of successes to have\na passable proficiency, and a quarter of that number\nto understand the most basic words and phrases. The\ndifficulty of those cunning checks depends on the\ncircumstances under which you are learning the\nlanguage. Use the following table to calculate the\ndifficulty.\n\n```\nOther Long Term Tasks\nWhenever you wish to take on a multi-day task,\nespecially if it will take months or even years, you\ncan use the following framework to determine\nprogress. Examples of this would include crafting\ncustom armor, recruiting an army, converting people\nto a religion, and building a boat.\nThe framework is as follows. The GM should\nfirst determine the timeframe of checks. This could\nbe days, weeks, or months. Then, they should\ndetermine the absolute minimum amount of these\ntime-blocks that would be necessary to complete the\ntask, given the best possible circumstances. Lastly,\nthey should set a CN based off of your specific\ncircumstances. You may roll against this CN once as\neach block of time passes by, so long as you spend\nthat time working towards your long term goal.\n```\n\nQuick Combat\n\nExtensive rules for full combat are laid out in the\nnext chapter. However, there are times when it is\nclear that you will defeat your opponents easily, and\nusing the full rules for combat can be more trouble\nthan it\u2019s worth. If this is the case, you may want to\nuse these quick-combat rules.\nThe party should place the outcomes in the\nfollowing list in order of priority, with the most\n\n```\nimportant outcome at the top of their list. Then, a\nplayer must roll a might, agility, or cunning skill\ncheck four times, contested by a CN set by the GM\nrepresenting the difficulty of the encounter. For each\nfailure, the failure outcome on the lowest priority\nitem occurs, and then that item gets crossed off the\nlist. If the number rolled is less than half of the CN,\nthen the epic failure results occur instead. If the\n```\n\n```\nLa n g u a g e Le a r n i n g C h a l l e n g e\nCN Circumstances\n```\n\n```\n6 <7 y/o, phenomenal teacher, or complete immersion\n```\n\n```\n9 Daily lessons from a fluent speaker\n12 Half-immersion\n15 Self-taught, no interaction with fluent speakers\n```\n\nnumber is greater than the CN, then the desired\noutcome occurs.\n\n- We suffer no injury - Failure: Everyone takes d2, rank 10\n  wounds.\n- Epic failure: Everyone takes d4, rank 10\n  wounds.\n- None of our opponents escape\n  - Failure: A few escape\n  - Epic failure: All opponents escape\n- We get what we want\n  - Failure: We get some of what we want,\n  - Epic failure: We get nothing\n- Nothing else goes wrong\n  - Failure: Minor complication\n  - Epic failure: Major complication\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Although most grow up in minotaur-\ndominated communities, they have spread out across\nAlaria, and can be found in great numbers in many\nlarge armies.\n\nVitals\n\n- Size: Medium\n- Height: 6-7.5 feet\n- Weight: 200-350 pounds\n\nMinotaur Horns\n_Passive ability._\n\nThe horns on your head count as a heavy\npiercing melee weapon so long as you move at least\n15 feet in a straight-line towards an enemy before\nimmediately attacking. You get one level of\nadvantage on your attacks made with your horns for\nevery 15 feet you charged before you attack. This\nstacks up three times.\n\nDanaki\n\nDanaki are infamous for their toughness and their\nterrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as\nthe baby minotaur children are raised by the village.\nMost do not know who their parents are, nor are they\ninterested in finding out. From a young age, they are\ntaught to fight and kill, usually long before they\nlearn how to read and write.\nDanaki are also known for their rage\u2014a berserk\nstate of anger and pure, single-minded aggression.\nDuring a rage, they can behave unpredictably and\nincredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring\nmany injuries.\n\n```\nDanaki are trained from a young age to express\nvery little emotion, and suppress it if possible.\nAffection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as\nsigns of weakness, and most claim that they have not\nfelt those things since they were a child. Marriages\nin Danaki villages are arranged by the village\ncouncil once each member in the union has been\ndeemed \u201cstable\u201d. Most Danaki view their marriage\nas a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing\nthat you have completed your growth. The marriages\nare generally for convenience and pleasure, as many\naspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.\nAlthough the Danaki inevitably grow attached to\none another, they admit it only in confidence, and\nbelieve themselves capable of making decisions\ncompletely unaffected by that attachment.\n```\n\n```\nAspects\n```\n\n- Show no weakness\n- Obstinately bullheaded\n\n```\nBerserk\nMajor ability. Instant.\nIt is said that the Danaki rage is the physical\nrelease of all the pent up emotions held within them.\nWhether this is true is up to you.\nWhenever you take damage, you may enter a\nberserk state. While berserk, your movement speed\nincreases by 20, and increase every instance of\nincoming and outgoing physical damage by 2. You\nremain berserk so long as you make an A/D roll or\nenter an engagement each round, up to a minute.\n```\n\n```\nLorean Minotaur\nWhile Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary\ncrew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the\ncommanding general for a king\u2019s army. In describing\nthe difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most\nfamously quoted that \u201cLorean think with their head,\n```\n\nnot with their horns\u201d. Of course, if you ask their\nspouses, they will say that they \u201cthink with their\nhead, not with their hearts\u201d. This is the cursed\nblessing of Lorean\u2014incredibly tactically minded,\nbut seemingly incapable of thinking about problems\nin any other way.\nLorean culture places a heavy emphasis on\neducation and sound decision making. To make a\nmistake because emotions clouded one\u2019s judgement\nis worthy of profound shame. It\u2019s not that Lorean\ndon't experience emotions\u2014they do\u2014but to let them\ninfluence one\u2019s decision at all is weakness and\nfailure, especially when other people\u2019s wellbeing is\nat stake.\nThis sense of duty towards protection lies as\ndeeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards\nemotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been\nplaced in charge of his troop will die before letting\nhis troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the\nultimate failure as a minotaur\u2014worthy of self-exile.\nAlthough Lorean would never hold anyone else to\nsuch high standards, including other minotaur, every\nLorean would never give such leniency to\nthemselves.\n\nAspects\n\n- Profoundly caring\n- Emotions get in the way of logical thinking\n\nTac t i c a l S u p r e m ac y\n_Passive ability._\nYou may take an additional help action each\nround.

You may return to it, or any\n  other unoccupied corpse.\n\nDeva\n\nDeva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very\ncommanding presences that enter the world fully\ngrown, intelligent, with no family, and a single,\ndriving purpose. Several explanation exist on how\nthey appear, though the most supported reasoning is\nthat they are manifestations of collective thought and\nhope from the Psyic plane.\nDeva generally have light, gray, blueish,\nlavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their\neyes, which are pure white. They are on average,\nslightly taller than humans, though only slightly.\nDeva rarely appear looking younger than in their\ntwenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although\nit does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and\nin combination with their striking features, they are\ngenerally at the center of attention of any room they\nenter.\nDeva are always \u201cborn\u201d with a deep feeling of\nhope and purpose. The source of that hope and\npurpose is never clear, but the force with which these\ndrive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that\ngoal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are\nusually somewhat noble, such as \u201cfreeing the region\nfrom tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat\u201d or\n\u201cleading their community safely to a new land\u201d.\nThese purposes tend to align with the communities\nin which they spawn, supporting theories of their\npsyic origins.\nDeva also are born with a feeling of having\nmemories that are not entirely their own. They do not\nknow how they know so many skills, as they\nremember nothing of learning them. They may have\nfaint memories of past events within their\ncommunities, or even past experiences of other deva\nbefore them, but beyond that, it feels as though their\nlives began when they spawned.\n\n```\nWhen a deva dies, their body dissipates\u2014there is\nno body left over. If they failed at their purpose,\nanother deva may appear years later, or if they\nsucceeded, another deva might not appear for\nhundreds of years.\n```\n\n```\nAspects\n```\n\n- Core purpose: Choose one for your community\n- Hope\n\n```\nVitals\n```\n\n- Size: Medium\n- Height: 5.5-6.5 feet\n- Weight: 140-240 pounds\n\n```\nNaturally Charismatic\nPassive ability.\nIncreasing your presence die costs 2 less XP.

They were created as\nbutlers, maids, and test subjects, fabricated from the\ncombination of Deoric ritual and a body of the\nrecently deceased, made to serve the wizards.\nBecause of this, ghouls lack any spirit, making them\nimmune to some effects, but incredibly susceptible to\nKethic elemental magic. They exert no Kethic\npresence, meaning there\u2019s nothing stopping a water\nattuned mage from filling a ghoul\u2019s lungs with water,\nor a fire attuned mage from igniting the very skin of\na ghoul.\nAfter the age of great Deoric mages ended,\nghouls lived on. They are rare, and not infrequently\nkilled for their distinctive, gaunt, gray skin that\nidentifies them as ghouls, an aspect that many try to\ncover up. This widely felt vehemence towards ghouls\nstems from the belief that they kill other humanoids\nand eat them\u2014which is partially true.\nDue to the nature of ghouls\u2019 origin, they feel an\neternal emptiness within their bodies that aches to be\nfilled. Eating magic, and the souls of other living\nthings sate that hunger. While eating magic and flesh\nare not strictly necessary for ghoul survival, it\nusually feels that way, and any chance to eat magic\nor the recently deceased has a powerful frenzying\neffect on all ghouls. Many give in to this urge,\nfeeling little sympathy towards a world that has\ngiven them nothing but hurt, creating a reputation for\nall ghouls of hunting and eating humans. Seeing a\nghoul in a feeding frenzy is a truly horrifying\nexperience\u2014one that only needs to be seen once\nbefore never wanting to be near another ghoul again.\nFor these reasons, ghoul hunters can be found\nacross Alaria. Nearly all are mages\u2014capable of\nkilling a ghoul in nearly an instant. While some\nghouls try to flee or hide from the hunters, others\n\n```\nfight back, usually gathering in small groups in the\nhopes of overwhelming the hunter.\nDespite not being able to create biological\noffspring, some ghouls will create other ghouls,\nusing the same cruel magic as was used to create the\noriginal few. The Deoric ritual is innately known by\nall ghouls, and requires nothing more than one dead\nbody, and one live one for sacrifice. This ritual takes\n1 hour to perform.\n```\n\n```\nAspects\n```\n\n- I must eat flesh\n- Terrifying presence\n\n```\nVitals\nYou have whatever vitals you gained from the\nbody you were reanimated from.\n```\n\n```\nSoul Eater\nPassive ability.\nWhen you are adjacent to a humanoid or creature\nof greater power that has died within the last hour,\nyou may spend an action to suck its soul out and\ningest it.

There are many reasons\nrevenants may choose to stay, but the most common\ninvolve unfinished business. Whether it\u2019s getting\nrevenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this\ngoal is a top priority. While revenants may take\ndetours along the way, they will always come back to\ntheir purpose for remaining in the material world.\nBy remaining in the material world, revenants\nforfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a revenant has\ncompleted whatever business kept them in this\nworld, they generally slowly go crazy and are\neventually hunted down and killed by children of\nAnubis or other specialized killers.\nDue to revenant\u2019s near immortality, they are\nforced to watch as everyone they love inevitably\ngrows old and dies, which contributes to the slow\ndecaying of their sanity.\n\nAspects\n\n- Unfinished business\n- [Choose one from your previous race]\n\nVitals\n\nYou have whatever vitals you would have had\nbefore you died.\n\nUndead\n_Passive ability._\n\nYou no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and\ncannot be poisoned.\n\n```\nYou have already died, and can therefore not die\nagain in the traditional sense.

The first is the moment-to-moment scale,\ncalled micro-scale. This is the scale that combat and\nconversations usually play out at. When a player\nsays what they want to do with their action in\ncombat, or describes or RPs the things they say to\nanother character, this is micro-scale.\nThe second scale is the macro-scale\u2014when\nactions are described more generically, and the\ndetails don\u2019t really matter. For example, when the\nplayers say that they spend the rest of the night\nhanging out with people from the inn, or when a\nplayer says they want to spend the day hunting deer,\nthis is macro-scale.\nThe first half of this book describes how to\nhandle the micro-scale. Things you do either\nsucceed, or they fail, and there are strict definitions\nfor the outcomes of different activities you take.\nMacro-scale is more nuanced and does not have the\nsame sort of strict rules for outcomes. In this section,\nhandling the macro-scale is described.\n\nMacro-Scale\n\nFor the most part, macro-scale activities should\nplay out in whatever way makes the most sense and\nwould feel natural. However, when the macro-scale\naction is one that has a specific goal and is risky or\nhas potential to fail, then you must use these rules.\nNote that many times, activities that are risky or\nhave potential to fail are better suited to being played\nout at micro-scale. For example, a conversation with\na duke to persuade him of new policy _could_ be\nplayed out at macro-scale, if players would rather not\ndeal with the details of the conversation. However,\n\n```\nplayers may prefer to handle the situation themselves\non a more granular scale, in which case the\nconversation should happen on a micro-scale. If\nyou're sure the activity should happen on a macro-\nscale and the outcome is uncertain, proceed.\n```\n\n```\nRunning the Skill Check\nMake sure players everyone is aware of what the\ngoal is, and make sure it's clear what a success state\nlooks like. This doesn't have to happen explicitly, but\nit's usually safer to say it directly. If players are\ngoing to fight off some thugs, and their goal is to\n\u201cwin\u201d, for example, this is not a clearly defined\nsuccess state. What does winning look like? Dead\nthugs? Thugs that ran off? Thugs that are scared of\nthe players? Thugs that ran off and are scared of the\nplayers? And does it matter if there are witnesses?\nOnce the success state is defined, you as the GM\nshould set and inform the players of the CN for the\nroll. Then, the player can make a normal skill check\nagainst the CN.\nIf the players roll 2 greater than the CN, then\nthey should be awarded a full success. If the players\nroll somewhere between CN + 2 and CN - 2, the\nplayers should get a partial success. And if the\nplayers roll less, then it should result in failure. How\nto run each of those outcomes is detailed below.\n```\n\n```\nFull Success\nWhen players achieve full success, they should\nbe able to achieve their goal, or at least have very\nlittle work left to get there. Before or after this\nmoment of success, zoom in on a side effect from the\nlist below. Be specific.\n```\n\nSuccess, and\n\n- you find something else useful or interesting\n- you meet someone unusual or who might be\n  helpful later\n- you discover a secret\n- you gain a valuable ally\n- you find unexpected rewards or resources\n\nExamples\n\n- ** The player is foraging to get food ** : \u201cAn hour\n  walk around the lake reveals little signs of food.\n  However, as you near your starting location, you\n  spot a small dark spot at the top of a nearby tree.\n  Upon approach, it appears to be a cache of food.\u201d\n  When players investigate further, they also\n  discover a crude map and some tools (unexpected\n  rewards or resources).\n- ** The player is doing daily musical\n  performances to make money ** : \u201cYour music is\n  enormously popular in the city. Crowds gather, and\n  you\u2019re making about X (decide for yourself) ducat\n  every day. After one, particularly impressive\n  performance, a woman approaches you. She wears\n  fine furs and her wrists and neck are dripping with\n  silver and gold.\u201d Upon conversation, the woman\n  reveals herself to be someone looking for a\n  musician for her upcoming, private party (unusual\n  person/valuable ally).\n- ** The player is visiting all the pubs, looking\n  for blackmail on the king ** : \u201cYou hit a dozen pubs,\n  being careful to ask the right questions so as to not\n  raise too much suspicion. First, you learn that\n  [insert blackmail about the king].

As the day nears an end, you\n  finally find someone who\u2019s intrigued. He\u2019s a\n  peculiar looking fellow, with a brimmed hat, a long\n  coat, and a pipe. You had been chatting with a\n  representative at the guild and he had been\n  listening from a seat nearby, and approaches you as\n  you come out. \u2018How do you do,\u2019 he says, stepping\n  up to shake your hand.\u201d The man is willing to buy\n  your wares, but he wants your help making amends\n  with another merchant he burned his relationship\n  with (it has a cost).\n- ** The player is navigating a passage through\n  the mountains ** : \u201cThe trip is slow but you\u2019re\n\n```\nrelatively confident that you know where you are.\nHowever, around noon you come to a steep valley.\nYou don\u2019t recognize this on your map, but you can\nclearly see the lake you are trying to reach, only a\ncouple miles beyond. On either side of the valley,\nyou see burrows dotting the ground, each about 3\nfeet across. From where you stand at the foot of the\nvalley, however, all appears to be still.\u201d Dangerous\ncreatures may emerge from the burrows if the\nplayers travel through the valley (you will attract\nunwanted attention or suspicion/it requires getting\ninto a situation).\n```\n\n- ** The player is mentoring a student to teach\n  them how to run the ship in their absence ** : \u201cThe\n  months stretch on, and Bj\u00f6rn appears to be\n  learning well. However, Bj\u00f6rn is not popular with\n  the crew. They think he\u2019s a bit weak, and hasn't\n  really proven his meddle, so they don\u2019t want to be\n  reporting to him in your absence.\u201d Players may\n  have to seek out a dangerous situation so that\n  Bj\u00f6rn can prove himself, or deal with later\n  consequences of having an unpopular leader for\n  their crew (people aren't happy about it).\n\nFailure\n\nOn a failure, the original goal was failed.\nHowever, there must always be some degree of\nprogression to throw the ball back in players\u2019 court.\nDescribe the failure, and then zoom in on the silver\nlining.\n\nFailure, but\n\n- you find something else useful or interesting\n- you meet someone unusual or who might be\n  helpful later\n- you discover a secret\n- you get clues towards where you can try again\n- you gain a better understanding of the situation\n\n```\nExamples\n```\n\n- ** The player is recruiting villagers to defend\n  the settlement ** : \u201cGoing from door to door, you beg\n  the townsfolk to assemble\u2014it\u2019s their village they\n  need to defend! However, your pleas are largely\n  ignored, and except for a small ragtag group of\n  idiots and misfits, nobody seems particularly\n  interested in doing anything to stop the invaders.\n  \u2018New nobility, same taxes\u2019 they say. However,\n  while scouring the area for homes, you eventually\n  spot a small shack on the hill. It is the last home\n  around.\u201d Inside is a crazy old man with insight on\n  the nature of the attackers and maybe has ideas on\n  defending the village (find someone unusual, better\n  understanding of the situation).\n- ** The players are beating up a pickpocket to\n  teach them a lesson ** : \u201cYou grab the pickpocket by\n  the back of the collar, and yank him back. With a\n  yelp, the pickpocket wriggles free, sliding their\n  shirt off and sprinting down the street before you\n  can grab them again. You are left only with the\n  pickpocket\u2019s shirt. However, before you throw it\n  away, you notice a small insignia of a leaping tiger\n  embroidered in with gold thread, with the letters S\n  V L underneath it.\u201d This is the icon and insignia of\n  the queen\u2019s secret service of city spies (find\n  something else useful/interesting, discover a\n  secret).\n- ** The player is trying to learn new spells at\n  an academy for elemental mages ** : \u201cA few months\n  pass, and you are really struggling to pick up any\n  of it. It\u2019s mainly due to the fact that the professor\n  for the class rarely shows up, and when she does,\n  seems incredibly exhausted. One evening, while\n  walking back to your dormitory, you see her across\n  campus, limping from the forest.\u201d She has come\n  from some other adventure or commitment. If the\n  players can solve her issues for her, she may be\n\n```\nable to actually teach the class (discover a secret,\nclues towards trying again, better understanding).\n```\n\nComplication Triggered:\n\n- A new danger is revealed\n- You\u2019re in a tough situation\n- It had an unforeseen cost\n- It isn\u2019t as good as it seemed\n- You aroused suspicion\n- Dangerous forces are gathering\n- The status quo is disturbed\n- People aren\u2019t happy about it\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Unfortunately, Heart Rush is a fairly tactical\ngame that requires some degree of preparation for\ncombat. On the bright side, even a boring monster\ncan be exciting to fight in Heart Rush, and if you\nwant to make the monster more interesting it is not\ndifficult.\n\nBase Stats\n\nIf you are creating a monster, you will absolutely\nneed to know each of the following stats:\n\n- HP\n- Heart die\n- Might, agility, and cunning dice\n- Weapon die\n- Armor\n  It doesn't really matter what you assign to these\n  values\u2014you just want them to be \u201crealistic-ish\u201d.\n  Bear in mind that a player starts with 40 HP, a d8\n  heart die, d6-ish ability dice, and a d10-ish weapon,\n  and maybe 2-6 armor. Use that as a metric to build\n  your monster, and scale the values up or down.\n\nBells and Whistles\n\nIf you have all of the above, you\u2019ve got a\nstandard monster, and it's good enough to use in a\nfight. If you want the monster to have more flavor,\nit\u2019s a good idea to add abilities. Monsters don\u2019t need\nto have lots of abilities, they just need ones that ooze\nwith the flavor of that monster. A basilisk needs an\nability that paralyzes people. A cobra needs to be\nable to poison people. A fire dragon needs to be able\nto breathe fire on people.\n\n```\nAbility Templates\nIf you don't want to come up with your own\nability from scratch, use an ability template from the\nlist below.\n```\n\n- ** Aura ** : At the beginning of each creature\u2019s turn\n  within X feet...\n- ** Attack Side Effect ** : When this creature\n  directly beats a stance...\n- ** AoE ** : As priority ability, everyone within\n  [area]...\n- ** Damage Side Effect ** : When this creature deals\n  damage...\n- ** Non-Weapon Attack** : Target creature/s make a\n  [ability] saving throw. On a failure, those\n  creatures... On a success...\n\n```\nAbility Effects\nHere are some common effects for monster\nabilities to spark your imagination.\n```\n\n- Conditions\n  - Weakened/Off-balanced/Dazed\n  - Poisoned\n  - Prone\n  - Grappled\n  - Restrained\n  - Blinded\n  - Stunned\n  - Slowed\n  - Burning\n- Forced movement\n- Additional damage\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

In this mode of gameplay, time\nprogresses in blocks of time, split into the four\nquarters of the day: morning, afternoon, evening, and\nnight. Each quarter can be spent traveling or\ncamping.\nWhile traveling, you are moving towards your\ndestination. For each quarter of the day you spend\ntraveling, you cover a number of miles equal to half\nof your travel speed. Additionally, for each quarter\nspent traveling, you may take one action with the\n_travel_ tag from the Journey Actions section below.\nWhile camping, you are recovering from your\ntravels and preparing for the next leg of the journey.\n\n```\nFor each quarter spent camping, you may take one\naction with the camp tag from the Journey Actions\nsection below.\n```\n\n```\nJourney Actions\nWhile traveling, you can take one journey action\nfor each quarter of the day, so long as its tag\ncorresponds to what you're doing during that quarter.\nSome journey actions have both a travel and a camp\ntag, meaning you can always take the action. All\nplayers should determine which journey action they\nwant to take before they are resolved.\nMost actions require you to make a skill check\nagains the environment. Below is a chart defining the\nchallenge numbers for different journey actions in\ndifferent environments. The GM may adjust these\nCNs based on additional factors.\n```\n\nWhen you take a journey action at night, it's\nsubstantially harder to do it effectively.

If you beat the CN by\nfour points or more, grant two DP instead.\n\nFish\n\n_Camp._\nYou go fishing. You must have fishing gear and\nbe near a body of water to take this action.\nMake a fishing skill check against the challenge\nnumber for the environment. On a success, you catch\ntwo rations worth of food. For every point over the\nCN, you catch two additional rations worth of food.\n\nForage\n_Travel. Camp._\nYou look for edible plants, roots, and berries.\nMake a foraging skill check against the challenge\nnumber for the environment. If you use this as a\ntravel action, you have disadvantage on this roll. On\na success, you find six rations. For every point over\nthe CN, you find one additional ration worth of food.\n\nGather Wood\n_Camp._\n\nYou look for dry wood or other flammables to\nbuild a fire. Make a search skill check against the\nchallenge number for the environment. On a success,\nyou gather one bundle of wood (enough to keep a\nsmall fire burning for a quarter). If you beat the CN\nby four or more, you gather two bundles of wood\n\n```\n(enough to keep a large fire burning for one quarter,\nor a small fire burning for two quarters).\n```\n\n```\nHunt\nTravel. Camp.\nYou track down and kill a wild animal for food.\nYou must have a light or heavy ranged weapon with\na range of 30 feet or greater to take this action.\nMake a tracking skill check against the\nchallenge number for the environment. If you use\nthis as a travel action, you have disadvantage on this\nroll. On a success, you find a prey animal worth 2\nrations of food, typical to the surrounding terrain, if\nany exist. If you beat the CN by four or more, the\nanimal you find is worth 20 rations instead. You may\nthen make a hunting skill check against the challenge\nnumber for the environment. On a success, you kill\nthe animal before it gets away.\n```\n\n```\nLo o k o u t\nTravel. Camp.\nYou keep watch while moving, or explore the\nsurroundings around your camp. Make a perception\nskill check against the challenge number for your\nenvironment. On a success, you see or hear any\nthreats as soon as they become visible or audible. If\nyou beat the CN by four points or more, you spot\nsomething interesting while searching, as determined\nby the GM.\n```\n\n```\nNavigate\nTravel. Camp.\nYou use charts and your surroundings to keep\ntrack of where you are. If someone does not take this\naction while in a travel phase, you may become lost\nat the GM\u2019s discretion.\nWhen you take this action, make a navigation\ncheck against the challenge number for the\nenvironment. On a failure, you are lost. Add an\nadditional event to the journey. The GM should roll\n```\n\non the _Lost in the Wilderness_ table to determine the\noutcome.\n\nScou t A he ad\n_Travel._\nIf scouting ahead is feasible, you may take this\naction. Make a scouting skill check against the\nenvironment's challenge number. On a success,\nchoose one of the following journey actions:\nCaptain, Fish, Gather Wood, Forage, Hunt, Make\nCamp, or Navigate. During the next quarter, skill\nchecks made for the chosen journey action have\nadvantage.\n\nSleep\n_Camp. Travel\\*._\nWhen you take this action, you may take a long\nrest. Make your sleeping check. If you take this\naction during a quarter of the day other than the\nnight, you have -20 on this roll.\nYou can sleep while traveling if you are not on\nfoot. You have -30 to the sleeping check.\n\nInterruptions in the Journey\n\nIf you get into a fight, explore something you\ndiscovered, or take part in any lengthy activity that\nthe GM rules is not part of the journey, the journey\nactions pause. When they resume, the GM may start\nat whatever quarter they deem appropriate.\n\nGetting Lost\n\nWhen you are lost, rather than going in the\nintended direction, you cover the same distance in a\ncardinal direction determined by 1d4 (1: North, 2:\nEast, 3: South, 4: West). So long as you are lost,\nquarters spent traveling continue to be in random\ndirections.\nYou remain lost until you succeed at a _navigate_\njourney action.\n\nCarrying Gear\n\n```\nWhen you travel, you will likely want to bring\nyour gear. These rules break down how much gear\nyou can carry and what happens when you try to\ncarry more.\n```\n\n```\nEncumbrance Score\nThere are several critical points of burden. Your\nfirst critical point of carrying capacity is your\nencumbrance score. This is equal to half of your\nmight die times 10, and it dictates how many pounds\nof gear you can carry without any penalty.\nOnce you surpass that amount, however, you\nbecome encumbered. While encumbered, for every\n10 pounds over your encumbrance threshold,\nrounded up, your movement speed is reduced by 5\nfeet.\n```\n\n```\nMaximum Carrying Capacity\nYour second critical point of burden is your\nmaximum carrying capacity, equal to your might die\ntimes 10. Although you can lift more than this, you\ncannot carry this much for a full quarter of the day.\n```\n\n```\nPac k A n i m al s & Vehicles\nRather than carrying all of your gear on your\nback, using a pack animal or vehicle can help. Use\nthe following chart to determine the carrying\ncapacity. If you are riding the animal, remember to\nsubtract your own weight as well.\nCarrying Capacity\nAnimal/Vehicle Capacity\nDonkey 150\nHorse 300\n```\n\nAdventuring Gear\n\nRules 2. 0?\n\n```\nWhen traveling, there are a variety of tasks\nnecessary to survival: staying on course, gathering\nfood, and getting shelter. Each of these needs is\naccounted for by the following activities:\n```\n\n- Piloting. Piloting any vehicle you are traveling\n  on.\n\n```\nHorse-drawn wagon 1500\n```\n\n```\nAnimal/Vehicle Capacity\n```\n\n```\nAdventuring Gear\nItem Effect Weight Cost\nRation of\nfood\n```\n\n```\nFulfills your need for\nfood for two quarters\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

When you first create\nyour character, you will likely start out with a\nweapon and some armor, though it is up to the GM.\nAlso in this section are the rules for cantrips.\nCantrips are very similar to weapons; you choose\nstances, and on a hit you usually get to make an\nattack roll with your chosen stance. Cantrips differ\nfrom weapons in that there is no physical weapon\nused to strike the opponent, and only those with\nmagical attunements can use them.\n\nWeapons\n\nEvery weapon has a size, attack type, and\ndamage type, which together describe the weapon\nand its properties. You may choose one weapon to be\nyour primary weapon. This weapon does not use up\nequipment slots.\nYou can only wield one weapon at a time. If\nwielding a weapon does not require being held in\nyour hands, it does not count towards this restriction.\n\nSize\n\nThe size of weapon refers to how big and\npowerful the weapon is. Three sizes exist: heavy,\nlight, and ultralight or improvised. It is up to the GM\nto determine the size of any given weapon.\n\nHeavy Weapons\n\nHeavy weapons require two hands, can only be\nwielded by creatures of size medium or larger, and\ncannot be easily hidden upon your body. Longbows,\n\n```\nlong swords, pikes, mauls, and heavy crossbows are\nexamples of heavy weapons. Whenever you use a\nheavy weapon, add 1d12 to your attack rolls. Your\nmove speed decreases by 5 feet if this weapon is not\npart of your body. Heavy weapons use 10 gear slots\nunless they are your primary weapon or part of your\nbody.\n```\n\n```\nLi g h t W e a p o n s\nLight weapons are, as their name suggests, light,\nand are easy to handle. Crossbows, shortswords, and\nshortbows are all examples of light weapons.\nWhenever you use a light weapon, add 1d8 to your\nattack rolls. Light weapons use 5 gear slots unless\nthey are your primary weapon or part of your body.\n```\n\n```\nUltralight Weapons\nUltralight weapons are small and easy to handle.\nKnives, shurikens, and claws count as ultralight\nweapons. Whenever you use an ultralight weapon,\nadd 1d4 to your attack roll. Ultralight weapons use 2\ngear slots unless they are your primary weapon or\nare part of your body.\n```\n\n```\nImprovised Weapons\nChairs, your teeth, and your falling body can all\nbe weapons in the right context. Improvised weapons\ncount as ultralight weapons unless indicated\notherwise.\n```\n\n```\nAt tack Ty pe\nTwo types of weapons exist: melee and ranged.\nEach come with different benefits.\n```\n\nMelee\n\nMelee weapons are weapons that do not involve\nany part of the weapon leaving your hand. They are\ngenerally more powerful than ranged weapons, due\nto the fact that they have a lot of weight attached to\nthem. Heavy melee weapons require two hands, and\nlight and ultralight melee weapons require only one.\nMelee weapons have a range of 5 feet.\n* *Might Stance Bonus** : You may push the\ndefending creature 10 feet away from you after\neveryone in the engagement has made their might\nattack roll. You may enter any of the free spaces they\nleft or passed through because of your attack.\nMoving into that space does not provoke opportunity\nattacks.\n\nRanged\n\nRanged weapons trade damage for being able to\ninflict injuries from a safer distance. Light ranged\nweapons have a range of 30 ft, and heavy ranged\nweapons have a range of 60 ft. You can attack targets\noutside of that range, but have disadvantage to the\nattack for every 10 feet beyond the range listed, to a\nmaximum of double the weapon\u2019s range.\nRanged weapons come with drawbacks,\nhowever. All ranged weapons require two hands\nunless specifically noted otherwise, and you cannot\nchoose anything but the defensive stance if you\nmove more than half of your move speed (after\naccounting for armor and other penalties) during a\nround, and cannot move more than half your move\nspeed (after accounting for armor and other\npenalties) if you already took a non-defensive stance\nin an engagement.\n* *Might Stance Bonus** : Creatures defending\nagainst this attack cannot add their defense bonus\nfrom armor to their defense roll.\n\n```\nTh row n\nThrown weapons are a special category of\nweapons that combine elements of both melee and\nranged combat. They behave similarly to melee\nweapons in terms of handling but are used up as they\nare thrown. Thrown weapons have a range of 20 feet.\nYou can attack targets outside of that range, but have\ndisadvantage on the attack for every 5 feet beyond\nthe range listed, to a maximum of double the\nweapon\u2019s range.\nUnless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons\ncan be thrown. Weapons cannot be thrown in water.\nMight Stance Bonus : The first time you hit with\na thrown weapon attack in an engagement, you may\nmake an immediate follow-up attack with another\nthrown weapon against a different valid target in the\nengagement.\n```\n\n```\nWhip\nWhips have a range of 20 feet. Unless otherwise\nstated, only ultralight weapons can be whips.\nWhips cannot be used in water.\nMight Stance Bonus : Add another weapon die\nto your attack roll.\n```\n\nDamage Type\n\n```\nBludgeoning\nBludgeoning weapons use raw force to inflict\ndamage, and therefore are best used with high might.\nExamples of bludgeoning weapons include war\nhammers and clubs. Whenever you wield a\nbludgeoning weapon and use the might stance, add\nan additional weapon die to your roll.\n```\n\n```\nSlashing\nSlashing weapons use accuracy and dexterity to\ninflict damage, and therefore are best used with high\nagility. Examples of slashing weapons include\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Examples\nof piercing weapons include rapiers and weapons\nthat use arrows. Whenever you wield a piercing\nweapon and use the cunning stance, add an\nadditional weapon die to your roll.\n\nOther Weapon Tags\n\nEvery weapon has a size, attack type, and\ndamage type. However, weapons can also have tags,\nmaking them further distinct.\n\nReach\n\nMelee weapons can have this tag. If you haven\u2019t\ndashed this round, the range of this weapon is 10 feet\ninstead of 5. If you attack a creature at this extended\nrange, you cannot dash this round.\n\nCantrips\n\nCantrips are very similar to normal weapons.\nThey can be melee or ranged, and heavy, light, or\nultralight, and they can be cast any time you would\nnormally make an attack with a weapon. However,\nunlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you\nhave an attunement to the corresponding element.\nAlso, since elemental attacks are not always\nphysical, they don't always deal damage, and the\nbonus granted by the might stance is sometimes\ndifferent.\nThere are two types of cantrips\u2014bolts, and\nblasts. Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line\n\n```\nfrom your hand, while blasts are short bursts of\nenergy emitted from the caster themselves. Each\nhave more specific rules outlined in their sections.\n```\n\n```\nBolts\nBolts are individual streaks of elemental energy\nor matter that are fired from a single hand. They\nbehave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though\nthey do not get a bonus from damage type. All bolt\ncantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement\nto that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and\n120 feet at paragon attunement.\n```\n\n```\nLi g h t n i n g B o l t\nAir.\nYou shoot a crackling bolt of lightning from your\nhand.

However, the rules for\nspells are similar to ranged weapons. Unlike\nspells, they are used during engagements in the\nsame way as weapons. People with attunements\ncan use them like \u201cutility\u201d arrows, where each\ntype of bolt and blast has some convenient\neffect, possibly in addition to damage.\n```\n\nWat e r B olt\n_Water._\nYou may shoot a heavy jet of water from your\nhand.

This attack does no damage, but the\ntarget takes a level of confused as faesong rips\nthrough their body.\n* *Might Stance Bonus** : Add a level of confused.\n\nDark Bolt\n_Dark._\nYou shoot a bolt of darkness from your hand.\nThis attack does no damage, but the target takes 2\nlevels of weakened as their skin is chilled to the\nbone.\n* *Might Stance Bonus** : Add two levels of\nweakened.\n\n```\nRadiant Bolt\nLight.\nYou shoot a bolt of brilliant light from your hand.\nThis attack does no damage, but the target takes 2\nlevels of blinded as light ripples across their body.\nMight Stance Bonus : Add a level of blinded.\n```\n\n```\nTi me B olt\nTime.\nYou shoot a bolt of time from your hand.

They\nbehave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that\nyou must choose a stance, can only attack those\nwhom your stance beats, and gain the benefits\nassociated with each stance\u2014though not all blasts\ndeal damage, and not all blasts are attacks. You must\nhave both hands free to use blast cantrips.\nAfter choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up\nto two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of\nyou. At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any\nnumber of valid targets in range. At paragon\nattunement, the range of your blast increases by 5\nfeet.\n```\n\n```\nBlast of Lightning\nAir.\nYou spread your arms, sending electricity\ncrackling away from you.

Engagements are short scenes of\ncombat between participants, and are used to abstract\nthe actions of multiple combatants all trying to attack\neach other.\nDuring each round, everyone will have the\nchance to use whatever abilities they can and take\nactions, though the order of all these things can vary\nfrom round to round. There are not \u201cturns\u201d in the\ntraditional sense.\n\nStarting Combat\n\nWhen combat begins, everyone loses priority.\nThat means they cannot use abilities that are not\n_instant_. Instead, priority will be granted to a starting\nside, and then pass back and forth until everyone in\nthe round has done all of the things they want to do.\nThe first step is determining who starts with\npriority. If one side wasn\u2019t expecting to get attacked,\nthe other side gains priority and should choose\nsomeone on their side to start. If both sides saw\ncombat coming, the players should roll 1d6 to\ndetermine which side gets starting priority, with a 4\nor higher resulting in the players getting priority\nfirst. The starting side will begin each subsequent\nround with priority.\n\nPriority During Combat\n\nWhen your side in a fight has priority, anyone on\nyour side can use an ability. Once they do, priority\npasses to the other side. If they don\u2019t want to use an\nability (or can't), priority passes back to your side.\n\n```\nThis continues until neither side wishes to do\nanything, in which case the round ends. Note that\nabilities with the instant tag do not require priority,\nand do not trigger priority passing to the other side.\nIn overview, the sequence will look like this:\nsomeone on the side with priority will use an ability.\nOnce that ability resolves, anyone on the other side\ncan choose to use an ability next. If nobody on that\nside wants to, then anybody on the original side gets\nanother turn. If none of them want to do anything, it\npasses to the other side one final time. If all of them\nstill don\u2019t want to use an ability, then the round is\nover.\nIf, however, someone does want to use an ability,\nthen the sequence starts over. In effect, so long as\nboth sides are frantically trying to use their abilities,\nboth sides will alternate using abilities. However, if\none side is no longer interested in or able to use any\nabilities, the other side will be able to\nuninterruptedly continue using abilities until the\nother side decides to jump back in.\nDuring engagements, which are explained in the\nEngaging the Enemy section, nobody gets priority.\nAs soon as someone enters an engagement, neither\nside has priority until the engagement ends.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Whenever you use a minor\nability, you must spend one rush point for each time\nyou\u2019ve used the ability, including the current use.\nYou have multiple minor abilities, so you will have\nto manage how many times you\u2019ve used each\nseparately. They do not require you to spend an\naction, but there may be limitations on when you can\nuse them.\n\nMajor Abilities\n\nMajor abilities are like ultimate moves your\ncharacter has. Unlike minor abilities, major abilities\ncan only be used once per day. Major abilities gained\nfrom your class have additional, optional rush point\ncosts, meaning that your major abilities will get\nstronger and stronger the longer the fight lasts. They\ndo not require you to spend an action, but there may\nbe limitations on when you can use them\n\nSpecial Use Cases\n\nRush points can also be spent to make\nopportunity attacks or to sidestep.\n\nEngaging the\n\nEnemy\n\nAn engagement with the enemy may be a short\nflurry of crossing blows, or it may be part of a larger\nmelee with dozens of combatants.\nIn either case, when you first decide to engage\nthe enemy\u2014taking the _Engage the Enemy_ action\u2014\nchoose an enemy you could theoretically hit with the\nweapon you are currently wielding. You and this\nenemy are now part of the engagement. The enemy\ndoes not have a choice in entering this engagement,\n\n```\nand participating in this engagement does not cost\nthem their action.\nAs an engagement has now begun, creatures no\nlonger get priority. The engagement must be resolved\nbefore creatures get priority again. However, first,\nother creatures get a chance to join.\nOther creatures within weapon range of anyone\nin the engagement may decide to enter the\nengagement as well. If they wish to do so, they can\nspend their action to join the engagement. This is the\nEnter an Engagement action.\n```\n\n```\nChoosing Stances\nOnce everyone who wants to and is allowed to\njoin the engagement has done so, every combatant\nwithin the engagement must secretly choose their\nstance: might, agility, cunning, or the defensive\nstance. Once everyone has chosen, everyone must\nreveal their choice. Attacks proceed in a manner\nsimilar to rock paper scissors, as outlined in the\nsections below.\nNote that if the players wish to discuss which\nstance to choose among themselves, the GM should\nchoose the stance for the enemies before the players\ndecide for their characters, to prevent any\naccusations of cheating by reacting to the decisions\nmade by the players.\n```\n\n```\nTy p i c a l R o u n ds\nIn most rounds, you\u2019ll want to move a bit\u2014\nthe first dash is free\u2014and you\u2019ll want to start\nor enter an engagement, since that\u2019s the main\nway to deal damage. Sprinkled throughout,\nyou\u2019ll use various abilities and occasionally\nyou\u2019ll want to do something else with your\naction, but moving and engaging is the gist.\n```\n\nCunning\n\nThose who chose cunning are able to easily read\nand avoid the attacks of anyone who can\u2019t beat them\nwith raw strength, and get to make an attack against\na single creature in the engagement that didn\u2019t take\nthe might stance. Creatures that chose the cunning\nstance make their attack rolls first, in any order.\nCunning directly beats agility. Whenever you use\nthis stance to attack a creature defending with the\nagility stance, you may apply up to two levels of\ndazed, off-balanced, or weakened to that creature.\n\nAgilit y\n\nThose who chose agility are able to maneuver\ntheir way past those who can\u2019t read their actions, and\nget to make an attack against a single creature in the\nengagement that didn\u2019t take the cunning stance.\nCreatures that chose the agility stance can make their\nattack rolls after all of the cunning stance attack rolls\nhave been made.\nAlso, if you choose this stance, you may take the\nsidestep action for free during the engagement, right\nbefore or after you make your attack. Creatures that\nchoose to attack before moving get to attack before\ncreatures that sidestep and then attack. If creatures\non opposite sides of a fight get to move via the\nagility stance, both sides should alternate who\nmoves, starting with whichever side was originally\nengaged with.\n\nMight\n\nThose who chose might are able to crush those\nwho are not agile enough to get out of the way, and\nget to make an attack against a single creature in the\nengagement that didn\u2019t take the agility stance.\nCreatures that chose the might stance make their\nattack rolls last.\nAdditionally, whenever you attack a creature\ndefending with the cunning stance, you trigger your\n\n```\nweapon\u2019s might stance bonus. Check out the\nWeapons section to learn more.\n```\n\n```\nDefensive\nAnyone who chose the defensive stance does not\nget to attack, but will not take as much damage.\nAfter subtracting your defense from an attack, halve\nthe remaining damage, rounding up.\n```\n\n```\nResolution\nAfter everyone has revealed their stance, it is\ntime for attacks. Everyone may attack one other\ncharacter that their stance beats, and is within range\nof their weapon. All stances beat defensive stance. If\nno one else took a stance that they could beat, or\nthey aren\u2019t in range of your weapon, you cannot\nattack in this engagement.\nAttacks should happen in order of\n1.Cunning\n2.Agility\n3.Might.\nStarting with cunning, anyone who chose the\ncunning stance may choose to attack each other or\nanyone who chose the agility or defensive stance.\nProceed in order.\nAlthough attacks of the same stance may not\nliterally happen simultaneously, treat them as though\nthey did. For example, if you push a creature away\nwith a melee weapon using the might stance, it\ncannot prevent them from attacking a creature that\nthey were previously in range of hitting with the\nmight stance. Likewise, if the attack would kill them,\nthey still get to hit another creature first.\nNote that if an attack pushes a target before the\ntarget's stance goes, such as if a cunning attacker\npushed someone who had chosen agility, the target\nmight not be in range of anyone any more, and\nwould be unable to attack or be attacked during the\nsubsequent turns for the remaining stances.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

There are three different types\nof cover, based on how many lines of sight exist\nbetween the attacker and the defender. Determining\nwhat type of cover you have from an attacker can be\ndone by drawing imaginary lines between any one\npoint on the attacker and each corner of a square that\nthe enemy takes the space of. For each line that is\nobstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of\ndisadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four\nlines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack\nthat creature.\nSometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to\nthe line blocked method of determining cover. It is\nthen up to the GM to decide how much cover should\nbe awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small\nbut not very helpful like a small tree in the way of\nyour shot will provide one level of cover. Things that\nthe defender has to poke their body out from behind\nto attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a\ncouch, provide two levels of cover.

Likewise, the\nclimbed on creature has the _climbed on_ condition.\nA creature can only climb on one creature at a\ntime.\n\nHinder\n\nWhen you choose this option, you perform some\nother sort of option that interferes with your target.\nThis could be represented by throwing sand in their\neyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching\nthem. You must be adjacent to the creature you target\nwith this ability.\nChoose one option from the following list:\n\n- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of\n  weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.\n- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.\n- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is\n  no more than one size larger than you.\n- Push the creature 5 feet.

There\u2019s a whole\nsection (Engaging the Enemy) on it, but the\nidea is that you\u2019re entering a chaotic melee\nwhere anyone could get hurt, including\nyourself.\n```\n\nDuring Combat\n\nDuring each round of combat, you can take up to\none action, and use any number of abilities\n(following the frequency restrictions on the abilities\nthemselves).\n\nAct ions\n\nYou get one action per round. All actions are\nabilities, and as with all abilities, you must have\npriority to use them.\nNote that the _Dash_ action, _Object Interaction_\naction, and _Call Out_ action do not cost an action the\nfirst time you perform them each round.\n\nEngage the Enemy\n_Full action._\nAs an action, you may engage with the enemy.\nThis does not guarantee that you\u2019ll injure them, or\neven hit them in the first place. In fact, they might hit\nyou instead.\nRules for engagement are complicated, and are\ndescribed in detail in the Engaging the Enemy\nsection below. As a simple analogy, using your\naction to engage the enemy can be described as\ninitiating a rock-paper-scissors game of combat with\nthe enemy, with the victor having the chance to\ninjure the loser.\n\nCast A Spell\n_Full action._\n\nSee the Spellcasting section for details and\nrestrictions on casting spells. You cannot cast a spell\nif you do not know any spells.\n\nSidestep\n_Full action\\*._\nRather than using an action, you may instead\nspend a rush point to perform this ability.\n\n```\nWhen you take this action, you may move 5 feet\nor stand up from prone. This movement does not\nprovoke opportunity attacks.\n```\n\n```\nDash\nFull action*.\nThe first dash you take each round does not cost\nyour action.\nMove a number of feet up to or equal to your\nmove speed. Unless stated otherwise, your move\nspeed is 60 before accounting for equipment.\nIf you move more than 5 feet within a creature\u2019s\nmelee range or leave their melee range without\ntaking the sidestep action, the creature may make an\nopportunity attack against you. Resolve the attack\nbefore leaving the creature\u2019s range and completing\nthe movement.\n```\n\n```\nObject Interaction\nFull action*.\nThe first object interaction you take each round\ndoes not cost your action.\nAny sort of simple interaction with an object\ncounts as an interaction action. Stowing a weapon\nand retrieving a new one are two separate object\ninteractions.\n```\n\n```\nHelp\nFull action.\nYou aid another creature. Choose an adjacent\ncreature. That creature gets advantage on its next A/\nD roll, skill check, or saving throw.\n```\n\n```\nCall Out\nFull action*.\nThe first call out you make each round does not\ncost your action.\nSay (or shout out) something. Up to one,\nreasonable-length sentence.\n```\n\nInstant Actions\n\nBelow are some actions that you can take at\ninstant speed, even while another creature is doing\nan action. They do not trigger priority changes.\n\nEnter An Engagement\n\n_Full action. Instant._\nAs an action, you may enter an engagement that\nhas already been initiated between other characters\nbut has not yet begun. Unlike other abilities, you do\nnot need priority to use this ability. Instead,\nimmediately after someone uses the _Engage the\nEnemy_ action, everyone has the choice to take this\naction until nobody else wishes to do so.\nThere must be a valid target in range of your\nweapon who is already part of the engagement in\norder to enter. To continue the analogy from the\nexplanation of engaging the enemy, this is like\ndeciding to jump into a rock-paper-scissors game\ngoing on between the people around you, and\nchoosing to play as well.\n\nTr i p\n\n_Full action. Instant._\nWhenever a creatures with a level of off-\nbalanced moves (willingly or forced) through a space\nthat is adjacent to you, if that creature is no more\nthan one size larger than you, you may trip the\ncreature, immediately knocking it prone in that\nspace.\n\nOpportunity Attack\n\n_Full action\\*. Instant._\nRather than using an action, you may instead\nspend a rush point to perform this ability.\nOpportunity attacks represent moments when an\nenemy has presented an easily exploited weakness.\nThey let you make an attack against them without\nfirst winning an engagement.\n\n```\nYou can only take this action if one or more of\nthe following conditions is met:\n```\n\n- The enemy willingly leaves your melee reach\n  without using the sidestep ability.\n- The enemy willingly moves more than 5 feet\n  within your melee reach without using the sidestep\n  ability.\n- The enemy stands up without using the\n  sidestep action.\n- You are hidden.\n- The target of your action is surprised.\n  When you take this action, make an attack roll\n  against the creature with the stance of your choice.\n\n```\nRush Poin ts\nRush represents the excitement and tension of a\nfight. As a fight goes on, rush points build, and you\ncan perform more and more powerful moves. Rush is\nrepresented with a pool of points. At the start of\ncombat, you have one rush point. At the beginning of\neach subsequent round, you gain rush points equal to\nthe number of rounds in which you were part of an\nengagement, made an opportunity attack, or cast a\nspell, up to the current number of rounds. Other\nabilities may increase this pool further.\nUnspent rush points are lost at the end of every\nround.\nOutside of combat, you have 0 rush points.\n```\n\n```\nHard To Get, but Great\nOpportunity attacks are like gold. They\u2019re\nhard to get, but when you do, you can throw\neverything you\u2019ve got into the roll and nail the\ntarget exactly the way you want. For this\nreason, enemies will do a lot to avoid getting\nhit with them. Use that to your advantage.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

The\norc\u2019s undead wolf dashes, coming adjacent to you as well. Priority passes back to you and allies.

You coordinate with your archer ally\u2014you\u2019ll choose might, she\u2019ll choose\nagility. You announce you\u2019re ready, and stances are revealed. The orc chose might, and the hound chose\ncunning. Time to resolve attacks.\n1.Cunning happens first. Although cunning beats agility, the hound is not adjacent to your archer friend,\nso the hound does nothing.\n2.Agility comes next. Your ally chose agility, which beats the might stance of the orc. Your ally, seeing\nshe\u2019s got the upper hand, decides to user her Execute ability, meaning her attack will deal a lot more\ndamage. She makes an attack roll against the orc, and the orc makes a defense roll. The orc decides it\u2019s\nmore damage than he\u2019s interested in, and decides to reduce his heart die to halve the damage. He remains\nalive.\n3.After agility comes might. You and the orc both chose might. Since you chose might, you can attack\neither the orc (since you tied stances), or the hound (might beats cunning). You decide to attack the orc\nsince the orc is a greater threat and you want him dead. However, the orc decided to attack you as well,\nsince you were its only target. You each make contested attack rolls, with the loser taking the difference in\ndamage. Unfortunately you roll a bit lower, so you end up taking a few points of damage.\nThe engagement ends, since everyone who can attack has done so. The enemies now have priority. At\nthis point, nobody except for the orc has an action left, since the orc didn\u2019t have to use an action to join the\nengagement (they were forced to join). The orc might enter an engagement again with you, in which case\nnobody else would have actions left to join, or they might not. The round continues.\n```\n\nPriority After the Engagement\n\nPriority passes to side that was targeted when the\nengagement first started, and continues as usual.\n\nTa k i n g D a m ag e\n\nWhen you take damage, you can choose to use\nsome of your stamina to \u201cshrug off\u201d or \"dodge\" the\ninjury. In this case, you take half as much damage,\nbut your heart die falls one size. If you cannot\ndecrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you\nmust take the full amount of damage.\nRegardless, whatever damage you do take gets\nsubtracted from your hit points. If this would cause\nyour hit points to reach a negative amount equal to\nyour maximum hit points, you are dead.\n\nMore Than 10 Damage\n\nIf you take 10 or more damage, this represents\nserious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit\npoints, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain\nEnglish description of the wound. For example, a\nwound could be \u201ca nasty gash in your arm,\u201d or \u201ca\nfractured leg,\u201d or \u201cyour guts are spilling out\u201d. Write\nthis down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound.\nThe rank is equal to the amount of damage you took.\nRead more about wounds in the next section.\n\nWou n ds\n\nWounds reduce your maximum hit points.\nWhenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase\nyour hit points beyond your normal maximum minus\nthe sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you\nnormally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have\n23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit\npoints.\nOutside of combat, wounds are like aspects,\nwhich you can read about in the Aspects section\n\n```\n(page 10). Since they have a description and a rank,\nyou or the GM can invoke them for a penalty on a\nroll equal to the rank of the wound, in exchange for\nDP equal to the rank of the wound, up to 5.\n```\n\n```\nTr e a t i n g W ou n ds\nWhenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it\ntreated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large\namount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a\nmedicine skill check and reduce the rank of all\nuntreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by\nthe rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's\nrank below zero, remove the wound completely.\nIf you are treating your own wounds, you have\ndisadvantage.\nYou can treat any number of wounds at once, but\nonce a wound has been treated it cannot be treated\nagain. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal\nover time when you take long rests. See the Rests &\nHealing section for more details.\n```\n\n```\nZero Hit Points\nWhen your hit points reach zero, you are in bad\ncondition.

Your\nmultiplier starts at one, though you may remove\nlevels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it.\nTo increase the multiplier by one, you must sacrifice\na number of levels of advantage equal to the current\nlevel of the multiplier. So to increase the multiplier\nto two, you would have to spend one level of\nadvantage. To then increase it to three, you would\nspend two levels of advantage, and so on.\nFinally, make your attack roll.

As with abilities gained from your class,\npassive abilities can be used whenever and at no\ncost, and major abilities can be used once per day.\nHeart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only\nafter you have taken a short or long rest, or if you\ntake a wound.\nAdditionally, talents may also have the _instant_ or\n_full action_ tag. If it is _instant_ , then you can use the\nability at literally any time, even right before you\nroll. If it has the _full action_ tag, it requires you to use\nyour action.\n\nTy p e s o f Ta l e n t s\n\nSeveral varieties of talents exist, indicated by\ntheir tags. Each require different conditions to be met\nin order to gain that talent.\n\nCognitive and Martial Talents\n\nMartial talents are those that require physical\nprowess and training. They represent the cumulation\nof extensive practice and training. There are no\nprerequisites for taking a martial talent.\nCognitive talents, like martial talents, come from\nvigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no\nprerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.\n\n```\nGaeic Melodies\nGaeic melodies are fragments of song that\nreverberate throughout all living things\u2014left over\nfrom when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world\ninto life.\nGaeic melodies are magical, and listening to\nthem have magical effects. However, they cannot be\ndiscovered innately, and require a teacher or a\nsongbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or\nhigher aspect in musical talents in order to play\nthem.\nWhen playing a gaeic melody, it requires your\naction to play the instrument. You can move up to\nhalf your move speed while playing, but cannot\nmove more than that. You cannot play more than one\ngaeic melody at the same time.\n```\n\n```\nHandmagic\nHandmagic uses the power of Deoric to create\ntheir effects. Deoric is the language of truth\u2014where\nwords spoken in it simply come true.\nHandmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the\nback of one\u2019s hand, inscribed in the blood of magical\ncreatures to power this life-cost.

The knowledge and necessary\nmaterials to inscribe hand runes is rare and\nexpensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely\nrequire you to be in a city.\n\nCombat Talents\n\nThe talents in this section are combat-related\ntalents.

Martial talent._\nYou have learned the art of debilitating your foes\nand killing them silently. When you enter an\nengagement with a humanoid, you may immediately\nmake a might or agility check against their agility\nchallenge number. On a success, you either gag\nthem, garrote them, or in some other way remove\ntheir ability to speak or shout out. They cannot\n\n```\nproduce sound for the next minute.

Instant. Martial talent.\nIf you and another ally are opposite to each other\nwith an enemy directly between you (you can draw a\nline from a single corner of your space to every\ncorner of the ally\u2019s space such that the line passes\ncompletely through the enemy\u2019s space), and the\nenemy has used its action to enter an engagement\nwith your ally this round, you may treat your weapon\nas using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against\nthat enemy until end of the round.

A creature is considered\nbehind you if at least one straight line can be drawn\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Its basis is in one of attunement.\nBy understanding a fundamental element completely,\nand having a primal bond with that thing, one can\ndevelop power to control that element. As that bond\nand understanding grows, one\u2019s power over that\nelement grows.\nThere are nine fundamental elements: earth, air,\nfire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With\nthese elements, nearly everything is created.\nBy attuning to different elements, you have some\nbasic power over those elements. There are three\ndifferent levels of attunement for each element\u2014\neach of which grant you increasing abilities.\nHowever, attuning to an element is difficult.\nMost people never attune to any elements in their life\ntimes, and your spirit must be able to handle the\nadditional pressure of resonating with the your\nattuned element. Those who do will frequently do so\nby accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to\none of these such elements. More advanced\nattunements require even more exposure, and\nparagon level attunements generally require special\nactivity dedicated to developing an attunement to\nthat element.\nKethic also comes with limitations. Every living\nthing has some very low level attunement with all\nthe elements, and for this reason, it is nearly\nimpossible for another creature to interfere with\nelements especially close to another living being,\nsuch as its blood or flesh.\n\nResonate\n\nSubstances\n\n```\nOne of the primary forms of elemental\nmanipulation is through attunement to resonate\nsubstances. These are the collection of materials that\nyou have control over. Different types of substances\nhave different rules dictating your affinity to them at\ndifferent levels, however. For example, a master of\nearth still won't be able to create as much stone as an\nequally skilled master of air can create breathable air\n\u2014the solid stone is just fundamentally more difficult\nto work with.\nThe limitations to your control over different\ntypes of substances is listed in the following\nsections. There are three different categories of\nsubstances: solids, liquids, and gasses.\n```\n\nSolids\n\n```\nManipulation\nYou can physically manipulate the shape and\nform of the substance with your hands as though it\nwas clay. It is about as fast as literally shaping\nsomething out of clay.\nAdvanced Attunement\nThe range of your manipulation increases to\nsubstances within 15 feet. You do not have to\nphysically touch the material to shape it. Even\nthough your hands are not touching the material,\n```\n\ntheir movements control the manipulation as though\nthe solid was in your hands.\n\nPar ag on At t u n e m e n t\nThe range of your manipulation increases to\nsubstances within 45 feet.\n\nSensing\n\nYou can sense the direction and approximate\nshape and size of the substance within 15 feet, even\nif you can\u2019t see them. Your approximations are in 5-\nfoot cube increments.\n\nAdvanced Attunement\nThe range of your sensing increases to 45 feet.\nFor substances that you can hold in your hands, you\ncan sense precise details as though your were\nlooking through it.\n\n```\nPar ag on At t u n e m e n t\nThe range of your sensing increases to 120 feet.\n```\n\nCreation & Destruction\n\nAs an action, you can create or destroy up to a 1-\nfoot cube of the substance in your hands. If digging a\npassage way in this way, you can burrow a humanoid\nsized hole a rate of 1 foot per minute. When creating\nthis solid, it is created in shapeless, 1-foot cubes, and\nrequire further action to shape them further.\n\nAdvanced Attunement\nYou can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in\nyour hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of\n2 feet per minute.\n\nPar ag on At t u n e m e n t\nYou can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in\nyour hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of\n5 feet per minute.\n\nLi q u i d s\n\n```\nManipulation\nAs an action, you can crudely manipulate the\nflow of the substance in a 15 foot range around you,\nsuch as creating eddies or a current in one direction\nor another. Currents you create can be up to 2 miles\nper hour. Additionally, you can hold up to a 1-foot\ncube of it in your hands without a container.\nAdvanced Attunement\nThe range of your manipulation increases to\nsubstances within 45 feet. You can cause currents of\nup to 4 miles per hour.\nPar ag on At t u n e m e n t\nThe range of your manipulation increases to\nsubstances within 120 feet.

Many of the other elements\nhave physical aspects or obvious connections to\nsources of damage, but light and dark do not.\nYou\u2019ll notice in the spell sections that spells\nwith the light and dark tags only deal damage\nwhen they\u2019re paired with another element.\n```\n\nAdvanced Attunement\n\n- The range of your darkvision increases by 30\n  feet.\n- The range at which you can create darkness\n  increases by 30 feet.\n\nPar ag on At t u n e m e n t\n\n- Other creatures with darkvision cannot see\n  through darkness you create.\n- The range at which you can create darkness\n  increases by 60 feet.\n\nForce\n\nBasic Attunement\n\n- As an action, you can apply up to 10 pounds of\n  force to any non-living object within 90 feet. You\n  can manipulate fine objects, so long as they only\n  require one, linear force applied to them.\n\nAdvanced Attunement\n\n- The force you can apply increases to a\n  maximum of 20 pounds.\n- You may divide this force between up to three\n  different objects.\n- You can manipulate fine objects that would not\n  otherwise require a skill check to manipulate, and\n  can apply rotational force.\n\nPar ag on At t u n e m e n t\n\n- You may divide this force between any number\n  of different objects.\n- You may manipulate objects that would require\n  a skill check to use. You cannot wield a weapon\n  using this force.\n\nSpellcasting\n\nGaining Spells\n\nLearning a spell represents mastery over some\naspect of one\u2019s connection with an element, allowing\nthe user to perform some fantastical feat. Anyone\nwith an attunement can learn to cast a spell.\nBy spending XP, as described in the Gaining and\nSpending XP section, one can gain a new spell,\nchosen from the list of spells in the Spells section.\nYou must have at least a basic attunement to all of\nthe elements in the tags listed below each spell in\norder to learn that spell.\n\nCasting Spells\n\nCasting a spell is more difficult than simple\nelemental manipulation performed with just an\nattunement, as it requires more precise control for a\nlonger duration. Performing a powerful act of\nelemental control while in the thick of a fight takes\nskill and practice, and comes with the following\nrestrictions:\n\n- Casting a spell requires your action.\n- You may cast only one spell per round.\n- Casting a spell requires at least one free hand\n- If casting a spell, you cannot have moved more\n  than half your movement speed (after accounting\n  for armor and other penalties), rounded up.\n- After casting the spell, you cannot move more\n  than half your movement speed (after accounting\n  for armor and other penalties).\n  Casting spells is strenuous, and takes a toll on\n  your body, and without proper preparation, can\n  wreak havoc on your ability to channel your\n  attunement in that way again for a while. You must\n  wait four long rests before casting that spell again,\n  though that time may vary as per the following rules:\n- Subtract one long rest for each consecutive\n  round taken before this action spent unmoving,\n  taking no actions and using no abilities, and not\n  communicating (in complete, meditative\n  concentration).\n- Subtract one long rest if you have an advanced\n  attunement with the elemental type of the spell you\n  are casting.\n- Subtract two long rests if you instead have a\n  paragon attunement with the elemental type of the\n  spell you are casting.\n  If the total number of long rests would be\n  reduced to zero, you must still wait at least one short\n  rest before casting the spell again.\n\n```\nSpellcasting Ability\nWhenever a creature has to make a saving throw\nagainst your spellcasting ability, it must make a\ncheck against the maximum of your current heart\ndie, plus two times your paragon level.\n```\n\nSpells\n\n```\nSpells are listed by their name, along with two\ntags\u2014their required attunements, and if they are\nongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a\nsingle attunement as prerequisite for casting the\nspell, but some have two or more. If the spell is\nimmediate, the spell effect occurs once when the\nspell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell\u2019s effects\ncontinue for up to one minute, or when the spell\ncaster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.\n```\n\n```\nAu r a of I g n i t ion\nFire.

These conversions use the\nfollowing rules.\nConversions happen at a rate equal to twice the\ncreation rate of whatever substance you are turning it\ninto, and at a range equal to the corresponding\nmanipulation range.\nFor example, with an advanced attunement to a\nsolid, you can create a 1.5-foot cube as an action. If\nyou are instead turning a liquid into a solid, you can\ncreate a 2-foot cube of solid as an action, and you\ncan do it at a range of 15 feet.\nIf you instead were converting that solid into a\nliquid at an advanced level, you would have the\nsame increase in volume, but would instead be able\nto do it at a range of 45 feet, since that is the\nadvanced liquid manipulation range.\n\nTr a pp i n g a C r e a t u r e\n\nIf you try to convert the substance a creature is\nstanding in into a solid, it is usually slow enough that\nthe creature can escape becoming trapped, unless it\nalready cannot move.\n\nThe Ele me n t s\n\nThere are nine different elements\u2014fire, air,\nwater, earth, light, dark, force, void, and time. When\nyou have a level of attunement with an element, you\ngain all of its benefits, as well as the benefits from\nevery level before it. Gaining attunements to\nelements is also one of the primary ways to gain\nattunements to resonate substances. You can gain an\n\n```\nelemental attunement with the Elemental Affinity\ntalent, found in the Talents section.\n```\n\nFire\n\n```\nBasic Attunement\n```\n\n- As an action, you can ignite or put out small\n  flames within 5 feet without touching them.\n- You can sense any fire within 45 feet,\n  including how much, its general direction, and\n  intensity.\n- You take half damage from the burning\n  condition.\n\n```\nAdvanced Attunement\n```\n\n- Add ash to your resonate substances as a basic,\n  solid attunement.\n- Add smoke to your resonate substances as a\n  basic, gaseous substance attunement.

Different poisons have different\nproperties and means of application. Some may\nparalyze you, but only if ingested, while other may\nkill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream,\nbut are otherwise harmless if swallowed. Some are\nlong lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to\nweapons and maintain potency for minutes to days,\nwhile others can\u2019t be applied to weapons at all.\nWhile most poisons will have specific rulings\napplied to them individually, some general poisoning\nrules apply to most of them.\nDue to the difficulty of properly applying poison,\npoison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.\nEach application of the poison uses up one dose of\nthat poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with\npoison applied to it uses up the poison. Most poisons\ncan be applied to weapons prior to combat. The\nlength that the poison remains potent on the weapon\nwill vary from poison to poison, after which the\npoison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in\norder to still garner the same effects. Damage from\npoison happens after the weapon attack\u2014it is not\nrolled with the attack dice.\n\nExperience\n\n```\nOver the course of many games, you will gain\nmore and more XP. With this XP, you can purchase\nnew, interesting features for your character.\n```\n\n```\nGaining Experience\nIt is up to the GM to deliver XP to players. They\ncan decide what they want to award XP for,\ndepending on the type of game they want to run.\nCommon triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing\ngoals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning\ncombats, or just length of session. Whatever the\nmetric for determining XP, the GM should\ncommunicate this to the players.\n```\n\n```\nSpending Experience\nBetween sessions, or during sessions so long as\nyou are not in combat, you may spend XP to access\nnew features. Use the following chart to find the cost\nof your desired new feature.\nExperience Options\nTy p e XP Cost Effect\nLe v e l i n g\nNew Aspect 1 Add a new aspect at rank 1.\nIncrease Aspect X+1, Where X is the aspect\u2019s\ncurrent level\n```\n\n```\nIncrease the rank of an aspect by 1.\n```\n\n```\nChange Aspect 0 Replace the text of your aspect with different text.\n```\n\n```\nGM Note\nGranting XP equal to players\u2019 combat rank is\na decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading\ntheir character every few sessions. If you want\nslightly more aggressive growth, increasing this\nby one, or even two can be okay.\n```\n\nNew Aspect\n\nCreating a new aspect means writing down\nanother word or phrase describing your character.\nThe aspect starts at rank one.\n\nIncrease Aspect\n\nIncrease the rank of one your aspects by one.\nAspects cannot have a rank greater than five.\n\nChange Aspect\n\nYou may replace your aspect with a brand new\naspect, if you believe your character development\nwarrants it. The aspect remains at the same rank, but\nyou may change the description.\n\nIncrease Maximum Hit Points\n\n```\nIncrease your maximum hit points by 10.\n```\n\nIncrease Ability Die\n\nIncrease an ability die by one size. Ability die\nsize increases in the order d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12\n\n> d20. Each increase costs XP equal to the size of the\n> new die, so an increase from d8 to d10 would cost\n\n10. You cannot increase your heart die in this way.\n\n```\nNew Combat/Non-Combat Talent\nChoose and mark down a new talent from the\ncombat or non-combat talent list. If it is a cognitive\nor martial talent, you immediately gain it. Otherwise,\nsee the Talent section for details on the prerequisites\nfor picking up that talent.\n```\n\n```\nDestiny Level\nChoose one of your talents. You gain its destiny\nlevel. Any prerequisites for the original talent are\nalso necessary to gain the destiny level.\n```\n\n```\nNew Spell\nChoose a spell from the spell list. At least one\nelement will be listed as a tag. If you have a basic\nattunement or better to all of the listed elements, you\nlearn the spell. Note that spells are cheaper if you are\nspelltouched.\n```\n\n```\nIncreasing Heart Die\nAs you gain XP, your experience and the strength\nof your spirit reaches critical levels at which your\nmaximum heart die is automatically increased.\n```\n\n```\nIncrease Maximum\nHit Points\n```\n\n```\nX/10 + 1, where X is your\ncurrent hit point maximum\n```\n\n```\nIncrease your maximum hit points by 10\n```\n\n```\nIncrease Ability Die X, where X is the next die size Increase an ability die by 1 size, to a maximum of a\nd12.\nNew Combat Talent X+3 where X is the number of\ncombat talents you already have\n```\n\n```\nGain a new combat talent.

If you are\nin combat, this requires your action. Helping grants\nthe person making the check advantage, so long as\nyou reasonably could provide help in that situation.\nIf you help someone, you are both liable to suffer\nany consequences from any complications or\nfailures.\n\nGroup Rolls\n\nSometimes, everyone in a group will need to\nmake the same check, or will want to help on the\nsame check. For example, working together to break\ndown a door, sneaking past some guards, or\npersuading a judge could all be group rolls. Rolls are\ncalculated differently, depending on the exact type of\ntask.\nIf everyone is making a check where the group is\nonly as strong as the weakest link, such as sneaking\npast guards as a group, only one person rolls. Find\nthe person in the group who is the worst at making\nthis roll, and they make the roll for the group with\nadvantage. It is assumed that everyone else will\n\n```\nsucceed, but if this person fails, everyone else may\nfail as well.\nHowever, if it is a task where people work\ntogether, such as when everyone works together to\nconvince someone of the truth, then only the person\nbest at the task has to roll, and they may roll with\nadvantage.\n```\n\nUsing Abilities\n\n```\nWhen creating your character, you will inevitably\ngain a lot of abilities. Abilities are any chunk of rules\nthat let you create an affect, perform some activity,\nor do anything at all. Examples include class\nabilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels,\nthough some abilities grant you their own abilities.\nYou can most easily recognize an ability because\nof the format it has in this book:\n```\n\n```\nAbility Name\nAbility tags.\nRules text describing what the ability lets you do.\n```\n\n```\nAll abilities listed in this rulebook have their\nname, followed by tags, and then followed by their\nrules. For the most part, abilities can be used\nwhenever you want. However, some have\nrestrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very\nspecific, in the ability rules itself.\nAll tags in an ability are separated by periods.\nEach tag will contain information about when you\ncan use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for\ngaining that ability. While many tags will be\nexplained by whichever section they appear in, there\nare a few types which can show up on any type of\nability. These are listed below.\n```\n\n```\nExample\nYou are trying to lift a heavy portcullis. Due\nto various elements at play, you have three\nsources of advantage, and one source of\ndisadvantage. Your might die is a d6, and your\nheart die is a d8. When you make the roll, you\nwould roll with 2 levels of advantage\u20141d8 and\n3d6. Lets say you get an 3, 6, 5, and 1,\nrespectively. The final result would be 11 (6 + 5).\n```\n\nFrequency Tags\n\nThe frequency of an ability determines how often\nit can be used. An ability can be either, _passive_ ,\n_minor_ , _heart_ , _major_ , _weekly_ , or _monthly_. This tag is\nalways listed as the first tag.\n\nPas s i v e A b i l i t y\n\nThere are no restrictions on how many times you\ncan use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability,\nit is assumed to always be active.\n\nMinor Ability\n\nYou may use this ability by spending a rush point\nfor each time you have used this ability including\nthis one during the current encounter. You may not\nuse it outside of an encounter.\n\nHeart Abilit y\n\nYou may use this ability once per long rest. If\nyou take a wound, you may use the ability again.\n\nMajor Ability\n\n```\nYou may use this ability once per long rest.\n```\n\nWeekly Abilit y\n\n```\nYou may use this ability once per week.\n```\n\nMonthly Ability\n\n```\nYou may use this ability once per month.\n```\n\nTi m ing Tag\n\nOutside of combat, you can use an ability\nwhenever you want\u2014there are no restrictions\nbesides the ones listed on the ability itself. However,\nduring combat, you must have priority to use your\nabilities. Priority is described in detail in the Combat\nsection. However, the _instant_ tag is an exception to\n\n```\nthat rule. Abilities that don\u2019t have the instant tag are\nreferred to as \u201cpriority abilities\u201d.\n```\n\n```\nInstant\nIf an ability is marked as instant, it means that\nthe ability can be used literally any time, even when\nyou don't have priority. While another creature is\nusing an ability, while you roll dice for an attack\u2014\nliterally any time, so long as the ability doesn\u2019t have\nany further explicit instructions on when it can be\nused.\nIf multiple creatures want to use an instant\nability, whoever declared their use last goes first.\nYou must declare the way in which you are using\nyour ability when you announce that you are using\nan ability.\n```\n\n```\naction Tag\nDuring each round of combat, you only have one\naction. By default, abilities don\u2019t use your action\nunless they have the full action tag.\nIf an ability is marked as full action , it means that\nthe ability uses your action. If you don't have an\naction left during this round, you cannot use the\nability.\n```\n\nOther Rules\n\n```\nForced Movement\nIf you are ever pushed or forced to move, and\nthis movement is interrupted by a wall, another\ncreature that is within two sizes of your own, or a\nheavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you\nimmediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for\nevery 5 feet remaining in your movement. If this\nmovement is stopped by a creature that is not\nwielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

From\nsmallest to largest, they are: minuscule, tiny, small,\nmedium, large, and then L2, L3, L4, and so on.\nDifferent sizes come with different bonuses and\npenalties, especially in combat.\nUp to a thousand minuscule creatures can fit into\na single space, ten tiny creatures can fit on one\nspace; five small creatures can fit on one space; one\nmedium or large creature on one space; and creatures\nof sizes L2 and greater take up a number of spaces\nequal to the square of their level. For example, an L\ncreature would take up four spaces (2x2 spaces), and\nan L5 creature would take up twenty-five spaces\n(5x5 spaces).\n\nAt tacking\n\nWhenever an attacking creature uses the might\nstance to push a defending creature of a different\nsize, the defending creature may move more or less\nthan the default of 10 feet. If the defending creature\nis smaller than the attacker, the defending creature\nmoves an additional 5 feet for each level of size\ndifference. If the defending creature is larger than the\nattacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet\nfor each level of size difference. This could mean\nthat the defending creature is not pushed at all.\n\nMovement and Spaces\n\nOne creature can occupy and move through the\nspace of another creature if it is at least two sizes\nsmaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain.\nWhile in the same space as a non-hostile creature,\nyou also have one level of cover.\n\n```\nWeapons\nCreatures of size small or tiny cannot wield\nheavy weapons. Creatures of size tiny cannot wield\nheavy or light weapons.\n```\n\n```\nLi g h t i n g\nThere are three different states of lighting that\ncan occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and\ndark.\nDaylight, the immediate area around a lantern,\nand intense fire all produce bright light. There are no\npenalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit\narea.\nDim light can be found in alleyways, twilight,\nand in all the spaces between bright light and\ndarkness. Perception and observation skill checks are\nmade with disadvantage for creatures that require\nlight to see.\nDarkness is anywhere there is no light. Unless\nyou have darkvision, you cannot see anything.\n```\n\n```\nDarkvision\nSome creatures have darkvision. A creature with\ndarkvision can see in dim light as though it were\nbright light, and can see in darkness as though it\nwere dim light.\n```\n\n```\nHiding\nIf the environment provides suitable places to\nhide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may\nchoose to hide. This requires more than a single\naction, and cannot be performed during combat.\nWhen you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill\ncheck. On a success you are hidden, and count as\nunseen for the purposes of attacking.\nWhile hidden, you may use your action to make\nan opportunity attack against a creature you are\nhidden from. You may still be obscured after you\n```\n\nattack, but you do not count as hidden and you\ncannot make opportunity attacks.\nAll hidden creatures that wish to make\nopportunity attacks may use their action to attack\nbefore combat begins.\n\nTe r r ain\n\nAs you adventure, you will encounter numerous\nenvironments that all pose their own unique\nchallenges.\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\nDifficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently\nhard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy\nfoliage. While in difficult terrain, after accounting\nfor other movement penalties, your remaining\nmovement speed is halved.\n\nWat e r\n\nDoing anything while in or under water comes\nwith severe limitations. While shallow water counts\nonly as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that\nyou move at your swim speed. Unless you explicitly\nhave a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.\nIf you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all\nA/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement. If\nyou cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have\nD5 on all of those rolls instead. Ranged weapons\ntravel half their distance when fired underwater.\n\nVertical Surfaces\n\nWhen climbing, you may be required to make a\nmight check to determine if you can climb at all. On\na success, you can climb at your climb speed, which\nunless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.\n\n```\nSources of Dam age\nThere are several other sources of damage\nbesides combat. Some of the more common ones are\nlisted below.\n```\n\n```\nCombat\nCombat is one of the most common ways to lose\nhealth. Check out the Combat section to learn more.\n```\n\n```\nHazards & Traps\nThere will be times when you have to avoid\ndamage from the environment. For example, being\nhit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or\ngetting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship. In\nthese cases, you should make a saving throw,\ndetailed in the Saving Throws section. On a failure,\nyou will take damage.\n```\n\n```\nFalling\nWhen falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility\nsaving throw against the height fallen. If you roll less\nthan the distance fallen, you take the difference as\ndamage.\n```\n\n```\nSuffocation and Strangulation\nThere are different effects on one\u2019s body\ndepending if you are holding your breath, or getting\nstrangled or suffocated by something else.\nWhen holding your breath, make a might check.\nYou can hold your breath a number of rounds equal\nto your result. Subtract one from the total number of\nrounds whenever you take an action or move while\nholding your breath. After you run out of breath, you\ntake the suffocating condition.\nIf you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were\nsuddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin\nsuffocating immediately.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

Note that players can eventually reach\nup to d12+d20+10, and that this chart does not account for\ncomplications.\n```\n\n```\nExample\nYou are trying to climb around the edge of the\nking\u2019s tower without falling to your death. You\nhave to make a skill check and roll a 1 and a 5.\nYou really don\u2019t want to fall, so you accept a\ncomplication and re-roll the 1, getting a 4 instead.\nThe 9 is apparently high enough and you succeed\nat climbing around the tower, but the GM\nannounces that in a near fall, you accidentally\nknock a stone down, alerting the guards below.\n```\n\nuse the total result after re-rolling your dice to\ndetermine that. Instead, something related to the task\nat hand but not determinate of your success or failure\ngoes wrong. This can be many things, such as\nbreaking your lock picks if you were trying to open a\ndoor, or sparking a new line of interrogation if you\nwere trying to smooth talk your way past guards.\nIf you roll additional 1s they do not cause\ncomplications.\nIf you roll two 1s as your first roll, you fail the\ncheck, and there is a complication.\n\nRaising the Stakes\n\nWhenever you or another player makes a skill\ncheck, but before the dice are rolled, you may choose\nto raise the stakes. When you raise the stakes, you\nincrease the effectiveness of a success, and the\nincrease how disastrous the complication or failure is\non a fail. You may do this once once per session, on\nany roll that any player makes.\n\nSaving Throws\n\nWhenever you have to roll to avoid or mitigate\nthe effects of someone else\u2019s action, such as dodging\na falling boulder, or withstanding a powerful venom,\nmake a saving throw. Saving throws are identical to\nskill checks, except they do not provoke\ncomplications. Instead, rolling equal to or over the\nchallenge number implies you avoid the negative\neffect, and rolling under implies suffering the\nnegative effect.\nWhen the effect was created by another creature,\nthey are usually made against that creature\u2019s ability\nchallenge number. If it was an effect from the\nenvironment, the CN will be determined by the GM.\n\nAbility Challenge Number\n\nWhen another creature is avoiding an effect that\nyou have caused, the GM may have them roll a\n\n```\nsaving throw. The CN for this roll is equal to the\nmaximum of your most applicable ability die, plus\ntwo times your paragon level (which starts at zero).\nThis number is generically called your ability\nchallenge number, though more specifically, you\nwould have might, agility, cunning, presence, and\neven heart challenge numbers. Use whichever ability\nis most relevant for the roll, or if no ability die fits\u2014\nsuch as the case with magical effects\u2014use your heart\nchallenge number\u2014the maximum of your heart die\ninstead.\n```\n\n```\nAt tack & Defense Rolls\nAttack and defense rolls, or A/D rolls, are made\nwhenever your roll to deal or negate damage in an\nengagement or opportunity attack. Roll the relevant\nability die, your heart die, and add any necessary\nmodifiers. A/D rolls are explained in greater detail in\nthe Combat chapter.\n```\n\n```\nAdvantage & Disadvantage\nAdvantage and disadvantage give you bonuses or\npenalties to a roll. For each instance of advantage\nyou have on a roll, roll an additional instance of the\nlowest of the dice, and then remove the lowest result\nwhen calculating the total. When rolling with\ndisadvantage, instead roll an additional instance of\nthe highest of the dice, and then remove the highest\nresult from the dice you rolled. Advantage and\ndisadvantage cancel out, and multiple instances of\neither one can stack.\nMultiple levels of advantage or disadvantage are\nreferred to as Ax or Dx, where 'x' indicates the\nnumber of instances. When determining the outcome\nwith advantage or disadvantage, treat the final result\nas if only the dice that were kept were rolled.

In these cases, you are assumed\nto reach your destination in the appropriate amount\nof time and the game can continue at the new\nlocation.\nHowever, in cases where travel is a major focal\npoint of gameplay, the rest of this section describes\nthe rules for travel.\n\nTr av e l B a s i cs\n\nThe first step in beginning a journey is figuring\nout how long it will take. You can calculate this by\nusing your daily travel speed. The GM should then\nsegment the journey, and add events, which will be\nexplained later in this section.\n\nTravel Speed\n\nYour travel speed is calculated based off your\nmovement speed. The following sections describe\nhow far you can travel in different terrain. These\ndistances represent miles of progress towards your\ndestination, not absolute distance traveled.\nWhen you begin, the GM should calculate how\nlong it will take reach your destination, assuming\neverything goes well.\n\nOn Foot\n\nIf you are on a path on flat ground, you can cover\n24 miles per day. In difficult terrain, such as swamps,\n\n```\njungles, and mountains (as determined by the GM),\nthis distance is halved. If you are not on a path, this\nmovement speed is also halved.\n```\n\n```\nOn a Vehicle\nIf you are on horseback, in a carriage, or\ntraveling via some other land-vehicle, use the\nvehicle\u2019s daily travel speed rather than your own.\nHorses and carriages have the same movement speed\nas humans for the purposes of calculating daily\ntravel speeds, but they will have greater carrying\ncapacity and will not be penalized by your own\nmovement penalties, such as those from armor.\n```\n\n```\nSegmenting the Journe y\nOn long trips through varied terrain, the GM\nshould segment the journey into different distinct\nsections, broken at each major change in terrain. For\nexample, if the the trip is through the mountains and\ninto the forests beyond, there may be a segment of\nmountain travel and a segment of forest travel. Most\ntrips do not need multiple segments.\nWhen segmenting trips, the GM should calculate\nhow long each segment should take based off the\ndistance and travel speed in that segment of the\njourney.\n```\n\n```\nEvents\nBesides survival, these are what make a journey\ninto an adventure. Events can include things such as\nfalling avalanches, bandits attacking, tombs being\ndiscovered, and just about anything else you can\nimagine creating a situation where danger or further\ninvestigation might be warranted.\n```\n\nThe GM should add between one and five events\nto most journeys, sticking with lower numbers on\nshorter journeys or longer, safer ones, and higher\nnumbers for longer, more dangerous journeys. If\nthere are multiple segments in the trip, it\u2019s usually a\ngood idea to add at least one event per segment.\n\nMaking the\n\nJourney\n\nWhen you actually leave for the journey, for each\nsegment, the GM should determine if any of the\nfollowing survival challenges are necessary to the\nwellbeing of the players during the segment, and\ncouldn\u2019t be reasonably prepared for or already\naccounted for:\n\n- Keep Watch\n- Navigate - Collect Water - Gather Food - Find Shelter\n  If you are bringing enough food and water for the\n  duration of the segment, for example, the GM should\n  not include _Gather Food_ or _Collect Water_. The tasks\n  the GM deems as necessary will each require one or\n  more successful skill checks in order to avoid\n  turning into a bigger problem for you and your party.\n  You or someone else from the party must make a\n  skill check for each of these needs, using the\n  challenge number from the table below. The same\n  person can make multiple skill checks, but they get\n  disadvantage on each skill checks they make for\n  every additional skill check they have to make.\n  Conversely, anyone not making a skill check can\n  grant advantage to exactly one skill check being\n  made by another player.\n\n```\nJourney Skill Check Challenge Numbers\nTe r r ain Keep Watch Navigate Collect\nWat e r\n```\n\n```\nGather\nFood\n```\n\n```\nFind\nShelter\nArctic 7 10 5 12 8\nCoast 8 4 6 6 5\nCanyons 10 8 7 7 5\nDesert 5 9 13 12 10\nForest 11 9 5 5 8\nGrassland 5 6 6 6 7\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

This way, if players\nget stuck in a challenge phase at some point and\ndecide to tough it out till the end, you know how\nmany days it will take. It also means you can\ncalculate how many long rests they have between\nevents, so they can heal an appropriate amount.\n```\n\nhorse for food, you would not need to make a skill\ncheck to gather food for a few days.\n\nDaily Consequences\n\nFailing any of these skill checks results in the\nsame consequences as normal, though they occur\nimmediately, and do not trigger new challenge\nphases\u2014you just remain in the existing one.\nWhile in the challenge phase, it is possible you\nwill spend time going hungry or thirsty, without\nsleep, or too hot or cold. Each has their own\nconsequences as outlined in the Basic Needs section.\n\nEnding the Challenge Phase\n\nIf you start a day after succeeding at every\nrequired skill check the day before, you are capable\nof traveling, and there are no obvious threats to your\nimmediate safety, the challenge phase ends and you\nresume the travel phase. The GM may continue the\nmontage of travel.\nAlternatively, if the GM rules that you\u2019ve gone\nenough distance to reach your destination, the\njourney ends.\n\nEvent Phase\n\nEvents represent highlights and notable moments\nfrom a journey (in addition to any struggles faced\nduring challenge phases). They can take a wide\nvariety of forms, some good, some bad, and they\nshould be introduced as an interruption to travel. For\nexample, the GM might describe rounding a hill after\ndays of travel and seeing the colossal ruins of a\ndestroyed dwarven fortress on the mountainside. The\nplayers can now investigate the fortress in normal\ngame-time.\nOnce players are finished with an event, are no\nlonger threatened by it, and have chosen to move on,\n\n```\nthe event phase ends and the next travel phase\nbegins.\n```\n\n```\nPac k A n i m al s\nIf you are traveling light, you may be able to\n```\n\n```\ncarry all of the necessary gear you need on your\nback. However, on longer trips you will likely want a\npack animal, especially if you want to bring all your\nfood with you. See the Equipment & Gear section\nfor rules on carrying capacity and a list of common\nequipment.\n```\n\nJourney Modes\n\n```\nWhen traveling long distances, there are two\nmodes of gameplay: travel mode, and action mode.\nIn travel mode, time passes quickly, and the GM\nshould describe the activities of the party like a\nmontage. You are welcome to chime in to describe\nwhat you are doing as you travel, but this gameplay\noccurs at macro pace. The GM may describe the\nhighlights of the journey, small oddities you may\nhave noticed along the trail, but nothing that out of\nthe ordinary.\nThe second mode of travel is action mode. In\naction mode, play returns to micro pace\u2014you're\nback to deciding what you want to do, moment to\nmoment, scene by scene.\nDuring a journey, most of the distance traveled\nwill likely occur in travel mode. However, when\n```\n\n```\nGM Note\nFor advice on how to make and run\ninteresting events, see the Travel Events section.\n```\n\nsurvival becomes a challenge, or notable incidents\noccur, the journey will switch to action mode and\nyou and your party will have to figure out how to\ndeal with it. Once you have dealt with whatever\ncame up, along with whatever other fallout came of\nit, you may return to travel mode and continue along\nyour journey.\n\nGM breaks trip into segments of terrain. Each\nsegment requires X successful travel checks to get\nthrough uneventfully, and is Y days of travel long.\nGm should also make Z number of events to put in\nthroughout the journey.\n\n```\nRoll each check, as necessary.\n```\n\nAs you get to different places along the journey,\nif you had been in travel mode it triggers a re-roll.\nAll failures occur simultaneously.\n\nWhen you fail roll, GM chooses which one\nactually causes the journey to grind to a halt. The\nrest of the failures just impose disadvantage on the\nnext check to that roll.\n\n```\nEach travel segment should have a chance of\n```\n\nSplit trip into segments of terrain. Each terrain\nsegment has its own travel mode roll. GM should\nsprinkle those failures in wherever they see fit while\nplayers are in that section. Once action mode has\nbegun, the GM can spend those failures on failures\nduring action mode.\n\nWhen in action mode, the check to hunt is much\nmore interactive. Roll to find animals, roll to kkill\n\n```\nthem, the animals you find are random duration\nworth of food. Other people can help for advantage.\nCollecting water failure means you have to keep\ntraveling into the night to find some.\nShelter failure means you need to keep traveling,\nor not sleep or find a more dangerous place to spend\nthe night.\nNavigation failure means you make no progress\nand have a chance to hit a new encounter. Can make\none in the day.\nWhen action mode begins, have days of food\nequal to surplus on food finding roll. Roll 1 higher,\nand you have one extra day of food. All canteens are\nfull.\nCan resume travel mode once more than half of\nthe party has finished a successful long rest.\n```\n\n```\n1.Segment trip as necessary between different\nterrains, if present. Many trips will have just one\nterrain and tehrefore just one segment.\n2.Approximate length of each segment in miles\nand time\n3.Add X events to the trip. They can come up\nwhenever, though at least one per terrain is good\nidea.\n4.May Y rolls for each necessity for each\nsegment, in order. If the segment requires 4 rolls,\nthen the first roll represents the first quarter of the\ndistance traveled.\n5.Whenever a roll is failed, things go to shit\nimmediately.

If the players are traveling\nthrough farmland, just use the travel phase as a\nbrief montage opportunity before having an event\nphase.\nGM Note\nCheck out the Journey chapter in the GM\nsection of this book. There\u2019s lots of advice on\nhow to come up with interesting events and\nadvice on when to use them.\n```\n\nTo t a l S u c c e s s\n\nOn succeeding at every skill check, the journey\nprogresses to the event phase. No challenge phases\nare triggered.\n\nSkill Check Failure\n\nIf a skill check is failed, players can face\nconsequences. Each skill check has its own\nconsequences for failure. If multiple skill checks are\nfailed, the GM may choose to resolve them in\nwhichever order they wish.\n\nSkill Check Consequences\n\nEach travel phase skill check has it\u2019s own\nconsequences for failure.\n\nKeep Watch\n\nSucceeding on this skill check represents keeping\na watchful eye on your surroundings throughout the\ntravel phase. When you successfully keep watch,\nwhen an event occurs, you and the party see any\nthreats present before they see you.\nOn a failure, any people or creatures from an\nevent surprise you.\n\n```\nNavigate\nSucceeding on this skill check represents\nconsistently staying on track towards your\ndestination.\nOn a failure, the party fails to make progress\ntowards the destination and the party enters an event\nphase. This event does not count towards the total\nnumber of events for the journey.\n```\n\n```\nGather Food\nSucceeding on this skill check represents\nconsistently fishing, hunting, or foraging\nsuccessfully enough to keep everyone fed during the\ntravel phase.\nOn a failure to gather food, the travel phase ends\nand a challenge phase begins. Until you can get food,\nyou cannot resume the travel phase. You may have to\neat pack animals, consume unidentified plants, hunt\nmore dangerous creatures, or simply go hungry until\nfood becomes available again.\nWhen the challenge phase triggered by this\nfailure ends, if the GM rules that food is still an issue\nfor the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill\ncheck for the travel phase.\n```\n\n```\nHellscape 8 8 16 14 10\nJungle 12 13 5 4 11\nOpen Water 4 10 15* 8 Impossible\nSprawling City 13 9 0 0 0\nSwamp 12 13 8 9 12\nTundra 6 8 7 10 9\nUnderground 12 14 4 12 8\n```\n\n```\nTe r r ain Keep Watch Navigate Collect\nWat e r\n```\n\n```\nGather\nFood\n```\n\n```\nFind\nShelter\n```\n\n```\n* If the water is freshwater, than 0\n```\n\nCollect Water\n\nSucceeding on this skill check represents\nconsistently finding enough clean drinking water to\nkeep everyone hydrated during the travel phase.\nOn a failure to collect water, the travel phase\nends and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get\nwater, you cannot resume the travel phase. You may\nhave to drink unclean water, journey to more\ndangerous water sources, or else simply go thirsty\nand wait until water becomes available again.\nWhen the challenge phase triggered by this\nfailure ends, if the GM rules that water is still an\nissue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll\nthis skill check for the travel phase.\n\nFind Shelter\n\nSucceeding on this skill check represents\nconsistently finding safe places to build shelter and\nget good rest away from the elements. If you have a\ntent, you get +4 to this roll. If you have a bedroll,\nyou get +3 to this roll. If you are not at a comfortable\ntemperature, as per the rules in the Temperature\nsection, you get -3 to this roll per temperature tier\nyou are off by.\nOn a failure to find shelter, the travel phase ends.\nIt is nightfall and you cannot find a safe place to set\nup camp.

It is the foundation on which\nyou build your life, your soul; it is the chassis and\nessence of your decisions and their consequences;\nand it is what drives you forward. You are building\nan entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.\n\nYou r D r e a m\n\nWith this in mind, build a character that has a\nvision towards what they want to achieve. You\nshould have a dream of what you want to do in the\nworld, one that is complex and difficult and worthy\nof the caliber of legend you wish to become.\nRemember\u2014you determine the direction the story\ntakes. There\u2019s no goal to this game besides the one\nyou set for yourself. So speak with your GM about\nthe world in which the game takes place, and figure\nout how you want to be remembered. It\u2019s your story,\nand the stakes are low, so it\u2019s okay to set your sights\nhigh.\nOnce you have come up with something, write\nthis dream down somewhere. You may want to edit\nor add to it later.\n\nYou r V i t al s\n\nThese are the core-most stats of your character.\nThey represent the raw capabilities and limits of\nyour mind and body.\n\n```\nExperience\nWhen the game begins, you will start with some\nexperience (XP). During the game and between\nsessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills,\nabilities, and more. See the Spending Experience\nsection to learn more. After making your character,\nyou may begin spending your XP.\n```\n\n```\nAbility Dice\nPlayers have four important stats\u2014might, agility,\ncunning, and presence. These traits define your\nphysical and mental abilities, and are used to\ndetermine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task\nyou attempt to do.\n```\n\n```\nMight\nMight is your strength, endurance, and fortitude.\nHigh might allows you to push through locked doors,\nlift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles\nwithout rest.\n```\n\n```\nAgilit y\nAgility is your physical dexterity, speed, and\nreflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling\nrocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a\nsummersault on a tightrope.\n```\n\n```\nCunning\nCunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses.\nHigh cunning allows you to recall information\nyou\u2019ve learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and\ndiscern fact from fiction.\n```\n\nPresence\n\nPresence is your charm, charisma, and social\ninfluence. High presence allows you to persuade\nguards to let you past, lie to them about why you did\nit, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone\nabout it.\n\nAssigning Dice to Your Core Stats\n\nYour prowess in each of these abilities is\nrepresented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task\nthat requires one of these abilities, you will roll the\nability\u2019s corresponding die and add it to the result.\nThe first step in creating your character is\ndetermining which dice you will use for which stat.\nTypical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability,\nreflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When\nyou create your character, assign a d6 to two of your\nabilities, and a d4 to the remaining two.\n\nMovement\n\nBy default, you have a 60 feet move speed. That\nmeans that when you take the dash action (see the\nCombat section), you can cover that distance. Note\nthat your move speed is negatively effected by\nequipment penalties (like armor).\nWhen swimming, you have a swim speed of 15\nfeet. This is also negatively effected by equipment\npenalties: don\u2019t swim with heavy armor on.\nWhen climbing, your move speed is 5 feet. This\nis not affected by equipment penalties.\n\nHealth\n\nThe health of your character is represented by a\ncombination of your hit points, heart die, and\nwounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take\nwounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will\nfall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and\ntaking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too\n\n```\nmany wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of\nthese systems will be explained further in the\nfollowing sections.\n```\n\n```\nHit Points\nHit points represent your physical health.\nDamage causes your hit points to fall by a\ncorresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer\nto death. When you create a character, you start at 40\nhit points. If your hit points ever reach 0, you can\nchoose to immediately go unconscious. If you don\u2019t,\nyou go unconscious after 10 minutes if your hit\npoints are still at 0.\nYour hit points can go negative as well. If your\nhit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of\nyour maximum hit points, you die.\nWhen you take a long rest, your hit points return\nto their maximum.\n```\n\n```\nHeart Die\nYour heart die represents your stamina. It\nmanifests itself when you roll dice to perform\nchallenging actions. With very few exceptions, this\ndie will be part of every roll you make. When you\ncreate a character, it starts at a maximum of a d8.\nOther creatures can have larger or smaller heart\ndice. A rat, for example, will only have a d4 heart\ndie, while an adult dragon would use a d20. It is\npossible to increase your own heart die beyond a d8,\nbut it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.\nSometimes, there will be effects that cause your\nheart die to increase or decrease.

However, if you take 10 or more damage, this\nrepresents something serious\u2014a wound. The exact\ndetails of taking wounds and healing them will be\ndescribed later in the Combat section.\n\nYour Niche\n\nKin & Culture\n\nEveryone comes from a different background and\nhas a different upbringing. When you create a\ncharacter, choose a race from the Kin & Culture\nsection. You gain the aspects and abilities that come\nfrom choosing that race.\nMany races have multiple heritages within that\nrace. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities\nof the race, as well as a those of a chosen heritage.\n\nTa l e n t s\n\nTalents are specialized abilities that you know\nand can utilize. These act as a way of specializing\nyour play style and differentiating you from anyone\nelse in the world. Although you do not start with any\ntalents, they can be purchased with XP, with which\nyou start the game and can immediately use to buy\ntalents.\n\nBackground\n\nYour background describes your past life and\nskills. Choose up to three professions and distribute\n4 ranks between them. They can all be in one, or\nthey can be spread between them. Whenever you\nmake a skill check that one or more of your\nprofessions would apply to, add your rank in the\nrelevant professions to that roll.\n\n```\nAspects\nFor every facet of your character that cannot be\ndescribed with abilities and skills, they can be\ndescribed with aspects. Your aspects describe the\nfeatures and traits from your personality,\nbackground, and experiences that make you distinct\n\u2014both positive and negative.\nWhen you first create your character, you gain\nthree destiny points (DP). You will gain and lose DP\neach session as you spend them to benefit from your\npositive aspects and gain them by letting your\nnegative ones shine through. If you ever start a\nsession with fewer than three DP, you instead start\nwith three DP. You cannot have more than 10 DP.\nAs you play your character, you will gather more\naspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has\ntwo parts: its description, and its rank.\n```\n\n```\nDescription\nThe description describes the aspect as a whole,\nand should be a phrase or a few words to describe\nyour character. It should be a significant personality\ntrait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed\ntitle, or some sort of reputation. For example,\n\u201cBullheaded,\u201d \u201cRecord everything,\u201d \u201cChronic\nheadaches,\u201d \u201cKleptomaniac,\u201d \u201cFortune teller,\u201d\n\u201cLeave no one behind,\u201d \u201cI fear nothing,\u201d \u201cI can see\nstraight into your soul\u201d and \u201cI want revenge for my\nfather\u201d can all be aspect descriptions. Do not choose\ngeneric things, like \u201cgood at most thing\u201d or \u201clucky\u201d,\n```\n\n```\nExample\nLet\u2019s say you choose \u201cDiplomat\u201d and \u201cTutor\nfor Nobility\u201d as your professions, and distribute 3\nranks to the first, and 1 rank to the latter. If you\nwere making a skill check to persuade someone of\nsomething, you could add 3 to that roll due to your\nbackground as a diplomat.\n```\n\nsince they will apply to everything, or be too vague\nto decide if they should apply to a situation. If the\nGM says your aspect description is too generic, you\nneed to choose a new one, or make it more specific.\n\nRank\n\nNext, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an\naspect represents how influential that aspect is over\nwho you are, and will determine the modifier to your\nrolls. The rank will be a number between one and\nfive, though in some cases it can be increased even\nfurther.\n\nUsing Your Aspect for Bonuses\n\nBy spending destiny points up to or equal to an\naspect\u2019s rank, you may add that much to any skill\ncheck. In order to use this, whatever roll you are\nmaking must align with the meaning of your aspect,\nas approved by the GM.\nFor example, if you had the aspect \u201cLeave no\none behind\u201d at rank two, and you were trying to save\na friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and\nadd 2 to a die roll made to break open the bars of the\ncell.\nOr, for example, if you had the aspect \u201cI want\nrevenge for my father\u201d at rank four, you could spend\nfour DP and add 4 to any skill check that was related\nto getting revenge for your father.\nIf you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll,\nuse only the highest ranking aspect that applies.\n\nUsing Your Aspect for Destiny Points\n\nIn contrast, if an aspect would complicate a\nsituation or indicate you were bad at something, you\nmay choose to do whatever your aspect would\nsuggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect\u2019s\nrank.\n\u201cBum leg,\u201d \u201cKleptomaniac,\u201d and \u201cQuick to draw\nmy sword\u201d are examples of negative aspects. If you\nrole-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the\n\n```\nGM will award DP. For example, if a bookstore\nowner insults you, and you have the aspect \u201cQuick to\ndraw my sword\u201d at rank three, you would gain three\nDP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-\nowner.\nLikewise, if you were chasing after a fleeing\nthief, rather than making a skill check to keep up\nwith them, you could choose to fail the roll, citing\nyour bum leg and taking DP corresponding to the\nrank of the aspect.\n```\n\n```\nCreating Your Aspects\nWhen you create your character, create two\naspects. You will gain two more from your race and\nculture and you may gain more throughout the game.\nAll aspects start at rank one when they are created,\nunless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater\nthan rank five.\nWhen creating an aspect, it is generally a good\nidea to have aspects with both positive and negative\nsides to them. Without any negative aspects, you\nhave no way of gaining more destiny points, and\ntherefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Also look\nout for aspects that can be both positive and negative\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

This\nharsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders,\nwho are usually seen as dead weight until they have\nproven their worthiness to their pack. However,\nwhen the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider\u2014a rare\nappearance, due to their tendency to stick with their\nkind\u2014they are frequently the hardest working, such\nis their desire to prove their usefulness to a new\ncommunity.\nUlvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are\nknown for their formidable mercenary groups,\ntrackers, and explorers.\n```\n\n```"}], "temperature": 0.1}}

There are two types of\nrests: short rests and long rests.\n\nShort Rest\n\nA short rest is nothing more than 10 minutes of\nstationary relaxation. When you take a short rest,\nyour heart die returns to its maximum. You can take\nany number of short rests per day.\n\nLo n g R e s t\n\nWhen you go to sleep for the night, that is a long\nrest. Long rests must be at least 7 hours, and you can\nonly take one each day. When taking a long rest\naway from shelter, bed, and warmth, you must also\nmake a sleeping check. Succeeding at a sleeping\ncheck results in a \u201csuccessful\u201d long rest. On failing\nthe check, you have an unsuccessful long rest.\nTo make the sleeping check, roll 1d100 and add\nall the relevant modifiers from the Sleeping\nConditions table below.
