Battleheart

Battlehearts are best at dealing out lots of
damage. Their abilities grant bonuses that make them
more likely to hit, and more likely to deal more
damage. Two types of battlehearts exist—strikers
and ravagers.

Brutal Attacks
_Passive ability. Rank 1._
Your attacks are vicious and true. Whenever you
roll the maximum result on one of the dice in an
attack roll, or damage from a spell you cast, you may

```
add another die of the same size and roll it, adding it
to the result. This can trigger multiple times.
```

```
Making It Count
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1.
You may apply the effects of your stance twice
during the current engagement.
```

```
Subcl ass: Striker
Also known as: Ranger, Bounty-hunter, Assassin
A lone halfling stands atop a boulder,
overlooking the chaos of the battlefield. In the blink
of an eye, he draws and releases, and another enemy
falls, his arrows swift and unerring.
From the shadows of the rafters, a woman drops
silently onto the false king's back. With a swift,
precise motion, her blade finds its mark, and blood
spills before the king crumples to the floor. In the
next instant, she vanishes, leaving no trace.
An old man perches high in the branches of a
tree, unseen by the caravan below. With quiet
precision, he draws back his bowstring and releases,
sending an arrow straight through the driver's heart,
ending the journey in a single, silent breath.
Strikers are lethal assassins, masters of precision
and efficiency, capable of bringing down even the
mightiest foes with deadly accuracy. Whether
wielding a bow, blade, or any other weapon, Strikers
turn their tools into instruments of death, striking
fear into the hearts of their enemies.
Strikers gain the following abilities.
```

```
Called Shot
Passive ability. Rank 2.
You exchange some defensive ability for
overwhelming offensive prowess. You have
disadvantage on defense rolls, but you may make
called shots.
```

### CLASSES

By aiming for a very specific location on your
target, you maximize your potential damage, at the
risk of dealing less damage if you miss. If you have
advantage on an attack roll, you may declare the
attack to be a called shot.
If you do, announce a target number for you
attack roll. Keep this number in mind for later.
Then, it’s time to determine the multiplier. Your
multiplier starts at one, though you may remove
levels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it.
To increase the multiplier by one, you must sacrifice
a number of levels of advantage equal to the current
level of the multiplier. So to increase the multiplier
to two, you would have to spend one level of
advantage. To then increase it to three, you would
spend two levels of advantage, and so on.
Finally, make your attack roll. If any of the dice
you rolled are equal to or higher than your target
number, multiply your target number by the
multiplier and add that to your attack roll.

```
Power Strike
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Before you announce your stance in an
engagement, you may declare the attack to be a
power strike. If you do, all dice used in the attack
roll trigger your Brutal Attacks ability if they land on
a result greater than half the size of the die. For
example, you would reroll and add another 1d10 to
the result if you rolled a 6-10 on a d10 in your attack
roll.
```

```
Execute
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you
may choose for it to be an execution instead. If you
do and if this damage would reduce the creature to
zero or fewer hit points, the creature immediately
dies.
```

```
Devastation Strike
Major ability. Instant. Rank 4.
You deliver a massive blow, potentially finishing
off your enemy. Until the end of the round, you may
use each of your minor abilities once for free. In
addition, you may spend any number of your rush
points to roll 1d6 and add it to your next attack roll
this round. If you do not attack this round, it does not
count as using this ability.
```

```
Subcl ass: Ravager
Also known as: Berserker
A small woman with bloodshot eyes and a
dagger in each hand whirls and dives, darting
between the outstretched arms of her attackers and
skewering them both in the sides as she passes.
A man stands before a horde of goblins, his belt
jammed with nearly a dozen instruments of death.
With a deep breath, the man leaps forward, bringing
his sword down on the head of the first goblin before
```

```
Example (Called Shot)
Let’s say you have four levels of advantage
and you are about to make your attack roll with
1d10, 1d8, and 1d6. If you rolled normally, this
would mean you rolled 1d10 + 1d8 + 5d6, and
then dropped the lowest four. However, you want
to try for more. You decide that you are going to
give up three levels of advantage—one to
increase your multiplier to 2, and two more to
increase it again to 3. You then set your target
number to 5. You then roll your attack with your
one remaining level of advantage: 1d10 + 1d8 +
2d6. You get an 8, 3, 5, and 1. After dropping the
lowest die you have an 8, 5, and 3. Since 8 is
greater than 5, you hit your target and add 5 times
your multiplier of 3—resulting in an additional
15 added to your attack roll of 16 (8 + 5 + 3),
resulting in a 31 total.
```

drawing a hand-axe and throwing it at the second,
before leaping over the head of the next, and driving
an arrow from his quiver into the eye of the last
goblin.
A lithe woman draws forth a paper thin blade of
steel, sharp as a razor. With a short hop, she begins
to move, jumping like lightning from foe to foe,
lopping off heads and severing limbs in an endless
graceful dance that only she can understand.
Ravagers are masters of the horde. They have
learned to wield multiple blades at once, always
capable of choosing the right weapon to gain the
edge in the fight. No battle is too thick for a ravager
to enter, and then leave again with a trail of bloody
corpses in their wake.
Ravagers gain the following abilities.

Everywhere At Once

_Passive ability. Rank 2._
You are capable of combatting multiple enemies
at once. Whenever you enter an engagement, you
may force two enemies to engage rather than just
one.
When you do so, you may make a melee attack
against any number of valid targets in the
engagement rather than only one. If you do not make
any melee attacks, you may instead make a ranged
attack against any number of valid targets in the
engagement who are adjacent to each other.
Additionally, stowing and drawing weapons
counts as a free action, and can be taken at any time,
including between attack rolls.

Li g h t n i n g R e f l e x e s
_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._
Your reflexes are faster than anyone else’s on the
battlefield. During this round, you keep priority after
using abilities. If you choose not to use an ability
while you have priority in this way, priority is still
passed to the other side as usual.

```
Bloodthirsty
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You can launch from one foe to the next with
grace. When you deal enough damage to cause a
creature go unconscious or die this round, you regain
an action at the end of the engagement (to a
maximum of one). When you attack a creature that
has not been attacked yet this round, you get AD3 on
the attack roll.
```

```
Blitz
Major ability. Rank 4.
The rhythm of your movements synchronizes
perfectly with the fight. Until the end of the round,
you may spend one rush point to make a free
opportunity attack against an enemy and take the
sidestep action. You cannot make an opportunity
attack against the same target more than once.
```

Cleverheart

```
Cleverhearts are best at providing help to their
teammates—either augmenting their attacks, or
debuffing enemies to make their attacks weaker.
Two types of cleverhearts exist—battleminds and
spelltouched.
```

```
Above the Fray
Passive ability. Rank 1.
Although not necessarily the best at dishing out
the damage in a fight, cleverhearts excel at
everything else. Once per round, you may make an
object interaction, sidestep, help, or trip action for
free.
```

```
Tac t i cs
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1.
You can spot out the weak points in your
enemies’ defenses and direct your allies towards
```

### CLASSES

them. Choose a creature within 30 feet. If the
creature meets one of the following conditions,
attacks against them have advantage. For each
additional condition met, attacks against that creature
are made with an additional level of advantage until
the end of the round.

- Creature has a wall on two sides
- Creature is adjacent to two or more of your
  allies
- Creature is prone
- Creature has three or more levels of a single
  condition
- Creature is affected by three or more different
  conditions

Subcl ass: Battlemind

_Also known as: Commander, Mastermind, Tactician_
A battalion commander stands atop a boulder, her
voice cutting through the chaos as she issues sharp,
precise commands. Beneath her, soldiers move as
one, each order turning the tide of battle further in
their favor.
At the back of his company, a man with steely
eyes watches a pack of wolves approach. With a
swift gesture and a few barked orders, the company
converges, taking down each wolf in turn with
practiced efficiency.
A woman moves gracefully among her allies, her
blade flashing as it strikes her opponent’s shoulder.
With a commanding shout, she rallies her
companions, guiding their movements into a
powerful, unified assault.
Battleminds are master strategists, shaping the
flow of combat with keen insight and decisive
action. Their presence boosts their allies,
coordinating efforts to exploit every advantage and
turn the tide of battle.
Battleminds gain the following abilities.

```
Versatile Training
Passive ability. Rank 2.
You have more versatility in combat. Gain 1 XP
for each combat talent and 2XP for each combat
destiny level you have taken so far. Future combat
talents cost 1 fewer XP, and their destiny levels cost
2 fewer XP.
```

```
Commander’s Call
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You provide tactical aid to a teammate. Choose
any combination of up to four creatures and combat
talents you know. The chosen creatures must be
within 120 feet and in earshot. Until the end of this
round, the chosen creatures gain the benefits of the
the basic level of the chosen talents. If a heart ability
or major ability is granted, that ability cannot be
used again by you or them until the next day.
```
