rank for each component in the spell is equal or
higher, then there is no check you need to make—
you pass.

Situation 2: You Are Reading, and You Don’t

Have the Knowledge

If you are reading the spell, but you don’t meet
the knowledge rank for each component in the spell,
then for each difference in ranks, square it and add it
to a running total. Then add 12. This is the challenge
number for casting the spell. After casting the spell
but before the spell takes effect, make a Deoric spell
casting (cunning) skill check against the CN. On a
failure, the spell fizzles out, or worse, backfires.
Refer to the Miscasting & Fizzling Spells section
later in this chapter.

Situation 3: You Are Reciting, and You Have

the Knowledge

If you are reciting the spell from memory, and
your knowledge rank for each component in the spell
is equal or higher, then there is a chance for you to
misremember the spell and mess it up. Take the spell
cost for a spell before accounting for its subject cost
(if any). Make a Deoric spell casting (cunning) skill
check against this number. On a failure, the spell

```
fizzles out, or worse, backfires. Refer to the
Miscasting & Fizzling Spells section later in this
chapter.
```

```
Situation 4: You Are Reciting, and You Do
Not Have the Knowledge
Unless otherwise stated, you can not cast the
spell. Attempting to do so automatically results in a
spell failure. Refer to the Miscasting & Fizzling
Spells section later in this chapter.
```

```
Supplying the Energy
When you cast a spell, you must also have the
necessary energy to power the spell. This energy is
called spirit energy, and it comes from spirits,
funneled into a spell. Since spirits disappear shortly
after death, this usually requires live sacrifice.
To determine how much spirit energy is required
to cast a spell, refer to the spell cost of the spell.
Each sacrifice provides energy equal to its subject
cost (see the Subject Costs table above) towards the
spell. So long as the sacrifice is made within a
minute before the spell ends, the spirits go towards
fueling the spell.
When casting a spell with a subject, the spirits
must be powerful enough to overcome your target. In
these cases, the sacrificed spirits must be of equal or
greater subject cost when compared to the target of
your spell. For example, if you wanted to cast a spell
on an average human, you could use human
sacrifices, or even dragon sacrifices, but wouldn’t be
able to use rodents.
Likewise, when the spell is complex or powerful
enough, it also requires higher level sacrifices. Look
at the highest rank of domains used in a spell. To cast
that spell, sacrifices must come from a creature with
a cost equal to that number or higher.
If upon casting a spell, there is not enough
energy to cast the spell, the spell misfires. The
```

energy must be available before the spell ends. If it is
not, you may achieve partial success, though the
exact results are up to your GM to determine.

Ti me To C ast

The last factor to consider when casting a spell is
the time it takes to cast. Although spells are just
spoken sentences, they are long and complex, and
ensuring their perfect enunciation requires time.
Furthermore, most mages choose to repeat the spell
over and over again to increase the likelihood of
fixing any minor mistakes made in the first runs. The
correct and incorrect pronunciations average out
over time, thereby reducing the odds of a single
mistake sabotaging the spell. For this reason, the
time to cast a spell is variable; you can always
choose to cast faster, at greater risk.
To determine the time and risk of casting a spell,
use the _Spell Speed_ table below. Use the rank of the
spell’s technique component to determine the spell
speed. The column on the right determines how long
it takes to cast the spell safely. Note that you cannot
change the nature of a spell once you have begun
casting it. For example, if your spell is going to
create a large rock over someone’s head so that it
falls and kills them, you would have to pay the
subject cost if you wanted the rock to be created
wherever they had moved to by the end of the spell
cast.
If you wish you may choose to cast the spell in
the time from the row above its position. If you do,
make a CN 10 Deoric spell casting skill check
(cunning). On a success, you cast the spell in the
shorter time. If roll less than a 10, but greater than or
equal to a 7, you are aware of your mistake, and may
choose to use the rest of the time. If you roll less
than a 7, you are unaware of your error, and miscast
the spell at the end of the duration.

```
If you wish to cast a spell even more quickly, you
may go up two rows instead of one, although the CN
is 20 instead of 10.
```

```
Miscasting & Fizzling Spells
Sometimes, deoric casting goes awry. When
every word is critical to the execution of a spell,
even the slightest mistake can lead to disaster.
Whenever you fail the deoric knowledge check
to speak the spell, or if you attempt and fail to cast
the spell more quickly than is safe, roll Xd6, where
X is the amount you missed the CN by. Add the
results of the dice. The GM may now describe the
result of your spell. Nothing worse than the
description in your result’s corresponding row can
happen.

Le a r n i n g D e o r i c

One of the key ways to increasing Deoric power
is by gaining ranks in the domains and techniques of
Deoric power. Gaining ranks in either spell
component happens in the same way.

Le a r n i n g D o m a i n s a n d

Te ch n iqu e s

Learning Deoric is similar to the way in which
you learn any language—just much harder. Use the
CN from the Learning a Language section to
determine the CN for each check. Rather than
making monthly checks to learn, you must make
checks only once per year, after studying for the
duration. The number of successes required to reach
the next rank in a domain or technique is listed in the
table below.

```
In addition to time, you also need source
material. In order to increase your rank in a domain
or modifier, you must be able to study a spell that
contains a component of the rank you seek to reach.
Once you have used that spell to gain a success at the
end of the year with your language learning check,
you cannot use that spell for further successes
towards the same rank. For example, if I want to
reach rank two in Vul, I need to have access to a
spell that I can read that requires Vul 2 as one of its
components. If I succeed on my language check at
the end of the year, I cannot use that same spell to
continue learning towards rank two in Vul. If that
book also contains a spell that requires Vul 3, I
cannot use that to satisfy the requirement for source
material, since it is too advanced.
```

```
Inventing Spells
Spells can be invented, as well as learned. In
order to invent a spell, you must first describe and
determine stats for that spell, as described in the
previous sections. If you do not have the ranks in the
domains or techniques corresponding to the spell’s
domain and technique ranks, you cannot invent the
spell. The GM may also determine that the spell you
described requires specialty knowledge, even more
specific than the general ranks in each domain you
could gain, in which case you may have to achieve
other, specific conditions set by the GM.
If you do meet the requirements, however, then
you may begin work. Each week you may make a
CN 15 Deoric spell invention (cunning) check. Once
you have a number of successes equal to the spell
cost of the spell, you have learned how to cast the
spell, and can write it down or commit it to memory.
```

```
16–20 Something negative and permanent
but not lethal occurs to one or more
people, major destruction to
immediate area
21–25 One or more people are lethally or
very negatively and permanently
affected, mass destruction
26 Catastrophe occurs

Enchantments &

Artifacts

While the energy used to cast a Deoric spell is
usually used up in the casting, some materials bear
naturally energy producing or storing properties, and
can be enchanted with Deoric magic to become
magical artifacts. Since the materials of the artifact
provide some of the energy for the magic, artifacts
can have magical properties that remain potent
indefinitely. For example, a sword that can be always
activated to erupt in flames, or a magnifying glass
that reveals an examined object’s history when used.
Different materials have different magical properties,
which can make them more or less suited for
different enchantments.
In order to create an artifact, you must have the
crafting skill to create the item if it doesn’t exist
already, the runescribing skills to engrave the artifact
in Deoric runes, and the Deoric knowledge of the
spell in order to know what to write. In addition, the
object you are enchanting must have the magical
capacity for the spell you wish to enchant it with.
Larger objects have more magical capacity, and more
magical (and typically therefore more expensive)
materials have more magical capacity.

Magical Capacity

Every artifact has some magical capacity which
