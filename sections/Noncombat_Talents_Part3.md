Cold Read
_Major ability. Cognitive talent._
You can suss out information from someone even
without them knowing. If you spend 10 minutes
talking with someone, you may ask the GM one
thing about them that they aren’t trying to hide from
the following list:

- Profession - Childhood - Moral compass
  If you wish, you may press further and make a
  presence check contested by their cunning challenge
  number. This check is made with disadvantage if
  they are unfriendly or hostile towards you. On a
  success, you learn any one specific piece of
  information that the target knows and is not actively
  hiding. On a fail, they know that you are fishing for
  information about your topic.
  Destiny Level
  You do not make this check with disadvantage
  against unfriendly creatures, and you make the check
  with advantage if it’s against a friendly or neutral
  creature. In addition, if you fail, the creature does not
  know that you were probing for details on your
  topic.
