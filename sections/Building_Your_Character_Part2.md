aspects. For example, “Kleptomaniac" could be used
as a bonus to rolls to steal, but you could gain DP for
invoking it at times when it really would be best _not_
to steal. You could even use both at the same time—
such as when stealing something you shouldn’t.
You’d gain DP when you decide to try to steal it, but
then could immediately spend the same amount to
gain a bonus on taking it.

Wou n ds

When you take wounds, they will have a
description and a rank, just like an aspect. You may
use wounds as aspects as well, though you cannot
gain more than 5 DP from invoking the wound, even
if the rank of the wound is higher. For example, if
you have the rank 12 wound, "Guts spilling out,”
you could gain 5 DP by taking a minus 12 penalty to
nearly any athletics check, since it'd be logical that
having that type of wound would make it very
difficult to do almost anything physical.

Progress

```
There are six different ranks of combat power
you can start at in Heart Rush. With each rank, you
have access to more combat abilities. When you first
start to play, everyone should agree which rank to
begin the game at. At rank 1, players are barely more
than commoners with a desire for excitement; at rank
4, players are incredible combatants, likely known
throughout their community; and at rank 6 and
beyond, players are at low heroic levels; with
everything else falling somewhere in between.
```

```
At each rank, you gain new abilities. If you are
starting at a rank higher than rank 1, gain all the
abilities from each previous rank, and start with XP
equal to the corresponding value in the row.
```

Combat Ranks, Classes,

```
Subcl asses, & Paragon Levels
While you will gain XP every session, you
progress in combat ranks at the GM’s discretion. In
general, you should expect to graduate to the next
combat rank around when you have an amount of
total XP corresponding to the respective rank, as
```

```
Stages of Progression
Rank Abilities Starting XP
0 None 5
1 Some class abilities 15
2 Class and subclass
abilities
```

### 30

```
3 More subclass abilities 50
4 Even more subclass
abilities
```

### 80

```
5+ A paragon ability per
rank beyond
```

```
120 + 40 per
level
```

Advanced Character Creation
Sometimes, you want an even more in-
depth character creation process. If this is
something that interests everyone in the group,
check out the advanced character creation rules
in the Advanced Character Creation section.
```

```
Burn Through Those DP
To get the most out of your character, you
should be invoking your aspects frequently. DP
are not meant to be a precious resource—spend
them, and then make more by invoking your
negative ones. When creating your character,
make sure to create aspects that you’re going to
enjoy using; you’ll be using them a lot.
```

outlined in the table above. However, it is ultimately
up to the GM.

Rank 0

At this rank, you have no special abilities beyond
those that you purchase with your XP.

Rank 1

When you reach rank 1, you will have to choose
a class, as listed in the Classes section. Your class
will determine what role you have in combat—
tanking heavy blows, dealing damage, or supporting
your teammates. You are welcome to do whatever
you want in combat, but your class will give you an
edge in its respective role. Mark down all of the
abilities for that class that are at or below rank 1.

Rank 2

Upon reaching rank 2, you will have to choose a
subclass. Each class has a few subclasses, which are
specializations of your class. You must choose one of
them. Mark down all of the abilities for your class
and subclass that are at or below rank 2.
Additionally, at this stage you must decide if you
wish to become spelltouched. Spelltouched are a
universal subclass specializing in using elements to
deal damage. You can read more about them in the
Spelltouched section.

```
Rank 3
When you reach rank 3, you unlock more
abilities in your subclass. Mark down all of the
abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 3.
```

```
Rank 4
At rank 4, you unlock the last abilities from your
subclass. Mark down all of the abilities for your
subclass that are at or below rank 4.
```

```
Rank 5 and Above
Finally, upon reaching rank 5, and for each rank
thereafter, you gain a paragon level. When you gain
```

```
a paragon level, you may choose and gain an ability
from the Paragon Abilities section. These abilities
represent heroic level capstones to various combat
archetypes.
```

### BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

Advice for New Groups
If everyone in your group is brand new to
Heart Rush, rank 0 is a good place to start.
There are many rules that only kick into play
once you have a class, and Heart Rush combat
can take some time to wrap your head around,
so it can be nice to start small.
```

```
GM Note
When determining when to grant players the
next combat rank, it’s generally a good idea to
wait until a suitably impressive fight has been
won by the party. These combat ranks are major
upgrades in player combat power, so they act as a
great reward for players accepting and defeating
more dangerous fights.
