Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You have a cause, and you are good at rallying
those around you to it. If you spend ten minutes
talking to a crowd of ten or more, you convert 1/10th
of the people who are at least one level of influence
lower than you into followers.
You have advantage when trying to persuade
your followers to take an action that aligns with your
ideology.
Destiny Level
Your rhetoric is so strong, you can convert 1/4th
of a crowd to followers, rather than 1/10th.
When you take this destiny level, you may also
choose and describe how you gain one devotee to
your ideology. You may take this destiny level
multiple times.

Impenetrable Fog
Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air.
Add fog to your resonate substances as a gaseous
attunement. Your attunement to fog is equal to the
lower of levels between your attunements to water
and air. Fog cannot be seen through.
Destiny Level
The fog you create is incredibly thick, and hangs
heavy in the air. It takes 1 hour to dissipate instead of
1 minute, and mutes the sounds within it, granting
```

A3 on all stealth checks to remain quiet while
navigating within the fog.

Inanimate Object
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may transform into any generic
object that would fit in a space somewhere between a
1 inch cube and a 10 foot cube. You remain sentient
but cannot move. You can sense your surroundings
in a 5 foot radius. The transformation lasts for one
hour, or until you spend your action to transform
back into your natural form.

Destiny Level
There is no limit to the duration you can remain
transformed.

Keen Eye

_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._
When you make a perception check, you may
declare one thing that is unusual but nearly
unnoticeable about the current scene. It must be an
addition to the scene, not a change to what’s already
happening. The GM may then declare one additional
thing, modifying your stated fact.

Destiny Level
You may add one detail to whatever thing you
notice.

Le t I t G o
_Major ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Void._
As an action, you may touch an inanimate object
that could fit inside a 30-foot cube. The object
permanently disappears. There must be no sentient
creatures contained inside the object.

Destiny Level
The object must fit inside a 100-foot cube
instead.

```
Lu c k y
Passive ability. Handmagic.
If you have no applicable bonuses to a skill
check and you do not have advantage already, you
may choose to gain advantage on the roll. You
cannot get further bonuses to the roll.
Destiny Level
You have A2 on all of those rolls. You gain your
choice of permanent physical or permanent mental
vulnerability.
```

```
Master of Espionage
Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.
Whether it be heists, spying, or sabotage, you are
accomplished in the ways of espionage. You may
declare an object as the target of your espionage. If
you spend one day gathering knowledge about the
security around your target, you have advantage on
all rolls related to accessing that object, and then
escaping thereafter.
If you spend one week gathering knowledge
about your target, you may make an “educated
guess” about the security around your target. The
GM will confirm or deny your educated guess with a
simple “yes” or “no”.
Destiny Level
Before you perform your act of espionage, you
may choose to lay out a detailed plan. You must
describe your plan to the GM. While you execute
your espionage, so long as everything goes as
planned, you may choose to replace any roll made
during the heist with the maximum of your relevant
ability die. These benefits do not extend to
contingency plans, nor to tasks that were not clearly
specified in the plan. For example, “Break into the
house” would provide zero bonuses, while “Pick the
lock on the door without making a sound” would
provide bonuses to both picking the lock and to
doing so quietly.
