## Journeys

When the travel is safe and not a focus of
gameplay, such as on a well-traveled road between
nearby towns, you only need to know the basics of
travel speed so you can determine how long it takes
(described below). In these cases, you are assumed
to reach your destination in the appropriate amount
of time and the game can continue at the new
location.
However, in cases where travel is a major focal
point of gameplay, the rest of this section describes
the rules for travel.

Tr av e l B a s i cs

The first step in beginning a journey is figuring
out how long it will take. You can calculate this by
using your daily travel speed. The GM should then
segment the journey, and add events, which will be
explained later in this section.

Travel Speed

Your travel speed is calculated based off your
movement speed. The following sections describe
how far you can travel in different terrain. These
distances represent miles of progress towards your
destination, not absolute distance traveled.
When you begin, the GM should calculate how
long it will take reach your destination, assuming
everything goes well.

On Foot

If you are on a path on flat ground, you can cover
24 miles per day. In difficult terrain, such as swamps,

```
jungles, and mountains (as determined by the GM),
this distance is halved. If you are not on a path, this
movement speed is also halved.
```

```
On a Vehicle
If you are on horseback, in a carriage, or
traveling via some other land-vehicle, use the
vehicle’s daily travel speed rather than your own.
Horses and carriages have the same movement speed
as humans for the purposes of calculating daily
travel speeds, but they will have greater carrying
capacity and will not be penalized by your own
movement penalties, such as those from armor.
```

```
Segmenting the Journe y
On long trips through varied terrain, the GM
should segment the journey into different distinct
sections, broken at each major change in terrain. For
example, if the the trip is through the mountains and
into the forests beyond, there may be a segment of
mountain travel and a segment of forest travel. Most
trips do not need multiple segments.
When segmenting trips, the GM should calculate
how long each segment should take based off the
distance and travel speed in that segment of the
journey.
```

```
Events
Besides survival, these are what make a journey
into an adventure. Events can include things such as
falling avalanches, bandits attacking, tombs being
discovered, and just about anything else you can
imagine creating a situation where danger or further
investigation might be warranted.
```

The GM should add between one and five events
to most journeys, sticking with lower numbers on
shorter journeys or longer, safer ones, and higher
numbers for longer, more dangerous journeys. If
there are multiple segments in the trip, it’s usually a
good idea to add at least one event per segment.

Making the

Journey

When you actually leave for the journey, for each
segment, the GM should determine if any of the
following survival challenges are necessary to the
wellbeing of the players during the segment, and
couldn’t be reasonably prepared for or already
accounted for:

- Keep Watch
- Navigate - Collect Water - Gather Food - Find Shelter
  If you are bringing enough food and water for the
  duration of the segment, for example, the GM should
  not include _Gather Food_ or _Collect Water_. The tasks
  the GM deems as necessary will each require one or
  more successful skill checks in order to avoid
  turning into a bigger problem for you and your party.
  You or someone else from the party must make a
  skill check for each of these needs, using the
  challenge number from the table below. The same
  person can make multiple skill checks, but they get
  disadvantage on each skill checks they make for
  every additional skill check they have to make.
  Conversely, anyone not making a skill check can
  grant advantage to exactly one skill check being
  made by another player.

### JOURNEYS

```
GM Note
Some journeys don’t need any skill checks
for their travel phases. If the players are traveling
through farmland, just use the travel phase as a
brief montage opportunity before having an event
phase.
GM Note
Check out the Journey chapter in the GM
section of this book. There’s lots of advice on
how to come up with interesting events and
advice on when to use them.
```

To t a l S u c c e s s

On succeeding at every skill check, the journey
progresses to the event phase. No challenge phases
are triggered.

Skill Check Failure

If a skill check is failed, players can face
consequences. Each skill check has its own
consequences for failure. If multiple skill checks are
failed, the GM may choose to resolve them in
whichever order they wish.

Skill Check Consequences

Each travel phase skill check has it’s own
consequences for failure.

Keep Watch

Succeeding on this skill check represents keeping
a watchful eye on your surroundings throughout the
travel phase. When you successfully keep watch,
when an event occurs, you and the party see any
threats present before they see you.
On a failure, any people or creatures from an
event surprise you.

```
Navigate
Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently staying on track towards your
destination.
On a failure, the party fails to make progress
towards the destination and the party enters an event
phase. This event does not count towards the total
number of events for the journey.
```

```
Gather Food
Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently fishing, hunting, or foraging
successfully enough to keep everyone fed during the
travel phase.
On a failure to gather food, the travel phase ends
and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get food,
you cannot resume the travel phase. You may have to
eat pack animals, consume unidentified plants, hunt
more dangerous creatures, or simply go hungry until
food becomes available again.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that food is still an issue
for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill
check for the travel phase.

Collect Water

Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently finding enough clean drinking water to
keep everyone hydrated during the travel phase.
On a failure to collect water, the travel phase
ends and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get
water, you cannot resume the travel phase. You may
have to drink unclean water, journey to more
dangerous water sources, or else simply go thirsty
and wait until water becomes available again.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that water is still an
issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll
this skill check for the travel phase.

Find Shelter

Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently finding safe places to build shelter and
get good rest away from the elements. If you have a
tent, you get +4 to this roll. If you have a bedroll,
you get +3 to this roll. If you are not at a comfortable
temperature, as per the rules in the Temperature
section, you get -3 to this roll per temperature tier
you are off by.
On a failure to find shelter, the travel phase ends.
It is nightfall and you cannot find a safe place to set
up camp. You may have to sleep in a more dangerous
location, or skip sleep altogether.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that shelter is still an
issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll
this skill check for the travel phase.

Other Interruptions

If you wish to stop the travel phase at any point,
you may do so. Regular game-time resumes until
you and your party agree to resume the journey. So
long as your general ability to travel survive and

```
travel safely has not changed, you should resume the
previous travel phase, keeping its rolls and results.
```

```
Healing During Travel
If you lose health during an encounter or during a
challenge phase, you
```

Challenge Phase

```
When a challenge phase begins, the montage of
travel is over. Challenge phases begin when you
have no food, no water, or no shelter. Gameplay
slows down to normal pace. You must now make
decisions as you would in a normal situation—the
GM describes the situation, and you have to figure
out what to do.
If you want to continue travel as you did before,
you must now make daily checks to keep watch,
gather food, collect water, navigate, and find shelter.
Everyone should make skill checks for these as they
would for the travel phase, unless they are doing
something uniquely different compared to what they
would have been doing during the travel phase. For
example, if you were riding a horse, ran out of food,
entered a challenge phase, and then butchered your
```

### TRAVEL & SURVIVAL

```
GM Note
Even though travel phases don’t all have to be
the same duration and it’s all a montage anyway,
it’s still important to have a good idea how long
each leg of the journey lasts. This way, if players
get stuck in a challenge phase at some point and
decide to tough it out till the end, you know how
many days it will take. It also means you can
calculate how many long rests they have between
events, so they can heal an appropriate amount.
```

horse for food, you would not need to make a skill
check to gather food for a few days.

Daily Consequences

Failing any of these skill checks results in the
same consequences as normal, though they occur
immediately, and do not trigger new challenge
phases—you just remain in the existing one.
While in the challenge phase, it is possible you
will spend time going hungry or thirsty, without
sleep, or too hot or cold. Each has their own
consequences as outlined in the Basic Needs section.

Ending the Challenge Phase

If you start a day after succeeding at every
required skill check the day before, you are capable
of traveling, and there are no obvious threats to your
immediate safety, the challenge phase ends and you
resume the travel phase. The GM may continue the
montage of travel.
Alternatively, if the GM rules that you’ve gone
enough distance to reach your destination, the
journey ends.

Event Phase

Events represent highlights and notable moments
from a journey (in addition to any struggles faced
during challenge phases). They can take a wide
variety of forms, some good, some bad, and they
should be introduced as an interruption to travel. For
example, the GM might describe rounding a hill after
days of travel and seeing the colossal ruins of a
destroyed dwarven fortress on the mountainside. The
players can now investigate the fortress in normal
game-time.
Once players are finished with an event, are no
longer threatened by it, and have chosen to move on,

```
the event phase ends and the next travel phase
begins.
```

```
Pac k A n i m al s
If you are traveling light, you may be able to
```

```
carry all of the necessary gear you need on your
back. However, on longer trips you will likely want a
pack animal, especially if you want to bring all your
food with you. See the Equipment & Gear section
for rules on carrying capacity and a list of common
equipment.
```

Journey Modes

```
When traveling long distances, there are two
modes of gameplay: travel mode, and action mode.
In travel mode, time passes quickly, and the GM
