## Combat

Combat occurs in rounds, broken up by abilities
and engagements. Engagements are short scenes of
combat between participants, and are used to abstract
the actions of multiple combatants all trying to attack
each other.
During each round, everyone will have the
chance to use whatever abilities they can and take
actions, though the order of all these things can vary
from round to round. There are not “turns” in the
traditional sense.

Starting Combat

When combat begins, everyone loses priority.
That means they cannot use abilities that are not
_instant_. Instead, priority will be granted to a starting
side, and then pass back and forth until everyone in
the round has done all of the things they want to do.
The first step is determining who starts with
priority. If one side wasn’t expecting to get attacked,
the other side gains priority and should choose
someone on their side to start. If both sides saw
combat coming, the players should roll 1d6 to
determine which side gets starting priority, with a 4
or higher resulting in the players getting priority
first. The starting side will begin each subsequent
round with priority.

Priority During Combat

When your side in a fight has priority, anyone on
your side can use an ability. Once they do, priority
passes to the other side. If they don’t want to use an
ability (or can't), priority passes back to your side.

```
This continues until neither side wishes to do
anything, in which case the round ends. Note that
abilities with the instant tag do not require priority,
and do not trigger priority passing to the other side.
In overview, the sequence will look like this:
someone on the side with priority will use an ability.
Once that ability resolves, anyone on the other side
can choose to use an ability next. If nobody on that
side wants to, then anybody on the original side gets
another turn. If none of them want to do anything, it
passes to the other side one final time. If all of them
still don’t want to use an ability, then the round is
over.
If, however, someone does want to use an ability,
then the sequence starts over. In effect, so long as
both sides are frantically trying to use their abilities,
both sides will alternate using abilities. However, if
one side is no longer interested in or able to use any
abilities, the other side will be able to
uninterruptedly continue using abilities until the
other side decides to jump back in.
During engagements, which are explained in the
Engaging the Enemy section, nobody gets priority.
As soon as someone enters an engagement, neither
side has priority until the engagement ends.
```

### COMBAT

```
Engagements Are Important
Engagements are the core of Heart Rush
combat, and they might take a bit of time to
wrap your head around. There’s a whole
section (Engaging the Enemy) on it, but the
idea is that you’re entering a chaotic melee
where anyone could get hurt, including
yourself.
```

During Combat

During each round of combat, you can take up to
one action, and use any number of abilities
(following the frequency restrictions on the abilities
themselves).

Act ions

You get one action per round. All actions are
abilities, and as with all abilities, you must have
priority to use them.
Note that the _Dash_ action, _Object Interaction_
action, and _Call Out_ action do not cost an action the
first time you perform them each round.

Engage the Enemy
_Full action._
As an action, you may engage with the enemy.
This does not guarantee that you’ll injure them, or
even hit them in the first place. In fact, they might hit
you instead.
Rules for engagement are complicated, and are
described in detail in the Engaging the Enemy
section below. As a simple analogy, using your
action to engage the enemy can be described as
initiating a rock-paper-scissors game of combat with
the enemy, with the victor having the chance to
injure the loser.

Cast A Spell
_Full action._

See the Spellcasting section for details and
restrictions on casting spells. You cannot cast a spell
if you do not know any spells.

Sidestep
_Full action\*._
Rather than using an action, you may instead
spend a rush point to perform this ability.

```
When you take this action, you may move 5 feet
or stand up from prone. This movement does not
provoke opportunity attacks.
```

```
Dash
Full action*.
The first dash you take each round does not cost
your action.
Move a number of feet up to or equal to your
move speed. Unless stated otherwise, your move
speed is 60 before accounting for equipment.
If you move more than 5 feet within a creature’s
melee range or leave their melee range without
taking the sidestep action, the creature may make an
opportunity attack against you. Resolve the attack
before leaving the creature’s range and completing
the movement.
```

```
Object Interaction
Full action*.
The first object interaction you take each round
does not cost your action.
Any sort of simple interaction with an object
counts as an interaction action. Stowing a weapon
and retrieving a new one are two separate object
interactions.
```

```
Help
Full action.
You aid another creature. Choose an adjacent
creature. That creature gets advantage on its next A/
D roll, skill check, or saving throw.
```

```
Call Out
Full action*.
The first call out you make each round does not
cost your action.
Say (or shout out) something. Up to one,
reasonable-length sentence.
```

Instant Actions

Below are some actions that you can take at
instant speed, even while another creature is doing
an action. They do not trigger priority changes.

Enter An Engagement

_Full action. Instant._
As an action, you may enter an engagement that
has already been initiated between other characters
but has not yet begun. Unlike other abilities, you do
not need priority to use this ability. Instead,
immediately after someone uses the _Engage the
Enemy_ action, everyone has the choice to take this
action until nobody else wishes to do so.
There must be a valid target in range of your
weapon who is already part of the engagement in
order to enter. To continue the analogy from the
explanation of engaging the enemy, this is like
deciding to jump into a rock-paper-scissors game
going on between the people around you, and
choosing to play as well.

Tr i p

_Full action. Instant._
Whenever a creatures with a level of off-
balanced moves (willingly or forced) through a space
that is adjacent to you, if that creature is no more
than one size larger than you, you may trip the
creature, immediately knocking it prone in that
space.

Opportunity Attack

_Full action\*. Instant._
Rather than using an action, you may instead
spend a rush point to perform this ability.
Opportunity attacks represent moments when an
enemy has presented an easily exploited weakness.
They let you make an attack against them without
first winning an engagement.

```
You can only take this action if one or more of
the following conditions is met:
```

- The enemy willingly leaves your melee reach
  without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy willingly moves more than 5 feet
  within your melee reach without using the sidestep
  ability.
- The enemy stands up without using the
  sidestep action.
- You are hidden.
- The target of your action is surprised.
  When you take this action, make an attack roll
  against the creature with the stance of your choice.

```
Rush Poin ts
Rush represents the excitement and tension of a
fight. As a fight goes on, rush points build, and you
can perform more and more powerful moves. Rush is
represented with a pool of points. At the start of
combat, you have one rush point. At the beginning of
each subsequent round, you gain rush points equal to
the number of rounds in which you were part of an
engagement, made an opportunity attack, or cast a
spell, up to the current number of rounds. Other
abilities may increase this pool further.
Unspent rush points are lost at the end of every
round.
Outside of combat, you have 0 rush points.
```

```
Hard To Get, but Great
Opportunity attacks are like gold. They’re
hard to get, but when you do, you can throw
everything you’ve got into the roll and nail the
target exactly the way you want. For this
reason, enemies will do a lot to avoid getting
hit with them. Use that to your advantage.
```

### COMBAT

Minor Abilities

Minor abilities are special abilities unique to
your class and subclass. Whenever you use a minor
ability, you must spend one rush point for each time
you’ve used the ability, including the current use.
You have multiple minor abilities, so you will have
to manage how many times you’ve used each
separately. They do not require you to spend an
action, but there may be limitations on when you can
use them.

Major Abilities

Major abilities are like ultimate moves your
character has. Unlike minor abilities, major abilities
can only be used once per day. Major abilities gained
from your class have additional, optional rush point
costs, meaning that your major abilities will get
stronger and stronger the longer the fight lasts. They
do not require you to spend an action, but there may
be limitations on when you can use them

Special Use Cases

Rush points can also be spent to make
opportunity attacks or to sidestep.

Engaging the

Enemy

An engagement with the enemy may be a short
flurry of crossing blows, or it may be part of a larger
melee with dozens of combatants.
In either case, when you first decide to engage
the enemy—taking the _Engage the Enemy_ action—
choose an enemy you could theoretically hit with the
weapon you are currently wielding. You and this
enemy are now part of the engagement. The enemy
does not have a choice in entering this engagement,

```
and participating in this engagement does not cost
them their action.
As an engagement has now begun, creatures no
longer get priority. The engagement must be resolved
before creatures get priority again. However, first,
other creatures get a chance to join.
Other creatures within weapon range of anyone
in the engagement may decide to enter the
engagement as well. If they wish to do so, they can
spend their action to join the engagement. This is the
Enter an Engagement action.
```

```
Choosing Stances
Once everyone who wants to and is allowed to
join the engagement has done so, every combatant
within the engagement must secretly choose their
stance: might, agility, cunning, or the defensive
stance. Once everyone has chosen, everyone must
reveal their choice. Attacks proceed in a manner
similar to rock paper scissors, as outlined in the
sections below.
Note that if the players wish to discuss which
stance to choose among themselves, the GM should
choose the stance for the enemies before the players
decide for their characters, to prevent any
accusations of cheating by reacting to the decisions
made by the players.
```

```
Ty p i c a l R o u n ds
In most rounds, you’ll want to move a bit—
the first dash is free—and you’ll want to start
or enter an engagement, since that’s the main
way to deal damage. Sprinkled throughout,
you’ll use various abilities and occasionally
you’ll want to do something else with your
action, but moving and engaging is the gist.
```

Cunning

Those who chose cunning are able to easily read
and avoid the attacks of anyone who can’t beat them
with raw strength, and get to make an attack against
a single creature in the engagement that didn’t take
the might stance. Creatures that chose the cunning
stance make their attack rolls first, in any order.
Cunning directly beats agility. Whenever you use
this stance to attack a creature defending with the
agility stance, you may apply up to two levels of
dazed, off-balanced, or weakened to that creature.

Agilit y

Those who chose agility are able to maneuver
