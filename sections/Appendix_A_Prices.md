## Appendix A: Prices

While traveling the world, spending money, and
slowly gathering money, you will also find yourself
spending money. Use the following tables to find
approximate costs for services.

```
These costs represent the base cost of items. In
other words, the GM is welcome to decide that some
item is of exceptionally high quality, or is more
scarce in your location, and increase the price.

Adventuring Gear

While adventuring, you will want to bring gear.
Check out the Carrying Your Gear section for rules
about slots and encumbrance.
Some of the gear in the table below have limited
uses, denoted by the _dX uses_ in the _Notes_ column. If

```
something has dX uses, then you should roll an X-
sided die. If the result is a 1, then the die decreases in
size. If that would cause the die to decrease to less
than a d2, then instead, the item is used up.
