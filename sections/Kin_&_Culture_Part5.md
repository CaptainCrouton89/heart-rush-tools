Te le pat h
Passive ability.
Tier 1: You can communicate telepathically with
any humanoid (or equally sentient creature) you
touch. While you are touching them, they can
communicate telepathically with you as well. You
```

may also sense using their senses, during which you
cannot sense through your own. Creatures are not
aware that you are sensing through them.
Tier 2: Your tier 1 abilities are not limited by
touch, and instead extend to a range of 20 feet.

Tr e m or s e n s e

_Passive ability._
Tier 1: By sensing vibrations in ground and air,
you can sense the location and shape of anything
within 20 feet of you, including through walls. This
counts as being able to see that object for the sake of
abilities that rely on sight. You cannot see color, and
details are limited to only things larger than your fist.
For example, you cannot read using this ability.
Tier 2: The range of this ability extends to 60
feet.

Futuresight

_Passive ability._
Tier 1: You have the Sight, and can see glimpses
into the future. Whenever you fall asleep or are
unconscious, you have a vision. Before you wake up,
you may ask the GM a question about an event in the
future. The GM must give a vague answer (generally
no more than a couple words), to the best of their
ability.
Tier 2: Your futuresight is more developed. Once,
at the beginning of each day, roll three dice of any
size you wish. Whenever you, the GM, or anyone
else rolls a die with size matching one of the dice
you rolled, you may replace the result with the result
from your die roll. After doing so, you cannot use
that die again.
