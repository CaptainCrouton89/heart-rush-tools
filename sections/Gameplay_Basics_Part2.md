a single space, ten tiny creatures can fit on one
space; five small creatures can fit on one space; one
medium or large creature on one space; and creatures
of sizes L2 and greater take up a number of spaces
equal to the square of their level. For example, an L
creature would take up four spaces (2x2 spaces), and
an L5 creature would take up twenty-five spaces
(5x5 spaces).

At tacking

Whenever an attacking creature uses the might
stance to push a defending creature of a different
size, the defending creature may move more or less
than the default of 10 feet. If the defending creature
is smaller than the attacker, the defending creature
moves an additional 5 feet for each level of size
difference. If the defending creature is larger than the
attacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet
for each level of size difference. This could mean
that the defending creature is not pushed at all.

Movement and Spaces

One creature can occupy and move through the
space of another creature if it is at least two sizes
smaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain.
While in the same space as a non-hostile creature,
you also have one level of cover.

```
Weapons
Creatures of size small or tiny cannot wield
heavy weapons. Creatures of size tiny cannot wield
heavy or light weapons.
```

```
Li g h t i n g
There are three different states of lighting that
can occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and
dark.
Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern,
and intense fire all produce bright light. There are no
penalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit
area.
Dim light can be found in alleyways, twilight,
and in all the spaces between bright light and
darkness. Perception and observation skill checks are
made with disadvantage for creatures that require
light to see.
Darkness is anywhere there is no light. Unless
you have darkvision, you cannot see anything.
```

```
Darkvision
Some creatures have darkvision. A creature with
darkvision can see in dim light as though it were
bright light, and can see in darkness as though it
were dim light.
```

```
Hiding
If the environment provides suitable places to
hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may
choose to hide. This requires more than a single
action, and cannot be performed during combat.
When you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill
check. On a success you are hidden, and count as
unseen for the purposes of attacking.
While hidden, you may use your action to make
an opportunity attack against a creature you are
hidden from. You may still be obscured after you
```

attack, but you do not count as hidden and you
cannot make opportunity attacks.
All hidden creatures that wish to make
opportunity attacks may use their action to attack
before combat begins.

Te r r ain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous
environments that all pose their own unique
challenges.

Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently
hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy
foliage. While in difficult terrain, after accounting
for other movement penalties, your remaining
movement speed is halved.

Wat e r

Doing anything while in or under water comes
with severe limitations. While shallow water counts
only as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that
you move at your swim speed. Unless you explicitly
have a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.
If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all
A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement. If
you cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have
D5 on all of those rolls instead. Ranged weapons
travel half their distance when fired underwater.

Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a
might check to determine if you can climb at all. On
a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which
unless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.

```
Sources of Dam age
There are several other sources of damage
besides combat. Some of the more common ones are
listed below.
```

```
Combat
Combat is one of the most common ways to lose
health. Check out the Combat section to learn more.
```

```
Hazards & Traps
There will be times when you have to avoid
damage from the environment. For example, being
hit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or
getting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship. In
these cases, you should make a saving throw,
detailed in the Saving Throws section. On a failure,
you will take damage.
```

```
Falling
When falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility
saving throw against the height fallen. If you roll less
than the distance fallen, you take the difference as
damage.
```

```
Suffocation and Strangulation
There are different effects on one’s body
depending if you are holding your breath, or getting
strangled or suffocated by something else.
When holding your breath, make a might check.
You can hold your breath a number of rounds equal
to your result. Subtract one from the total number of
rounds whenever you take an action or move while
holding your breath. After you run out of breath, you
take the suffocating condition.
If you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were
suddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin
suffocating immediately.
```

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across
various poisons. Different poisons have different
properties and means of application. Some may
paralyze you, but only if ingested, while other may
kill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream,
but are otherwise harmless if swallowed. Some are
long lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to
weapons and maintain potency for minutes to days,
while others can’t be applied to weapons at all.
While most poisons will have specific rulings
applied to them individually, some general poisoning
rules apply to most of them.
Due to the difficulty of properly applying poison,
poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.
Each application of the poison uses up one dose of
that poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with
poison applied to it uses up the poison. Most poisons
can be applied to weapons prior to combat. The
length that the poison remains potent on the weapon
will vary from poison to poison, after which the
poison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in
order to still garner the same effects. Damage from
poison happens after the weapon attack—it is not
rolled with the attack dice.

Experience

```
Over the course of many games, you will gain
more and more XP. With this XP, you can purchase
new, interesting features for your character.
```

```
Gaining Experience
It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players. They
can decide what they want to award XP for,
depending on the type of game they want to run.
Common triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing
goals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning
combats, or just length of session. Whatever the
metric for determining XP, the GM should
communicate this to the players.
```

```
Spending Experience
Between sessions, or during sessions so long as
you are not in combat, you may spend XP to access
new features. Use the following chart to find the cost
of your desired new feature.
Experience Options
Ty p e XP Cost Effect
Le v e l i n g
New Aspect 1 Add a new aspect at rank 1.
Increase Aspect X+1, Where X is the aspect’s
current level
```

```
Increase the rank of an aspect by 1.
```

```
Change Aspect 0 Replace the text of your aspect with different text.
```

```
GM Note
Granting XP equal to players’ combat rank is
a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading
their character every few sessions. If you want
slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this
by one, or even two can be okay.
```

New Aspect

Creating a new aspect means writing down
another word or phrase describing your character.
The aspect starts at rank one.

Increase Aspect

Increase the rank of one your aspects by one.
Aspects cannot have a rank greater than five.

Change Aspect

You may replace your aspect with a brand new
aspect, if you believe your character development
warrants it. The aspect remains at the same rank, but
you may change the description.

Increase Maximum Hit Points

```
Increase your maximum hit points by 10.
```

Increase Ability Die

Increase an ability die by one size. Ability die
size increases in the order d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12

> d20. Each increase costs XP equal to the size of the
> new die, so an increase from d8 to d10 would cost

10. You cannot increase your heart die in this way.

```
New Combat/Non-Combat Talent

combat or non-combat talent list. If it is a cognitive

level. Any prerequisites for the original talent are

of your spirit reaches critical levels at which your
maximum heart die is automatically increased.
