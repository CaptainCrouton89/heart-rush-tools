## Basic Needs

Although usually not necessary to track, basic
needs such as water, food, and warmth are all things
that can spell life or death when they are in short
supply, such as when in a challenge phase during a
journey.

Food

Whenever you start a new day having not eaten a
ration of food the day before, you gain a level of
weakened, off-balanced, or dazed, at random. For
every 24 hours thereafter, gain one level of each
condition. These conditions do not fade until you
consume two rations of food.
After a number of days have passed equal to 10
times your might die, you starve.

Wat e r

Whenever you start a new day having not drunk
a ration of water the day before, you gain two levels
of weakened, off-balanced, and dazed. These
conditions do not fade until you drink two rations of
water.
If this occurs for two consecutive days, you die
on the third morning.

Te m pe r at u r e

There are six tiers of temperature. The GM
should make sure to communicate the temperature if

```
it is ever anything other than comfortable and
staying warm or cool is a concern.
```

- Searing hot
- Muggy/Sweltering
- Comfortable
- Chilly
- Freezing
- Bone-chilling
  While adventuring in extreme heat or cold, you
  must track your own tier of warmth. If you get too
  cold or hot, you could suffer penalties or even die.
  Without clothes or fire, your temperature rating is
  equal to the ambient temperature.
  Depending on your temperature, there are
  different effects you suffer from.

```
Muggy/Sweltering & Chilly
These temperatures don't inflict penalties, but
they make it harder to sleep. Check out the Rests &
Healing section for details on sleeping checks.
```

```
Searing Hot
If you spend a quarter of the day at a searing hot
temperature, roll 1d12. On a 10 or higher, you take a
wound of rank equal to the result, labeling it
“heatstroke”. On a result less than 10, you take that
much damage but suffer no wounds.
```

```
Freezing
If you spend a quarter of the day freezing, roll
1d10 and take a wound of rank equal to the result,
labeling it “frostbite”. So long as you are freezing,
this wound does not heal.
```

Bone-Chilling

If you spend a quarter of the day where your
temperature is bone-chilling, roll 6d10 and take a
wound of rank equal to the result, labeling it
frostbite. So long as you are freezing, this wound
does not heal.

Modulating Temperature

Fortunately, by using shelter, fire, and clothes,
you can modulate your temperature to avoid the
associated penalties with the extremes.

Shelter

While you are in shelter, your temperature counts
as one tier closer to comfortable. Tents and caves
count as shelter. For other natural features it is up to
the GM to determine if the feature counts as shelter.

Fire

While next to a fire, your temperature counts as
one tier higher. You cannot build a fire in a tent
unless specifically stated otherwise.

Clothes

Different clothes can increase your temperature
by one or more tiers. Checkout the Equipment &
Gear section for the different clothes. You cannot
sleep in your clothes, but an insulated bedroll will
also work.
