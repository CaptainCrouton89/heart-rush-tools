## Deoric Magic

Deoric is the language of truth. The language is
extremely complex, but whatever is spoken in the
language, when fueled with enough energy, simply
become true. Hypothetically, you could do anything
from changing the color of your freckles to altering
the nature of time. However, energy for Deoric
magic comes only from living sacrifice, and using
Deoric magic to affect other living things is even
more difficult. For these reasons, Deoric is
frequently referred to as ritual magic, or witchcraft,
because it is usually performed in private, over long
periods of time, at the cost of life.
Making things even more difficult, Deoric is an
absurdly cryptic and complex language. In order to
make the magic occur, the desired outcome must be
described in excruciating detail and with perfect
grammar, pronunciation, and rhythm. Simply
knowing the words to a few common objects will not
come even close to allowing you to control them.
Furthermore, the consequences of misspeaking can
be enormous. While in general, a mispronunciation
results in nothing more than the spell fizzling out,
mixing up words can also lead to equally powerful,
but unintended effects. The subject of Deoric
research is an intense one—riddled with catastrophic
and lethal failures throughout.
Many people don’t know any Deoric, and those
who do, very little. Instead, people read from
existing texts, sounding out familiar words and
sequences of sounds as they go. Entire books exist
describing how to perform only a handful of Deoric
spells. Due to the intense costs of failures, most
choose to chant Deoric spells many times before
releasing the energy with the sacrifice, thereby

```
reducing the risk of a single misspoken syllable
negating the entire spell.
Deoric is also used in handmagic, oaths, and
most magical artifacts. In each of these cases, the
Deoric is stored in some object (your hand, a scroll,
an item), and can then be activated for its effect. We
will cover these aspects of Deoric magic in a later
section.
```

Casting a Spell

```
Although anyone could theoretically cast Deoric
magic simply by sounding out the words, the odds of
successfully casting are nearly nonexistent. On the
other hand, learning the entire language in all of its
minute complexities would take eons—both to learn,
as well as to track down the tens of thousands of
ancient and obscure words, lost to history. Instead,
people generally choose to focus on different
domains of Deoric to specialize in. This way, a
Deoric magician may be proficient in spells
involving the creation and manipulation of stone, but
incapable of destroying it, or turning it into water.
There are many different domains of Deoric, and
your proficiency in any domain will be given a rank,
starting at 0. Although your rank in a domain could
theoretically go up indefinitely, most people don't
achieve over a 3 in their lifetime, and the knowledge
of the gods rarely range above 5 or 6.
```

```
Spell Components
One of the most important factors in casting
Deoric spells is determining the spell’s stats. There
```

are no predetermined spells in this rulebook—
instead, each spell is made up by the players or the
GM. However, there is some consistency between
spells. **Every spell is made up of varying ranks in
at least one domain, one technique, and three
modifiers.** These ranks determine the energy cost of
the spell, as well as how difficult it is to cast, if you
can cast it at all. The first step is determining the
ranks of the components of the spell.
To assign ranks to the spell’s components, the
spell should be described in detail, explaining
exactly what it does and how it causes whatever
effect it creates. Then, use the domain, technique,

```
and modifier charts to assign that spell a rank in each
of its components. Examples are included in a later
section.
```

```
Domains
There are twelve domains of Deoric knowledge.
The ranks assigned to each level of control over that
element are rough—they are designed to help you
arrive at a value, not explicitly point one out to you.
Based off the description of the spell, assign it a rank
in ever domain relevant to the spell. Every spell
should have at least one domain.
```

Te ch n iqu e Next choose the relevant technique for the spell.
Their are five techniques of Deoric magic, listed in

```

the table below. When calculating the rank of a
technique for any given spell, it should be roughly
equal to the average cost of the domain components
of a spell. However, in some circumstances a

```
technique will be harder or easier. In these cases,
adjust the rank of the technique up or down by one,
or even two, if the technique is especially easy or
hard.
```

Modifiers

There are three modifiers to every spells, which
change their behavior, listed in the table below.

```
Choose a rank for each modifier for your spell, based
off of the range at which your spell works, the
duration it lasts, and amount of precision it requires.

(Summoning)
```

```
Nothing can be created or destroyed using Deoric—but you can summon things from the
surrounding area. Unless specified, it could come from anywhere. Some things are more
difficult to summon than others, due to their scarcity (e.g. gold, titan blood). After
summoning something, it does not return to wherever it was summoned from.
Mindoran
(Understanding)
```

```
Used for comprehension, scrying, and effects on the mind. Seeking information that is
“harder to get” can make the rank of this component higher.
Taziin
(Banishment)
```

```
Just as nothing can be created, nor can anything be destroyed—only sent somewhere else.
Unless specified, this could banish the target of the spell anywhere.
Ostum
(Control)
```

```
One of the most common techniques. Used for controlling the behavior and movement of
some domain. It is more difficult to make something behave in a way that is more unnatural
to it.
Phreo
(Transform)
```

```
Used for changing the properties of a domain. Small changes require less work than large
changes. After transforming something, it will not necessarily revert to its previous state, if
that would require more energy.

Destroy only the poison in a goblet of poisoned
water: Pel 1, Taziin 1, Tuul 1, Mim 1, Xin 3.

Determining Spell Cost

A spell’s cost can be calculated by multiplying
the technique and modifiers together (note: not the
domain rank). Keep note of this number and save it
for later.
For example, making the wooden chair glow
would be level 1 (1 x 1 x 1 x 1) , while making a
small tornado would be level 36 (3 x 2 x 3 x 2), and
destroying the poison would be 3 (3 x 1 x 1).
When determining spell cost, the GM is at full
liberty to increase or decrease ranks of individual
components of a spell at their discretion. These
variations can be explained by the finicky nature of
Deoric spell casting.

Ta r g e t i n g a S u b j e c t

If you wish to target a living creature with your
spell, you must first determine your intent. There are
two levels of intent one can have: neutral or positive
intent, and negative intent.

you must also take into account the subject cost
of your target. Living things are extremely complex,
and without knowing a creature’s true name, you
have to describe the creature in all of its complexity
rather than use a single word to identify it. This
makes casting spells targeting living things much
more difficult. If you do cast a spell targeting a
creature, first determine the subject cost, using the
following table.

```
After determining the subject cost of your spell,
multiply the spell cost by the square of the subject
cost. For example, let’s say the spell to remove
poison from a dead human body costs 5 energy. If
that body is alive, that same spell now costs 45 (5 x
32 ). If you know the true name of the subject, the
subject cost becomes one.
```

```
Deoric Knowledge
In order to actually cast a spell, you must meet
two requirements: energy, and knowledge. We have
already covered calculating the spell cost, so we will
now cover how knowledge of domains and
techniques affects the casting.
For each domain and technique of Deoric, you
will have an associated rank of knowledge. By
default, a new character starts with zero ranks of
knowledge in each domain and technique. As you
increase your ranks of knowledge, it will allow you
to invent new Deoric spells, as well as have higher
odds of success at casting Deoric spells.
```

```
Casting the Spell
When casting a spell, there are two things to
determine. The first is if you are reading the spell, or
reciting it from memory. Reading it is more likely to
result in a successful casting, but is often less
convenient.
```

```
Subject Costs
Subject Cost
Small creatures 1
Medium-sized, non-sentient creatures 2
Magical, non-sentient creatures, most
humans
```

### 3

```
Mythical creatures 4
Heroes 5
Dragons 6
```

The second thing to determine is your
comfortability with the domains and techniques used
in the spell. If your rank in knowledge for the
domains and techniques is greater than or equal to
the ranks defined in the spell, than you are much less
likely to fail. On the other hand, if you do not meet
the knowledge requirements, you won’t even be able
to cast the spell unless you are reading from a
written source, and even then, you may fail.

the Knowledge
