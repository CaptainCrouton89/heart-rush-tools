defines how powerful the spells contained can be.
Larger artifacts, made of more magically potent
materials, can store more powerful spells, while
smaller artifacts with less valuable materials can
hold only weaker spells. To determine the capacity
of an item, sum the value of the all of the magical

```
materials used in the item. You can see the values of
each material in the chart below.
When you enchant an item, the item must have
magical capacity greater than or equal to the spell
cost of the spell you wish to enchant the item with.
Upon enchanting the item, subtract the spellâ€™s spell
cost from the capacity of the item to get the new,
remaining capacity of the item. A single item can
have multiple enchantments on it, so long as it has
the capacity for all of them.

Enchanting the Artifact
To enchant an artifact with a Deoric spell, you
must meet all of the knowledge requirements for the
domain and technique of the spell, as well as the
additional energy costs.
Although the materials of the artifact provide
some of the energy, sacrifice is still required to
enchant an item. With higher sacrifice, the item can
be used more frequently, while with less sacrifice, it
```

```
Materials With Magical Potency
Material Cost per Lb
Obsidian 5
Silver 20
Dragon Bone 60
Dragon Blood 100
Gold 6,000
Gems 7,500
Platinum 10,000
Red Gold 20,000
Titan Blood 25,000
Titan Bone 25,000
Astrum 50,000
Malstaric Ash 50,000
```

can only be used rarely. To determine how much
additional soul energy is required for a specific
frequency of casting, refer to the table below, and
multiply the energy cost of the spell by the energy
multiplier from that row.
While enchanting an artifact, the required soul
energy is used up and channeled into the artifact
throughout the process. Each day, you must spend 8
hours in a workshop with access to engraving tools,
and must contribute an amount of spirit energy no
less than the energy required for a full casting of that
spell. Once you have contributed an amount of spirit
energy equal to or greater than the total soul energy
required for the enchantment, you are finished
enchanting the item. This takes a minimum of one
day.

Setting the Activation

The last step in the enchantment process is
determining the activation trigger for the spell stored
within your artifact. There are several types of
triggers you can create, determined by your skill as a
runescribe and enchanter. Unless otherwise stated,
you can only craft items that can be activated at
extremely slow speed.

```
Extremely Slow
The spell is activated after one hour of use.
```

```
Very Slow
The spell is activated after one minute of use.
```

```
Slow
The spell can be activated as an action.
```

```
Quick
The spell can be activated without an action.
```

```
Immediate
The spell can be activated without an action at
instant speed.
```

```
Pas s i v e
The spell is always active.
```
