## Building Your Char acter

As you make a character in Heart Rush,
remember that at the center of every Heart Rush
character is their heart. It is the foundation on which
you build your life, your soul; it is the chassis and
essence of your decisions and their consequences;
and it is what drives you forward. You are building
an entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.

You r D r e a m

With this in mind, build a character that has a
vision towards what they want to achieve. You
should have a dream of what you want to do in the
world, one that is complex and difficult and worthy
of the caliber of legend you wish to become.
Remember—you determine the direction the story
takes. There’s no goal to this game besides the one
you set for yourself. So speak with your GM about
the world in which the game takes place, and figure
out how you want to be remembered. It’s your story,
and the stakes are low, so it’s okay to set your sights
high.
Once you have come up with something, write
this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit
or add to it later.

You r V i t al s

These are the core-most stats of your character.
They represent the raw capabilities and limits of
your mind and body.

```
Experience
When the game begins, you will start with some
experience (XP). During the game and between
sessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills,
abilities, and more. See the Spending Experience
section to learn more. After making your character,
you may begin spending your XP.
```

```
Ability Dice
Players have four important stats—might, agility,
cunning, and presence. These traits define your
physical and mental abilities, and are used to
determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task
you attempt to do.
```

```
Might
Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude.
High might allows you to push through locked doors,
lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles
without rest.
```

```
Agilit y
Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and
reflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling
rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a
summersault on a tightrope.
```

```
Cunning
Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses.
High cunning allows you to recall information
you’ve learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and
discern fact from fiction.
```

Presence

Presence is your charm, charisma, and social
influence. High presence allows you to persuade
guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did
it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone
about it.

Assigning Dice to Your Core Stats

Your prowess in each of these abilities is
represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task
that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the
ability’s corresponding die and add it to the result.
The first step in creating your character is
determining which dice you will use for which stat.
Typical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability,
reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When
you create your character, assign a d6 to two of your
abilities, and a d4 to the remaining two.

Movement

By default, you have a 60 feet move speed. That
means that when you take the dash action (see the
Combat section), you can cover that distance. Note
that your move speed is negatively effected by
equipment penalties (like armor).
When swimming, you have a swim speed of 15
feet. This is also negatively effected by equipment
penalties: don’t swim with heavy armor on.
When climbing, your move speed is 5 feet. This
is not affected by equipment penalties.

Health

The health of your character is represented by a
combination of your hit points, heart die, and
wounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take
wounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will
fall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and
taking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too

```
many wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of
these systems will be explained further in the
following sections.
```

```
Hit Points
Hit points represent your physical health.
Damage causes your hit points to fall by a
corresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer
to death. When you create a character, you start at 40
hit points. If your hit points ever reach 0, you can
choose to immediately go unconscious. If you don’t,
you go unconscious after 10 minutes if your hit
points are still at 0.
Your hit points can go negative as well. If your
hit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of
your maximum hit points, you die.
When you take a long rest, your hit points return
to their maximum.
```

```
Heart Die
Your heart die represents your stamina. It
manifests itself when you roll dice to perform
challenging actions. With very few exceptions, this
die will be part of every roll you make. When you
create a character, it starts at a maximum of a d8.
Other creatures can have larger or smaller heart
dice. A rat, for example, will only have a d4 heart
die, while an adult dragon would use a d20. It is
possible to increase your own heart die beyond a d8,
but it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.
Sometimes, there will be effects that cause your
heart die to increase or decrease. This means
replacing your heart die with a die of a larger or
smaller size. For example, decreasing your heart die
from a d8 would mean replacing it with a d6.
```

```
Wou n ds
When you take damage in Heart Rush, it can
mean different things depending on how much
damage you take. If it’s less than 10 damage, this
```

represents minor injuries—nothing that poses a real
threat. However, if you take 10 or more damage, this
represents something serious—a wound. The exact
details of taking wounds and healing them will be
described later in the Combat section.

Your Niche

Kin & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and
has a different upbringing. When you create a
character, choose a race from the Kin & Culture
section. You gain the aspects and abilities that come
from choosing that race.
Many races have multiple heritages within that
race. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities
of the race, as well as a those of a chosen heritage.

Ta l e n t s

Talents are specialized abilities that you know
and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing
your play style and differentiating you from anyone
else in the world. Although you do not start with any
talents, they can be purchased with XP, with which
you start the game and can immediately use to buy
talents.

Background

Your background describes your past life and
skills. Choose up to three professions and distribute
4 ranks between them. They can all be in one, or
they can be spread between them. Whenever you
make a skill check that one or more of your
professions would apply to, add your rank in the
relevant professions to that roll.

```
Aspects
For every facet of your character that cannot be
described with abilities and skills, they can be
described with aspects. Your aspects describe the
features and traits from your personality,
background, and experiences that make you distinct
—both positive and negative.
When you first create your character, you gain
three destiny points (DP). You will gain and lose DP
each session as you spend them to benefit from your
positive aspects and gain them by letting your
negative ones shine through. If you ever start a
session with fewer than three DP, you instead start
with three DP. You cannot have more than 10 DP.
As you play your character, you will gather more
aspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has
two parts: its description, and its rank.
```

```
Description
The description describes the aspect as a whole,
and should be a phrase or a few words to describe
your character. It should be a significant personality
trait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed
title, or some sort of reputation. For example,
“Bullheaded,” “Record everything,” “Chronic
headaches,” “Kleptomaniac,” “Fortune teller,”
“Leave no one behind,” “I fear nothing,” “I can see
straight into your soul” and “I want revenge for my
father” can all be aspect descriptions. Do not choose
generic things, like “good at most thing” or “lucky”,
```

```
Example
Let’s say you choose “Diplomat” and “Tutor
for Nobility” as your professions, and distribute 3
ranks to the first, and 1 rank to the latter. If you
were making a skill check to persuade someone of
something, you could add 3 to that roll due to your
background as a diplomat.
```

since they will apply to everything, or be too vague
to decide if they should apply to a situation. If the
GM says your aspect description is too generic, you
need to choose a new one, or make it more specific.

Rank

Next, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an
aspect represents how influential that aspect is over
who you are, and will determine the modifier to your
rolls. The rank will be a number between one and
five, though in some cases it can be increased even
further.

Using Your Aspect for Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an
aspect’s rank, you may add that much to any skill
check. In order to use this, whatever roll you are
making must align with the meaning of your aspect,
as approved by the GM.
For example, if you had the aspect “Leave no
one behind” at rank two, and you were trying to save
a friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and
add 2 to a die roll made to break open the bars of the
cell.
Or, for example, if you had the aspect “I want
revenge for my father” at rank four, you could spend
four DP and add 4 to any skill check that was related
to getting revenge for your father.
If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll,
use only the highest ranking aspect that applies.

Using Your Aspect for Destiny Points

In contrast, if an aspect would complicate a
situation or indicate you were bad at something, you
may choose to do whatever your aspect would
suggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect’s
rank.
“Bum leg,” “Kleptomaniac,” and “Quick to draw
my sword” are examples of negative aspects. If you
role-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the

```
GM will award DP. For example, if a bookstore
owner insults you, and you have the aspect “Quick to
draw my sword” at rank three, you would gain three
DP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-
owner.
Likewise, if you were chasing after a fleeing
thief, rather than making a skill check to keep up
with them, you could choose to fail the roll, citing
your bum leg and taking DP corresponding to the
rank of the aspect.
```

```
Creating Your Aspects
When you create your character, create two
aspects. You will gain two more from your race and
culture and you may gain more throughout the game.
All aspects start at rank one when they are created,
unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater
than rank five.
When creating an aspect, it is generally a good
idea to have aspects with both positive and negative
sides to them. Without any negative aspects, you
have no way of gaining more destiny points, and
therefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Also look
out for aspects that can be both positive and negative
```

### BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

```
Example
Let’s say you have the aspects “Diplomat” at
rank 2, and “I need revenge for my family” at
rank 3. You have just met the queen and are
trying to convince her that civil war is imminent.
When you make the skill check to convince her
of this truth, you spend 3 DP to increase your roll
by 3, successfully convincing her. However,
moments later you find out that the queen herself
was complicit in your family’s murders. The GM
invokes you aspect for revenge—you gain 2 DP,
but must now exact revenge, or else be forced to
pay 2 DP instead.
