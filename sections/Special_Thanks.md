## Special Thanks

Jess

The first person to see all the drivel that gets
spewed onto these pages. Full of wisdom and
sardonic humor, and has been the best wall I’ve ever
had the honor to bounce ideas off of for Heart Rush.

Soren

You have suffered through countless reworks of
characters where I have been forced to change rules
to mitigate your inventive builds. You have been the
excel-spreadsheet-guru-master-of-balance. You even
play tested the game and ran it as a GM once early
on—a formidable task, considering the state of the
rules at the time. Any single one of those roles is
enough to warrant significant thanks. You have been
invaluable to this project, and without your help, I
doubt Heart Rush would be here today.

Jakob

You have been a constant source of hype,
excitement, and constructive feedback for Heart
Rush. You stuck through it as I put you through some
pretty terrible iterations of RPG game design, and
not only that, but helped me figure out exactly what
worked, and what didn’t. Your encouragement
helped me carry through.

Carl

Whether you intended to or not, talking to you
about Heart Rush and hearing you get excited about
how you’re going to beat face with new talent-
synergies has never ceased to inspire me to work
harder and better. It’s a pleasure to write mechanics

```
for someone who so thoroughly enjoys using them.
And the dice script! Making that was fun.

Having a constant group of friends who were
always down to play test whatever new shenanigans
I had cooked up is a rare treat. The rules changed
over and over—even on the fly, and I would (and
still do) forget how mechanics worked mid-game.
Those are both things many groups would never be
willing to put up with. But you guys did, and for
that, I am grateful.

When I had a new idea, and didn’t know what to
do with it, you all were there to help me figure it out.
You offered your insights, thoughts, and feedback,
and I loved all of it. It solved a lot of questions for
me. Thank you.

That’s right—I didn’t forget about you guys
either. That was a lot of game time we fit into just a
few months, and it was epic. I’m sure it helped me
develop HR a bit, but most of all, it was a
phenomenally fun time. I miss you guys.
