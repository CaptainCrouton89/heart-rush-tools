their way past those who can’t read their actions, and
get to make an attack against a single creature in the
engagement that didn’t take the cunning stance.
Creatures that chose the agility stance can make their
attack rolls after all of the cunning stance attack rolls
have been made.
Also, if you choose this stance, you may take the
sidestep action for free during the engagement, right
before or after you make your attack. Creatures that
choose to attack before moving get to attack before
creatures that sidestep and then attack. If creatures
on opposite sides of a fight get to move via the
agility stance, both sides should alternate who
moves, starting with whichever side was originally
engaged with.

Might

Those who chose might are able to crush those
who are not agile enough to get out of the way, and
get to make an attack against a single creature in the
engagement that didn’t take the agility stance.
Creatures that chose the might stance make their
attack rolls last.
Additionally, whenever you attack a creature
defending with the cunning stance, you trigger your

```
weapon’s might stance bonus. Check out the
Weapons section to learn more.
```

```
Defensive
Anyone who chose the defensive stance does not
get to attack, but will not take as much damage.
After subtracting your defense from an attack, halve
the remaining damage, rounding up.
```

```
Resolution
After everyone has revealed their stance, it is
time for attacks. Everyone may attack one other
character that their stance beats, and is within range
of their weapon. All stances beat defensive stance. If
no one else took a stance that they could beat, or
they aren’t in range of your weapon, you cannot
attack in this engagement.
Attacks should happen in order of
1.Cunning
2.Agility
3.Might.
Starting with cunning, anyone who chose the
cunning stance may choose to attack each other or
anyone who chose the agility or defensive stance.
Proceed in order.
Although attacks of the same stance may not
literally happen simultaneously, treat them as though
they did. For example, if you push a creature away
with a melee weapon using the might stance, it
cannot prevent them from attacking a creature that
they were previously in range of hitting with the
might stance. Likewise, if the attack would kill them,
they still get to hit another creature first.
Note that if an attack pushes a target before the
target's stance goes, such as if a cunning attacker
pushed someone who had chosen agility, the target
might not be in range of anyone any more, and
would be unable to attack or be attacked during the
subsequent turns for the remaining stances.
```

### COMBAT

At tacking

If you get to attack someone, you make an attack
roll consisting of your heart die + ability die for the
stance you chose + weapon die. Then, the defending
creature makes a defense roll using their heart die +
ability die corresponding to the stance you chose +
armor bonuses.
After both sides roll, the defender then takes
damage equal to the the result of the attack roll
minus the defense roll. If this would be negative, the

```
defender instead takes no damage. See the next
section to determine how damage is dealt with.
Note that if you are attacking someone who is
attacking you back with the same stance, make
contested attack rolls rather than two separate attack
and defense rolls.
Anyone can attack someone who takes the
defense stance. Make contested rolls as normal, but
the resulting damage is halved.
```

```
Example
You initiate a fight, and dash towards the undead orc in front of you. Priority passes to the enemies. The
orc’s undead wolf dashes, coming adjacent to you as well. Priority passes back to you and allies. Your ally
decides she wants to shoot the first orc with an arrow, announcing she’s entering an engagement. Since an
engagement has started, nobody can use abilities that aren’t instant now.
You decide to join the engagement, since you can attack the orc too. The undead hound joins the
engagement as well. The orc is already in the engagement, so it doesn’t have to use its action to join.
The engagement begins. You coordinate with your archer ally—you’ll choose might, she’ll choose
agility. You announce you’re ready, and stances are revealed. The orc chose might, and the hound chose
cunning. Time to resolve attacks.
1.Cunning happens first. Although cunning beats agility, the hound is not adjacent to your archer friend,
so the hound does nothing.
2.Agility comes next. Your ally chose agility, which beats the might stance of the orc. Your ally, seeing
she’s got the upper hand, decides to user her Execute ability, meaning her attack will deal a lot more
damage. She makes an attack roll against the orc, and the orc makes a defense roll. The orc decides it’s
more damage than he’s interested in, and decides to reduce his heart die to halve the damage. He remains
alive.
3.After agility comes might. You and the orc both chose might. Since you chose might, you can attack
either the orc (since you tied stances), or the hound (might beats cunning). You decide to attack the orc
since the orc is a greater threat and you want him dead. However, the orc decided to attack you as well,
since you were its only target. You each make contested attack rolls, with the loser taking the difference in
damage. Unfortunately you roll a bit lower, so you end up taking a few points of damage.
The engagement ends, since everyone who can attack has done so. The enemies now have priority. At
this point, nobody except for the orc has an action left, since the orc didn’t have to use an action to join the
engagement (they were forced to join). The orc might enter an engagement again with you, in which case
nobody else would have actions left to join, or they might not. The round continues.
```

Priority After the Engagement

Priority passes to side that was targeted when the
engagement first started, and continues as usual.

Ta k i n g D a m ag e

When you take damage, you can choose to use
some of your stamina to “shrug off” or "dodge" the
injury. In this case, you take half as much damage,
but your heart die falls one size. If you cannot
decrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you
must take the full amount of damage.
Regardless, whatever damage you do take gets
subtracted from your hit points. If this would cause
your hit points to reach a negative amount equal to
your maximum hit points, you are dead.

More Than 10 Damage

If you take 10 or more damage, this represents
serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit
points, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain
English description of the wound. For example, a
wound could be “a nasty gash in your arm,” or “a
fractured leg,” or “your guts are spilling out”. Write
this down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound.
The rank is equal to the amount of damage you took.
Read more about wounds in the next section.

Wou n ds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points.
Whenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase
your hit points beyond your normal maximum minus
the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you
normally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have
23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit
points.
Outside of combat, wounds are like aspects,
which you can read about in the Aspects section

```
(page 10). Since they have a description and a rank,
you or the GM can invoke them for a penalty on a
roll equal to the rank of the wound, in exchange for
DP equal to the rank of the wound, up to 5.
```

```
Tr e a t i n g W ou n ds
Whenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it
treated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large
amount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a
medicine skill check and reduce the rank of all
untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by
the rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's
rank below zero, remove the wound completely.
If you are treating your own wounds, you have
disadvantage.
You can treat any number of wounds at once, but
once a wound has been treated it cannot be treated
again. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal
over time when you take long rests. See the Rests &
Healing section for more details.
```

```
Zero Hit Points
When your hit points reach zero, you are in bad
condition. If you wish, you may choose to go
```

### COMBAT

```
Example
You are at 25 hit points, and have a d6 heart
die. You lose an engagement and they are going
to deal 30 damage. This won’t kill you, but it’ll
put you below 0, meaning you’d go unconscious
after 10 minutes. You don’t want this, so you
instead choose to decrement your heart die, going
down to a d4. Instead of 30 damage, you take 15,
going down to 10 hit points. Then, because you
took over 10 damage, you take a wound. The GM
tells you that that your leg is badly smashed. You
write down “Smashed leg: 15”. That’s going to
suck.
```

unconscious. If you do not, you fall unconscious
anyway after 10 minutes. If you take damage while
at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and
any wounds—you can go into the negative.
If your hit points ever reach an amount equal to
or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.
Once you are unconscious, you remain
unconscious so long as your hit points are zero or
fewer.
You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by
taking rests. Read more in the Rests & Healing
section.

Other Offensive

Act ions

If you want to do something to an enemy other
than hit it with a weapon, such as grapple it, climb
onto it, or otherwise mess with it, it still begins with
winning an engagement. However, you must win the
engagement by directly beating their stance—both
choosing the same stance does not let you perform
these types of acts. Assuming you have directly
beaten their stance, you may forgo your attack roll
and instead use one of these other options. If you do,

```
the effects of the offensive action occur after all
attack rolls have been made.
Some of these options requires a contested skill
check, rather than an attack and defense roll. These
contested checks still receive advantage or
disadvantage as though they were an attack or
defense roll of their corresponding ability, but they
should not use any additional dice (such as from
your weapon) or bonuses from armor.
```

```
Grappling
Make a might ability check against an adjacent
creature, contested by the creature’s own might or
agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it
gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level
of size difference.
If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You
gain the condition grappling and the opposing
creature gains the condition grappled.
Unless otherwise specified, at least one hand
must be free to grapple another creature. You can
grapple with one or two hands. If grappling with
```

```
Example
You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before
it moves past you and attacks your badly hurt
friend. You enter an engagement with it, choose
stances, and stances are revealed. You chose
cunning, and it chose agility. Since cunning beats
agility, you get to attack. However, since you’re
trying to grapple it, you decide not to attack, and
instead make a might check. Your ally used the
help action earlier in the round, so you have
advantage. The wolf makes an agility check to
avoid getting grappled, but it rolls less than you.
The wolf is now grappled, and you are now
grappling. The wolf is stuck.
```

```
Why Would I Go Unconscious??
If you’re in a nasty fight, combatants tend
to try to attack the people who are still fighting
back. If you go unconscious, people usually
won’t view you as a threat, so you’re a lot less
likely to be attacked (and potentially die).
Things trying to eat you generally don’t abide
by this, so in some cases this is definitely not
recommended...
```

only one hand, halve your grapple ability check,
rounding up.
A creature can only be grappled by one creature
at a time, and can only grapple one creature at a
time.
While grappling a creature, rather than pushing
