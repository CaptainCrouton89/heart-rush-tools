the creature when you use the might stance, you may
choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage
for every size greater you are than the grappled
creature.

Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes
larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check
contested by the creature’s might or agility ability
check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the
creature. So long as you are on the creature, you
have the _creature climber_ condition. Likewise, the
climbed on creature has the _climbed on_ condition.
A creature can only climb on one creature at a
time.

Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform some
other sort of option that interferes with your target.
This could be represented by throwing sand in their
eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching
them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target
with this ability.
Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of
  weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is
  no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature 5 feet. It travels 5 feet less for
  every size larger than you it is, and 5 feet more for
  every size smaller. The creature gains 2 levels of
  off-balanced.

```
Stunt
Choose your own effect, with the GM’s
permission. This could be something like stealing an
item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their
sword by the blade to turn it into clay, trying to taunt
the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging
into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet.
In these cases, make a contested ability check
against the creature.
```

Special

Circumstances

```
Surprise
In some cases when combat begins, one or more
parties will be completely surprised, giving anyone
who was already prepared to fight a large advantage.
Special rules apply in these circumstances.
A creature is not surprised if they can see their
opponent before the round begins, and they are
unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or don’t
know their opponent.
If one of the parties in an encounter is completely
surprised by combat, then each un-surprised creature
can use their action to make an opportunity attack,
and each surprised creature does not get to use
abilities or move on the first round of combat.
```

```
At tacking t he He lple ss
Sometimes, you will make attacks against
creatures that are completely unable to defend
themselves. At the GM’s discretion, you may make
an opportunity attack against the creature.
```

### COMBAT

Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also
choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

Cover

Cover is an important part of staying alive—if
you remain behind cover, you remain safe from
ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types
of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist
between the attacker and the defender. Determining
what type of cover you have from an attacker can be
done by drawing imaginary lines between any one
point on the attacker and each corner of a square that
the enemy takes the space of. For each line that is
obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of
disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four
lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack
that creature.
Sometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to
the line blocked method of determining cover. It is
then up to the GM to decide how much cover should
be awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small
but not very helpful like a small tree in the way of
your shot will provide one level of cover. Things that
the defender has to poke their body out from behind
to attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a
couch, provide two levels of cover. Lastly, things
that are specifically designed for uni-directional
attacks, such as arrow slits, will provide three levels
of cover.
