## Equipment & Gear

Encumbrance

Your capacity for carrying stuff is tracked using
encumbrance points (EP), each representing about
five pounds of weight. Your maximum EP is equal to
6 plus half of your might die. For example, if you
have a d4, your maximum EP is 8. This doesn’t mean
you can’t carry more than 40 (8 \* 5) pounds, it just
means that you can’t carry more than that for hours
at a time without becoming exhausted and having to
make endurance checks on a case by case basis, as
determined by the GM.
Different adventuring gear has different EP
values. You can see the EP values and prices of all
gear in the table below. Regardless of if you're
wearing the gear or carrying it, if it's on you, the EP
counts against your maximum EP.

Gear Notes EP Price

```
Some of the gear in the table have limited uses, denoted by the “dX uses”. If something has dX uses, then you should roll an X-sided die. If the result is a 1,
then the die decreases in size. If that would occur on a d4, then instead, the item is used up.
