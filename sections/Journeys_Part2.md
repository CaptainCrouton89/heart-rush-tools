should describe the activities of the party like a
montage. You are welcome to chime in to describe
what you are doing as you travel, but this gameplay
occurs at macro pace. The GM may describe the
highlights of the journey, small oddities you may
have noticed along the trail, but nothing that out of
the ordinary.
The second mode of travel is action mode. In
action mode, play returns to micro paceâ€”you're
back to deciding what you want to do, moment to
moment, scene by scene.
During a journey, most of the distance traveled
will likely occur in travel mode. However, when
```

GM Note
For advice on how to make and run
interesting events, see the Travel Events section.
```

survival becomes a challenge, or notable incidents
occur, the journey will switch to action mode and
you and your party will have to figure out how to
deal with it. Once you have dealt with whatever
came up, along with whatever other fallout came of
it, you may return to travel mode and continue along
your journey.

GM breaks trip into segments of terrain. Each
segment requires X successful travel checks to get
through uneventfully, and is Y days of travel long.
Gm should also make Z number of events to put in
throughout the journey.

```
Roll each check, as necessary.
```

As you get to different places along the journey,
if you had been in travel mode it triggers a re-roll.
All failures occur simultaneously.

When you fail roll, GM chooses which one
actually causes the journey to grind to a halt. The
rest of the failures just impose disadvantage on the
next check to that roll.

```
Each travel segment should have a chance of

Split trip into segments of terrain. Each terrain
segment has its own travel mode roll. GM should
sprinkle those failures in wherever they see fit while
players are in that section. Once action mode has
begun, the GM can spend those failures on failures
during action mode.

When in action mode, the check to hunt is much
more interactive. Roll to find animals, roll to kkill

```
them, the animals you find are random duration
worth of food. Other people can help for advantage.
Collecting water failure means you have to keep
traveling into the night to find some.
Shelter failure means you need to keep traveling,
or not sleep or find a more dangerous place to spend
the night.
Navigation failure means you make no progress
and have a chance to hit a new encounter. Can make
one in the day.
When action mode begins, have days of food
equal to surplus on food finding roll. Roll 1 higher,
and you have one extra day of food. All canteens are
full.
Can resume travel mode once more than half of
the party has finished a successful long rest.
```

```
1.Segment trip as necessary between different
terrains, if present. Many trips will have just one
terrain and tehrefore just one segment.
2.Approximate length of each segment in miles
and time
3.Add X events to the trip. They can come up
whenever, though at least one per terrain is good
idea.
4.May Y rolls for each necessity for each
segment, in order. If the segment requires 4 rolls,
then the first roll represents the first quarter of the
distance traveled.
5.Whenever a roll is failed, things go to shit
immediately. GM chooses which roll causes party
to fail. The remaining ones just act as
disadvantage on the rolls during action phase.
