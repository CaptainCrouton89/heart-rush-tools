Noncombat

Ta l e n t s

```
Adherence
Heart ability. Handmagic.
As an action, you may point at a non-living,
unoccupied object or space within 30 feet. Up to a 5-
foot cube worth of volume of that object becomes
covered in an extremely sticky slime, with sticking
power equal to 100 pounds. If a creature steps on the
object, they must use their action to step free of it,
and the space counts as difficult terrain.
Destiny Level
The sticking force increases to 200 pounds.
Freeing oneself from the slime requires a CN 12
might check.
```

```
Animate Object
Heart ability. Full action. Handmagic.
As an action, you may point at an inanimate
object within 30 feet that that could fit in a 5-foot
cube. The object obeys your commands to best of its
ability, and gains a move speed of 15 feet. This effect
lasts for as long as you remain pointing at it. You
```

cannot animate more than one object using this
ability.

Destiny Level
You may manipulate up to three objects at once
with this ability. You do not have to point at them to
animate them, but they must remain within 30 feet.
The objects must fit in a 10-foot cube.

Ancient Visions

_Weekly ability. Handmagic._
You may touch an object to see its past. Choose
one:

- Origin: You see how the object was created.
- Pinnacle: You see a moment in the objectâ€™s past
  when it was surrounded by the most excitement
  and activity.
- Recent: You see the events around the last time
  the object was touched by another creature.
  Destiny Level
  In addition, you may ask the object any question
  about its past. The object will answer the question
  truthfully.

Anthropomorphize

_Heart ability. Handmagic._
As an action, you may lay your hand on a non-
hostile animal. The following effects last for one
hour. Choose two:

- It grows to human size and human appearance
- It gains human intelligence and the ability to
  speak in a language you know.
- The duration of the spell increases to 1 day.
  Destiny Level
  You may choose all three effects, and you only
  have to be within 40 feet of target to use this ability.

```
At t r action
Heart ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Force
Choose any two inanimate objects. Those objects
attract each other with 50 pounds of force if they are
within 10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you
choose two new objects.
Destiny Level
You may choose up to five objects, and the
attractive force begins at 100 feet away. If you use
this ability on the same objects every day for a
month, the effect becomes permanent.
```

```
Assembly Not Required
Passive ability. Handmagic.
Any of your body parts may be detached and
reattached to their original positions at will, without
damaging them. You may control all of your body
parts at will.
Destiny Level
If you spend one minute with a dismembered
body part of another humanoid, you may control that
limb as well, as though it were your own. You may
control up to nine body parts in this fashion.
