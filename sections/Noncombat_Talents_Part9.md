than yourself. That creature’s next roll is replaced
with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a

```
complication occurs. At any time, the GM may
replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum
possible result. It cannot be rerolled or replaced. The
GM may not do so again until you use this ability
again.
Destiny Level
This no longer takes an action.
```

```
Pinky Swear
Passive ability. Handmagic.
While the smallest finger of your hand is
interlocked with the smallest finger of another
person’s hand, neither you nor that person can
knowingly utter a lie.
Destiny Level
While your fingers are intertwined, both people
are compelled to speak truthfully. They cannot
withhold information.
```

```
Poisoner
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
So long as you can disguise it as another action,
you automatically succeed on any check to slip
poison into someone’s food or drink, even while in
plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they
will not notice there is poison in their food, only that
they will not realize that you are poisoning the food
as you do it.
For every 10 times you digest a single type of
poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it,
and take 10 damage less from every instance of
damage it deals.
Destiny Level
You know your poisons. You immediately know
if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as
well as all of its properties.
```

### TA L E N T S

Rapid Growth
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may place your hand on a non-
living object that fits in a space somewhere between
a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows
to fill a 10-foot cube, or shrinks to fit a 2-inch cube,
though it will not grow if it is enclosed. The
transformation lasts for one hour, or until dismissed
as an action.

Destiny Level
The transformation lasts indefinitely, though you
may not use this ability on more than three different
objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases
to at 25-foot cube.

Repulsion

_Heart ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Force_
Choose any two objects. Those objects repulse
each other with 50 pounds of force if they are within
10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you
choose two new objects.

Destiny Level
You may choose up to 5 objects, and the
repulsive force begins at 100 feet away.

Rope Servant

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it
can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were
an extension of your arm, including floating straight
up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a
weapon. The control persists only while you hold the
rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

Destiny Level
The rope becomes unbreakably strong while
being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.

```
Ru nescribe
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may now begin making
handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and
practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you
can memorize that sign and tattoo hands with that
sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and
titan bone, which equates to about half the price of
getting a new handmagic sign.
Destiny Level
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may make the additional
modifications to a handmagic sign to make its
destiny level upgrade. You must spend a week
studying and practicing before memorizing and
inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.
```

```
Silver Tongue
Major ability. Handmagic.
As an action, you may charm a person you are
talking to. They gain 2 ranks of charmed towards
you for the next hour, after which they know they
were magically charmed by you. They lose all ranks
of charmed if you take a hostile action towards them.
Destiny Level
The effect lasts twelve hours rather than one. The
person does not realize they were charmed when the
effect ends.
```

```
Siren’s Song
Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are
enthralled with your performance, and struggle to
pull their gaze away. So long as you play and they
are not in obvious danger, they will approach you up
to 10 feet, and will not pull their gaze from you.
```

They have D3 on checks to notice their
