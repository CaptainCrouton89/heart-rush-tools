## Classes

Your class is the general role in combat that you
fill. It doesn’t say anything about what you do
outside of combat, and in games where combat is
more infrequent, your class will be less relevant to
gameplay compared to your aspects and talents.
There are three different classes—stronghearts,
battlehearts, and cleverhearts. Each has a distinct
combat style that makes them unique. Stronghearts
are beefier, and are responsible for preventing
enemies from killing their allies. Battlehearts dish
out the most damage, and are responsible for
downing enemies quickly. Cleverhearts fill a more
nebulous role of helping allies best fill their own
roles, and hurting the enemies in ways that make
them easier to deal with.
When you reach rank 1, choose one of the
classes and gain the abilities listed with the _Rank 1_
tag. Then, upon reaching rank 2, choose one of the
subclasses your class offers. Each subclass
specializes its own unique play style. For example, a
striker specializes in single targets, while a ravager
specializes in dishing out lots of damage to
everybody.

```
Within each subclass, there are three different
types of abilities: rank 2, rank 3, and rank 4 abilities.
Upon reaching each rank, gain the corresponding
abilities from your subclass.
```

Strongheart

```
Stronghearts are accustomed to taking the brunt
of the damage in a fight. They can survive more hits
than other classes, and do best when they are in the
thick of the fight. They generally have ways of
keeping enemies engaged with them, rather than
threatening their allies. Three types of stronghearts
exist—bastions, wrathguards, and vicehands.

### CLASSES

```
Part y C om p os i t ion
Heart Rush is a game where every role in
the party will play a critical role in a team fight.
Each class enables or takes advantage of the
synergistic abilities of other classes, so a party
where there is at least one of each class will
almost always perform better than a party that’s
missing one of the core classes. Obviously,
don’t feel like you have to choose a class
because the rest of your party wants to choose
the other classes—it’s just something to keep in
mind.
```

In the Thick of It
_Passive ability. Rank 1._
You excel when in the center of battle. For each
enemy adjacent to you, you get +1 to your attack and
defense rolls.

- Whenever you take damage, gain a rush
  point.
- Damage converts to damage you can attack
  back with
- Counter attacks
- HP as a spendable resource (wrath guard)

Cry of Defiance

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1._
You shout out, have a moment of inner peace, or
by some other means recenter yourself in the
moment. Choose one:

- Remove all levels of one condition from
  yourself.
- Remove one level of every condition from
  yourself.
- Gain hit points equal to your maximum heart
  die.

Subcl ass: Bastion

_Also known as: Guardian, Knight, Paladin_
A burly woman stands her ground, unyielding as
a wall, shielding the frightened villager behind her.
Each time a wolf leaps, she strikes, knocking them
aside, holding the line and keeping the pack at bay.
Blow after blow rains down on a hulking
minotaur, surrounded by enemies. With a thunderous
roar, he rears up, shaking off the attackers and
sending them sprawling. The flurry of strikes seems
to have left him unscathed.
A young dwarf in heavy armor strides calmly
through the chaos of battle, his massive great
hammer resting on his shoulder. Despite the storm of
blades around him, he remains unscathed, and with a

```
casual swing, he crushes enemies to the ground, as if
at his whim.
Bastions are living fortresses, impenetrable and
unmovable on the battlefield. They step in to shield
their allies, absorb devastating blows, and unleash
retribution on those foolish enough to ignore their
defense.
```

```
Guardian’s Sacrifice
Passive ability. Rank 2.
You have the ability to step in when those nearby
are in a vulnerable position. If a creature adjacent to
you is about to be harmed or attacked, and the attack,
defense, or damage rolls haven't been made yet, you
can choose to intervene and place yourself between
them and the source of harm. If it's an attack, you
make the defense roll and absorb the damage in their
place. If it's unavoidable damage, you can take that
on yourself too. You also have the option to switch
positions with the creature you're protecting. You can
only save one creature during a round, but you can
shield them from multiple sources of damage if
needed.
```

```
Violent Defense
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You hunker down, presenting a bristling wall of
defense. Until the end of the round, you may add
your weapon die to your defense rolls. If you would
make a defense roll and get a result greater than their
attack roll, the attacker takes damage equal to the
difference as you parry their blow and counterattack.
```

```
Hulking Blows
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Your blows are slow, but absolutely devastating.
After revealing stances, if you are wielding a heavy
melee weapon, you may declare your attack to be a
hulking blow. If you do, choose a creature in the
engagement that you are able to attack. That creature
```

may choose to forfeit all attack rolls during this
engagement and instead automatically dodge your
attack. If they don’t, you may double the result of all
dice from your attack roll.

Eternal Fortitude

_Major ability. Instant. Rank 4._
While others may fall, you fight on—nothing can
bring you to your knees. You may spend any number
of rush points. For each rush point spent, set aside
2d6. Whenever you make a defense roll, before
seeing your result, you may remove and then roll any
number of these dice and add them to your defense
roll.

Subcl ass: Vicehand

A massive orc clad in heavy armor strides
forward, the weight of his presence palpable. With a
swift, calculated movement, he snatches a charging
brigand by the wrist, halting the attack before it
begins. The brigand struggles, but the orc’s grip is
unyielding, yanking the brigand back and away from
his allies.
In the heart of the battlefield, a trollkin stands
firm, surrounded by chaos. With a fierce
determination, she locks onto an enemy warrior,
tackling him to the ground before pummeling him
into a pulp with her fists.
A hulking, bare chested warrior has wrestled a
dire lion to the ground. With terrifying strength, the
warrior begins to constrict the snarling but
completely helpless beast. As the seconds pass, the
snarling becomes weaker and weaker as the life is
squeezed from the mighty beast.
Vicehands are living clamps, expertly trained to
restrain and dominate a single target while shielding
their allies from harm. They thrive in melee combat,
using their strength to hold foes in check and disrupt
enemy plans, ensuring that no threat goes unchecked.

```
Vicehands gain the following abilities.
```

```
Grappler
Passive. Rank 2.
You do not have to directly beat a creature’s
stance to attempt to grapple them. You can grapple as
though you are one size larger than you are.
You have advantage on rolls to grapple other
creatures.
While grappling a creature, your movement
speed is 5 rather than 0.
```

```
Fists, Knees, and Elbows
Minor ability. Rank 3.
Until the end of the round, when you make an
unarmed attack roll against a creature you are
grappling, add your might die to the roll. Grappling
the creature does not impose disadvantage on your
attack rolls against the creature this round.
```

```
I Don’t Think So
Minor ability. Rank 3.
Make a grappling ability check against a creature
you are already grappling. On a success, choose one:
```

- If you are standing, move the grappled creature
  5 feet to a different space adjacent to you.
- The grappled creature cannot make sounds this
  round.
- You and the grappled creature fall prone.
- The creature takes a level of weakened, off-
  balanced, or dazed.

```
Cinch Down
Major ability. Speed. Rank 4
You may only use this ability if you are grappling
a creature. You gain the following benefits so long as
you remain grappling the creature. X is equal to the
number of rush points you spend on this ability.
```

- You get X levels of advantage on checks to
  maintain your grapple on the creature.

### CLASSES

- Each round, as an action, you may roll your
  might die X times and deal that much damage to
  the creature.
- The creature gains X levels of restrained so
  long as they are grappled.

Subcl ass: Wrathguard

_Also known as: Warrior, Sentinel, Barbarian_
A woman stands tall, war-hammer in hand,
daring the snarling werebear to make a move. When
the beast finally lunges, aiming to bypass her and
strike her ally, she reacts with lightning speed,
bringing her hammer down on its back with a
resounding crack, sending it crashing to the ground,
whimpering.
A knight, clad head to toe in gleaming plate mail,
stands firm at the center of the fray. Shield raised,
she swings her mace in wide arcs, keeping half a
dozen goblins at bay. They scramble to dodge her
whirling weapon, only to be cut down by her
advancing allies.
As two armies prepare to clash, a lone figure in
nothing but a kilt and a hammer charges out from the
front lines. Arrows rain down upon him, but he does
not falter. Reaching the enemy’s ranks, he unleashes
a sweeping blow, knocking three soldiers off their
feet, and the battle begins with his roar echoing
across the field.
Wrathguards are fierce, unyielding war
machines, thriving in the heart of combat. They can
withstand punishing blows and return them in kind,
and no matter how battered they are, they rise again,
ready to fight.
Wrathguards gain the following abilities.

Sentinel

_Passive ability. Rank 2._
You are always ready. Sidestepping does not let
enemies avoid your opportunity attacks.

```
Additionally, opportunity attacks do not require an
action or rush points.
```

```
I Didn’t Feel a Thing
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You are naturally tougher than nearly anyone you
know. You take half as much damage from the next
source of incoming damage, rounded down. If the
source would cause you to move, you move 10 feet
less. If the source would cause you to gain leveled
conditions, you gain those condition at one level
less.
```

```
Crippling Blows
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Your blows are powerful enough to knock people
off their feet. When you deal damage to a creature
with a heavy, melee weapon, choose one:
```

- **Beat Down ** : The creature cannot take the
  sidestep action until the beginning of the next
  round. If the creature is no more than one size
  larger than you, it is knocked prone. Otherwise, it
  instead takes two levels of weakened.
- ** Smash ** : The creature is knocked 10 feet away
  from you.

```
Battle Spirited
Major ability. Instant. Rank 4.
Whenever an ally is attacked by an enemy, you
op attack them.
Whenever in engagement where an enemy could
have attacked you but did not,
Whenever enemy uses its action to start or enter
engagement with anyone besides you...
Whenever an enemy attacks anyone other than
you, attacks you make against that enemy...
```

```
More attacks against more people: any enemy
that attacks an ally gets op attacked
```
