## OSR PbtA

```
Gritty, simulationist PbtA.
```

Are rules necessary? Simulate factions. Skills,
professions. Roll. Complications, bonuses.

Do players get to say what happens when they do
things? no.
Granularity of conversation, easily scalable up
and down.
Monsters are just a description, and a number to
represent their power in relation to the players.

- This giant spider is a “boss-level” threat.
  Therefore +2. (+3 for nearly lethal, +1 for nasty).
  It’s got the traits: “shoots web to ensnare
  enemies”, “venomous fangs”, and “climbs on
  walls and ceiling” (totally optional to write
  down) - As a +2 boss, numbers to beat are
  +2. Partial success, failure, etc.

```
Best of all worlds:
```

- GM Moves
- Aspects
- Enemies have difficulty which is just mod
  from basic values. Traits describe how the enemy
  behaves. Motivation/goals so you know how to
  run it.
- Professions as skills.
- Partial success mechanics
- Let players decide what they want to do. By
  attempting to do those things and failing,
  complications occur.
