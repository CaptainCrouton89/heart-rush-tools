communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled
Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are
sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most
respected member of a pride. They will make
unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is
chosen.
Outside these communities, Sharabha who have
willingly left do not practice many of their more
traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of
principles and morality.

Aspect of the Lion
Major ability.
You may channel your blood of Shara Bolasi,
and transform into a lion-like form. Your head
morphs into the head of a lion and claws grow on
your hands. While in this form, you gain the
following traits:
```

- Your jaws count as a heavy piercing weapon.
  Your claws count as light slashing weapons.
- Whenever you deal damage with your jaws to
  an enemy, you may choose to not let go. If you do,
  and if the creature is no more than one size larger
  than you, the creature takes a level of restrained
  until it spends its action and wins a might check
  against your might challenge number. While
  holding on, you cannot attack with your jaws
  again. Both you and the bitten creature have your
  move speeds reduced by half, and move together.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or
  manipulate fine objects.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

Elf

Elves are a race of fiercely independent, ancient,
culturally rich people. With lifespans five times the
length of a humans’, elves have a much broader
perspective on life and the world around them, and a
lot more time to explore and refine their passions.
Wars, politics, and the frivolities of other races are
far less important to most elven cultures.

Vitals

- Height: 5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Years of Experience

_Passive ability._
Gaining additional or upgrading your aspects
costs 2 less XP, for a minimum of 1, and your
maximum rank for each of your aspects is increased
by 3.

Amverela (High Elf)

The Amverela are the most prolific and long-
living of the elves, and most interactive with the
other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long
life times, but especially due to their extreme
wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are
some of the longest running ethnic identities among
all people on Alaria—having survived numerous
cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while
remaining relatively culturally intact.
They place a higher value on investing in
themselves, their relationships, and their
communities. This has led them to building some of
the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by
most standards.

```
The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and
are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects
of life.
```

```
Aspects

- Centuries of wisdom
- Cautious

```
Caerene (Wood Elf)
The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than
their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them
to more easily blend into the forests in which they
usually live.
Caerene are far more isolating than many other
races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial,
day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on
Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found
hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of
hiding and blending in with their natural
surroundings. An unobservant individual walking
through the middle of a Caerene village may not
even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the
Caerene.
Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding
balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They
place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and
immediate justice. There are no second chances in
Caerene culture.

Drasnian (Stout Dwarf)

Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and by far most
populous of the dwarven heritages, dating back to
before the Uline dwarves went underground.
Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with
softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and
live almost exclusively above ground or in homes
built into hillsides. They have a long history of both
prosperity and destitution, and through economic
trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement,
have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found
in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as
in several countries where Drasnians have settled
down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the
believed birthplace of the Drasnians.
As a whole, they value education, money, and
preserving their cultural and religious legacy.
Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating
worship, relationships, and one’s day-to-day life.

Uline (Chain Dwarf)
The Uline originated from a particularly
productive iron mine, many thousands of years ago.
The mine, which had struck a rich vein of ore was so
vast and deep that it would inevitably take more than
a generation to complete. Rather than journey to and
from the surface daily, they discovered that it was
more efficient to temporarily station some dwarves
within the mines for days, or even weeks at a time.
With time, these temporary stations became more
permanent residencies, and eventually, entire
settlements. These dwarves became the Uline—
named after the settlement that grew up in that first
mine. Today, the Uline are the most industrious of
the dwarves, preferring to live underground, mining,
and making their homes in the mountains beneath
the surface.
Living underground came with several
unexpected effects, that the Uline now embrace or
have adapted to. Beneath the surface, there are few
people who can interfere with a settlement’s growth.
Defense from invaders is easier when underground,
which has allowed the Uline to allocate more
resources towards magnificent palaces, inventions,
and other intellectual efforts. Additionally, within a
single generation, the number of earth attuned

### KIN & CULTURE

individuals increased drastically, enhancing the
population’s ability to mine and control their
environment underground.
However, underground life also came with
several hardships. Fish, fungi, and insects are nearly
the only things alive besides the monsters from the
deep, and little airflow and high temperatures deep
underground require complex air circulation systems
in place. The Uline have gotten around this latter
problem by implementing networks of air vents
leading to the surface, manipulated through long
chains, giving them their nickname of chain
dwarves.
Even more difficult to deal with were the
shadereavers and other monstrosities from the dark.
While the Aureum dwarves invented huge mirrored
passageways into the depths of the caves, using the
sun’s light to protect themselves from the creatures
of the dark, the Uline resorted to iron. To this day,
children are taught from a young age how to wield
the heavy iron blades and hammers used to defend
themselves from the monsters of the dark.
Living underground has shaped the Uline into a
rough, tough, and pragmatic group, but they are
usually goodnatured, and even sometimes downright
jolly. However, it is unwise to get into an argument
with most Uline; the Uline have done things in the
same way for thousands of years, and change is not
something many of them are welcome to. When
disagreement does arise, arbitrage usually falls on
higher ranking individuals within the community,
who will have final say.

Aspects

- Stubborn to a fault
- I respect true authority

```
Mountain-Born
Passive ability
You gain your choice of a basic attunement to
earth or darkness.

```
Au r e u m (Su n Dwarf)
In the early days of the Uline, when no more than
a few underground settlements existed, an upwelling
of shadereavers from deep below nearly wiped out
the underground population. Immediately, multiple
factions emerged proposing different ways to avoid
such catastrophes in the future. One of these such
factions determined that nothing but the light of the
sun could shield them from such monstrosities, and
swore to find a way to brings the sun’s light into the
depths of the Uline caves. While many of the Uline
thought this was impossible, and rejected the idea,
some latched on, and the Aureum were born.
The Aureum use complex systems of mirrors and
glass to illuminate their underground settlements
with the warm glow of sunlight. Within a few more
centuries, they had also discovered the secret to
storing liquid sunlight, keeping them safe even when
night came. Now, this liquid sunlight is smelted into
much of their armor and weapons, and keeps them
strong, and as they now believe, pure.
Aureum culture emphasizes law, honor, and
truth. When the Aureum first broke away from the
Uline, their leader, Aurea herself, promised to keep
her people safe, so long as her followers trusted her,
and followed her commands. They did, and she
carried through—permanently cementing the
importance of a promise and following one’s leader.
```

```
Aspects
```

- The law comes first
- My word is my bond

Su nsmith
_Major ability._
As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret
methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun’s
rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight
available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light
for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for
any one of the following abilities:

- Health and Rejuvenation. As an interact action,
  you may drink the flask and gain the benefits of a
  short rest.
- Smash. As an interact action, you may crush or
  throw your flask to cast _Blinding Sun_.
  Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so
  again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise
  or sunset to capture the sun’s rays. The sunlight
  within a flask expires after 12 hours.
