## Influence

Your influence is a general measurement of your
social power in society. As you gain fame or infamy,
your influence will increase, opening doors that were
previously closed to you.
When you first create your character, unless
otherwise noted, you start at zero levels of influence.
You can consult the following table to see the
approximate levels of influence of other people in
society.

```
Tr a de
See the Traders & Merchants rules section for
details. However, in summary, higher influence
allows you to find buyers and sellers who are willing
to buy or sell more product.
```

```
Social Encou n ters
Whenever you are interacting with someone who
has influence greater or less than you, the imbalance
of power can have powerful affect on the
effectiveness of your communication. At the GM’s
discretion, they may add levels of advantage or
disadvantage to rolls to intimidate, persuade, or
deceive to either member of a social interaction—
usually equal to half the difference in levels of
influence, rounded down.
For example, if a king, of influence 6 is trying to
persuade one of his subjects of influence 2, the king
would reasonably be granted 2 levels of advantage
on the roll. Likewise, if a peasant of influence 1 was
trying to intimidate a nobleman of influence 4, they
would have a level of disadvantage.

At t e n dan ts

As you gain influence, you may gain attendants
as well. Attendants are close servants who personally
serve you. You may get to know your attendants, but
they will not fight for you—they stick around to
serve your mundane needs in exchange for a share of
your prestige. They travel with you wherever you go,
have no cost, and if they die, a new one can usually
be found to take their place.
Different types of attendants exist that serve
different kinds of purposes. Each attendant, with the
exception of the generic type, will only do things
related to their title. For example, a footpad could
not make checks to heal you, and an interpreter
could not make checks to find clues at a crime scene.
However, occasionally, your attendants’ skills or
safety may be challenged. In these cases, you make
all rolls for your attendants. Treat all of your
attendants’ abilities as d6s. They have a 40 maximum
hit points and a d8 heart die, but will always retreat
or surrender in a fight. When making skill checks,
you may add your influence to their roll.
Although you can hire more attendants to cover
more of your needs, additional attendants will
require personal investment of game-time and/or
currency, while the ones granted from your influence
come for free.
When you reach level 4 influence, you gain one
attendant. At each level beyond 4, you gain an
additional attendant, and may switch out any number
of your attendants. You may gain attendants at any
settlement that is not hostile to you.

Cook

A personal cook prepares your meals for you.
They know what foods are edible and which ones
aren’t, and they can prepare a hearty meal to keep
you healthy.

```
While you have a cook, you cannot be poisoned
from foraged food. Additionally, so long as your
cook has a properly stocked kitchen, eating their
breakfast increases your hit points by 2X (but not
greater than your hit point capacity), where X is your
influence. Your cook can prepare food for up to 6
people, who all gain these benefits.
Multiple cooks do not cause stacking effects.
```

```
Disciple
A disciple is a student of your form of combat.
They seek to learn to fight the way you do, and will
follow you into combat unless told otherwise.
While you have a disciple, they will participate
in any fights you get into unless forbidden or
otherwise unable. They remain by your side
whenever possible, though are controlled by you.
Rather than roll combat for them, it is assumed they
help you. You may add half of your influence to your
A/D rolls.
```

```
Footpad
A footpad is your trusted, undercover servant,
capable of minor scouting missions and petty theft.
While you have a footpad, you can have them
scout out a settlement for a number of interesting and
valuable people, objects, and locations equal to your
influence.
Additionally, you may task your footpad with
shadowing a person. They make a stealth check
contested by the cunning challenge number of the
target. On a success, you can receive daily updates
on the target’s activities and location.
```

```
Healer
A healer may act as your assistant in your own
healing, or may personally attend to you when you
get back from a fight.
While you have a healer, they automatically
succeed on any checks to treat wounds less than or
```

equal to your influence, and automatically succeed
on checks to perform first aid on creatures with a
maximum wound level equal to or less than your
influence.

Interpreter

An interpreter understands, can speak, read, and
write many languages. They will act as a personal
translator for yourself and your company.
When you gain an interpreter, they can
communicate in all mediums in a number of
languages equal to your influence. Whenever you
gain influence, you can add a language. Your
interpreter can interpret for you and your party and
anyone you wish to speak to.
If you wish to switch languages known by your
interpreter, you will need a new interpreter.
Interpreters can not interpret magical languages.

Porter

A porter carries your gear for you, so you don’t
have to.
A porter can carry a number of slots equal to 30
times your influence level.

Sage

A sage is an expert in a field, and acts as your
personal, small walking library of knowledge on a
subject.
When you gain a sage, choose a subject. Rather
than make your own knowledge checks on that
subject, you may query your sage. They make the
same check, but add your full influence level rather
than half to the roll. They have advantage on the roll.

Apprentice

Apprentices are your personal mentees. They
seek your guidance and tutelage in a particular field
that you have become experienced in.

```
When you gain an apprentice, choose a field of
work, such as alchemy, smithing, or Deoric casting.
It can be nearly any profession, though your GM has
final say.
While you have your apprentice, you have
advantage on all skill checks made on tasks related
to your profession.
You can only have one apprentice at a time.
```

```
Smith
A personal smith will keep you and your party’s
weapons and armor in pristine condition, and can
make minor adjustments and tools out of metal.
While you have a smith, you and your party have
+ 1 to all A/D rolls, so long as you have allowed your
smit to tune up the weapons within the last month.
Multiple smiths do not cause stacking effects.
```

```
Stable Hand
A stable hand takes care of your animals. They
make sure they are well fed, taken care of, and in
good condition.
While you have a stable hand, you can travel
20% further each day while riding on an animal
cared for by your stablehand.
A stable hand can take care of up to 6 large
creatures, or 2 L2 creatures. For creatures larger than
L2, it requires a number of stable hands equal to the
size of the creature (L3 requires 3, L4 requires 4,
etc).
```

```
Body Guard
Body guards act as the last line of defense
between you and those who seek to have you dead.
They remain with you at nearly all times, and will
sacrifice themselves to keep you alive.
Body guards will not fight for you, and they
never partake in typical combat. However, if you
would take potentially lethal damage while outside a
typical combat (such as a falling rock, a sneak attack,
```

or a midnight assassination), they may be able to
save you. Whenever such an event might occur, they
take damage up to 10 times your influence level
before they die and any leftover damage is dealt to
you. This might take the form of them tackling you
out of the way of a large source of damage, or using
their life as the necessary distraction to prevent a
potential killer.
Multiple body guards do not cause stacking
effects. If you want additional safeguards, you will
need to find them through other means.

```
Gaining Influence
Influence is hard to gain, though not impossible.
Ultimately, it is up to the GM to determine when a
player should gain influence, but they should consult
the following table as guideline. In each table, the
right two column are ways that a player could gain
influence, while on the left column it shows the
minimum influence level of a player who’s met any
of the criteria in the row.
```

# Followers

If a player is a leader of a faction, is a religious
leader, or is a daemon, use this column to determine
their influence.

```
# Profoundly Changed Lives
If a player has saved people’s lives, conquered
them, or in some other way had a profound impact
on people, use this column.
```

```

If a player is a trader, use this column. Note that
after a certain point, you cannot raise your influence
any further from being a merchant.

Flaunting of Riches

If a player shows off their wealth in some way,
such as by constructing something opulent or
revealing an impressive heist, then use the value of
whatever object they are showing off to determine
where they sit in this column.
