```
As an action, you may make an illusion of a
single object within the range of your mist
manipulation. The illusion cannot be seen through,
and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion
until they have interacted with it in some way, at
which point the illusion fades from their sight.
Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of
another object, though they appear as three
dimensional objects, so they cannot be illusions of
darkness, empty space, or your immediate
surroundings.
If a creature has reason to suspect it is an
illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or
disappears, they may make a cunning check
contested by your cunning challenge number. On a
success, they see through the illusion.
Destiny Level
By agitating the molecules in the air, you can
also cause the illusion to emit realistic sounds of
your choice. You may manipulate the image and
sounds as an object interaction.

Nature’s Child
Passive ability. Handmagic.
You can sense basic intentions and communicate
simple ideas with wild animals. When you take this
talent, you may choose to limit this ability to only
one type of animal, such as ravens, spiders, or
wolves. If you do, those creatures will never attack
you and you have A3 on all interactions with those
creatures.
Destiny Level
As an action, you can summon forth wild
animals in a mile radius. If you have chosen a
specific animal, you gain exclusively that animal
instead.
```

Necromancy
_Major ability. Handmagic._
You can raise the dead. By sacrificing a creature,
you can reanimate another creature of the same type.
The ritual takes one hour, and at the end you have a
creature with stats identical to the dead creature, with
the same might die, d2 cunning, agility, and presence
dice, half of the hit point maximum, and no ability to
communicate. It loses any special combat abilities it
had, and obeys any orders you give it to the best of
its ability. You can have no more than one undead
creature under your control.

Destiny Level
You may create and control up to three undead
servants with this talent.

Observant
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
You have A4 on cunning checks to notice things.
In addition, so long as you can see someone’s
lips and understand the language they are speaking,
you know what they are saying, even if you can’t
hear them.

Destiny Level
Hidden attackers cannot make opportunity
attacks against you, you do not suffer any penalty
from attacking an obscured enemy, and obscured
enemies gain no advantage when attacking you.
In addition, if you spend your action watching a
creature fight for three rounds or more, you learn the
creature’s strengths and weaknesses, and have
advantage on all A/D rolls made against that
creature.

Oracle
_Monthly ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may choose a creature other
than yourself. That creature’s next roll is replaced
with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a

```
complication occurs. At any time, the GM may
replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum
possible result. It cannot be rerolled or replaced. The
GM may not do so again until you use this ability
again.
Destiny Level
This no longer takes an action.
```

```
Pinky Swear
Passive ability. Handmagic.
While the smallest finger of your hand is
interlocked with the smallest finger of another
person’s hand, neither you nor that person can
knowingly utter a lie.
Destiny Level
While your fingers are intertwined, both people
are compelled to speak truthfully. They cannot
withhold information.
```

```
Poisoner
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
So long as you can disguise it as another action,
you automatically succeed on any check to slip
poison into someone’s food or drink, even while in
plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they
will not notice there is poison in their food, only that
they will not realize that you are poisoning the food
as you do it.
For every 10 times you digest a single type of
poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it,
and take 10 damage less from every instance of
damage it deals.
Destiny Level
You know your poisons. You immediately know
if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as
well as all of its properties.
```

### TA L E N T S

Rapid Growth
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may place your hand on a non-
living object that fits in a space somewhere between
a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows
to fill a 10-foot cube, or shrinks to fit a 2-inch cube,
though it will not grow if it is enclosed. The
transformation lasts for one hour, or until dismissed
as an action.

Destiny Level
The transformation lasts indefinitely, though you
may not use this ability on more than three different
objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases
to at 25-foot cube.

Repulsion

_Heart ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Force_
Choose any two objects. Those objects repulse
each other with 50 pounds of force if they are within
10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you
choose two new objects.

Destiny Level
You may choose up to 5 objects, and the
repulsive force begins at 100 feet away.

Rope Servant

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it
can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were
an extension of your arm, including floating straight
up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a
weapon. The control persists only while you hold the
rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

Destiny Level
The rope becomes unbreakably strong while
being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.

```
Ru nescribe
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may now begin making
handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and
practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you
can memorize that sign and tattoo hands with that
sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and
titan bone, which equates to about half the price of
getting a new handmagic sign.
Destiny Level
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may make the additional
modifications to a handmagic sign to make its
destiny level upgrade. You must spend a week
studying and practicing before memorizing and
inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.
```

```
Silver Tongue
Major ability. Handmagic.
As an action, you may charm a person you are
talking to. They gain 2 ranks of charmed towards
you for the next hour, after which they know they
were magically charmed by you. They lose all ranks

person does not realize they were charmed when the
effect ends.
```

```
Siren’s Song
Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are

are not in obvious danger, they will approach you up
to 10 feet, and will not pull their gaze from you.
```

They have D3 on checks to notice their
surroundings.

Destiny Level
The range of your song increases to 120 feet. In
addition, you may choose to exclude individuals
from the collection of creatures you enthrall.

Smooth Talker

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Whenever you speak, your words come out like
smooth butter. You have A2 on presence skill checks
to persuade, intimidate, and deceive.

When you gain this destiny level, choose
persuasion, intimidation, or deception. Whenever
you make a skill check in that category, before you
roll, you may choose to instead use the maximum
result of your presence die rather than rolling.

Song of Rage

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose a creature within 60 feet and
in earshot. It feels an inexplicable dislike towards a
creature of your choice. If they were close, they

towards that creature until the end of the day.

Those creatures gain the benefit of two long
rests, instead.

```
The Spider
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You have a network of spies and informants at
your fingertips. Once per day while within a city
within the range of your influence, you may meet
with your informants to learn what is going on
around town. You may ask two unique questions of
the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or
more, your spies return with answers. The GM
answers one of your questions truthfully, and either
gives false information about the other, or else
doesn’t answer it at all. Any information that fewer
than 25 people know about cannot be answered by
your spy network.
Destiny Level
You may ask up to three questions, and may ask
questions with answers that are known by no fewer
than five people. The GM must truthfully answer
two of the three questions.

Smell Something Fishy
_Heart ability. Cognitive talent._

undiscovered clues related to a question of your
choice about whatever event occurred in your
location. The GM must answer truthfully.

Destiny Level
When investigating a mystery or crime, or when
interrogating a suspect, you may posit a hypothesis
about what happened to the GM. Then, the GM rolls
a d4 in secret. On a 2, 3, or 4, the GM must nod their
head if you are right, and shake their head if you are
wrong. On a 1, the GM must do the opposite.

Stargazer

ended question with a one-word answer. Roll 1d10.
On a 8, 9, or 10, the GM must answer truthfully with
one word.

You have two faces, your natural face and a
second face with features you decide, which you can
switch between by passing a hand over your face.
