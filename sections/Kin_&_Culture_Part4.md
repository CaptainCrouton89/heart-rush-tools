Revenant

Once you were dead, but now—well, you still
are, kind of. Revenants are semi corporeal versions
of their past, living, selves. When a creature dies and
rather than leaving its physical form, chooses to
remain within, it forfeits its ability to ever leave and
is eternally trapped in the material world where they
remain as a revenant. There are many reasons
revenants may choose to stay, but the most common
involve unfinished business. Whether it’s getting
revenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this
goal is a top priority. While revenants may take
detours along the way, they will always come back to
their purpose for remaining in the material world.
By remaining in the material world, revenants
forfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a revenant has
completed whatever business kept them in this
world, they generally slowly go crazy and are
eventually hunted down and killed by children of
Anubis or other specialized killers.
Due to revenant’s near immortality, they are
forced to watch as everyone they love inevitably
grows old and dies, which contributes to the slow
decaying of their sanity.

Aspects

- Unfinished business
- [Choose one from your previous race]

Vitals

You have whatever vitals you would have had
before you died.

Undead
_Passive ability._

You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and
cannot be poisoned.

```
You have already died, and can therefore not die
again in the traditional sense. When you would
normally die, you instead fall unconscious for 24
hours and are reborn where you died the first time
with no memory of your life after death.
You take double damage from silvered weapons,
and if you should die to a silver weapon, you are
dead forever.
Also, your physical body is no longer fully alive,
and it will slowly decay with passing time. Though
you can generally maintain your appearance from
your moment of death, your skin no longer closes up
over wounds, so your body will begin to fall apart.
For this reason, many revenants prefer to cover up as
much of their skin as possible, and to travel
unnoticed. Once you have died in a corpse three
times, it is too mangled to ever return to.
```

```
Detached Spirit
Passive ability.
You have a soul, shadow, and spirit—all
necessary for true life, but they are no longer bound
to your corporal body in the same way—instead, it is
through willpower alone that you keep them attached
to your physical form. This is a constant struggle,
and when you waver, your form flickers as your
spirit sloughs away from your skin. This, however,
comes with benefits.
As an action, you may let your concentration fall,
causing you to dissolve into a pool of light and
shadow. While in this form, you gain the following
effects:
```

- You can fit through any space larger than the
  width of a pebble.
- You cannot interact with the physical world
- You take half damage from all non-silver, non-
  iron sources, rounded down.
- You cannot take actions.
- You cannot speak.

### KIN & CULTURE

- Your physical body remains collapsed
  wherever you left it. You may return to it, or any
  other unoccupied corpse.

Deva

Deva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very
commanding presences that enter the world fully
grown, intelligent, with no family, and a single,
driving purpose. Several explanation exist on how
they appear, though the most supported reasoning is
that they are manifestations of collective thought and
hope from the Psyic plane.
Deva generally have light, gray, blueish,
lavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their
eyes, which are pure white. They are on average,
slightly taller than humans, though only slightly.
Deva rarely appear looking younger than in their
twenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although
it does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and
in combination with their striking features, they are
generally at the center of attention of any room they
enter.
Deva are always “born” with a deep feeling of
hope and purpose. The source of that hope and
purpose is never clear, but the force with which these
drive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that
goal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are
usually somewhat noble, such as “freeing the region
from tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat” or
“leading their community safely to a new land”.
These purposes tend to align with the communities
in which they spawn, supporting theories of their
psyic origins.
Deva also are born with a feeling of having
memories that are not entirely their own. They do not
know how they know so many skills, as they
remember nothing of learning them. They may have
faint memories of past events within their
communities, or even past experiences of other deva
before them, but beyond that, it feels as though their
lives began when they spawned.

```
When a deva dies, their body dissipates—there is
no body left over. If they failed at their purpose,
another deva may appear years later, or if they
succeeded, another deva might not appear for
hundreds of years.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Core purpose: Choose one for your community
- Hope

```
Vitals
```

- Size: Medium
- Height: 5.5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 140-240 pounds

```
Naturally Charismatic
Passive ability.
Increasing your presence die costs 2 less XP. You
do not need to reach PL2 in order to take the
Draconic Presence paragon level.
```

```
Memories Passed
Major ability. Instant.
The psyic energy from which you spawned
occasionally provides imagery from others’
memories of the past as well, guiding you when you
face difficult challenges. You may use this ability to
gain advantage on any skill check you make. If the
skill check also aligns with your deeper purpose, you
instead gain A3.
You also do not have a soul or shadow, and are
thus invisible on both the ethereal and nethereal
planes. This also excludes you from effects on
creatures with souls or shadows.
```

### KIN & CULTURE

Ghoul

Ghouls are the descendants of servants spawned
by ancient, powerful wizards. They were created as
butlers, maids, and test subjects, fabricated from the
combination of Deoric ritual and a body of the
recently deceased, made to serve the wizards.
Because of this, ghouls lack any spirit, making them
immune to some effects, but incredibly susceptible to
Kethic elemental magic. They exert no Kethic
presence, meaning there’s nothing stopping a water
attuned mage from filling a ghoul’s lungs with water,
or a fire attuned mage from igniting the very skin of
a ghoul.
After the age of great Deoric mages ended,
ghouls lived on. They are rare, and not infrequently
killed for their distinctive, gaunt, gray skin that
identifies them as ghouls, an aspect that many try to
cover up. This widely felt vehemence towards ghouls
stems from the belief that they kill other humanoids
and eat them—which is partially true.
Due to the nature of ghouls’ origin, they feel an
eternal emptiness within their bodies that aches to be
filled. Eating magic, and the souls of other living
things sate that hunger. While eating magic and flesh
are not strictly necessary for ghoul survival, it
usually feels that way, and any chance to eat magic
or the recently deceased has a powerful frenzying
effect on all ghouls. Many give in to this urge,
feeling little sympathy towards a world that has
given them nothing but hurt, creating a reputation for
all ghouls of hunting and eating humans. Seeing a
ghoul in a feeding frenzy is a truly horrifying
experience—one that only needs to be seen once
before never wanting to be near another ghoul again.
For these reasons, ghoul hunters can be found
across Alaria. Nearly all are mages—capable of
killing a ghoul in nearly an instant. While some
ghouls try to flee or hide from the hunters, others

```
fight back, usually gathering in small groups in the
hopes of overwhelming the hunter.
Despite not being able to create biological
offspring, some ghouls will create other ghouls,
using the same cruel magic as was used to create the
original few. The Deoric ritual is innately known by
all ghouls, and requires nothing more than one dead
body, and one live one for sacrifice. This ritual takes
1 hour to perform.
```

```
Aspects
```

- I must eat flesh
- Terrifying presence

```
Vitals
You have whatever vitals you gained from the
body you were reanimated from.
```

```
Soul Eater
Passive ability.
When you are adjacent to a humanoid or creature
of greater power that has died within the last hour,
you may spend an action to suck its soul out and
ingest it. Doing so lets you heal, learn something
about the creature, gain temporary magical power, or
temporarily store its soul in your body to protect you
from elemental magic.
When you ingest a creature’s soul, choose one
from the following list.
```

- Replenish. Regain 5 hp and any conditions
  affecting you.
- Inspect. The GM must tell you one secret about
  this creature’s past life.
- Devour. If the creature had an ability die higher
  than your own, you may replace your ability die
  with their ability die for the next ten minutes.
- Infuse. For the next 1d10 days, spelltouched
  cannot use their action to inflict wounds upon you,
  as detailed in the _Deoric Origins_ ability described
  below.

While flesh is a preferred substitute for standard
food, you can still consume normal foodstuffs for
nutrients.

Deoric Origins
_Passive ability._

Gaining oath talents and their destiny levels cost
2 XP less.
As an action, someone with a basic attunement
may inflict 10 damage on you, so long as you are
within 45 feet. If they have an advanced attunement,
they inflict 20 damage instead, and the range
increases to 90 feet. With a paragon level
attunement, they may inflict 30 damage, and the
range increases to 120 feet. The _Infuse_ option from
your _Soul Eater_ can prevent creatures with elemental
attunement from doing this.

### KIN & CULTURE

Savant

Savants, for reasons unknown, are born with rare
differences in their physiology, sometimes
sacrificing the ability to move, sense, or
communicate effectively in exchange for excelling
greatly in other ways. They can be born into nearly
any race, from anyone. In some communities,
savants are worshipped as supernatural beings, while
in others they are shunned and treated as outcasts.

Aspects

Choose one aspect from the following list, and
one from the heritage or race from your _Savant
Birthright_.

- Paranoid
- Emotionally cold
- Obsessed
- Vicious

Vitals

```
You have the same vitals as the original creature.
```

Savant Birthright

_Passive ability._
When you choose this race, you must also choose
a heritage from a different race. You are technically
of that race, and gain all of the associated aspects.
However, you will replace the abilities granted from
the race—not the heritage—with your choice of
abilities listed later in this section. For example, if
you chose Uline dwarf, you would keep the
Mountain-born ability, but lose the Hearty and Gruff
ability.
Upon picking a heritage, choose one ability from
the Physical & Mental Abilities section listed below,
and gain its tier 1 ability.
Then, if you wish, you may choose and gain one
of the conditions from the Physical and Mental

```
Conditions section listed below. If you do, you gain
the tier 2 ability for whichever talent you chose in
the earlier step, or a different tier 1 ability.
```

```
Physical & Mental Conditions
You may choose one passive ability from the
options listed below. If you do, you may gain a
second tier 1 ability, or the tier 2 ability of your
initial chosen ability.
```

```
Blind
Passive ability.
You are completely blind, and therefore cannot
see. You permanently have three levels of blindness.
```

```
Physically Disabled
Passive ability.
