Hate
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You feel a deep loathing towards a certain type of
creature or individual. You have A2 on all checks to

creature or individual, and you have advantage on
attack rolls against them if they are an individual.
If the creature is an individual, you may
exchange this talent for any other talent when you
kill the individual.
You may take this talent any number of times,
though you must choose a different target each time.
Destiny Level
You have advantage on all checks related to
hindering your target, and you gain advantage on
defense rolls if the target of your hate is a specific
individual. If the creature is an individual, you may
replace this talent with a new talent and a destiny
level for any talent you already have.

information presents itself. You do not forget the

knowledge contained in any information you read or
hear.

rather than a question about an opinion or belief.
