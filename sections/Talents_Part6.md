multiple times.

As an action, you may transform into any generic
object that would fit in a space somewhere between a

hour, or until you spend your action to transform
back into your natural form.

transformed.

Keen Eye

_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._
When you make a perception check, you may
declare one thing that is unusual but nearly

thing, modifying your stated fact.

Destiny Level
You may add one detail to whatever thing you
notice.

Le t I t G o

choice of permanent physical or permanent mental
vulnerability.
```

```
Master of Espionage
Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.
Whether it be heists, spying, or sabotage, you are
accomplished in the ways of espionage. You may
declare an object as the target of your espionage. If
you spend one day gathering knowledge about the
security around your target, you have advantage on
all rolls related to accessing that object, and then
escaping thereafter.
If you spend one week gathering knowledge
about your target, you may make an “educated
guess” about the security around your target. The
GM will confirm or deny your educated guess with a
simple “yes” or “no”.
Destiny Level
Before you perform your act of espionage, you
may choose to lay out a detailed plan. You must
describe your plan to the GM. While you execute
your espionage, so long as everything goes as
planned, you may choose to replace any roll made
during the heist with the maximum of your relevant
ability die. These benefits do not extend to
contingency plans, nor to tasks that were not clearly
specified in the plan. For example, “Break into the
house” would provide zero bonuses, while “Pick the
lock on the door without making a sound” would
provide bonuses to both picking the lock and to
doing so quietly.
```

non-hostile creature that you touch. You may replace
up to one minute’s worth of memories made by that

occurring.

memories from the last day.

Metallurgy

Add iron and steel to your resonate substances as
a basic solid attunement.
Whenever you are hit with a melee weapon made
of iron or steel, you may catch the blade in your
hand, warping and bending it in your grip. Do not
roll a defense roll—you take the full damage—but
the weapon is rendered useless, and cannot be used
again.

Destiny Level
If you have a paragon attunement to earth, you
gain an advanced attunement to iron and steel.

Misty Illusions

_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._
You can manipulate the water in the air to create
realistic illusions. Add mist to your resonate
substances as a liquid attunement.
