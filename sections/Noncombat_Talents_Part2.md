Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
So long as you can see the stars, you may ignore
the navigation challenge number for your
environment and use a default value of 10. You do
not have disadvantage if you make this roll as part of
a navigation camp action at night. If you are already
lost, you cannot identify your location only by
looking at the stars, though a successful navigation
check will tell you that you are lost.
Destiny Level
You have advantage on navigation checks. You
can identify your location from a successful
navigation check.

### TA L E N T S

Befuddle
_Heart ability. Handmagic._
As an action, you may point at a sentient
creature. That creature forms no new memories for
the next ten minutes, though it is aware that you
performed mind-altering magic on it.

Destiny Level
The target does not realize that you performed
mind-altering magic on it.

Beastform
_Major ability. Handmagic._
When you pick this talent, work with your GM to
pick a common and mundane creature that you can
transform into. As an action, you may transform into
this creature. You maintain your mental stats, though
take on the physical stats and abilities of the chosen
creature.
The creature can not have a fly speed or a swim
speed, and should use either a d4 and d8, or two d6s
for its might and agility ability dice. It must be either
a small or medium creature. It has the same
maximum hit points and heart die as you do.
You automatically revert to your natural form
after one hour, or as an action any time before then.

Destiny Level
This becomes a passive ability. You may stay in
your transformed state for any amount of time. The
creature you transform into may be tiny, and may
have a swim speed. The creature can have 2d8s, or a
d4 and d10 for its might and agility dice.

Deoric Linguist
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
You have A2 on checks to learn Deoric domains,
cast Deoric spells, and interact with the Deoric
language in any way.

```
Destiny Level
You may use books that include spells consisting
of domains of any level that is higher than your
existing rank in order to learn those domains.
```

```
Cat’s Feet
Passive ability. Martial talent.
You gain the following abilities:
```

- When rolling agility to avoid fall damage, you
  automatically roll the maximum.
- If a creature would be knocked into you, you
  may instead dodge and have that creature continue
  past you.
- You have advantage on agility defense rolls.
- You have advantage on skill checks to be
  stealthy.
  Destiny Level
  You gain the following additional abilities:
- You automatically succeed any check to avoid
  falling prone.
- So long as you are not restrained, you may
  immediately stand up if you are knocked prone as
  an instant, free action that doesn't trigger
  opportunity attacks.
- You have A3 on agility defense rolls instead of
  A1.
- You have A2 rather than A1 on skill checks to
  be stealthy.

```
Call of Delorn
Monthly ability. Gaeic melody.
You play a song, making a plea to the wilds for
their help. After playing your instrument for an hour,
a friendly, non-humanoid animal comes to your aid.
The animal is not your servant, but will do its best to
help you in any way that does not put itself in
danger. You may communicate with it through your
song, though the animal cannot communicate back.
```

The animal remains in your aid for the rest of the
day.

Destiny Level
You may choose for a sentient creature,
including other humanoids, to answer your call
instead. They feel a strong compulsion to help you
for reasons they cannot identify, so long as you do
not drive them away with your words or actions.

Cast Thoughts

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
By pointing your index finger at a person, you
can project your voice into their mind. They hear the
words as if spoken in your voice. They know the
voice is not being spoken aloud.

Destiny Level
You may make the words come out in any voice
you’ve heard before, and you do not have to point.
They may communicate back in the same way if you
choose to allow them to.
