- As an action, you may cease to exist, and
  disappear. When you do so, choose any length of
  time. After that time, you reappear in the same
  spot. Note that if that spot has any solid objects
  passing through it when you return, those objects
  are now passing through you—potentially killing
  you.

```
Advanced Attunement
```

- As an action, you can send a non-living object
  you touch into the void, causing it to cease to exist
  forever. The object must not be larger than a 1-foot
  cube. The entire object must be able to fit within
  the cube, and must be a distinct object—not part of
  something larger.

```

- Whenever you move, you may instead choose
  to teleport half the distance.
- The maximum size of objects you send to the
  void increases to a 5-foot cube.

Ti me

Basic Attunement

- Once per day, immediately after learning the
  result of an action you took, you may choose to go
  back to right before you made that action and
  choose not to take it. This could include things
  such as stepping onto a trap, making a
  conversational gaffe, or
- By touching a nonliving object for a minute,
  you can cause it to age a year. The object must be
  able to fit within a 5-foot cube.

Advanced Attunement

- When you unwind time, you may choose to
  instead unwind time when another creature makes
  an action rather than yourself. You may make an
  action now.
- The size of the object to age increases to a 10-
  foot cube.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- The size of the object to age increases to a 100-
  foot cube.
- You may choose to use your own timeline to
  fix the past. The entire world reverts to whatever
  state it was 24 hours ago. You gain take 3 levels of
  dazed that don’t fade until you take a long rest, and
  your body ages by 10 years.

Li g h t

Basic Attunement

- You can produces bright light in a 30-foot
  radius, and dim light 30 feet beyond that. It dispels
  magical darkness. By touching an inanimate
  object, it gains this property. You cannot produce
  more than one source of light.
- You may inflict three levels of blindness to
  creatures you are touching.

```
Advanced Attunement
```

- The bright light you can produce extends up to
  60 feet, and 60 feet of dim light beyond that. You
  can produce up to three sources of this light.
- You may cast _blinding sun_ on yourself any
  number of times per day.

```
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
```

- You can raise the light level to dim light in any
  number of locations that you can see. This
  overrides any magical darkness, and cannot be
  turned into darkness.
- Whenever you cast _blinding sun_ , you may
  inflict up to 5 levels of blindness.

Darkness

```
Basic Attunement
```

- You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet,
  or increase your current darkvision by 30 feet.
- As an action, you dim the light in a 30 foot
  radius, turning non-magical, bright light into dim
  light, or dim light into darkness.

### ELEMENTAL MAGIC

```
A Note on Light and Dark
It’s hard to actually “hurt” someone with
light or darkness. Many of the other elements
have physical aspects or obvious connections to
sources of damage, but light and dark do not.
You’ll notice in the spell sections that spells
with the light and dark tags only deal damage
when they’re paired with another element.
```

Advanced Attunement

- The range of your darkvision increases by 30
  feet.
- The range at which you can create darkness
  increases by 30 feet.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- Other creatures with darkvision cannot see
  through darkness you create.
- The range at which you can create darkness
  increases by 60 feet.

Force

Basic Attunement

- As an action, you can apply up to 10 pounds of
  force to any non-living object within 90 feet. You
  can manipulate fine objects, so long as they only
  require one, linear force applied to them.

Advanced Attunement

- The force you can apply increases to a
  maximum of 20 pounds.
- You may divide this force between up to three
  different objects.
- You can manipulate fine objects that would not
  otherwise require a skill check to manipulate, and
  can apply rotational force.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- You may divide this force between any number
  of different objects.
- You may manipulate objects that would require
  a skill check to use. You cannot wield a weapon
  using this force.

Spellcasting

Gaining Spells

Learning a spell represents mastery over some
aspect of one’s connection with an element, allowing
the user to perform some fantastical feat. Anyone
with an attunement can learn to cast a spell.
By spending XP, as described in the Gaining and
Spending XP section, one can gain a new spell,
chosen from the list of spells in the Spells section.
You must have at least a basic attunement to all of
the elements in the tags listed below each spell in
order to learn that spell.

Casting Spells

Casting a spell is more difficult than simple
elemental manipulation performed with just an
attunement, as it requires more precise control for a
longer duration. Performing a powerful act of
elemental control while in the thick of a fight takes
skill and practice, and comes with the following
restrictions:

- Casting a spell requires your action.
- You may cast only one spell per round.
- Casting a spell requires at least one free hand
- If casting a spell, you cannot have moved more
  than half your movement speed (after accounting
  for armor and other penalties), rounded up.
- After casting the spell, you cannot move more
  than half your movement speed (after accounting
  for armor and other penalties).
  Casting spells is strenuous, and takes a toll on
  your body, and without proper preparation, can
  wreak havoc on your ability to channel your
  attunement in that way again for a while. You must
  wait four long rests before casting that spell again,
  though that time may vary as per the following rules:
- Subtract one long rest for each consecutive
  round taken before this action spent unmoving,
  taking no actions and using no abilities, and not
  communicating (in complete, meditative
  concentration).
- Subtract one long rest if you have an advanced
  attunement with the elemental type of the spell you
  are casting.
- Subtract two long rests if you instead have a
  paragon attunement with the elemental type of the
  spell you are casting.
  If the total number of long rests would be
  reduced to zero, you must still wait at least one short
  rest before casting the spell again.

```
Spellcasting Ability
Whenever a creature has to make a saving throw
against your spellcasting ability, it must make a
check against the maximum of your current heart
die, plus two times your paragon level.
```

Spells

```
Spells are listed by their name, along with two
tags—their required attunements, and if they are
ongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a
single attunement as prerequisite for casting the
spell, but some have two or more. If the spell is
immediate, the spell effect occurs once when the
spell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell’s effects
continue for up to one minute, or when the spell
caster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.
```

```
Au r a of I g n i t ion
Fire. Ongoing. Instant.
You snap your fingers, agitating the air around
you into a hyper-flammable state, allowing you to
easily ignite moments of already high-energy, such

10 feet takes damage, you may have them take a
level of burning if they don’t already have any levels
of burning.

Billowing Smoke

_Fire. Ongoing._
You cause thick, billowing smoke to erupt from a
nearby space. Choose a point within 45 feet. All
space within 5 feet of that point is obscured.
Additionally, creatures of your choice within the
smoke gain the suffocating condition.

Blast of Fire

_Fire and Force._
You point your finger, sending forth a bolt of
force and flame and blasting someone back. Choose
a creature within 45 feet. That creature is knocked
back 10 feet and then falls prone, taking two levels
of burning. On a success, they are not knocked
prone, and take only one level of burning.

Burning Brilliance
_Fire and Light. Ongoing._
You rub your fingers together, heating nearby
areas of light. All spaces within 45 feet in bright light
ignite into white, brilliant flames. So long as those
spaces remain in bright light, the flame remains. The
flames emit no light. Whenever a creature enters or
begins the round in one of these spaces, it takes one
level of burning.

Blinding Sun

_Light. Ongoing._
You rub a sphere of pure, brilliant light into your
fingers before casting it into the air. Choose a point
within 45 feet. Creatures of your choice within a 5-
foot radius of that point take three levels of blindness
whenever they enter or start the round in that space,
no more than once per round. For every 5 feet further

```
you are from the point creatures gain one level fewer
of blindness.
```

```
Cardinal Direction
Void and Force. Ongoing.
You align your fingers with the complex grid of
the void, applying its strict physical laws to the
world around you. Creatures of your choice within
45 feet of you can only move back and forth in one
direction each round (no diagonals).
```

```
Chilling Wind
Air.
You you beckon with your fingers, calling forth
the north wind, sending a bone chilling breeze

creatures also take one level of restrained.
```

```
Cloak of Shadows
Dark.
You drag wisps of shadows over your form,
obscuring yourself and actions. You count as
obscured until the end of your next engagement or
the end of the round, whichever comes first.
```

```
Cloud of Poison
Water. Ongoing.
You raise your finger to the air, spewing forth
billowing dark clouds of poison. All spaces within 10
feet of you are layered in a heavy cloud of poison.
Creatures count as obscured and take a level of
poisoned whenever they enter or start the round in
those spaces, no more than once per round. You are
immune to the poison effect for the duration of this
spell. Creatures cannot take more than one level of
poisoned with this effect. The cloud does not move
with you.
```

Cold Snap
_Water._
Snapping the fingers of your hand makes a loud
crack that causes all non-magical liquid within 45
feet to freeze solid. Creatures of your choice within
45 feet gain one level of restrained until the end of
the round. If they are wet or standing in water, they
instead gain 2 levels of restrained.

Collapse in Shadows
_Dark and Force._
You clap your fingers to your palm, dragging
everyone’s bodies to their shadows. Creatures of
your choice within 10 feet fall prone. If they are in
bright light, they gain two levels of restrained. If
they are in dim light, they gain one level of
restrained instead.

Crippling Aura

_Force. Ongoing._
You emit an aura that saps those around you of
their strength, greatly weakening them. Creatures of
your choice within 10 feet of you take three levels of
weakened whenever they enter or start the round in
that space, no more than once per round.

Deluge

_Water and Force._
You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending
a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away.
Choose a 10-foot by 20-foot section of the map.
Everyone in that area is swept to one of the 10-foot
sides of the rectangle, and lands prone. The water
puts out any fire in that area.

Earthen Shackles
_Earth and Force. Ongoing._
You grasp your hand into an upturned fist,
causing the ground to reach up and anchor those
above it. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of
