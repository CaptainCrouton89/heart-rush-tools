Item Description Cost

Animal Products

In most cases of magical crafting, the
components will come from animals. Below are the
most commonly used animal parts used in magical
crafting.
In order to harvest items from a creature, you
will likely have to make a harvest check with a CN
set by the GM. The difficulty of this will vary by
product and creature.

Le a t h e r

Hides can be used for armors and some crafting.
Nearly all hides can be fashioned into light or
medium armors, though some will also work as
heavy armor.

Feathers

Feathers provide very little protection, but
magically aided abilities in flight are sometimes held
within a creature’s feathers.

Scale s

Scales are much harder to harvest than leather,
but can be used in both armors as well as some
crafting.

Fangs, Spines & Horns

Fangs, spines, and horns can usually be crafted
into piercing melee weapons. In the case of
particularly straight edges, they can also be used as
arrowheads.

Claws & Talons

Claws and talons can be crafted into slashing
weapons. Usually the weapons cannot be heavy, as
the slashing area is relatively small.

```
Bones
Bones are versatile. They can be shaped into
weapons or trinkets, or they can be ground up and
used as powders in alchemy. Usually bones do not
possess much magical capacity, though if there is
any, it is usually concentrated in the creature’s skull.
```

```
Blood
Blood can be used in crafting potions, or it can
be dried and used as a powder or paste applied
during crafting. In the case of magical creatures, the
potion may grant the drinker some of the properties
of the creature during its life.
```

```
Heart
Like blood, the heart may be used in potion
crafting. In some cases, the heart can also be used for
crafting by harvesting the heart-strings. The heart is
generally more potent than the blood. Sometimes,
the heart might have some magical effects even if the
blood does not.
```

```
Brain
In creatures with powerful mind effects, the brain
can sometimes be used in potion crafting to capture
some of the creature’s magical ability.
```

```
Vocal C hords
In creatures with magically superior voices,
vocal chords can be harvested to capture some of the
creature’s magical ability.
```

```
Eyes
In creatures with magically superior sense of
sight, the eyes can usually be harvested to capture
some of the creature’s magical ability. They can
either be ground up for alchemy, or petrified in use
with crafting.
```

Venoms, Poisons & Toxins

Venoms, poisons, and toxins can be turned into
poisons and contact poisons. Some can also be
turned into poisonous gasses. Most creatures can
produce one dose of poison per day while alive, and
can have 3 doses harvested off of them on death.

Ink

Some creatures produce ink, such as octopus.
besides more mundane uses, such as for writing or
art, the ink may have magical properties that can be
used in alchemy or crafting.

Te ar s

Tears are some of the most difficult and taboo
alchemical components to procure, as they require

```
the creature to be alive and crying when they are
harvested. However, some of the most powerful
magic is occasionally held within a creature’s tears.
```

```
Hooves
The hooves of a creature with magical movement
speed may contain some magical power.
```

```
high level smithing requires a “god forge”,
something-crucible
Alchemy: Something-crucible.
```

All possible properties, as well as a brief
description of each can be found below:

The first is that all crafting has a difficulty. The
difficulty is a CN which determines how challenging
that item is to make.
The second is a duration. Different items take
different amounts of time to craft.
Lastly is a material cost. Material is measured in
weight, and is used up when you craft items.

The first thing to know is that the magic of
magical crafting comes from the components of the
objects made. Unlike Deoric or Kethic, making
magical items does not require any magical
capability of the crafter—it uses the magic entirely
from its materials.

Smithing

```
Smithing is the general descriptor for any sort of
forging, smithing, or crafting of weapons, shields, or
armor. For example, a bone mask that provides a
bonus to defense, an arrow made of a basilisk spine,
and a shield of astral steel are all examples of
smithing.
If you want to make something that falls under
the category of smithing, then there are three
important values to know—the
Use the following table to calculate the smithing
difficulty, time to craft, and material mass required.
To determine the difficulty, take the difficulty and
add any modifiers for the item type that applies. For
example, a heavy, bludgeoning, stone club would be
calculated as follows:
7 (base CN for adapting) + 1 (material cost) + 2
(heavy weight) + 0 (bludgeoning) + 0 (melee) = 10.

Alchemy

Alchemy is the process of transforming raw
ingredients into magical substances. Brewing
potions, refining magical components, and
concocting arcane substances are all examples of
alchemy. For example, making poisons, explosives,
and invisibility paint are all examples of alchemy.
Alchemy differs from artificing in that the
alchemical products are used up rather than sticking
around forever.
Despite this difference, the rules of alchemy are
nearly identical to those of magical crafting. The
level of your final product is estimated, tags are
determined, and components with corresponding
level and tags are used to produce a final product.
Differences are laid out below.

Inventing

Whenever you produce something new via
alchemy, you must determine how much of the
product you intend to create. By default, you
produce 10 uses of that item. For example, if you are
making a poison, you have 10 doses of that poison.
If you are producing flash bangs, you make 10 flash
bangs. In cases with more vague units of
measurements (such as invisibility paint) it is up to
you as the player, though it must be approved by the
GM.

Alchemy Laboratory

In order to perform alchemy, you must have the
tools, space, and knowledge to do so. All of those
things are centered in your laboratory—necessary for
any alchemical experiment.
While working in an alchemy lab, you get a
bonus to all alchemy checks equal to the level of the
lab.

```
Le v e l 1
At level 1, you need basic alchemy tools, and 2
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 2
At level 2, you need basic alchemy tools, and 5
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 3
At level 3, you need advanced alchemy tools,
and 10 or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 4
At level 4, you need advanced alchemy tools,
and 20 or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 5
At level 5, you need expert alchemy tools, and 40
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Crafting
In order to craft an alchemical brew, you must
spend time and resources to prepare the substance. In
addition, you must have access to the recipe, either
from a book, or memorized, and you must be in an
alchemy lab of a level equal or greater than the
recipe you are crafting.
When you wish to craft something, it takes a
number of days equal to the recipe’s level. Only two
hours each day must be spent actively working on
the recipe, since the rest of the time is spent waiting
for chemical reactions to occur. If you do not have
the recipe memorized, you must have access to a
written form of the recipe each day.
When you start the crafting process, remove all
the required remarkable materials from your
inventory. Those materials are used up in the
alchemy process. Any gold cost in addition to the
unique materials is spent at a rate of 10 * X ducat at
```

the start of each day, where X is the level of the
alchemical product.
After each day of crafting, make an alchemy skill
check against 8 + 2 \* X, where X is the level of the
recipe. On a success, you make another day of
progress towards finishing the product, potentially
finishing the product immediately. On a failure, all
progress is lost, and you ruin the product.

Recipes

In order to craft an alchemical solution, you must
know the recipe, or be able to follow a recipe from a
book. Memorizing a recipe takes a number of
successful daily memorization checks equal to the
recipe’s level. The CN for the memorization check is
equal to 8 + 2 \* X, where X is the recipe’s level.

Inventing Alchemy

As you progress as an alchemist, you may gain
the ability to invent alchemical products. If you do,
you may work with your GM to define the
properties, costs, remarkable materials, and levels of
any alchemical product. As a player, your
responsibility is to define the properties of a
hypothetical alchemical product. As the GM, their
responsibility is to determine if such a product could
even exist, and if so, to assign it its costs, material
requirements, and level.

Assigning Materials and Level

To determine the level and materials required for
