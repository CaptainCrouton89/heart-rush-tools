Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.
You play a macabre and sinister tune. After
playing your instrument for a minute or more, all
creatures within 60 feet and in earshot gain one level
of frightened towards you for the rest of the day.
Destiny Level
You may choose for them to gain three levels of
frightened instead, and you may choose to exempt
creatures from the effects.

Wor ldly Tr av e le r
Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.
You have traveled the world and met many, many
people. When you meet someone who the GM
describes as someone you’ve never met, you may
choose to claim some connection to them. If you do,
the GM will explain how you recognize them, and
the nature of your connection. This connection may
be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a
neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman
bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed
```

earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is
possible there is no feasible connection between you
and this person. In this case, you may either regain
the use of this ability, or take three destiny points.
You cannot use this ability to claim connections with
people more influential than yourself.

Destiny Level
Rather than claim a connection to someone you
meet, you may use this ability before actually
running into someone. For example, while at a bar in
a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a
weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM
also believes this to be plausible, your connection
becomes real (though their location and condition
may have changed since the last time you talked with
them). If the GM doesn’t believe this to be
reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.
