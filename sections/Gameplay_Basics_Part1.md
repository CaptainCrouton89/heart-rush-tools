## Gameplay Basics

This section describes how general gameplay
should proceed.

Rolling Dice

Skill Checks

Whenever you attempt to do something that has a
realistic chance of failure, the GM may ask you to
roll a skill check to see if you succeed. Whenever
you roll a skill check, there are two dice you need to
roll—your heart die, and one of your ability dice.
The ability die should correspond to the activity you
are doing. For example, if you are lifting something
heavy, you should use your might die.
After rolling the dice, calculate the sum, and then
add any modifiers you may gain from your aspects
or other bonuses. If the sum of the dice is equal to or
higher than the GM’s predetermined challenge
number (CN), then you succeed.

Difficulties

The GM should use the following chart to set the
challenge number.

```
Complications
As your heart leads you through your life and
story, there may be times that it stutters. When it
does, you may fail at whatever you are doing, or
something else may go wrong. This is represented by
rolling a 1 on a skill check.
Whenever you make a skill check, if the result
on one of the dice is a 1, you must choose to either
automatically fail the check, or else you may re-roll
that die, using the new result. If you choose the
latter, a complication occurs. A complication does
not mean you fail to do what you were trying to do—
```

```
Challenge Number
```

```
CN Difficulty
```

```
Skill level
```

```
Lo w High v. High
```

```
6 Fairly Easy 79% 95% 100%
9 Average 44% 77% 93%
12 Hard 13% 44% 74%
```

```
15 Very Hard – 16% 45%
18 Nearly
Impossible
```

### – 2% 19%

```
21 Heroic – – 4%
```

```
The percentages in the cells correspond to the chance of success for a
typical human at full heart with low (d8+d6), high (d8+d8+2), and
very high(d8+d10+4) skill level. Note that players can eventually reach
up to d12+d20+10, and that this chart does not account for
complications.
```

```
Example
You are trying to climb around the edge of the
king’s tower without falling to your death. You
have to make a skill check and roll a 1 and a 5.
You really don’t want to fall, so you accept a
complication and re-roll the 1, getting a 4 instead.
The 9 is apparently high enough and you succeed
at climbing around the tower, but the GM
announces that in a near fall, you accidentally
knock a stone down, alerting the guards below.
```

use the total result after re-rolling your dice to
determine that. Instead, something related to the task
at hand but not determinate of your success or failure
goes wrong. This can be many things, such as
breaking your lock picks if you were trying to open a
door, or sparking a new line of interrogation if you
were trying to smooth talk your way past guards.
If you roll additional 1s they do not cause
complications.
If you roll two 1s as your first roll, you fail the
check, and there is a complication.

Raising the Stakes

Whenever you or another player makes a skill
check, but before the dice are rolled, you may choose
to raise the stakes. When you raise the stakes, you
increase the effectiveness of a success, and the
increase how disastrous the complication or failure is
on a fail. You may do this once once per session, on
any roll that any player makes.

Saving Throws

Whenever you have to roll to avoid or mitigate
the effects of someone else’s action, such as dodging
a falling boulder, or withstanding a powerful venom,
make a saving throw. Saving throws are identical to
skill checks, except they do not provoke
complications. Instead, rolling equal to or over the
challenge number implies you avoid the negative
effect, and rolling under implies suffering the
negative effect.
When the effect was created by another creature,
they are usually made against that creature’s ability
challenge number. If it was an effect from the
environment, the CN will be determined by the GM.

Ability Challenge Number

When another creature is avoiding an effect that
you have caused, the GM may have them roll a

```
saving throw. The CN for this roll is equal to the
maximum of your most applicable ability die, plus
two times your paragon level (which starts at zero).
This number is generically called your ability
challenge number, though more specifically, you
would have might, agility, cunning, presence, and
even heart challenge numbers. Use whichever ability
is most relevant for the roll, or if no ability die fits—
such as the case with magical effects—use your heart
challenge number—the maximum of your heart die
instead.
```

```
At tack & Defense Rolls
Attack and defense rolls, or A/D rolls, are made
whenever your roll to deal or negate damage in an
engagement or opportunity attack. Roll the relevant
ability die, your heart die, and add any necessary
modifiers. A/D rolls are explained in greater detail in
the Combat chapter.
```

```
Advantage & Disadvantage
Advantage and disadvantage give you bonuses or
penalties to a roll. For each instance of advantage
you have on a roll, roll an additional instance of the
lowest of the dice, and then remove the lowest result
when calculating the total. When rolling with
disadvantage, instead roll an additional instance of
the highest of the dice, and then remove the highest
result from the dice you rolled. Advantage and
disadvantage cancel out, and multiple instances of
either one can stack.
Multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage are
referred to as Ax or Dx, where 'x' indicates the
number of instances. When determining the outcome
with advantage or disadvantage, treat the final result
as if only the dice that were kept were rolled. For
instance, if you have an ability that activates when a
specific number is rolled, disregard the results from
```

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

the extra dice gained through advantage or
disadvantage, and consider only the results of the
retained dice.

Helping

When someone wishes to assist another person
with a skill check, they can choose to help. If you are
in combat, this requires your action. Helping grants
the person making the check advantage, so long as
you reasonably could provide help in that situation.
If you help someone, you are both liable to suffer
any consequences from any complications or
failures.

Group Rolls

Sometimes, everyone in a group will need to
make the same check, or will want to help on the
same check. For example, working together to break
down a door, sneaking past some guards, or
persuading a judge could all be group rolls. Rolls are
calculated differently, depending on the exact type of
task.
If everyone is making a check where the group is
only as strong as the weakest link, such as sneaking
past guards as a group, only one person rolls. Find
the person in the group who is the worst at making
this roll, and they make the roll for the group with
advantage. It is assumed that everyone else will

```
succeed, but if this person fails, everyone else may
fail as well.
However, if it is a task where people work
together, such as when everyone works together to
convince someone of the truth, then only the person
best at the task has to roll, and they may roll with
advantage.
```

Using Abilities

```
When creating your character, you will inevitably
gain a lot of abilities. Abilities are any chunk of rules
that let you create an affect, perform some activity,
or do anything at all. Examples include class
abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels,
though some abilities grant you their own abilities.
You can most easily recognize an ability because
of the format it has in this book:
```

```
Ability Name
Ability tags.
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.
```

```
All abilities listed in this rulebook have their
name, followed by tags, and then followed by their
rules. For the most part, abilities can be used
whenever you want. However, some have
restrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very
specific, in the ability rules itself.
All tags in an ability are separated by periods.
Each tag will contain information about when you
can use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for
gaining that ability. While many tags will be
explained by whichever section they appear in, there
are a few types which can show up on any type of
ability. These are listed below.
```

```
Example
You are trying to lift a heavy portcullis. Due
to various elements at play, you have three
sources of advantage, and one source of
disadvantage. Your might die is a d6, and your
heart die is a d8. When you make the roll, you
would roll with 2 levels of advantage—1d8 and
3d6. Lets say you get an 3, 6, 5, and 1,
respectively. The final result would be 11 (6 + 5).
```

Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often
it can be used. An ability can be either, _passive_ ,
_minor_ , _heart_ , _major_ , _weekly_ , or _monthly_. This tag is
always listed as the first tag.

Pas s i v e A b i l i t y

There are no restrictions on how many times you
can use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability,
it is assumed to always be active.

Minor Ability

You may use this ability by spending a rush point
for each time you have used this ability including
this one during the current encounter. You may not
use it outside of an encounter.

Heart Abilit y

You may use this ability once per long rest. If
you take a wound, you may use the ability again.

Major Ability

```
You may use this ability once per long rest.
```

Weekly Abilit y

```
You may use this ability once per week.
```

Monthly Ability

```
You may use this ability once per month.
```

Ti m ing Tag

Outside of combat, you can use an ability
whenever you want—there are no restrictions
besides the ones listed on the ability itself. However,
during combat, you must have priority to use your
abilities. Priority is described in detail in the Combat
section. However, the _instant_ tag is an exception to

```
that rule. Abilities that don’t have the instant tag are
referred to as “priority abilities”.
```

```
Instant
If an ability is marked as instant, it means that
the ability can be used literally any time, even when
you don't have priority. While another creature is
using an ability, while you roll dice for an attack—
literally any time, so long as the ability doesn’t have
any further explicit instructions on when it can be
used.
If multiple creatures want to use an instant
ability, whoever declared their use last goes first.
You must declare the way in which you are using
your ability when you announce that you are using
an ability.
```

```
action Tag
During each round of combat, you only have one
action. By default, abilities don’t use your action
unless they have the full action tag.
If an ability is marked as full action , it means that
the ability uses your action. If you don't have an
action left during this round, you cannot use the
ability.
```

Other Rules

```
Forced Movement
If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and
this movement is interrupted by a wall, another
creature that is within two sizes of your own, or a
heavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you
immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for
every 5 feet remaining in your movement. If this
movement is stopped by a creature that is not
wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and
```

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

the total damage is split evenly between the two
creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to
move.

Size

Creatures can be of many different sizes. From
smallest to largest, they are: minuscule, tiny, small,
medium, large, and then L2, L3, L4, and so on.
Different sizes come with different bonuses and
penalties, especially in combat.
Up to a thousand minuscule creatures can fit into
