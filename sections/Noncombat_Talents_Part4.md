someone else within 10 feet, you can pull thoughts
from their mind. Make a contested cunning check
against another character. On a success, you may ask

```
one yes or no question about what they are thinking.
On a failure, they know that you tried to break into
their mind. You cannot steal dreams from the same
character more than once a day.
Destiny Level
You only require a few seconds of concentration
in order to use this ability. Additionally, on a success,
you may ask a follow up question.

Druid’s Step
Passive ability. Handmagic.
So long as you are walking on unaltered, natural
terrain, you may ignore difficult terrain, you cannot
be tracked if you do not wish to be, and your move
speed increases by 20 feet.
Destiny Level
Your move speed bonus increases by another 20
feet. You gain a 20 foot swim speed, and can climb
any tree with a 10 foot climb speed.
Whenever you move, you may move directly
through trees and other large plants.
If you have the destiny level of the Druid’s Touch
talent, you gain a move speed of 20 feet so long as
you are transformed as a plant.
```

```
Druid’s Touch
Passive ability. Handmagic.
As an action, by touching a plant, you can cause
it to grow as much as it would in one year over the
span of one minute. You may direct its growth, so
long as growing in such a way would not kill the
plant.
You can cause a plant you are touching to slowly
change its shape as you command, so long as its new
shape would not hurt the plant.
Destiny Level
As an action, you can meld with a tree, or other,
equally large plant. By doing so, your body and gear
disappears, and your spirit inhabits the wood of the
```

tree. You can sense your surroundings out to a range
of 45 feet.
While transformed as a tree, you maintain the
stats of your untransformed character, though your
defense becomes 8, and you may double your current
and hit points. You are also incapacitated, and cannot
speak. You may transform back to your original form
at will, or at the end of the round if in combat.

Druid’s Voice

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
You can communicate with plants, so long as you
are touching them. Plants recognize you as an ally,
and will generally be willing to help in any way they
can.

Destiny Level
If you speak in an area of dense vegetation, such
as a forest, plains, or garden, you may choose for
your voice to carry as whispers in the blade of grass
or leaves on the trees to everywhere within the
reaches of that vegetation, up to a 100 mile radius.
Likewise, you may choose to listen to any sounds or
voices within 100 miles, so long as you are both in
the same larger body of dense vegetation.
If you have the destiny level of the _Druid’s Touch_
talent, you may speak while transformed as a plant.

Eagle Eyed
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
You may take the _Lookout_ action for free, once
per travel and camp phase.

Destiny Level
Whenever you use the _Lookout_ action, choose
“threat” or “opportunity”. When you choose “threat,”
you automatically succeed the cunning check but do
not spot anything interesting. If you choose
opportunity, you only have to beat the challenge
number by one in order to spot something
interesting.

```
Elemental Affinit y
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
Choose an element. You gain a basic level of
attunement with that element, or gain an advanced
level of attunement with an element you already
have a basic attunement with. You may take this
talent multiple times.
Destiny Level
Choose an element you are attuned to. You do
not have to wait more than a single short rest
between casting spells that require just that element.
```

```
Every thing Has a Price
Weekly ability. Handmagic.
If you touch someone, you may force them to be
willing to sell any item to you. They will not
necessarily be willing to sell it for a price that you
desire, but if they would not have otherwise been
willing to sell the item, they are now.
Destiny Level
When you touch someone, you know with
certainty for the next 24 hours when they are
bluffing about anything related to prices, markets,
risk, and gambling.
```

```
Explorer
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
Adventuring and unexpected difficulty have
taught you how to prepare for any situation. At any
time, you may choose to allocate 10 slots of
inventory space as “adventuring gear”. When you do
so, choose one from the following list of benefits.
You can only choose each benefit once, and the slots
remain allocated until you reach a location where
you can resupply and change out your equipment.
```

  which direction is North.
- Your shelter counts as indoors for purpose of
  calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.

### TA L E N T S

- Your bed counts as a straw bed for the purpose
  of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.
