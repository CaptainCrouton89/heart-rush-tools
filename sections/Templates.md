Wildshape/Shapeshifter
You can take on features of other animals,
eventually capable of fully transforming.

Same as wereanimal, but instead of bloodthirsty
get penalty to cunning (down one size per tier while
transformed?) and some wishy-washy natury bullshit
aspect. This is WIP.

Daemonchosen

Becoming daemonchosen requires devoting ones
life and work to a daemon—usually in return for
their favor. While some daemonchosen are also
priests, the vast majority of priests are not also
daemonchosen. To be daemonchosen is more than
preaching for your patron—it is living in their image,
spreading their word, and acting in their stead.
Despite their incredible power, daemons are very
limited in

Scoundrel
You can offer something other than damage
whenever you deal damage. It gets to choose. Must
make offer before rolling. Can be any condition of
pushing, conditions, etc.

Scou n dr e l
Heart ability. Martial talent.
After making an attack roll against a target, but
before you deal damage to it, you may offer an
outcome other than damage. The target must choose
which option. For example, let’s if you were about to
deal damage to a guard, you may offer to instead
disarm and steal away the guard’s weapon. The GM
may then decide which outcome occurs. You get to
decide any mechanical effects of the damage-
alternative, though they must be described before the
GM chooses.

Contact-Effect Substances

There are various types of balms and ointments
that can be applied to weapons to give them contact
effects. These contact effects are effects that are
applied only when the substance makes contact with
blood, so they are used primarily on piercing and
slashing weapons.
Unless stated otherwise, these substances
remains active on a weapon indefinitely, and are
used up whenever you deal damage the first time
with that weapon.
In addition, unless otherwise stated, the
application of a contact-effect substance takes one
minute, and requires the use of a paintbrush or some
other applicator. A CN 10 substance application
(agility) check must be performed to avoid wasting
the substance.
One bottle of a contact-effect substance contains
10 doses.

Digestible Poisons

Digestible poisons are ones that only poison you
upon being digested. They have no effect unless they
are swallowed. Usually, they are more potent than
contact poisons, with more severe and potentially
long lasting effects.
One bottle of poison contains a single dose.

Friendliness

There are five levels of friendliness people have
between each other. Close, friendly, neutral,
unfriendly, and hostile. Someone who is close will
act charitably towards you, expecting nothing in
return. They likely will fight for you. Someone who
is friendly may take some minor inconveniences to
help you, but will not put their life or livelihood at

```
risk for you. Someone who is unfriendly may go
slightly out of their way to make your life worse.
Hostile creatures may risk their life or livelihood to
make your life worse.
