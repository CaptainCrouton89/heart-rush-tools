- Each day you must spend 15 minutes dedicated
  to your god. Whatever this activity this is, be it
  prayer, meditation, making music, or anything else,
  it is necessary to curry favor with your god. It
  cannot be a task that directly benefits you—it must
  primarily be for and about your god. Each day you
  do this, you gain two points of divine favor. Each
  day you don’t do this, you lose two points of
  divine favor. You can have a maximum of ten
  divine favor.

  you spend that time at a church, sacred shrine, or
  other, religiously significant location, gain twice as
  many points of divine favor for that day.
- Choose three handmagic talents. These are
  minor blessings that your god can grant you as
  their follower. You may spend one point of divine
  favor to have access to any one of these talents
  until the next dawn. Talents chosen must be
  approved by the GM to ensure they fit the thematic
  character of the god. Each additional talent you
  choose to access costs one additional point of
  divine favor.

  check in which one of your god’s aspects applies
  as though the aspect was your own. You may spend
  up to two points of divine favor each time you do
  this.
