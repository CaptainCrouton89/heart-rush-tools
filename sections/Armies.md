## Armies

Armies are fairly simple to handle. Any faction
can put together an army. It costs 1 surplus to recruit
1% of your population as a standing army, and 1
surplus for every 0.5% thereafter. This cost must be
paid each year. You may direct and move your forces
anywhere you like, though other factions may not
take kindly to you moving your armies on to land
they consider theirs. You may separate your army
into any size of discrete units—just make sure to
note how many soldiers exist in each unit.

Moving Armies

Most of the time, it is not important to keep track
of how quickly you can move units around—
nothing’s stopping them, and there’s no hurry.
However, during times of war, it can be important to
know exactly how long it takes to move a unit from
point A to point B.
A unit moves at a rate of 20 miles a day, and has
influence in a radius of 100 feet times the number of
people in the unit, to a maximum of 2 miles. If
another unit comes within this range of influence,
they may enter battle with the other unit. This is
important because it allows units to block
chokepoints; one army can’t slip past another in a
mountain pass—if one wants to fight, they have to
fight.

Battle

When carrying out a battle, the player should
take the size of their unit and divide it by the
combined sizes of both units, then multiply it by 100.
This is the target number. They then roll a d100. If
they roll under the target number, the player is
victorious! Otherwise, they suffer defeat.

```
Regardless of win or loss, both units must
disband 10% of their troops from casualties. Then,
compare the target number to the number rolled. If
the victor rolled between 1 and 20 more than the
target number, it was a minor victory. The defender
must choose to either give up ground, or to disband
20% of the troops in their unit, rather than just 10%.
If the victor rolled between 21 and 50 more than the
target number, it was a major victory. The defender
must give up ground and disband 30% of the troops
in their unit, rather than just 10%. If the victor rolled
more than 51 greater than the target number, it was a
route, and the defender must give up ground and
disband 60% of the troops in their unit, rather than
just 10%.
```

```
Giving Up Ground
When you give up ground, your unit no longer
prevents the other unit from moving past it for a day,
and your unit cannot move for a day. In the case of
failing to defend the mountain pass, the opposing
army would now free to march through the pass, on
towards your towns and cities. In the case of
defending a city, it means retreating from the city—
thereby granting the city to the attackers. Sometimes,
when in the case of a siege for example, the attacker
giving up ground has little to no effect, since the
troops within the walls of a castle have no reason to
leave.
```

```
Disbanding Troops
Disbanded troops are troops that have either died
or fled the battle, never to return. When you disband
troops, remove that many troops from your unit,
rounded up.
```

```
Situational Effects
In every battle, there is an attacker, and a
defender. The attacker is instigating, and the
```

defender is trying to hold a position. The attacker
wins if they can eventually destroy or dislodge the
defender, and the defender wins if the attacker gives
up. Before figuring out situational bonuses,
determine who is the attacker, and who is the
defender. If there truly is no attacker or defender,
there are no bonuses that are awarded. Otherwise,
apply any of the following bonuses and penalties, if
applicable:

- High ground: If the defenders have a clear
  terrain advantage, such as a narrow chokepoint or
  the high ground, multiply their effective troop
  count by 1.5.
- Fortified: If the defenders are behind fortified
  walls, multiply their effective troop count by 3.
- Unprepared: If the defenders were caught
  completely off guard by the attack, multiply their
  effective troop count by 1/3.

Player Intervention

Players may wish to participate in battles with
their units. If this is the case, they

Rules

This section includes a few more rules if you
want a bit more crunch to your combat. They only
build on the basic rules for armies.

Specific Troops

You may choose to include more specificity than
just “regular soldiers”. In this case, the GM will
allocate special traits to enemy troops, and will allow
player armies to pick up special traits as well, where
reasonable. Some example traits are listed below:

- Orcs: Large - These troops count as 1.5 troops
  for the purpose of determining the result of a battle
- Cavalry: Quick - These troops count as 1.2
  troops for the purpose of determining the result of
  a battle, and can move 50% further each day.
- Ix Tyrann: Vicious - Opposing units lose an
  additional 10% of their troops, regardless of a win
  or loss.
- Trolls: Regenerative - These units lose half as
  many troops whenever they disband.
