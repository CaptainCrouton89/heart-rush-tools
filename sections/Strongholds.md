## Strongholds

Strongholds represent loci of power for players.
Although not necessarily literally strongholds, they
act as recurring bases of operations for the activities
of the players. They can provide income, followers,
influence in exchange for maintenance and care.
Examples of strongholds include palaces, forges,
colleges, and inns, though many more exist.
Strongholds can be owned by multiple players.

Building Your Stronghold

In order to gain a stronghold, the owner must pay
an amount of ducat equal to the square footage of the
stronghold they wish to construct. If there are special
features of the stronghold, such as those listed in the
price modifiers table, then those price modifiers are
multiplied by the base price for the final cost.
Different types of strongholds have different
minimum levels, which you must also meet in order
to build them. It is up to the GM to determine how
long building any particular stronghold takes, though
it is suggested that building it takes between six
months and two years, and upgrades take about half
as much time.

```
During construction, and upon completion, it is
assumed that your stronghold becomes populated
with whatever folks are typical of the type of
residence. Shopkeepers, stable masters, craftsmen,
servants—these people and more will arrive and
begin working in your stronghold. Some of these
people would typically require payment to work
here, while others would typically pay taxes; don’t
bother keeping track of the specifics—all of this
flow of money is wrapped up in the initial cost of
construction and income generated by your
stronghold thereafter.

Miscellaneous Rules

```
Upgrading Your Stronghold
Upgrading your strong hold is as easy as paying
the difference in prices between the current value of
your stronghold and the new value of your
stronghold.

Multiple Strongholds

If you wish to own multiple strongholds, they
must share physical proximity. This could mean
building a large library stronghold in your castle
stronghold, or it could mean attaching a wizard
tower stronghold to your laboratory stronghold.
What’s important is that your presence and identity
is closely tied to each of them, and they share a close
connection to each other, which is not possible if
they are hundreds or thousands of miles apart.

Types of Strongholds

In exchange for their enormous costs,
strongholds have substantial benefits unique to each
type of stronghold. Regardless of what type of
stronghold you choose, you and the stronghold’s
inhabitants and owners all have advantage on rolls
made to defend your stronghold.

College

_Minimum level 2._
A college is a place of learning and further
education. This could be academic or scholarly in
nature, or it could be a training grounds, built to
teach one the arts of fighting or espionage. As the
leader of a college, you have influence on the great
minds of the next generation.
In order to build a college, you must also build a
library at a level no less than half the level of the
college, rounded up. This ratio must be maintained
as you level up your college.
As your college grows and people graduate, you
attract some of the graduates as followers. Whenever
you upgrade your college to another level (or for
each level beyond 2 that it was built at), you gain a
level 3 follower with a focus on whatever is taught at
your college.

```
At level 5 your college can offer a more
advanced program. You gain a level 4 follower, and
another one for every subsequent upgrade.
At level 8 your college is one of the most
prestigious places of learning in the world. When
you upgrade to level 8, you gain a level 5 follower.
```

```
Guild House
Minimum level 2.
You are the leader of your own guild house. As it
grows, it will become the hub of business for all of
your chosen field.
A guild house generates 10% of it’s total value
every year.
Guild house owners gain a level of advantage for
every level of the guild on ability checks for business
interactions that take place in the guild.
Additionally, gaining the services of the guild is
discounted at a rate of 5% per level of the guild
house.
```

```
House
Minimum level 1.
Your house is your personal haven—a place to
unwind and relax, store your belongings while
traveling, and to host parties.
All owners of the house gain the free aspect of
“Just want to get home safe” at a rank equal to the
level of your house. You can invoke this aspect
whenever you are doing anything to help you get
back home after going out adventuring.
Once per month, you may throw large social
events at your house. When you throw the event, in
addition to regular friends and folk, X people of
influence 1 higher than your current influence show
up, where X is the level of your house. During these
events, stronghold owners may treat their influence
as though it was one level greater than it is for the
purpose of making connections and socializing with
any guests.
```

Additionally, your house contains one attendant
per level of the house. They live at the house and
will not come with you on your travels. If the
attendant has abilities that normally only affect one
person, they instead apply to all owners of the house.
If the attendant has abilities that scale off of
influence level, use the level of the house instead.

present in your collection. Another column exists for
information known by 1,000 people or more.

re-roll checks to determine if your desired
information is present.

Starting at level 2, and once again for each level
thereafter, through trade and scouting, your librarians

choice. Talk with the GM to determine the specifics

```

```
Sanctuary
Minimum level 2.
A sanctuary is a place of elemental focus. If you
share an elemental attunement with the sanctuary,
meditating within it can be refreshing and
empowering.
When you create a sanctuary, choose an element.
That element is imbued into building during
construction. When you take a short rest in this
sanctuary, all spells of the corresponding element are
refreshed. I
When you upgrade your temple to level 3,
choose a spell from the same element as the
sanctuary. After a short rest within the sanctuary, if
you are attuned to the same element as the sanctuary,
you gain the ability to cast that spell until you take
your next long rest.
When you upgrade your sanctuary to level 4,
your own abilities with the element of the sanctuary
improve. While within your sanctuary, if you and the
sanctuary share an attunement to an element, treat
your attunement to that element as one level higher.
When you upgrade you sanctuary to level 8, the
sanctuary’s magic lasts with you longer. Whenever
you take a short rest within your sanctuary, if you
and the sanctuary share an attunement to an element,
treat your attunement to that element as one level
higher until you take your next long rest.
