intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get
into trouble all the time—but they are definitely
clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves,
merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are
known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently
witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons.
While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content
to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from
battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen
wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and
competent.
Goshwen’s culture of openness and constant
change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of
their communities. This has given rise to many

```
different branches of Goshwen communities across
Alaria with different quirks and identities. However,
all of them maintain their appreciation for progress
and wit.

Ezuri (Tr e e G n om e)
The Ezuri, or “tree people” as it translates to
from Old Gnomish, stemmed from when Mad
Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the
Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the forest
dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters.
While many fled the jungle, some were trapped, and
forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease
had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their
new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across
Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built
among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty
places.
The Ezuri also value connection with each other
as well as the natural world around them, and are
taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a
young age. This, combined with their natural affinity
for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger
humanoids across Alaria.

### KIN & CULTURE

Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father
and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father
may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all
raised together, with no knowledge of their specific
mother. The brood-father, over the course of his
lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen,
who will mother the next brood-father—the first
born son.
Most goblins live in communities around a single
goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and
friends are one’s half-siblings. This can lead to
bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict.
Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie
that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

Vitals

- Size: Small
- Height: 2.5-3.5 feet
- Weight: 40-100 pounds

Cooperative

_Passive ability._
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or
take the help action in combat, you provide two
levels of advantage rather than one, and they may
add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You
do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin,
they gain three levels of advantage instead.

Scal awag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their
mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature.
They are viewed more as pests than as people by
many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a
scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat
similar to that of ants. However; living among

```
Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of
merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are
born into enormous broods, and are expected to
defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will
spend most of their lives doing just that, along with
anything else they feel like doing. Besides the
general wellbeing of the community, though,
scalawags have few other obligations, and will
sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the
most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.
Scalawag can be found across the mountains and
scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are
known for their incredible performers, parties, and
oddly enough, philosophers.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Emotionally turbulent
- Impulsive and improvisational

```
Ankle Biter
Passive ability.
Rules for moving through and climbing on
creatures larger than yourself apply even if the
creature is only one size larger than you. You have
advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold
onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do
not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same
space as a hostile creatures provides one level of
cover from attacks from all other creatures.
```

```
Etherweaver
Etherweavers get their name for their longtime
mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark,
force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver
bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and
every goblin is born with an attunement to one of
those elements.
Etherweavers are generally more reserved and
cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value

preparation, and are usually more conscientious,
even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the
brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at
protecting their broods using magic, and therefore
require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that
etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging
in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a
greater sense of individuality among the
etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is
less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.
The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go
on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural
affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a
leg up over others, though etherweavers can be
found in nearly any other profession as well—having
elemental attunements can always come in handy.

- Level-headed
- Reflective and thoughtful

### KIN & CULTURE

Minotaur

Minotaur are mighty, formidable creatures,
known for their powerful builds and no-nonsense
nature. Although most grow up in minotaur-
dominated communities, they have spread out across
Alaria, and can be found in great numbers in many
large armies.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 6-7.5 feet
- Weight: 200-350 pounds

Minotaur Horns
_Passive ability._

The horns on your head count as a heavy
piercing melee weapon so long as you move at least
15 feet in a straight-line towards an enemy before
immediately attacking. You get one level of
advantage on your attacks made with your horns for
every 15 feet you charged before you attack. This
stacks up three times.

Danaki

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their
terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as
the baby minotaur children are raised by the village.
Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they
interested in finding out. From a young age, they are
taught to fight and kill, usually long before they
learn how to read and write.
Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk
state of anger and pure, single-minded aggression.
During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and
incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring
many injuries.

```
Danaki are trained from a young age to express
very little emotion, and suppress it if possible.
Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as
signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not
felt those things since they were a child. Marriages
in Danaki villages are arranged by the village
council once each member in the union has been
deemed “stable”. Most Danaki view their marriage
as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing
that you have completed your growth. The marriages
are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many
aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.
Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to
one another, they admit it only in confidence, and
believe themselves capable of making decisions
completely unaffected by that attachment.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Show no weakness
- Obstinately bullheaded

```
Berserk
Major ability. Instant.
It is said that the Danaki rage is the physical
release of all the pent up emotions held within them.
Whether this is true is up to you.
Whenever you take damage, you may enter a
berserk state. While berserk, your movement speed
increases by 20, and increase every instance of
incoming and outgoing physical damage by 2. You
remain berserk so long as you make an A/D roll or
enter an engagement each round, up to a minute.
```

```
Lorean Minotaur
While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary
crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the
commanding general for a king’s army. In describing
the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most
famously quoted that “Lorean think with their head,
```

not with their horns”. Of course, if you ask their
spouses, they will say that they “think with their
head, not with their hearts”. This is the cursed
blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded,
but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems
in any other way.
Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on
education and sound decision making. To make a
mistake because emotions clouded one’s judgement
is worthy of profound shame. It’s not that Lorean
don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them
influence one’s decision at all is weakness and
failure, especially when other people’s wellbeing is
at stake.
This sense of duty towards protection lies as
deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards
emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been
placed in charge of his troop will die before letting
his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the
ultimate failure as a minotaur—worthy of self-exile.
Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to
such high standards, including other minotaur, every
Lorean would never give such leniency to
themselves.

Aspects

- Profoundly caring
- Emotions get in the way of logical thinking

Tac t i c a l S u p r e m ac y
_Passive ability._
You may take an additional help action each
round. When you take the help action, you may
instead choose a willing creature within 30 feet and
move it 5 feet in any direction. This movement does
not provoke opportunity attacks.

### KIN & CULTURE

Tr ol l k i n

Half-breeds and outcasts—trollkin are the
unwanted children of humans and trolls. Rare is the
troll and human couple, and rarer still is the trollkin
child that makes it past the first few months in the
world. If not surreptitiously smothered or abandoned
in a forest, most trollkin end up in orphanages, where
they grow up as outsiders amongst their peers. In
troll communities, they are viewed as weak and
fragile, and in human communities, they are viewed
as too stupid and emotionless to be effective
members of society.
Unfortunately for trollkin, they are perfectly
capable of understanding and figuring out many
things, but are terrible at expressing it. Some trollkin
abandon society to live alone in nature, becoming
hermits and befriending the animals around them,
who they may feel more comfortable around.
Others choose to become experts in a niche field
of academics, where they do not need to interact
with many people, but can still let their creative,
roaming minds explore. Many of the greatest
discoveries were made by trollkin, though credit may
never be given to their name.
Still others turn to more violent areas of life.
When faced with the constant frustration of trying to
get others to understand you, some eventually
consider violence. Due to their troll blood and hide,
trollkin are formidable agents in combat.

Aspects

- Thick-headed
- Contemplating what no one else is

Vitals

- Size: Large
- Height: 7.5-8.5 feet
- Weight: 200-400 pounds
