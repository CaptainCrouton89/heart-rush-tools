## Advanced Character Creation

WARNING: This section is still work in
progress.
For added depth to character creation and
progression, there are several other steps to character
creation. Everyone in the group should decide
together if they would like to use these optional
rules.

Skills

Skills represent talent in a specific area. When
you create a character, you start with no skills.
However, as you spend downtime practicing new
things and overcoming difficult tasks, you begin to
learn, slowly and automatically increasing your rank
in the relevant skills.
Like aspects, specializations are just a title and a
rank that grants bonuses to related skill checks.
When you create your character, you start with
no skills.
Gaining ranks in a skill happens via training and
overcoming challenges during gameplay. To gain a
rank in any skill, consult the following table.

```
The columns after the column for rank represent
the requirements for gaining that rank in a skill.
```

```
Downtime Weeks
In order to get the rank in a skill, you must spend
at least that many weeks of downtime devoted to
studying, training, and practicing that skill.
Additional weeks do not count towards future ranks.
```

```
Challenges
In addition to downtime spent practicing, you
need to succeed at a certain number of challenges to
achieve the next rank. A challenge is anything that
meets the following criteria:
```

- It must be a skill check using your
  specialization.
- The CN for the roll is at least the maximum of
  your heart die + your rank in the skill.
- There are narrative stakes to failing the roll.
  If all criteria are met, and the skill check is
  successful, you may mark down a challenge
  completed. Here are some examples of some skills
  and some corresponding challenges.
- Pickpocketing: Pickpocket a very wealthy
  merchant who’s actively looking for pickpockets.
- Hunting: Shoot a rampaging bull in the streets
  before the it hurts someone.
- Chariot Racing: Beat a fellow chariot driver in
  a race.

Completing extra challenges does not count
towards future ranks.

Missions

Missions demonstrate an even greater mastery of
a particular skill. Like challenges, there are certain
criteria for a mission.

- It must represent deeper learning, mastery, or
  understanding of the skill, requiring its application
  multiple times, or a few times in critical
  circumstances. This should scale up as the rank in
  your skill increases.
- Success is uncertain, and cannot be
  automatically achieved with a single, high roll.
- There are narrative stakes to failing the roll.
  If all criteria are met and you succeed at what
  you set out to do, you may mark down the mission
  completed. Here are some examples of some skills
  and some corresponding missions.
- Playing the Lute: Perform at a prestigious
  venue with positive audience reaction.
- Painting: Get a painting commissioned for
  nobility and impress them.
- Jousting: Win the jousting tournament
  Completing extra missions does not count
  towards future ranks. However, one mission can
  satisfy the requirements for multiple skills so long as
  those skills clearly apply.

Skill & Background Overlap

If you would like to start learning a skill that you
would have picked up from your background, you
may request to start your rank in that skill at the rank
of the background. The GM has final say.

Using a Skill

Whenever you make a skill check that would
reasonably use a skill you have a rank in, you may
add your rank in the skill to the roll. If you have a

```
background that also applies, you must choose to
either use the bonus from the background or the
bonus from the skill.
If a skill only “sort of” applies, you may apply
half of your bonus, rounded down.
```

Age

When you create your character, choose an age:
young, adult, or elderly. Each age comes with
distinct benefits and drawbacks.

adjustments.

- You start with only two ranks worth of
  backgrounds, rather than four.

  than 5 points in it.
