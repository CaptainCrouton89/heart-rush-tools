## Ta l e n t s

Talents represent specific abilities you have
learned, been gifted, or know how to perform
through religious or magical ritual.
Each talent will fall into one of three types of
abilities: passive abilities, heart abilities, or major
abilities. As with abilities gained from your class,
passive abilities can be used whenever and at no
cost, and major abilities can be used once per day.
Heart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only
after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you
take a wound.
Additionally, talents may also have the _instant_ or
_full action_ tag. If it is _instant_ , then you can use the
ability at literally any time, even right before you
roll. If it has the _full action_ tag, it requires you to use
your action.

Ty p e s o f Ta l e n t s

Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by
their tags. Each require different conditions to be met
in order to gain that talent.

Cognitive and Martial Talents

Martial talents are those that require physical
prowess and training. They represent the cumulation
of extensive practice and training. There are no
prerequisites for taking a martial talent.
Cognitive talents, like martial talents, come from
vigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no
prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.

Gaeic Melodies
Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that
reverberate throughout all living things—left over
from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world
into life.
Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to
them have magical effects. However, they cannot be
discovered innately, and require a teacher or a
songbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or
higher aspect in musical talents in order to play
them.
When playing a gaeic melody, it requires your
action to play the instrument. You can move up to
half your move speed while playing, but cannot
move more than that. You cannot play more than one
gaeic melody at the same time.
```

```
Handmagic
Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create
their effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where
words spoken in it simply come true.
Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the
back of one’s hand, inscribed in the blood of magical
creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the
tattooed hand in specific ways, one can then create

GM Note
Gaeic melodies and handmagic are rooted in
lore specific to “Alaria”, the world held in mind
during the writing of the Heart Rush rulebook.
Feel free to re-flavor these tags, remove them, or
add new tags and categorizations.
```

those magical effects. The knowledge and necessary
materials to inscribe hand runes is rare and
expensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely
require you to be in a city.

Combat Talents

The talents in this section are combat-related
talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding
talents, and has no other effect.

Adrenaline Spike
_Major ability. Handmagic._

Increase the size of an ability die for a single roll.
You can't increase the size of the die beyond a d12.

Destiny Level
Increase the size of the die by two instead, or
increase a d12 to a d20.

Agile
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
When you choose the agility stance, you may
sidestep twice instead of once.

Destiny Level
Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared
this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D
rolls made this round. Increase the die’s size by one
for each consecutive time you chose this stance.

Assassin
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
You have learned the art of debilitating your foes
and killing them silently. When you enter an
engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately
make a might or agility check against their agility
challenge number. On a success, you either gag
them, garrote them, or in some other way remove
their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot

```
produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is
surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.
Destiny Level
Once per month, you may declare a humanoid to
be the target of your assassination. So long as that
creature never learns you are an assassin, they
remain marked.
Given you spend one month studying the target
of your assassination before attempting to kill them,
you have A5 on opportunity attacks made against
your target, and advantage on all other attacks
against it.
```

```
Back Stab
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
If you and another ally are opposite to each other
with an enemy directly between you (you can draw a
line from a single corner of your space to every
corner of the ally’s space such that the line passes
completely through the enemy’s space), and the
enemy has used its action to enter an engagement
with your ally this round, you may treat your weapon
as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against
that enemy until end of the round. You must be
wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the
benefits of this ability.
You may also use this die if you are granted an
opportunity attack because you are hidden.
Destiny Level
You may replace your weapon die with 2d20
instead.
```

```
Baited Attack
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
If a creature makes an attack against you and
deals no damage to you, they instead deal damage
equal to their roll to another creature behind you as
you redirect their attack. A creature is considered
behind you if at least one straight line can be drawn
```

### TA L E N T S

from a corner of the attacker’s space, through your
space, and to a corner of the new victim’s space.

Destiny Level
When you use this ability, both creatures gain 2
levels of enraged towards you.

Ballad Of Björn
_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._

After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose any number of creatures
besides yourself within 60 feet and in earshot. They
lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had
any, and are immune to both conditions for the next
24 hours.
In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest,
and gain one additional rush point the next time they
gain rush points today.

Destiny Level
This ability becomes a major ability. You may
include yourself in the creatures affected by your
song.

BattleFrenzy

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
While there are two or more enemies adjacent to
you, you have advantage on your attack roll for each
enemy adjacent to you.

Destiny Level
Whenever you start the round with two or more
enemies adjacent to you, you gain a rush point for
each adjacent enemy.

Battlescreech

_Heart ability. Martial talent._
You emit a horrifying, earsplitting screech,
terrifying and disturbing your enemies. Choose any
number of creatures within 30 feet. Those creatures
get D2 on their next A/D roll.

```
Destiny Level
Those creatures also don’t gain the benefit of the
next stance they choose, and gain two levels of
dazed.
```

```
Battleweave
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you sidestep, you deal damage to an
adjacent creature at your new location equal to twice
the number of enemies you began the round adjacent
to.
Destiny Level
You may choose to either deal twice as much
damage to the target of this ability, or the same
amount of damage to every adjacent enemy.
```

```
Beast Bond
Passive ability. Handmagic. Prerequisite: Beast Companion
You can magically, telepathically communicate
with your companion, and over any distance.
As an action, you may begin sensing through the
senses of your beast companion. You cannot use
your own senses again until you spend an action
returning to your own body.
Destiny Level
As an action, you may take total control of your
beast companion. While in control, you play each
round as the animal instead of yourself. You may use
any cognitive and martial talents you have, but the
cooldowns are not separate for your animal. For
example, once you've used a major ability, you
cannot use it yourself or as your animal until you
take a long rest. You may also cast spells you know
and use your attunements as the animal.
While controlling your companion, your body
falls prone and is incapacitated, and you cannot
sense using your body’s senses. You may return to
your body as an action.
```

Beast Companion
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Choose an animal with the GM’s approval. It has
a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, must be of small size or
smaller, has 20 hit point capacity, and a d6 heart die
(you may work with your GM to adjust these
values). You can communicate simple ideas with it
from a distance using verbal and somatic commands.
The animal obeys all your commands.
When in combat, your companion is not very
effective on its own. Your companion cannot use its
action to enter engagements, though it can still be
forced into engagements by other combatants. It can
otherwise use its action normally.
You may take this talent any number of times.
If your companion dies, you may choose to
replace this talent with another talent instead.

Destiny Level
You may spend XP on your beast companion as
though it were yourself. Beast companions cannot
gain talents as oaths, and cannot gain cognitive
talents. Your beast companion cannot gain a beast
companion.
While adjacent to your companion, if you or your
companion would be forced to make a defense roll,
the other may choose to step in to make the defense
roll and take the damage instead. If that creature was
already being attacked from the same source, they
cannot use this ability.

Beckon
_Heart ability. Handmagic._

Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. It
teleports to a free space in which it can stand that is
adjacent to you.

```
Destiny Level
The range extends to 90 feet instead.
```

```
Blink Step
Heart ability. Instant. Handmagic.
When you dash, you may instead teleport to an
unoccupied space that you can see within 90 feet.
Destiny Level
So long as you are holding on to someone, they
may come with you if they are willing. You can
bring up to two creatures besides yourself when
using this ability.
```

```
Bloodblade
Passive ability. Handmagic.
Whenever you make an attack roll, you may first
choose to lose 4 hit points. If you do, add 1d8 to
your roll.
Destiny Level
You may lose 6 hit points and add 1d12 instead.
```

```
Bloodknight
Passive ability. Handmagic.
The first time you gain hit points each round,
gain an additional 2 hit points.
Destiny Level
Instead, gain an additional 4 hit points.
```

```
Bloodlust
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you make an attack roll against an
enemy that has taken a wound, you may give it three
levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened.
Destiny Level
If that creature is already dazed, off-balanced, or
weakened, you have advantage on your attack, and
regain 4 hit points.
```

```
Bloodoath
Weekly ability. Handmagic.
As an action, you swear vengeance against a
creature that you believe has wronged you. You can
```

### TA L E N T S

only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time.
While you have sworn vengeance against a creature
you always know where the creature is, and
whenever you engage with or make an opportunity
attack against the creature you gain a rush point at
the beginning of the next round.

Destiny Level
You have advantage on A/D rolls against your
sworn enemy. In addition, you do not need to use
your action to use this ability.

Body Shield
_Heart ability. Martial talent._
The next time you are hit by a melee attack from
a source that is adjacent to both you and a creature
you are grappling, if the attacking creature’s stance
did not directly beat your own, you may use the
grappled creature as a body shield. Add the
creature’s defense bonus to your own and split the
damage between you, rounding up.

Destiny Level
You may use this ability against ranged attacks as
well, so long as the grappled creature is between you
and the source (a line can be drawn from one of your
corners to theirs that passes through the grappled
creature’s space).
When you use this ability, the grappled creature
