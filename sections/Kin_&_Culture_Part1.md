## Kin & Culture

When you create a character, choose a race, and
if available, an associated heritage within that race.
Your race is your literal species of sentient creature,
while your heritage describes the collective identity,
history, and culture you belong to. Heritages come
and go with the millennia, and transform over time,
while a race will stay the same.
Many races have multiple heritages to choose
from. This stems from their relative profusion across
thew world. Races with fewer heritages, or only one
heritage are less prolific, and therefore lack the same
levels of variety.
When you choose your race and heritage, you
gain all of the aspects and abilities granted by your
choices. The aspects from your race and heritage are
suggestions for that group, but you are welcome to
choose different aspects, so long as you make sure
you have a clear idea of why _you_ are different from
the rest of your community.
The races and heritages are listed at the end of
this book because they are the easiest to be added to.
If you have an idea for a new race or heritage for
your group, don’t hesitate to reach out to the GM and
propose your idea. Each race and heritage
combination adds up to about 2.5-3 talents worth of
power.

```
GM Note
The races listed in this chapter are a small
selection of the races that exist in the author’s
own campaign setting. But you should create
your own—it’s easy! Every race is just two
aspects, and two abilities that are each about as
powerful as a talent.
```

Human

Humans are resilient and abundant. They are far
the most prolific across Alaria, and have the greatest
breadth of culture. Contributing to their success as a
species is their perseverance; just when you think
you’ve knocked one down for good, they’re back up
for more.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Human Resilience and Diversity
_Passive ability._

When you gain this ability, choose one talent.
You gain this talent as a racial ability (it does not
count towards the number of talents you have).
In addition, whenever you take a wound, you
gain a rush point at the start of the next round.

Drachma

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous,
and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and
following ones instincts. They are usually the first
one you notice when walking into a room—both for
their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of
them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities.
It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.
Drachma are generally found in western regions
of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their
pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their
hearty Drachman ale.

Aspects

- Style is everything
- I follow my instincts

```
Instinctive
Passive ability.
When you get a complication on a skill check
and choose to re-roll, add 3 to the new result.
```

```
Tikh aya
Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value
strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for
being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that
Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are
comfortable spending time alone and in
contemplation. There is a sort of strength that
emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with
their physiology—but instead from their self-
certainty and outlook on the ways of the world. Even
Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about
them that is hardly met by even adults of other
cultures.
Tikhaya can be found across central and northern
Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are
known for their incredible philosophers,
mathematicians, and martial warriors.
```

```
Aspects
```

- I know right from wrong
- Wise in the ways of the world

```
Clear Mind
Passive ability.
You are immune to being confused, frightened,
enraged, or charmed. Additionally, you have A2
when making skill checks or saving throws to see
through deception.
```

```
Neth
Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a
high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It
is easy to misinterpret a Neth’s silence at a joke as
boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look
```

### KIN & CULTURE

carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they
will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while
never breaking a smile.
Neth are best known for their ability to speak
with the wind, allowing them to communicate with
the deceased members of their communities to gather
advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is
central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-
composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For
this reason, maintaining good relation with one’s
family, and community are critical to Neth culture,
an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they
meet who become close.
Neth can be found across the North Reach, along
the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above
Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers,
and resilient warriors.

Aspects

- Inscrutable
- If you look after nature, nature will look after
  you

Speak With the Wind
_Major ability._
While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you
can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day,
while not in combat, you may reach out to your
ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- Questions and Answers: You may ask them up
  to three questions. They answer to the best of their
  ability. Although they only know what they knew
  during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans
  nearly a millennium.
- Guidance: Define a specific type of task or
  activity. Once, before the end of the day, before
  making a roll for that task or activity, you may
  declare that you are using your ancestors’
  guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die
  with the maximum result of that die.

```
This entire ritual takes 1 minute.

Oznak
Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and
place a high emphasis on proving one’s self-worth
and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a
young age, children are taught with sticks how to
wield a sword, even if they will never be able to
afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in
Oznak-dominated settlements also include different
types of competitions involving sword play, and
proper tournaments are common in some regions.
While excelling with the blade garners the most
respect, those who don’t become the best are
pressured to succeed and dominate in another field.
This mentality results in a culture of highly
competitive people. Because they value skill so
highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is
seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into
a duel with an Oznak.
Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria,
though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in
the world, and are known for their technical
craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying
swordsmen.
```

```
Aspects
```

- I am no coward
- Fiercely competitive

```
Technical Master
Passive ability.
Choose a weapon or tool. If it is a weapon, you
have advantage while wielding it. If it is a tool, you
have A2 on all checks requiring the use of this tool.
```

```
Naga (Dragon Blooded)
Naga make up a long line of humans with dragon
blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant
```

descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-
father and first son of Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died
to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and
threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his
ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly
defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically,
Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally
grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon
and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and
heated the lands beneath it, the people below
transformed and became the Naga that still exist
today.
Naga are passionate and determined in all that
they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich
culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy.
They also have a profound sense of pride, both for
themselves, their culture, and the things they care
about. If they feel that any of those things have been
wronged, then they will not back down until amends
have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to
behold.

Aspects

- Iron determination
- Boiling vengeance

Aspect of the Dragon

_Major ability._
You may channel your blood of Naga, and
transform into a dragon-like form. Your head morphs
into the head of a dragon and your scales surface in
patches over your skin. While in this form, you gain
the following traits:

- You take half damage from fire.
- You gain +1 to defense rolls from your natural,
  scaly armor.
- You may belch fire, dealing 2d6 damage in a
  10-foot cone. You may only use this ability once
  per transformation.
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you
  gain one level of enraged towards that creature. If
  another creature deals damage to you, remove all
  other levels of enraged gained from this ability.
- You have advantage on skill checks to
  intimidate others.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

```
Ulvsjael (Wolf C h i ldr e n)
The ulvsjael are human descendants of Ulvma,
the wolf mother and the second child of the Gaea.
When Shara Bolasi died in his duel against
Hykravones, Nagatayora had descended into
madness, Ulvma stayed back with the armies of
Alaria and fought till the very end before being cut
down and collapsing into the ground amongst the
armies. When humans came and drank from her
blood, the Ulvsjael were born.
The Ulvsjael are a pragmatic and fiercely loyal
race who believe in the natural order of life. Much of
life revolves around small, nomadic units which
travel as a pack. They will protect their comrades
with their own lives, but they also feel no qualms
about keeping those who cannot defend themselves
alive. If you cannot contribute, you are culled. This
harsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders,
who are usually seen as dead weight until they have
proven their worthiness to their pack. However,
when the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider—a rare
appearance, due to their tendency to stick with their
kind—they are frequently the hardest working, such
is their desire to prove their usefulness to a new
community.
Ulvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are
known for their formidable mercenary groups,
trackers, and explorers.
```

### KIN & CULTURE

Aspects

- Loyal to a fault
- Only the strong can survive

Aspect of the Wolf
_Major ability._
You may channel your blood of Ulvsjael, and
transform into a wolf-like form. Your head morphs
into the head of a wolf and claws grow on your
hands. While in this form, you gain the following
traits:

- You gain A2 on all skill checks for perceiving
  things that can be smelt or heard.
- Your move speed increases by 40 feet.
- Your jaws and claws count as light piercing
  and slashing melee weapons, respectively.
- Whenever you are in an engagement, choose a
  valid target for your stance. All creatures have
  advantage on attack rolls against that creature.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or
  manipulate fine objects.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

Sharabha (Li o n H e a r t s)

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the
great lion father and third child of Gaea. When
Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was
the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand
against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing
battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before
at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped
Shara Bolasi’s heart out through his chest, before
stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when
people had settled across Alaria once more, the
humans who ate from the soil there became the first
Sharabha.
Sharabha are known for their warmth,
compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha
