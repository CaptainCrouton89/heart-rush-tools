## Magical Crafting

Any bit of magical crafting begins with its
components—a collection of magically potent
materials that will be combined to create the product.
Metals, gems, bloods, powders, horns, teeth, and
hides are all examples of potential magical
components.
Every component has two properties, each
determined at the GM’s discretion. First is its level.
This determines how powerful of an effect that
material can create. Second are its tags. Tags are
used to describe the type of magical ability
associated with a material. For example, pixie dust
could be a magical component. The GM may then
decide that it is a level 4 component with the tags
“psychic”, “air”, and “illusion”. The GM may also
decide that they want silver to be a level 2 magical
substance, and because they don't think it has any
specific magical properties, give it the “neutral” tag.
The GM should refer to the following sections to
determine the power level and tags of a component.
For examples of magic items, and their level and
tags, refer to Appendix C.

Power Level

The power level table is used for determining the
level of magical items as well as their components.
When determining the power level of a component,
the GM should assign it a level corresponding to the
highest power level one could feasibly achieve if the
component was the most critical component to an
item’s function. For example, let’s assign the power
level to a unicorn horn. As the GM, imagine that the
most powerful item we think the horn could
reasonably be used as the center piece for was a

```
“unicorn horn wand” that could powerfully charm
multiple people at a time. With this vague idea in
mind, we can assign it a power level of 4, since that’s
roughly the power level of that wand.
```

```
Tag s
The tags table is used for determining which tags
belong to a component. With the exception of the
“neutral” tag, all tags have a specific flavor of magic.
If a component feels like it meets the description for
a tag, that tag belongs on the component. For any
material or component that feels like it might be used
```

```
Power Level
Le v e l Power Level Description
1 Not powerful. More cosmetic, or flavorful
than anything else. +1 bonus to skill
checks..
2 The power of a talent. Roughly 2.5 damage
per round, or a +2 bonus to skill checks.
3 The power of a talent with its destiny level.
Roughly 5 damage per round, or a +3
bonus to skill checks.
4 A substantially powerful effect, such as a
paragon level. Roughly 8 damage per
round, or a +5 bonus to skill checks.
5 An incredible effect, but not one that could
be described as legendary. Multiple
paragon levels, for example. Roughly 20
damage per round.
6 Wondrous effects, potentially able to
instantly kill commoners. Not necessarily
one-of-a-kind, but probably. Their locations
are likely known throughout history—they
are viewed as legendary artifacts.
7 Beyond legendary.
```

in a magic item, but it doesn’t necessarily have a
specific use, it should likely receive the “neutral”
tag. For example, as the GM, if you want precious
metals and gems to be prevalent in all sorts of
magical items, they should have the “neutral” tag.

Crafting the Item

```
Before you can begin crafting the item, you must
first determine if you are following a procedure or if
you are inventing. If you have a blueprint, plan, or
recipe, or have one memorized, then you are
following a procedure. If you’ve never made
something before and are hoping to create a desired
effect, then you are inventing. Each involves
different steps.
```

```
Following Procedure
When following procedure, the GM will tell you
the level of the item you are crafting and the required
components. You must have each of the required
components, and you must have an aspect related to
crafting of rank equal to or greater than the level of
the item you are creating. Proceed to the Crafting
Check section.
```

```
Inventing
When inventing, the details of what you are
trying to make need to be ironed out first. Describe
to the GM what you want to make. Work with them
to determine the exact details of what the magical
item does, how often it can be used, and any other
properties of the item. As the player, it is ultimately
up to you to determine the stats of the item you wish
to create. With the stats clearly defined, the GM

```

should then determine the power level of the
described item using the _Power Level_ chart. This
process should be collaborative between the player
and GM.
After determining the level, the GM should
decide what types of components the item requires.
An item recipe should require at least one
component with a tag relating to each unique effect
of the item, and should require a total number of
components equal to the level of the item. If the total
number of specific types of components don’t sum to
the level of the item, the remaining components
should be neutral components. All components must
be of an equal or greater level than the crafted item
itself.

Crafting

Once you have determined the level and the tags
of the magic item, you can attempt to craft it. For
each tag on the magic item, you must have a
corresponding, distinct component of level equal or
greater than the level of the magic item you are
trying to craft. You must also have an aspect of rank
equal to or greater than the level of the item you are
creating.

Crafting Check

You have the necessary ingredients, it is now
time to actually make the item. Successfully crafting
an item requires X successful crafting skill checks,

```
where X is the level of the item you are trying to
craft. Crafting must also be done in a crafting
workshop, of level equal to or greater than the level
of the item being crafted. After every X days you
spend working in the workshop, make the crafting
skill check. The CN is equal to 8 + 2 * X.
On a failed skill check, progress for that period
of work does not count—you must work another X
days to make another check. On three consecutive
failed skill checks, the item is ruined, all progress is
lost, and a random component is wasted in the
process.
However, once you have a number of successful
crafting checks equal to the level of the item, you
have finished.
```

```
Following Procedure
If you were following a procedure, it is much
easier to make craft an item without making
mistakes. You have a +8 on your crafting skill
checks.
```

```
Inventing
If you were inventing, make one final crafting
skill check upon completing an item, representing
your skill as an inventor. On a success, you have
crafted the item with the desired effects. If you fail,
you have still successfully crafted a magical item,
but it does not have the exact intended behavior. It is
entirely up to the GM what the properties are of the
magic item you have created.
```

```
Refining Components
Sometimes the components you have are not
high enough level to make what you want. If this is
the case, you may wish to use alchemy to refine a
component into a shard. A shard is a purer form of a
magical material, distilled to its magical essence.
```

```
Example
Let’s say you want to craft a fiery great sword.
You describe it as giving a creature one level of
burning whenever you deal damage to it with the
sword. The GM would determine that this is of
roughly level 3, and would have the tag “fire” but
nothing else. It would therefore require one level 3
fire component, and two level 3 neutral components.
```

To craft shard you must have two, non-shard
materials of the same level and with the same tags,
and you must have access to an alchemy lab of level
equal to or greater than the level of the components
for the duration of the refinement. You may then
spend a number of days refining equal to the level of
the components. After those days, both components
are destroyed and you gain a shard—a magical
component with the same tags as its ingredients, and
of one higher level. Components with only a neutral
tag cannot be refined into shards, and shards cannot
be refined into more shards.

Crafting

Wor kshop

```
In order to craft magical items, it is necessary to
have at least some type of workshop dedicated to the
task. A workshop contains all the necessary tools,
reference materials, and specialized workstations
necessary for magical crafting. Every workstation
has a level. Higher level workstations are larger and
more expensive, but can make it easier to craft
magical items.
The following table contains the requirements for
each level of workshop. Required equipment is
cumulative, so each level of workshop requires all
the tools necessary from each previous level.
