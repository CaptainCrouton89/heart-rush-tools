  You may choose each option more than once, to
  grant additional levels of advantage on navigation
  checks, or give other people the benefits of shelter
  and a straw bed.
  Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense
  for where there may be more to discover, and what
  you might find. Once per month, while exploring a
  location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that
  there is more to be discovered. Then name either
  ruin, settlement, or natural wonder, and choose a
  direction that you have not been in before. Whatever
  you named is located somewhat closely in the named
  direction. The GM may ask you to choose a different
  direction, or a different discovery.

ability dice, a d6 heart die, and immediately
disappears if they take any damage or negative
