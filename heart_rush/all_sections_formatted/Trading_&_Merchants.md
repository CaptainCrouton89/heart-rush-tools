# Trade Routes & Merchants

Not all wealth comes from delving into dungeons or completing heroic quests. For those with a keen eye for opportunity and a talent for negotiation, establishing trade routes can provide steady income that grows your wealth far beyond what any single treasure hoard might offer.

## Creating Trade Routes

A trade route is a regular circuit where goods are bought in one location and sold in another for profit. You can establish routes two ways:

### Personal Establishment

If you personally travel the route, negotiate with merchants, and oversee the first shipment, the route succeeds automatically. Use standard Journey rules for travel and roleplay the negotiations.

### Remote Establishment

If relying on employees or partners to establish the route, it becomes a **Stratagem**:

**Objective**: Establish trade connections (Positional)  
**Resolution**: Single roll after your employees complete their mission (typically several weeks to months)

The GM sets the CN based on circumstances, considering assets and hindrances such as:

**Potential Assets**:

- Existing merchant contacts in target cities
- Strong reputation in the region
- Letters of introduction from influential figures
- Experienced trade factor handling negotiations
- Knowledge of local customs and languages
- Previous successful routes in the area

**Potential Hindrances**:

- Established competitors controlling the market
- Political tensions between regions
- Language and cultural barriers
- Suspicious local authorities
- Recent bandit activity on the route
- Trading in restricted or unusual goods

**Resolution**:

- **Success**: Route established; GM sets seasonal CN
- **Failure**: Route cannot be established due to discovered obstacles
- **Complication**: Route established but begins with a hindrance

## Operating Established Routes

Once established, routes run automatically each season with a chance of profitable completion.

### Route Difficulty

After establishment, the GM sets the route's difficulty:

| Route Conditions  | Seasonal CN |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Safe & Profitable | 6           |
| Moderate Risk     | 9           |
| Risky             | 12          |
| Dangerous         | 15          |
| Desperate         | 18          |

This CN remains constant until circumstances change (new assets or hindrances emerge).

### Seasonal Trade Roll

Once per season for each route:

1. GM states current CN based on route difficulty
2. Roll d8 + Presence or Cunning die + relevant profession rank
3. Compare to CN

**Success**: Route completes, earn expected profit  
**Failure**: Roll on Failure Table  
**Complication** (1 on any die): Reroll that die; if total succeeds, route completes but gains a hindrance

### Calculating Investment & Profit

**Investment**: The cost of goods at purchase price. Operational expenses are assumed unless extreme (hiring mercenary companies, magical transportation, operating in active war zones).

**Operational Costs**: When transport methods significantly impact cost or risk, negotiate with the GM:

- **Cheap but risky**: Slave ship cargo space, minimal guards, exposed caravans (reduces costs but increases CN)
- **Standard**: Normal merchant caravans, typical shipping (costs assumed in profit margins)
- **Expensive but secure**: Private airship, teleportation circles, heavy military escort (significant costs but reduces CN)

At larger scales, these choices become crucial—saving 10% on transport for a 100-crown shipment means 10 crowns, enough to fund entire adventures. The GM should make transport costs explicit when they'd meaningfully impact profits or risk.

**Profit Margins by Goods Type**:

- Raw goods (grain, ore, timber): 10-20%
- Crafted goods (tools, weapons, cloth): 25-40%
- Luxury goods (spices, silk, jewelry): 50-100%
- Exotic goods (magic items, rare artifacts): 100-200%

The GM adjusts these based on specific market conditions.

### Failure Table (d10)

1-2. **Total Loss**: Caravan/ship lost entirely—lose all investment  
3-4. **Partial Loss**: Half cargo lost or spoiled—recover 50% of investment  
5-6. **Break Even**: Delays and fees consume profit—recover investment only  
7-8. **Delayed**: Shipment arrives next season—roll again then  
9. **Reduced Profit**: Forced to sell at poor prices—gain 25% normal profit  
10. **Silver Lining**: Disaster leads to unexpected opportunity—normal profit plus new asset

### Complications & Hindrances

Complications create ongoing hindrances that affect future rolls. Examples:

- "Protection fees to local gang" - Reduces profit or increases CN
- "Damaged reputation with merchant guild" - Increases CN
- "Suspicious customs officials" - May trigger additional complications
- "Rival saboteur in organization" - Increases CN until discovered
- "Deteriorating road conditions" - Increases CN seasonally

The GM determines how each hindrance affects the route (typically +3 CN per significant hindrance).

## Accompanying Routes

You can personally accompany any shipment instead of rolling:

- Use Journey rules for travel
- Handle negotiations and dangers directly
- Success depends on your actions, not dice
- Potential to discover new assets or remove hindrances through play

## Managing Multiple Routes

Operating many routes simultaneously creates logistical challenges:

**Personal Management Limits**:

- 1-2 routes: No difficulty
- 3-4 routes: +3 CN to all routes
- 5+ routes: +6 CN to all routes

**Delegated Management**:

- **Trade Factor**: Manages routes independently, may add bonus to rolls
- **Merchant House Partnership**: Professional management but takes percentage of profits

## Assets & Improvements

Players can pursue various assets to improve their routes:

**Security Assets**:

- Hired guards for dangerous segments
- Protection agreements with local authorities
- Insurance through merchant guilds
- Armed caravan or naval escort

**Commercial Assets**:

- Exclusive supplier contracts
- Warehouses for storing goods
- Established buyers guaranteeing sales
- Market intelligence networks

**Political Assets**:

- Trading licenses and permits
- Noble or guild patronage
- Diplomatic immunity
- Bribed customs officials

**Operational Assets**:

- Experienced caravan masters
- Faster transportation methods
- Weather prediction capabilities
- Alternative route knowledge

Each asset typically reduces CN by 3, while multiple related assets might eliminate entire categories of risk.

## Example: The Silk Road

Elena wants to establish a route trading silk between the eastern ports and the capital.

**Establishment Attempt** (using employees):

- Base stratagem CN: 12 (difficult due to competition)
- Assets: Letter from Duke (-3), experienced factor (-3)
- Hindrances: Competing merchant house (+3), different languages (+3)
- Final CN: 12
- Roll: d8 (1→5) + Cunning d8 (5) + Merchant profession (3) = 13
- Success! But rolled 1 on d8, rerolled to 5
- Complication: "Forced to pay guild dues" hindrance added

**Route Established**:

- Investment: 40 ducats in silk
- Expected profit: 75% (30 ducats)
- Route difficulty: Moderate (CN 9 base, +3 for guild scrutiny = CN 12)
- Hindrance: Guild dues reduce profit by 10%

**First Season**:

- CN 12 (moderate route with guild scrutiny)
- Roll: d8 (6) + Presence d6 (3) + Merchant (3) = 12
- Success! Profit: 27 ducats (30 minus 10% guild cut)

Elena considers personally accompanying the next shipment to negotiate better guild terms and remove the hindrance.
