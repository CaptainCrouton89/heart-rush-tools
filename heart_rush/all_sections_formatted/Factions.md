# Factions

## Core Attributes

**Wealth** - Economic resources and financial power
**Sovereign** - Cohesiveness of people and internal unity  
**Might** - Military strength and combat capability
**Intelligence** - Information gathering and strategic planning

**Size** - Population and scale of the faction

## Basic Mechanics

A faction can maintain itself indefinitely, unless players are running it. Then challenges must arise so they have to deal with them.

### Starting Stats

- **Wealth**: d4
- **Might**: d8
- **Intelligence**: d6
- **Sovereign**: d4

**Health** = Size (d4 starting value)

## Scale Comparison Example: Gang vs Nation

**Intelligence**: We can both effectively spy on each other
**Might**: Nation crushes me in direct battle
**Scale Effects**: Individual acts can affect nation's army, but only matter if forces are remotely close
**Wealth**: Nation can buy way more than me
**Sovereign**: Although I'm more cohesive, we both suffer similar internal struggles

### Combat Resolution

- **Large scale battles**: Some fights must be abstracted, others played out
- **Key principle**: Non-abstracted battles need to matter more

### PC Faction Tasks

- Defend their stronghold from invaders
- Lead faction/country in revolution against another country
- Plant memory of gnomes entering city to shift blame onto them

### System Requirements

- **Battle rules** - For playing out individual battles
- **Resource conflict rules** - Leveraging money, resources and intel to undermine other powers
- **Policy pressure** - Ability to force factions to change policy

## Scale and Combat

**Size Ã— Might die** - Combat becomes swingier at low levels, terrifying at high levels.

### Size Scale

| Size | Population |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 1    | 100        |
| 2    | 200        |
| 3    | 500        |
| 4    | 1,000      |
| 5    | 2,000      |
| 6    | 5,000      |
| 7    | 10,000     |
| 8    | 20,000     |
| 9    | 50,000     |
| 10   | 100,000    |
| 11   | 200,000    |
| 12   | 500,000    |
| 13   | 1,000,000  |
| 14   | 2,000,000  |
| 15   | 5,000,000  |
| 16   | 10,000,000 |

### Wealth and Armies

Size affects wealth. Wealth determines how much might you have. Only relevant when using armies to fight. An "army" requires 100+ person population.
Armies only matter when you have company wealth. Company wealth is a score out of 10, based on size:

- **Rich faction**: Size + 1
- **Poor faction**: Size - 1
- **Absurdly rich**: Size + 2
- **Absurdly poor**: Size - 2

## Fronts System

Faction actions are organized into **"fronts"** - forces for change with a power rank.

### Front Mechanics

- Without player interaction, the greater front wins
- Fronts succeed automatically unless opposed
- Player counter-actions remove points from fronts
- Front ranks only calculated when players interfere

### Long-term Goals

All faction activities become long-term goals. Success builds points toward completion.

**Goals can be**:

- Positive: "Do X"
- Reactive: "Stop country Y from doing Z"

**NPC factions**: Automatically succeed at their goals unless opposed  
**Opposed fronts**: Power equals faction size - must be overcome to stop

## Surplus System

Compare your faction against neighboring communities of same territory size. Use all countries/states you border or have roads to.

**Surplus Calculation**:

- +1 surplus for each neighboring territory you exceed
- -1 surplus for each neighboring territory that exceeds you
- Equal resources = no difference
- Cannot have negative surplus
- Maximum +3 surplus from any single resource

### Surplus Types

- Farmland
- Mined resources
- Artisans and skilled laborers
- Scholarship
- Cheap labor
- Sky ports
- Sea ports
- Wood

### Standing Armies

- **Base army**: 1% of population for 1 surplus
- **Additional forces**: +0.5% per additional surplus
- **Deployment time**: Months equal to country size (or 1 month for double surplus)

### Internal Projects

Improving your faction internally costs 1 surplus per project.

**Project Requirements**:

- Minimum time: Months equal to faction size
- Must be significant for your faction's scale
- Should be something not all equivalent factions have

**Example**: Harbor counts as project for city-state, but not for entire country

### Counter-Fronts

**Defensive counter-front**: Surplus equal to (front value + your size rank + 1 project cost)

**Example**: Enemy force 11 vs your rank 9 = 3 surplus total (11 + 9 + 1)

**Offensive fronts**: Cannot apply rank advantage. Costs 1 surplus to create, then requires player action to succeed

### Example: Ship Passage Rights

**Scenario**: Persuade neighbors (2 ranks bigger) to allow ship passage

- **Cost**: 1 surplus (new project)
- **Difficulty**: Rank 2 challenge
- **Front strength**: 5 (requires player action to overcome)
- **Reward**: Avoid negative consequences

### Non-Surplus Rewards

**Why pursue projects without surplus benefits?**

- Population growth
- Remove threats
- Trade alliance benefits
- Cultural/religious significance

### Development Notes

**Unresolved questions**:

- How do player-controlled fronts work?
- Security score calculation (can be negative?)
- Asset system integration

## Asset System (Alternative Rules)

### Asset Types

Every asset has power (1-10) and type: force, wealth, or intelligence.

### Asset Combat

- **Might vs Might**: Use percentage dice (m1 / (m1 + m2))
- **Might vs Wealth**: Might auto-wins (wealth cannot defend)
- **Damage**: Reduces asset rank by 1

### Faction Power Scale

| Rank | Faction Type                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 10   | Mighty kingdom                          |
| 8    | Typical kingdom                         |
| 6    | Powerful city-state / Very weak kingdom |
| 4    | Powerful guild                          |
| 3    | Typical guild                           |
| 2    | Small club                              |
| 1    | You and your friends                    |

### Asset Combat Resolution

- Assets use attack tag vs defense tag (usually same type)
- Add faction rank to the roll
- **Success**: Attacking asset activates effect or deals damage
- **Failure**: Defending asset deals counter-damage

**Power Balance**: Can only fight parallel powers?

### Example Assets

- **Castle walls**: Passive, 10 hp. Provide +1 faction rank
