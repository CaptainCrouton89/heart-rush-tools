| 3    | With a terrible rumble, an avalanche begins.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4    | Vultures circle overhead, over the remains of a recent fall victim.                                                                                                                                           |
| 5    | A large cave entrance lies ahead. An appropriate creature lives within.                                                                                                                                       |
| 6    | The players have broken the sanctity of a grove of snow spirits. They attack!                                                                                                                                 |
| 7    | A large dead bear lies dead on the ground.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 8    | A man in nothing but a thin robe lies frozen in the snow. The robe has occult symbols on it.                                                                                                                  |
| 9    | Scattered across the mountain are the remains of a crashed sky ship.                                                                                                                                          |
| 10   | A cave network in a frozen glacier leads to an ice giant's lair.                                                                                                                                              |
| 11   | A morphling is stalking one of the players through the mountain, disguised as an animal native to the region.                                                                                                 |
| 12   | A giant bear crosses paths with the players, on its way to a salmon filled creek.                                                                                                                             |
| 13   | A small cemetery lies on the hillside. Warning signs around it tell people to steer clear. A small stone building lies in the center.                                                                         |
| 14   | Two giants get into a fight, throwing enormous stones at each other. One of them may die in the fight.                                                                                                        |
| 15   | A pack of dire wolves have begun to hunt the players.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 16   | The ground has been completely frozen after a thaw and flash freeze. It is very easy to fall off the mountain.                                                                                                |
| 17   | An injured mountain goat lies dying on the mountain side.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 18   | The players find a giant eagle's nest.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19   | The players cross paths with a goblin hunting party, chasing down mountain goats.                                                                                                                             |
| 20   | A dwarf is dead in a shallow tunnel, pickax and other mining gear lying nearby.                                                                                                                               |
| 21   | A giant purple wyrm tunnel leads through the mountain. The exit on the other side is boobytrapped by goblins.                                                                                                 |
| 22   | A small humanoid has a golem he uses to rob people as they pass through the mountain pass. His little cottage holds information leading to treasure.                                                          |
| 23   | Ruins of a city lie between two mountains. The city has been destroyed by obvious means.                                                                                                                      |
| 24   | Strange, parrot like birds live in nearby cliffs. They fly down and taunt those who pass by.                                                                                                                  |
| 25   | A player falls into a crevasse, landing 100 feet down with a broken leg.                                                                                                                                      |
| 26   | A lone monk sits in stasis, atop a peak. He claims to have paused time.                                                                                                                                       |
| 27   | At night, a bear gets into the party's food.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28   | Elemental magic is exuded from this mountain. Spontaneous combustion is not uncommon, nor are elementally attuned animals.                                                                                    |
| 29   | A gorgon lives in the caves of this mountain. Shattered statues litter the mountainside.                                                                                                                      |
| 30   | Dense clouds shroud this peak. It is a portal to the astral plane, guarded by elementals.                                                                                                                     |
| 31   | A ravine is filled with bladed pillars. Griffin swoop over head and drop their prey in.                                                                                                                       |
| 32   | A player is kidnapped by a giant.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33   | A sickly child is alone, starved, and speaking incoherently. If they are helped, they are revealed to be a morphling—normally, people hunters. The child eats someone else upon returning to a village.       |
| 34   | A meteor blows the top off of a nearby peak, leaving an astral plant in the crater.                                                                                                                           |
| 35   | The clockwork wyrm built by goblin architects, terrorizes this region.                                                                                                                                        |
| 36   | An ice covered lake has no snow on it. Nymphs can be seen, swimming below, guarding treasure.                                                                                                                 |
| 37   | The party runs into a group of miners, who are interested to hear about the adventures of the party.                                                                                                          |
| 38   | Poisonous mists fall upon the mountains at night, causing people to become disoriented and walk off cliffs.                                                                                                   |
| 39   | A campfire burns brightly, gear is strewn about, and unopened bottles of alcohol rest on the ground. Another group of adventurers are nowhere to be seen.                                                     |
| 40   | A giant, four armed yeti is frozen in a small glacier, though the glacier has been melting, and accelerated by fire cultists.                                                                                 |
| 41   | Ice bridge between two peaks, only wide enough for one person, no railing. Icy river below. Statues take tribute at either end, or else winds will blow you off.                                              |
| 42   | Wyverns are fighting over territory. Huge icicle pillars from their breath litter the mountain side.                                                                                                          |
| 43   | A hill giant wanders past, on patrol. He thinks it'd be fun to try to kick the players off the mountain.                                                                                                      |
| 44   | A dwarven patrol wanders past. They are willing to offer basic help.                                                                                                                                          |
| 45   | A mountain pool filled with sapphires is guarded by a statue and a water spirit. The water spirit warns not piss off the statue and enter the pool, and freezes it if players enter. The statue then awakens. |
| 46   | A rope with pitons hangs from the cliff side. Climbing it leads to good climbing gear, a skeleton trapped in the rock, and a diamond watch.                                                                   |
| 47   | A swarm of vampire bats inhabit a nearby cave.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 48   | A wishing well with runes grants half wishes, half disasters.                                                                                                                                                 |

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The party comes across a cave filled with mushrooms that emit a strange blue glow.                                                                                                                            |
| 2    | Whoever is last in the party feels a small tug on their pant leg. When they look down, a Chwinga is offering them a small necklace made of sea shells.                                                        |
| 3    | A few baboons begin howling at the party below. This attracts the attention of a nearby enemy.                                                                                                                |
| 4    | A group of tribesmen are hunting a large dinosaur nearby. They have not spotted the party, and it looks like they could use some help.                                                                        |
| 5    | Animal noises go quiet as the branches above you move and shake as if something is moving through them. Normal sounds continue a few minutes later.                                                           |
| 6    | You see the bones of a creature in the under growth. It has been picked clean by scavengers.                                                                                                                  |
| 7    | While resting a small swarm of loudly croaking frogs hop through the camp. Anyone touched by the frogs dreams prophetic dreams that nights.                                                                   |
| 8    | While moving through a river a few faintly glowing leeches attach themselves, but it's not blood they're draining but magic itself.                                                                           |
| 9    | A thick curtain of vines hangs before you blocking the path. If looking carefully small jungle creatures can be seen entwined. When cut the vines quickly strike like snakes trying to ensnare the party.     |
| 10   | Suddenly an empty clearing appears ahead nothing but dry grey skeletal trees hanging with a yellow moss.                                                                                                      |
| 11   | A large grove of edible fruit hang from the trees ahead. They smell divine.                                                                                                                                   |
| 12   | A ramshackle reed hut sits off the path, inside a grey furred Kor slowly rakes its arms with its claws muttering about empty eyes and a glowing maw over and over.                                            |
| 13   | There is an arrangement of once brightly colored, wilting, flowers pinned to a tree ahead with the name of a stranger carved underneath.                                                                      |
| 14   | Shallow panting can be heard to the right. Leads to a critically injured animal unable to run.                                                                                                                |
| 15   | A spider monkey jumps on the shoulder of a party member pawing at their backpack for food, in return for food the monkey gives a reward the next day.                                                         |
| 16   | A swarm of insects surrounds and follows the party, not dangerous but makes all tasks more difficult due to buzzing, biting and making it difficult to see.                                                   |
| 17   | A giant, iridescent beetle roams through the undergrowth. It isn't hostile, but its shell is likely quite valuable. It has a nasty bite.                                                                      |
| 18   | You see a brilliantly colored bird flit through the trees ahead, cawing and crying through the jungle air. It lands on a branch and screeches at you, before flying off.                                      |
| 19   | You come across the remains of a merchant caravan. All that remains are wagon ruins and picked at bones, still in their armor.                                                                                |
| 20   | An old tree lies ahead, dropping jellyfish like petals that cause you to fall into a d4 day long sleep on contact. Can't be woken.                                                                            |
| 21   | A trio of jungle cats gnaw on the body of an unidentifiable creature. They scatter into the woods as the party nears.                                                                                         |
| 22   | A man who must have been alive mere hours before, lies dead in the jungle heat. He wears no armor, but is covered in deep, bloody wounds, and some type of poison fills his veins.                            |
| 23   | At dusk, a young voice begging for help whispers to one member of the party. The voice seems to come from the trees themselves.                                                                               |
| 24   | The party is waken up to a high pitch scream coming seemingly from the surrounding trees, then silence.                                                                                                       |
| 25   | An aged map is found rolled up. It's a large map of the jungle with "LIES" written repeatedly in dried blood on it.                                                                                           |
| 26   | A small hunting party of aggressive goblins chasing an animal crosses paths with the players.                                                                                                                 |
| 27   | A young Stegosaurus' foot is seen trapped between two fallen trees. It cries out for its herd.                                                                                                                |
| 28   | A tribal warrior lays slumped against a tree holding his eviscerated abdomen, in a rasping grunt he describes what happened in his native language.                                                           |
| 29   | A large stone well is covered in vines and moss. Inside, it looks like it is filled with water. The water will quench your thirst but deplete your hunger.                                                    |
| 30   | A witch's hut sits in a small clearing. When approached, the hut stands up on giant chicken legs and flees.                                                                                                   |
| 31   | You enter into a clearing and shrieking starts. A patch of shrieker plants is found a few yards ahead. The sound reaches to anything within 300 feet of it.                                                   |
| 32   | You feel your left elbow get caught on something sticky. A giant spider web has caught your arm. A Giant Spider's eyes lock on you from 60 feet away.                                                         |
| 33   | Will-o'-the-wisps try to lead you away from the trail, to a swamp.                                                                                                                                            |
| 34   | Walking past a large purple flower a puff of near invisible spores release, causing those who inhale to believe that the flower is deadly.                                                                    |
| 35   | A night hag haunts the camp at night, looking for the weakest link to lead into the forest. She will take on only one person at a time.                                                                       |
| 36   | As if from the shadows a weretiger steps out. It levels its golden spear head at a party members throat "you trespass on sacred ground, you have until the moon shows her face, then let the hunt begin".     |
| 37   | You come upon a moss covered statue, fallen and showing the decay of centuries. A group of lemurs huddles together underneath to wait out the sudden downpour.                                                |
| 38   | A rampaging rhino, elephant, or hippo is nearby.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39   | A pool of bubbling tar is in front of you. You see an animal go in and screech in pain, then silence. Suddenly, the creature's skeleton covered in tar struts out and into the jungle as if nothing happened. |
| 40   | While making your way through thickets of vines you are scratched by long yellow thorns. Although painless, the veins near the scratch have turned a vivid orange.                                            |
| 41   | A beautifully colored bird flies along with the party with uncanny accuracy it copies everything said but in a whiney condescending tone.                                                                     |
| 42   | Plump white fruit hang from a tree overhead giving off a sweet and spicy aroma, biting into it lets the thousands of tiny spiders free.                                                                       |
| 43   | Army ant swarm approaches, covers bags. If you go back for them, you will get attacked.                                                                                                                       |
| 44   | A bright pink pool sits peacefully in the shade, smelling like strong cheese. Distilling the water and healing algae makes for a potent potion.                                                               |
| 45   | The path suddenly turns white and chalky but plants thrive, above roost giant bats.                                                                                                                           |
| 46   | The jungle opens up upon a gorge with a narrow rope bridge spanning its width. Halfway across, the drums begin to beat their insidious rhythm.                                                                |
| 47   | The jungle opens up upon a narrow gorge. As the first creature to crosses, a net of webbing shoots out from the gorge to ensnare them, dragging them down.                                                    |
| 48   | The jungle opens up upon a wide gorge. The walls are steep and what looks to be cave mouths litter the sides.                                                                                                 |
| 49   | The party comes across a river bed that has run dry. Embedded in the hard dirt are pieces of a wooden cart jutting out. The wood is old and water damaged, but show an attack by creatures of the forest.     |
| 50   | A massive crypt lies ahead, guarded by the undead slaves of a long forgotten king.                                                                                                                            |
| 51   | A tyrannosaurus rex is roaming through the woods. He might not notice the players.                                                                                                                            |
| 52   | An especially extreme storm strikes, blowing trees over, and flooding the forest floor. It lasts for days.                                                                                                    |
| 53   | A square 10ft by 10ft cave can be seen ahead on closer inspection this is the mouth of a huge primitive statue head covers in vines. Goblins have laid camp within.                                           |
| 54   | A buzzing hive can be seen hanging low in a tree. The bees are deadly, but the honey is addictive and has magical properties.                                                                                 |
| 55   | Taking a wrong step a party member steps on an enormous ant nest, falling into a loosely supported mess of twigs and nest material.                                                                           |
| 56   | Surprise sinkhole! Player is now suffocating in the sand.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 57   | A nastier than usual heatwave has struck the jungle. Unless cave shelter can be found, there's a high risk of getting cooked alive.                                                                           |
| 58   | A gentle splashing sounds near the parties chosen path, on arrival the pool is clean clear and brimming with fat fish. The fish will haunt your dreams if eaten.                                              |
| 59   | Red cloakers ambush the party. They look like fruit, drop down, and suffocate victims. Very thin, but very tough. Excrete a slightly sweet scent, and cause drowsiness. Can be harvested.                     |
| 60   | A dusk leopard stalks the party, looking for the weakest member. They have magical power, and their pelts are darkness itself.                                                                                |
| 61   | Low hanging gourds hang from a tree. Mind controlling larva live within the gourds, and will drive their host mad.                                                                                            |
| 62   | A jungle cat watches as her cubs attempts to kill a solitary goblin.                                                                                                                                          |
| 63   | Some hags disguised as children are playing hide and seek. They invite the players to join.                                                                                                                   |
| 64   | An overgrown cemetery holds rich treasure. Touching the headstones causes you immense fear.                                                                                                                   |
| 65   | A thick mat of vines you pass through tries to strangle the party.                                                                                                                                            |
