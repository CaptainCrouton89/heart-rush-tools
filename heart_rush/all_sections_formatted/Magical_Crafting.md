# Magical Crafting

Any bit of magical crafting begins with its components—a collection of magically potent materials that will be combined to create the product. Metals, gems, bloods, powders, horns, teeth, and hides are all examples of potential magical components.

Every component has two properties, each determined at the GM's discretion. First is its level, which determines how powerful of an effect that material can create. Second are its tags, which describe the type of magical ability associated with a material. For example, pixie dust could be a magical component. The GM may decide that it is a level 4 component with the tags "psychic", "air", and "illusion". The GM may also decide that silver is a level 2 magical substance, and because it doesn't have any specific magical properties, give it the "neutral" tag.

## Power Levels

When determining the power level of a component, the GM should assign it a level corresponding to the highest power level one could feasibly achieve if the component was the most critical component to an item's function. For example, when assigning the power level to a unicorn horn, imagine that the most powerful item the horn could reasonably be used as the centerpiece for was a "unicorn horn wand" that could powerfully charm multiple people at a time. With this vague idea in mind, assign it a power level of 4, since that's roughly the power level of that wand.

| Level | Power Level Description                                                                                                                                                              | Mechanical Effect                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Not particularly powerful—more cosmetic or flavorful than anything else                                                                                                              | +1 bonus to skill checks or similar minor benefits        |
| 2     | The power of a talent                                                                                                                                                                | Roughly 2.5 damage per round, or +2 bonus to skill checks |
| 3     | The power of a talent with its destiny level                                                                                                                                         | Roughly 5 damage per round, or +3 bonus to skill checks   |
| 4     | Substantially powerful effects, such as a paragon level ability                                                                                                                      | Roughly 8 damage per round, or +5 bonus to skill checks   |
| 5     | Incredible effects, though not quite legendary. Multiple paragon levels combined                                                                                                     | Roughly 20 damage per round                               |
| 6     | Wondrous effects, potentially able to instantly kill commoners. Not necessarily one-of-a-kind, but probably. Their locations are likely known throughout history—legendary artifacts | Campaign-changing effects                                 |
| 7     | Beyond legendary                                                                                                                                                                     | World-changing effects                                    |

## Component Tags

Tags describe the magical properties of a component. With the exception of the "neutral" tag, all tags have a specific flavor of magic. If a component feels like it meets the description for a tag, that tag belongs on the component. For any material or component that feels like it might be used in a magic item but doesn't necessarily have a specific use, it should likely receive the "neutral" tag. For example, if you want precious metals and gems to be prevalent in all sorts of magical items, they should have the "neutral" tag.

| Tag        | Description                                                                               |

## Types of Crafting

All magical crafting follows the same core system, but different types of items have different requirements and modifiers.

### Magical Smithing

Magical smithing creates permanent items like weapons, armor, tools, and other durable magical objects. This requires a workshop with a level equal to or greater than the item being crafted. The time investment follows standard magical crafting rates, with full magical component requirements. Each crafting attempt produces a single item.

### Magical Alchemy

Magical alchemy produces consumable items like potions, oils, bombs, and other temporary effects. This requires a laboratory with a level equal to or greater than the item being crafted, though alchemists can use a laboratory one level lower if they accept disadvantage on all crafting checks.

Alchemy is significantly faster than smithing, requiring only one-fifth the standard crafting time. The material costs are also reduced to half the standard rate. Additionally, alchemists can use "depleted" components salvaged from failed crafting attempts, though these still must meet the level requirements.

The real advantage of alchemy comes in batch production. When crafting potions or oils, a single crafting attempt produces 10 doses. Ammunition like arrows or bolts comes in batches of 20. Bombs and grenades yield 5 per batch. Only unique consumables are limited to single items per attempt.

The power of alchemical items scales predictably with level. Level 1 consumables provide basic effects like healing 10 HP, granting +1 to skill checks for an hour, or simple utility effects. Level 2 items heal 20 HP, provide +2 bonuses lasting 4 hours, or create minor status effects. Level 3 consumables heal 40 HP, grant +3 bonuses for 8 hours, or cause significant status changes. Level 4 items heal 80 HP, temporarily increase ability dice, or last 24 hours. Level 5 consumables can fully heal, grant major temporary abilities, or cause permanent minor changes. Level 6 items approach the legendary—raising the dead, creating permanent major changes, or bending reality. Level 7 consumables achieve mythical effects like true resurrection, permanent transformations, or god-tier abilities.

## Crafting Process

Before you can begin crafting an item, you must first determine if you are following a procedure or inventing. If you have a blueprint, plan, recipe, or have one memorized, then you are following a procedure. If you've never made something before and are hoping to create a desired effect, then you are inventing.

### Following Procedure

When following procedure, the GM will tell you the level of the item you are crafting and the required components. You must have each of the required components, and you must have an aspect related to crafting of rank equal to or greater than the level of the item you are creating. The familiarity of working from established instructions grants you a +8 bonus on all crafting skill checks.

### Inventing

When inventing, you need to work with the GM to determine exactly what you're trying to create. Describe what you want to make, including all the details of what the magical item does, how often it can be used, and any other properties. As the player, it's ultimately up to you to determine the stats of the item you wish to create. The GM should then determine the power level of the described item using the Power Level guidelines. This process should be collaborative.

After determining the level, the GM decides what types of components the item requires. An item recipe should require at least one component with a tag relating to each unique effect of the item, and should require a total number of components equal to the level of the item. If the total number of specific types of components don't sum to the level of the item, the remaining components should be neutral components. All components must be of an equal or greater level than the crafted item itself.

For example, if you want to craft a fiery greatsword that gives a creature one level of burning whenever you deal damage with it, the GM would determine this is roughly level 3. It would have the tag "fire" but nothing else, so it would require one level 3 fire component and two level 3 neutral components.

### The Crafting Check

Once you have the necessary ingredients, it's time to actually make the item. Successfully crafting an item requires a number of successful crafting skill checks equal to the level of the item you are trying to craft.

Magical smithing must be done in a workshop of appropriate level. After every X days you spend working (where X is the level of the item), make a crafting skill check. Magical alchemy must be done in a laboratory of appropriate level, or one level lower with disadvantage. After every X/5 days you spend working (rounded up), make a crafting skill check.

The Challenge Number equals 8 + (2 × the item's level).

On a failed skill check, the progress for that period of work does not count—you must work another period to make another check. When you fail three consecutive skill checks, the item is ruined. This means all progress is lost, all work up to that point is wasted, and a random component is destroyed in the process. The remaining components can be salvaged, though they may be considered "depleted" and only useful for certain alchemical purposes.

### Unstable Creations

When you fail a crafting check by 5 or less, instead of losing progress, you may choose to create an unstable version of the item. This applies to both smithing and alchemy.

For permanent items, unstable versions function as intended 80% of the time. Each use has a 20% chance to trigger an instability. When instability triggers, roll 1d6 to determine the effect. On a 1, the item overcharges—its effect doubles but it gains 1 Instability Point. On a 2, it fizzles with no effect this use. On a 3, feedback causes the user to take 1d6 damage. On a 4, the item develops a permanent minor quirk chosen by the GM. On a 5, the item burns out and becomes unusable for 24 hours. On a 6, it actually stabilizes and removes 1 Instability Point.

For consumable items like potions, unstable versions have similar unpredictability. When consumed or activated, roll 1d6. On a 1, the effect is doubled—a healing potion heals twice as much, a bomb has twice the radius. On a 2, it's a dud with no effect at all. On a 3, it has the opposite of the intended effect—healing potions deal damage, buff potions apply debuffs. On a 4, it works but with an unintended side effect chosen by the GM. On a 5, it has only half effectiveness. On a 6, it works perfectly as intended.

Unstable permanent items start with 1d4+1 Instability Points. At 5 or more points, they become dangerously unstable with a 40% chance of instability per use. At 10 or more points, the item self-destructs. You can attempt to stabilize an unstable item as another crafting project, with a CN equal to the original item level plus current Instability Points. Success removes all instability.

### Completion

Once you have a number of successful crafting checks equal to the level of the item, the crafting is complete. If you were following a procedure, you've successfully created the item as intended.

If you were inventing, make one final crafting skill check upon completing the item, representing your skill as an inventor. On a success, you have crafted the item with the desired effects. If you fail, you have still successfully crafted a magical item, but it does not have the exact intended behavior. The GM determines what properties the magic item actually has—it might be related to what you intended, but with unexpected twists or limitations.

## Workspace Requirements

Crafting magical items requires specialized equipment and dedicated space. Every workspace has a level that determines what can be created there.

### Workshops for Smithing

| Level | Description                                                                                            | Equipment Required            | Cost      |

**Planar Cauldron**: The legendary ultimate alchemy tool, if it exists at all.

## Component Refinement

Sometimes your components aren't high enough level for your needs. Through alchemy, you can refine components into shards—purer forms of magical material distilled to their essence.

To craft a shard, you need two non-shard materials of the same level with identical tags, plus access to an alchemy lab of level equal to or greater than the components. Spend a number of days refining equal to the level of the components. After those days, both components are destroyed and you gain a shard with the same tags but one level higher.

Components with only a neutral tag cannot be refined into shards, as they lack the specific magical resonance needed for distillation. Shards themselves cannot be further refined, as they are already at maximum purity.

## Harvesting Components

In most cases, magical crafting components come from creatures. Successfully harvesting requires a harvest check with a CN set by the GM based on the difficulty of extraction and the creature's nature.

| Component          | Primary Uses                   | Harvesting Notes                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Leather/Hide       | Armor crafting                 | Nearly all hides work for light/medium armor; some for heavy            |
| Scales             | Armor and weapon crafting      | Harder to harvest than leather but more versatile                       |
| Feathers           | Flight magic, light armor      | Provide little protection but may enhance flight                        |
| Bones              | Weapons, trinkets, powders     | Versatile when shaped or ground; magical capacity concentrates in skull |

| Claws/Talons       | Slashing weapons               | Usually not heavy due to limited cutting surface                        |
| Blood              | Potions, dried powders/pastes  | Can grant drinker properties of the creature                            |
| Heart              | Potions, heart-string crafting | More potent than blood; may have effects even when blood doesn't        |
| Brain              | Mind effect potions            | From creatures with powerful psychic abilities                          |
| Vocal Cords        | Sonic magic items              | From creatures with magically superior voices                           |
| Eyes               | Vision enhancements            | Ground for alchemy or petrified for crafting                            |
| Venom/Poison/Toxin | Harmful concoctions            | 1 dose/day while alive; 3 doses harvested at death                      |
| Ink                | Writing, magic effects         | Some creatures produce ink with properties beyond mundane use           |
| Hooves             | Movement enhancements          | From creatures with magical movement speed                              |
| Tears              | Most powerful magic            | Requires creature alive and crying; taboo but extremely potent          |
