## Using Abilities

When creating your character, you will inevitably gain a lot of abilities.

Abilities are any chunk of rules that let you create an effect, perform some activity, or do anything at all.

Examples include class abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels, though some abilities grant you their own abilities.

You can most easily recognize an ability because of the format it has in this book:

**Ability Name**  
_Ability tags._  
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.

All abilities listed in this rulebook have their name, followed by tags (in italics), and then followed by their rules.

For the most part, abilities can be used whenever you want. However, some have restrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very specific, in the ability rules itself.

All tags in an ability are separated by periods. Each tag will contain information about when you can use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for gaining that ability.

While many tags will be explained by whichever section they appear in, there are a few types which can show up on any type of ability. These are listed below.

### Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often it can be used.

An ability can be either passive, minor, heart, major, weekly, or monthly.

This tag is always listed as the first tag.

- **Passive ability**: There are no restrictions on how many times you can use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability, it is assumed to always be active.
- **Minor Ability**: You may use this ability by spending a rush point for each time you have used this ability including this one during the current encounter. You may not use it outside of an encounter.
- **Major ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest.
- **Weekly Ability**: You may use this ability once per week.
- **Monthly ability**: You may use this ability once per month.

### Timing Tags

Outside of combat, you can use an ability whenever you want—there are no restrictions besides the ones listed on the ability itself.

However, during combat, timing matters. Non-passive abilities either have the instant tag or they don't:

- **Instant**: If an ability is marked as instant, it can be used literally any time, even interrupting other actions as they're happening and during engagements.
- **No timing tag**: If an ability has no timing tag, it can only be used during the action phase of combat. It cannot be used during engagements. The ability itself will specify if it requires your action, costs rush points, or has other requirements.

Passive abilities do not have timing tags since they are always active.

**Understanding Timing**

The presence or absence of the instant tag creates a clear distinction:

**Standard Abilities (no timing tag):**

- Can only be used during the action phase
- Cannot be used during engagements
- The ability text will specify what it costs (your action, rush points, etc.)
- Most abilities fall into this category

**Instant Abilities:**

Instant abilities can be used at literally any moment during the game, even interrupting other actions as they're happening. This creates a true "interrupt system" where you can react to new information as it unfolds.

**Any time means any time:**

- While someone else is taking their action
- After seeing the result of a dice roll (yours or someone else's)
- In response to movement, damage, or any game event
- Even after seeing the consequences of an action

**Common examples:**

- See your attack roll result → boost damage with an instant ability
- Get hit by an attack → instantly use a defensive ability to reduce damage
- Watch an enemy move out of range → react with an instant repositioning ability
- Opponent reveals their stance choice → respond with an instant counter-ability

**During Engagements:**
Instant abilities can interrupt at any point during the engagement sequence:

- After stances are revealed but before attacks
- Between different stance attack resolutions (cunning → agility → might)
- After seeing an attack roll but before damage
- After taking damage but before the engagement ends

**Multiple Instant Abilities:**
When multiple people want to use instant abilities simultaneously, resolve them in "last-in, first-out" order:

- The person who declared their instant ability **last** resolves it **first**
- Then work backwards through who declared when
- This continues until all instant abilities are resolved

You must declare the way in which you are using your ability when you announce that you are using an ability.
