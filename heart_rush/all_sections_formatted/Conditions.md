# Conditions

A variety of conditions can affect players and enemies alike. They generally give advantage or disadvantage to different sorts of rolls.

## Tags

There are three different types of tags each condition can have: leveled, fading, and ongoing.

### Leveled

Some of the conditions are leveled, meaning that multiple instances of that condition can be applied. These levels also stack, so if the same condition is applied, both levels are added together. For example, if a moon-viper bites you, it could apply two levels of poison, giving you D2 to all rolls. If it then bit you again, you would then increase the number of levels of poisoned affecting you to four.

Conditions cannot be stacked greater than five times. Once a creature has gained five levels of a condition, further levels of that condition are ignored.

### Fading

Some conditions have fading, which means that the condition will quickly alleviate. When you take levels of a condition that has fading, remove one level of that condition at the start of each round.

### Ongoing

An ongoing condition continues until otherwise noted. It may be moments, it may be hours, it may be days, and it might even be forever.

## Physical Conditions

These conditions are likely to arise from basic combat.

### Dazed

_Leveled. Fading._

You have disadvantage on all cunning checks.

### Weakened

_Leveled. Fading._

You have a disadvantage on all might checks.

### Off-Balanced

_Leveled. Fading._

You have a disadvantage on all agility checks.

### Shaken

_Leveled. Fading._

You have a disadvantage on all presence checks.

### Restrained

_Leveled. Ongoing._

Your move speed becomes zero and you cannot dash or sidestep. You have disadvantage on all A/D rolls and any ability checks requiring motion.

### Stunned

_Ongoing._

Your move speed becomes zero, and you cannot take actions, use abilities, or make attack rolls.

### Incapacitated

_Ongoing._

You are under the effects of stunned. In addition, enemies may choose to use their action to make opportunity attacks against you rather than enter engagements.

### Poisoned

_Leveled. Ongoing._

You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls.

### Blinded

_Leveled. Fading._

You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls requiring sight. If you have five levels of blinded, you cannot see anything.

### Suffocating

_Ongoing._

You take 1d6 damage at the end of each round and whenever you move or take an action.

### Slowed

_Leveled. Fading._

Your movement speed is halved, after accounting for armor and other penalties. Additional levels only result in a longer lasting effect.

### Crippled

_Ongoing._

Your move speed becomes 5 feet.

### Vulnerability

_Leveled. Ongoing._

Complications and failures can occur on 1s as well as 2s when making skill checks in whichever state of vulnerability you are in. Physical vulnerability means might and agility checks, and mental vulnerability means cunning and presence checks. An additional level of vulnerability triggers complications or failures on 3s as well, and another level results on complications or failures on 4s. If you have four or more levels of vulnerability, you die.

## Mental Conditions

These conditions are likely to arise from magical effects.

_Note: These mental conditions are pretty powerful, and generally shouldn't be thrown around unless it's supposed to be a very powerful effect, or if the effect is from a magical source._

### Aggravated

_Leveled. Ongoing._

You are overcome with anger at another creature. You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls against any other creature besides the source of your aggravation.

As an action, you may make a cunning saving throw contested by the source's presence challenge number to immediately remove all levels of aggravated. 

If another creature causes you to become aggravated towards them, those levels replace the aggravation towards the previous target.

### Confused

_Leveled. Ongoing._

You are addled. If you use your movement during a round, you cannot take an action. If you take an action, you cannot move. You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls. Additionally, you cannot cast spells.

All levels of confused can be removed if another creature that can communicate with you takes the help action to help you calm and align your thoughts.

### Frightened

_Leveled. Ongoing._

You are terrified of something. You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls so long as you are within line of sight of the source of your fear, and you cannot willingly approach the source of your fear.

As an action, you may make a cunning saving throw contested by the source's presence challenge number to immediately remove all levels of frightened.

### Charmed

_Leveled. Ongoing._

For each level of charm, you move up one level on the enemy to friend track. If you are violent, you become hostile. If you are hostile, you become neutral. If you are neutral, you become friendly. If you are friendly, you become allied.

The source of the charm has advantage on all presence checks made against you for each level of charmed. If the charmer takes any hostile action against you, the charm effect ends immediately.

## Status Conditions

While many of these conditions can be caused by combat, some of them have more to do with your environment than any interaction with others.

### Prone

_Ongoing._

You move at your climb speed (5 feet unless stated differently). You have advantage on defense rolls against ranged attacks, and have disadvantage on all other A/D rolls. You can stand up by spending half of your movement (after accounting for bonuses and penalties to your movement), or by taking the sidestep action.

### Burning

_Leveled. Fading._

While you have levels of burning, at the end of each round, take 1d6 damage for each level of burning effecting you.

As an action, you or another creature can attempt to put out the fire, and remove half of the levels affecting you, rounded up. If you would be drenched or submerged in a nonflammable liquid, immediately remove all levels of burning.

### Obscured

_Ongoing._

If you are not visible to a creature, but have not hidden, then you are obscured. While obscured, attacks against you have D5. Likewise, defense rolls against obscured creatures have D5.

### Hidden

_Ongoing._

While hidden, you may make opportunity attacks against creatures who cannot see you. Once you make an attack, your position is revealed and you are no longer hidden. Note that while hidden, you are also obscured.

### Highground

_Ongoing._

If you are above another creature, such as fighting from up a hill, or from the sky, you have the high ground. You have advantage on your attack rolls against creatures that don't have the high ground.

### Creature Climber

_Ongoing._

You have A3 on attack rolls against the creature you are climbing on.

You may move on the creature using your climb speed. The creature counts as difficult terrain.

If you would push the creature you are climbing on any distance, instead inflict 1d6 damage.

If you take damage or are forced to move, you must roll a might or agility saving throw against the damage taken or distance pushed, whichever is greater, falling off of the creature on a failure.

You may use 5 feet of movement to hop off the creature when you can move.

Whenever the creature being climbed on moves, you move with it.

### Climbed-on

_Ongoing._

You have D3 on attacks against creatures climbing on you.

As an action, you may try to shake off the creatures that are climbing on you. Make a might or agility check contested by the might or agility check of every creature climbing on you. On a success, they are thrown off.

### Grappling

_Ongoing._

Your move speed becomes zero and you cannot take the dash action. You have disadvantage on all A/D rolls and any ability checks requiring motion.

When you sidestep, the grappled creature moves to the space you were in previously.

If you are prone, you cannot stand up while grappling.

Whenever the creature you are grappling is forced to move, you may choose to be forced to move that distance with it or release the grapple, ending the grappled condition for it.

If you are forced to move, the grappled creature moves with you.

Any damage that you or the grappled creature takes due to forced movement is also applied to the other.

### Grappled

_Ongoing._

You have 1 level of restrained.

As an action, you may try to break free. Make a might or agility check contested by the might or agility check of the creature grappling you.

If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

On a success, you are no longer grappled.

Levels of restrained inflicted from being grappled do not inflict disadvantage on this roll.

Any damage that you or a creature grappling you takes due to forced movement is also applied to the other.

### Entangled

_Ongoing._

You are wrapped in a net or similar restraining device. You gain 1 level of restrained.

As an action, you may attempt to escape. Choose one:

- **Cut Free:** Make a slashing attack against CN 10. Success destroys the net.
- **Wriggle Out:** Make an agility check contested by the attacker's cunning challenge number.
- **Tear Free:** Make a might check contested by the attacker's might challenge number + 4.

Allies can use their action to cut you free (automatic success with slashing weapon).

Flying creatures that become entangled immediately fall unless they can hover.
