# Kin & Culture

## Human

Humans are resilient and abundant. They are far the most prolific across Alaria, and have the greatest breadth of culture. Contributing to their success as a species is their perseverance; just when you think you've knocked one down for good, they're back up for more.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Human Resilience and Diversity

**Passive ability.**
When you gain this ability, choose one talent. You gain this talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have).

In addition, whenever you take a wound, you gain a rush point at the start of the next round.

### Drachma

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous, and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and following ones instincts. They are usually the first one you notice when walking into a room—both for their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities. It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.

Drachma are generally found in western regions of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their hearty Drachman ale.

#### Aspects

- Style is everything
- I follow my instincts

#### Instinctive

**Passive ability.**
When you get a complication on a skill check and choose to re-roll, add 3 to the new result.

### Tikhaya

Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are comfortable spending time alone and in contemplation. There is a sort of strength that emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with their physiology—but instead from their self-certainty and outlook on the ways of the world. Even Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about them that is hardly met by even adults of other cultures.

Tikhaya can be found across central and northern Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are known for their incredible philosophers, mathematicians, and martial warriors.

#### Aspects

- I know right from wrong
- Wise in the ways of the world

#### Clear Mind

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to being confused, frightened, enraged, or charmed. Additionally, you have A2 when making skill checks or saving throws to see through deception.

### Neth

Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It is easy to misinterpret a Neth's silence at a joke as boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while never breaking a smile.

Neth are best known for their ability to speak with the wind, allowing them to communicate with the deceased members of their communities to gather advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For this reason, maintaining good relation with one's family, and community are critical to Neth culture, an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they meet who become close.

Neth can be found across the North Reach, along the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers, and resilient warriors.

#### Aspects

- Inscrutable
- If you look after nature, nature will look after you

#### Speak with the Wind

**Major ability.**
While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day, while not in combat, you may reach out to your ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- **Questions and Answers:** You may ask them up to three questions. They answer to the best of their ability. Although they only know what they knew during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans nearly a millennium.
- **Guidance:** Define a specific type of task or activity. Once, before the end of the day, before making a roll for that task or activity, you may declare that you are using your ancestors' guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die with the maximum result of that die.

This entire ritual takes 1 minute.

### Oznak

Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and place a high emphasis on proving one's self-worth and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a young age, children are taught with sticks how to wield a sword, even if they will never be able to afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in Oznak-dominated settlements also include different types of competitions involving sword play, and proper tournaments are common in some regions.

While excelling with the blade garners the most respect, those who don't become the best are pressured to succeed and dominate in another field. This mentality results in a culture of highly competitive people. Because they value skill so highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into a duel with an Oznak.

Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria, though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in the world, and are known for their technical craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying swordsmen.

#### Aspects

- I am no coward
- Fiercely competitive

#### Technical Master

**Passive ability.**
Choose a weapon or tool. If it is a weapon, you have advantage while wielding it. If it is a tool, you have A2 on all checks requiring the use of this tool.

### Naga (Dragon blooded)

Naga make up a long line of humans with dragon blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-father and first son of Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically, Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and heated the lands beneath it, the people below transformed and became the Naga that still exist today.

Naga are passionate and determined in all that they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy. They also have a profound sense of pride, both for themselves, their culture, and the things they care about. If they feel that any of those things have been wronged, then they will not back down until amends have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to behold.

#### Aspects

- Iron determination
- Boiling vengeance

#### Aspect of the Dragon

**Major ability.**
You may channel your blood of Naga, and transform into a dragon-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a dragon and your scales surface in patches over your skin. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- You take half damage from fire.
- You gain +1 to defense rolls from your natural, scaly armor.
- You may belch fire, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone. You may only use this ability once per transformation.
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you gain one level of enraged towards that creature. If another creature deals damage to you, remove all other levels of enraged gained from this ability.
- You have advantage on skill checks to intimidate others.

You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.

### Ulvsjael (Wolf children)

The ulvsjael are human descendants of Ulvma, the wolf mother and the second child of the Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died in his duel against Hykravones, Nagatayora had descended into madness, Ulvma stayed back with the armies of Alaria and fought till the very end before being cut down and collapsing into the ground amongst the armies. When humans came and drank from her blood, the Ulvsjael were born.

The Ulvsjael are a pragmatic and fiercely loyal race who believe in the natural order of life. Much of life revolves around small, nomadic units which travel as a pack. They will protect their comrades with their own lives, but they also feel no qualms about keeping those who cannot defend themselves alive. If you cannot contribute, you are culled. This harsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders, who are usually seen as dead weight until they have proven their worthiness to their pack. However, when the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider—a rare appearance, due to their tendency to stick with their kind—they are frequently the hardest working, such is their desire to prove their usefulness to a new community.

Ulvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are known for their formidable mercenary groups, trackers, and explorers.

#### Aspects

- Loyal to a fault
- Only the strong can survive

#### Aspect of the Wolf

**Major ability.**
You may channel your blood of Ulvsjael, and transform into a wolf-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a wolf and claws grow on your hands. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- You gain A2 on all skill checks for perceiving things that can be smelt or heard.
- Your move speed increases by 40 feet.
- Your jaws and claws count as light piercing and slashing melee weapons, respectively.
- Whenever you are in an engagement, choose a valid target for your stance. All creatures have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or manipulate fine objects.

You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.

### Sharabha (Lion hearts)

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father and third child of Gaea. When Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped Shara Bolasi's heart out through his chest, before stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when people had settled across Alaria once more, the humans who ate from the soil there became the first Sharabha.

Sharabha are known for their warmth, compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most respected member of a pride. They will make unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is chosen.

Outside these communities, Sharabha who have willingly left do not practice many of their more traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of principles and morality.

#### Aspects

- My honor before my life
- Better die brave than live a coward

#### Aspect of the Lion

**Major ability.**
You may channel your blood of Shara Bolasi, and transform into a lion-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a lion and claws grow on your hands. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- Your jaws count as a heavy piercing weapon. Your claws count as light slashing weapons.
- Whenever you deal damage with your jaws to an enemy, you may choose to not let go. If you do, and if the creature is no more than one size larger than you, the creature takes a level of restrained until it spends its action and wins a might check against your might challenge number. While holding on, you cannot attack with your jaws again. Both you and the bitten creature have your move speeds reduced by half, and move together.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or manipulate fine objects.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.

You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.

Looking at the existing format and the information provided, here are the markdown entries for the new human subraces:

### Vyanoweir

The Vyanoweir were once a mighty culture of community-oriented Deoric casters who wielded words of power to shape reality itself. Their mastery over the language of truth was unparalleled, allowing them to speak changes into existence with collective rituals that could reshape landscapes and bend the fundamental laws of nature.

Now their great cities lie in ruins, their libraries burned, and their people scattered to the winds. Only a handful of individuals with Vyanoweir blood remain, carrying within them the fading echoes of their ancestors' incredible power. These survivors often don't even know their true heritage until moments of great need awaken the dormant magic in their blood.

Among the scattered remnants are the Jae-Kai, nomadic spirit wranglers who have adapted their ancestral magic to herd spirits across the Plains of Oblivion. They make yearly pilgrimages to Estornum Agnostus to pay homage to the desolate ruins of their lost civilization.

#### Aspects

- The last echo of a great civilization
- Words have power beyond comprehension

#### Ancient Bloodline

**Major ability.**
The Deoric magic of your ancestors flows through your veins, though weakened by generations. Once per day, you may speak a single word in Deoric that becomes reality. Work with your GM to determine reasonable effects - you might speak "Light" to illuminate an area, "Calm" to soothe an agitated creature, or "Open" to unlock a simple door. The effect should be equivalent to a level 1-2 spell and cannot directly harm creatures or grant permanent benefits.

### Husakas

The Husakas are nomadic scorpion riders who traverse the endless dunes in search of the precious red dust that gives their culture its power and purpose. This crimson powder, harvested from rare desert blooms that grow only where ancient magic has seeped into the sand, is both blessing and curse to the Husakas people.

From childhood, the Husakas consume small amounts of the red dust daily, allowing it to flow through their veins and awaken mystical abilities. The dust is highly addictive, and those who go without it for too long suffer terrible withdrawal that can drive them to madness. This dependency shapes their entire way of life, as they must constantly migrate across the desert following the seasonal blooms and maintaining their sacred harvest.

The Husakas form close bonds with giant scorpions that serve as both mounts and companions, capable of navigating the treacherous desert terrain and defending against the many dangers that lurk beneath the sands.

#### Aspects

- The red dust flows through my veins
- Always moving, never settling

#### Dust Dependency

**Passive ability.**
You carry a small pouch of red dust that you must consume daily. The dust has been running through your veins since childhood, awakening mystical powers within you. Choose any handmagic talent - you gain it as a racial ability (it does not count towards your total number of talents).

However, you are dependent on the dust. If you go more than a week without consuming it, you gain one level of all mental conditions (confused, frightened, enraged, charmed) that do not fade until you consume the dust again. Your dust supply must be replenished yearly through trade or pilgrimage to the sacred harvesting grounds.

### The Guiltless

The Guiltless are the tragic creation of the great wizard Thenry Gilmora, who sought to create the perfect servants of good by magically removing their capacity for evil. Born unable to lie, steal, harm others, or act with malicious intent, they were intended to be living saints who would guide the world toward righteousness.

Instead, they became victims. Their absolute honesty and inability to defend themselves made them easy targets for exploitation and abuse. Over thousands of years of mistreatment, however, the Guiltless have developed subtle methods of resistance and revenge that work within the constraints of their nature.

The Guiltless have interbred with humans across the world and can appear as any other human. The trait often skips generations, sometimes manifesting unexpectedly in someone's lineage - which can be catastrophic for those unprepared for its implications.

#### Aspects

- Incapable of malice or deception
- The meek shall inherit through persistence

#### Blessed Curse

**Passive ability.**
You are magically incapable of lying, stealing, or intentionally harming others. You automatically fail any attempt to deceive, pickpocket, or make attack rolls against sentient creatures. However, this absolute goodness grants you protection - you have advantage on all saving throws against hostile magic, and creatures attempting to harm you take disadvantage on their attack rolls as the universe itself seems to conspire to protect the innocent.

Additionally, your complete honesty allows you to speak uncomfortable truths that others cannot. Once per day, you may ask any creature a direct question, and they must answer truthfully if they understand you (though they may choose to remain silent rather than answer).

### Qord'ik

The Qord'ik are a proud people of the Free Isles, distinguished by their dark brown skin, exceptional height, and powerfully built frames that speak to the giant blood many believe flows through their veins. Standing head and shoulders above most other humans, they are natural sailors whose massive frames allow them to handle the rigging and cargo of the great ships that ply the southern seas.

Equally skilled as traders and fighters, the Qord'ik have built a reputation for fair dealing backed by the implicit threat of their formidable physical presence. Their island homes have made them master navigators, and their trading vessels are welcomed in ports across Alaria - though few would dare to cheat a Qord'ik merchant.

The harsh life of the islands and the constant struggle against fierce storms and sea monsters has bred a people of incredible resilience, both in body and spirit.

#### Aspects

- Giants' blood runs in my veins
- The sea is in my bones

#### Strong Bones

**Passive ability.**
Your giant heritage has blessed you with incredibly dense bones and resilient flesh. Increase the damage threshold for taking wounds by 2 - where others would take a wound from 10 or more damage, you require 12 or more damage to suffer a wound.

Additionally, your imposing size grants you advantage on intimidation checks against creatures smaller than you, and you count as one size larger for the purposes of carrying capacity and lifting.

### Shontobi

The Shontobi are the noble samurai of the great plains, a people who have built their entire culture around concepts of honor, inheritance, and family duty. In their society, one's position is determined not just by skill with a blade, but by the honor of one's ancestors and the careful maintenance of family obligations that stretch back generations.

The nobility ride magnificent griffons into battle, their great wings casting shadows across the grasslands, while other honorable warriors mount swift horses bred for speed and endurance across the endless plains. Sacred eagles, revered as divine messengers, serve as hunting companions and symbols of prestige - to harm another's eagle is among the gravest of insults.

Marriages among the Shontobi are strategic affairs, carefully arranged to strengthen family alliances and preserve bloodlines. To go against one's family is the ultimate disgrace, leading to exile from the clan and the loss of one's name. They are cunning tacticians who plan their battles with the same care they use to plan their dynasties.

#### Aspects

- Honor above all else
- My family's name must not be shamed

**Choose One:**

#### Eagle Companion

**Passive ability.**
You have an eagle companion that has grown up alongside you since childhood. You gain the Beast Companion talent targeting this eagle as a racial ability (it does not count towards your total number of talents). Your eagle is particularly intelligent and can deliver simple messages over long distances.

#### Honor Bound

**Passive ability.**
Any aspects related to honor, duty, or pursuing honorable goals are empowered by your unwavering commitment. Such aspects grant twice as much DP when invoked for penalties and provide double the bonus when used for advantages. Additionally, upgrading honor-related aspects costs 1 less XP, as your dedication makes such growth natural.

### Tarnak

The Tarnak are a nomadic people of the deep desert whose mastery of blood magic and communion with death has made them feared across the sands of Ulkevolm. Dark-skinned and adorned with precious jewelry that catches the desert light, they paint their faces and bodies with intricate patterns using their own blood mixed with sacred inks, creating a tapestry of red and black that tells the story of their lineage and magical accomplishments.

These desert shamans form deep bonds with great desert tigers that prowl alongside their caravans, hunting by night and resting in the shade of their tents by day. The Tarnak practice blood magic not for power over others, but to commune with the spirits of the dead and divine the movements of fate through the patterns of life and death in the desert.

Their rituals and appearance make them deeply unsettling to outsiders, but the Tarnak see beauty in death as much as life, understanding it as part of the natural cycle that governs all existence.

#### Aspects

- Blood tells all stories
- Death is just another kind of life

#### Blood Sight

**Major ability.**
Through ancient blood magic rituals, you can divine truth from the patterns of life and death. Once per day, by examining a small amount of blood (your own or willingly given), you can learn one piece of information about the creature it came from: their current emotional state, whether they have told any lies in the past day, if they are suffering from any diseases or curses, or the general direction and distance to their current location.

Additionally, you can sense the presence of undead creatures within 60 feet, as their corrupted life force creates discordant notes in the blood-song that flows through all living things.

### Nuun

The Nuun are a desert people blessed with striking golden or ice-blue eyes that reflect their deep attunement to the primal elements of fire and water. Dark-skinned and dark-haired, they have built magnificent cities in the desert realm of Kura, where their mastery of trade has brought wealth and their appreciation for beauty has created architectural wonders that rival any in the known world.

Education and proper upbringing are cornerstones of Nuun society. Every child is taught not only practical skills but also philosophy, art, and the appreciation of beauty in all its forms. Their cities are filled with fountains, gardens, and structures that seem to defy the harsh desert environment through the careful application of elemental magic.

As competent traders, the Nuun have established trading routes that stretch across continents, their caravans protected by their elemental magic and their reputation for fair dealing. They believe that beauty and knowledge are the highest achievements of civilization.

#### Aspects

- Beauty in all things must be preserved
- Knowledge is the greatest treasure

#### Elemental Heritage

**Passive ability.**
Choose fire or water - you have a basic elemental attunement to that element as a racial ability (this does not count towards talents gained). Your eyes glow faintly with elemental energy when you use this attunement, growing brighter during more powerful applications.

Additionally, your appreciation for beauty and culture grants you advantage on presence checks when dealing with matters of art, architecture, trade negotiations, or academic discussions.

### Temptari

The Temptari are a deeply spiritual people who have mastered the art of reading the subtle currents of time and weather. Through generations of religious devotion and seasonal rituals, they have developed an uncanny ability to sense what is about to unfold. Their monasteries dot the mountainous regions where the seasons change most dramatically, and their timemasters are sought after as advisors by rulers across Alaria. A Temptari never seems rushed or surprised—they move through life as if they've already lived it once before.

Temptari settlements can be found in the high mountain passes and valleys where the seasons are most pronounced. They are renowned for their prophets, weather-readers, and the legendary timemasters who can glimpse moments yet to come.

#### Aspects

- Time flows differently for me
- The seasons speak to those who listen

#### Temporal Awareness

**Passive ability.**
You cannot be surprised. Additionally, once per round, when you or an ally within 30 feet would roll a 1 on any die, you may warn them of the impending complication. They may choose to not take that action instead, avoiding both the roll and its consequences entirely.

#### Desert Born

**Passive ability.**
Choose either fire or water when you select this heritage. You gain a basic attunement to that element. Additionally, you have advantage on all presence checks related to trade, negotiation, or appraising the value of goods, and you only need to consume water once every three days instead of daily.

### Gezzerin

The Gezzerin have adapted to life in the shadow of giants, developing a culture built around stealth, conservation, and ritual scarification that tells the story of their survival. Each scar represents a close encounter, a lesson learned, or a giant evaded. They move through their hill country homes like ghosts, using ancient paths and hidden shelters passed down through generations. Water is sacred to the Gezzerin, and they have developed remarkable biological adaptations to preserve every drop.

The Gezzerin make their homes throughout the Hills of Gezzeri, where massive giants still roam. They are known for their scouts, survivalists, and the intricate scarification that serves as both history and protection.

#### Aspects

- My scars tell my story
- Giants cast long shadows, but shadows can hide many things

#### Giant's Bane

**Heart ability.**
Your people have learned to disappear when giants draw near. When you take the hide action, you may include up to six other creatures within 10 feet of you in your stealth check, using your result for the entire group. Additionally, you only need to drink water once per week, and you have advantage on saving throws against being forcibly moved or knocked prone by creatures larger than you.

### Kuru

The Kuru are perhaps the most unusual of human cultures, having discovered an ancient ritual that allows them to bond with the spirits of beasts. By pressing the skull of a slain animal to their forehead and speaking the words of binding, they fuse with the creature's essence, gaining its strength at the cost of human speech. The transformation is reversible but few choose to return—the call of the wild becomes part of their very soul. Kuru warriors are feared across the southern lands, as one never knows if the approaching figure is merely human or something far more dangerous.

The Kuru inhabit the Killing Hills and Avakus Forest south of Kyagos, where the barrier between human and beast grows thin. They are known for their beast warriors, primal shamans, and the haunting skull masks they wear before transformation.

#### Aspects

- The beast and I are one
- Words are cages—the wild speaks in actions

#### Skull Fusion

**Major ability.**
As an action, you may press the skull of a beast to your forehead, fusing with its spirit. Choose a beast form with your GM's approval (as per the Beastform talent). You transform into this creature, gaining its physical stats while maintaining your mental abilities. While transformed:

- You cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components
- You gain the beast's natural weapons, movement modes, and senses
- You can understand speech but cannot respond verbally
- The transformation lasts until you take a long rest or spend an action to end it

Unlike the Beastform talent, you may stay in this form indefinitely, but each long rest while transformed requires a might save (CN 10) or gain one level of mental vulnerability as the beast's instincts grow stronger.

### Shapers

The Shapers are perhaps the most distrusted of all human bloodlines, marked by their distinctive silver eyes that remain constant no matter what form they take. Gifted with the ability to perfectly mimic the physical appearance of any humanoid they have seen, they are living shapeshifters whose talents have unfortunately made them valuable for infiltration, espionage, and other unsavory professions.

Their abilities are not illusion but true physical transformation, allowing them to perfectly replicate height, build, facial features, and even voice. However, their silver eyes always remain, serving as the only reliable way to identify a Shaper. This limitation has led to widespread fear and suspicion of anyone with silver eyes, even among those who are not Shapers.

Many Shapers struggle with questions of identity, as the ease with which they can become someone else sometimes makes it difficult to remember who they truly are. Some embrace their gift as freedom from the constraints of a single form, while others see it as a curse that forever separates them from genuine human connection.

#### Aspects

- Am I who I appear to be?
- Trust is a luxury I cannot afford

#### Perfect Mimicry

**Major ability.**
You can perfectly transform your physical appearance to match any humanoid you have seen, changing height, build, facial features, skin tone, and even voice. This transformation is not an illusion but a true physical change that can fool even magical detection. However, your distinctive silver eyes never change, always remaining as the one identifying feature that cannot be hidden.

The transformation takes one minute and lasts until you choose to change again or revert to your true form. You retain all your abilities and statistics while transformed, but gain no special knowledge or memories of the person you're mimicking.

## Elf

Elves are a race of fiercely independent, ancient, culturally rich people. With lifespans five times the length of a humans', elves have a much broader perspective on life and the world around them, and a lot more time to explore and refine their passions. Wars, politics, and the frivolities of other races are far less important to most elven cultures.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Years of Experience

**Passive ability.**
Gaining additional or upgrading your aspects costs 2 less XP, for a minimum of 1, and your maximum rank for each of your aspects is increased by 3.

### Amverela (High Elf)

The Amverela are the most prolific and long-living of the elves, and most interactive with the other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long life times, but especially due to their extreme wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are some of the longest running ethnic identities among all people on Alaria—having survived numerous cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while remaining relatively culturally intact.

They place a higher value on investing in themselves, their relationships, and their communities. This has led them to building some of the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by most standards.

The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects of life.

#### Aspects

- Centuries of wisdom
- Cautious

#### Expertise

**Passive ability.**
Choose one:

- The XP cost of gaining martial talents and their destiny levels decreases by 2.
- The XP cost of gaining cognitive talents and their destiny levels decreases by 2.

### Caerene (Wood Elf)

The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them to more easily blend into the forests in which they usually live.

Caerene are far more isolating than many other races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial, day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of hiding and blending in with their natural surroundings. An unobservant individual walking through the middle of a Caerene village may not even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the Caerene.

Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and immediate justice. There are no second chances in Caerene culture.

#### Aspects

- Perceptive and stealthy
- Nature is my home

#### Warden of the Wilds

**Passive ability.**
You may ignore non-magical difficult terrain, your move speed is increased by 20 when not wearing heavy armor, and you have A2 on all skill checks relating to nature, survival, and stealth in the outdoors.

### Vyko (Astral Elf)

The Vyko are elves who have traversed the planar envelope protecting Alaria from the void beyond. Their skin is a deep purplish indigo, speckled with white points like distant stars, and their hair is either brilliant white or deep black. They possess an incredibly powerful presence that commands attention the moment they enter a room.

These elves reside north of Gorath, having returned from their cosmic journeys with a fundamentally altered perspective on time and existence. Their experience beyond the material plane has granted them both incredible presence and a patience that can seem frustrating to shorter-lived races.

#### Aspects

- Cosmic wanderer
- Time moves differently for me

#### Imperial Presence

**Passive ability.**
Whenever making a presence check, if you did not roll a failure or complication, you may choose to instead use your heart challenge number as the result. You are immune to the frightened condition.

#### Cosmic Mindset

**Passive ability.**
You are used to life traveling at a very slow rate. You have disadvantage on all ability checks made while under a time crunch, and advantage on all ability checks made with no time limitations.

### Eloweir (Sea Elf)

The Eloweir, called sea elves by other races, are a proud and capable people deeply connected to the oceans. They build bustling coastal cities with incredible architecture full of swooping curves and circular designs that mirror the flow of water and tides.

The Eloweir are renowned across Alaria for their mastery of poisons, their skilled soldiers, their natural attunement to water magic, and their sophisticated democratic governance. Their societies are as fluid and adaptive as the seas they call home.

#### Aspects

- Child of the tides
- Democratic ideals

#### Sea Blood

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to water, but only saltwater. You can breathe underwater and your swim speed is increased by 30 feet while in saltwater.

### Teflin (Blood Elf)

The Teflin reside in Hik, their reddish skin marking them as a people touched by an ancient curse. Blood is sacred to their culture, as an old Deoric enchantment runs through their veins—a curse that traded immortality for power, but at a terrible cost.

The curse builds up in their blood over time, and if allowed to accumulate too much, it will kill them. To manage this, the Teflin practice ritual bloodletting to relieve the curse's pressure. In exchange for this constant sacrifice, they gain power proportional to their suffering.

#### Aspects

- Blood is my burden and strength
- Cursed heritage

#### Crimson Sacrifice

**Passive ability.**
You may voluntarily reduce your current hit points by any amount as an action. For every 10 hit points you sacrifice this way, gain +1 to all attack rolls until your next long rest. These bonuses stack but are lost if you regain hit points above your pre-sacrifice total.

### Kuzagt (Bone Elf)

The Kuzagt, also known as Bone Elves, are tall and spindly elves with distinctive bony protrusions extending from their high cheekbones. Their angular features and slanted eyes give them a skull-like appearance that many find unsettling. They inhabit the salt flats of Bonnetaz, where they maintain vast human slave camps.

The Kuzagt see humans as invaders and poachers on Alaria's beauty, viewing nothing wrong with using them to further elven purposes. They wear robes made from human leather, drink fermented blood, and embed jewels into their skulls to denote rank within their oligarchical council system.

#### Aspects

- Humans are lesser beings
- Death holds no terror

#### Bone Deep Cruelty

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on intimidation checks against humanoids. When you deal damage to a humanoid that would cause a wound, you may increase the wound's rank by 2.

### Nemo (Lost Ones)

The Nemo are the ghostly descendants of Caerene elves who sought to achieve immortality and perfect oneness with the forest. Instead of transcendence, they eternally bound their souls to the Eros forests, becoming trapped spirits who can never truly die while the forest lives, but can never truly live again either.

These spectral elves are cold, bitter, and wise, having spent millennia isolated in their forest prison. Their failed pursuit of perfection serves as a warning about the dangers of reaching too far beyond mortal limitations.

#### Aspects

- Trapped between life and death
- Millennia of bitter wisdom

#### Ghostly Form

**Passive ability.**
You are incorporeal and can move through solid objects, but cannot interact with physical objects without concentrating (requiring an action). You are immune to physical damage but vulnerable to magical damage. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.

### Kryaaji (Sun Elf)

The Kryaaji dwell in Enuau Kemjallb, the radiant House of the Sun, a golden palace forbidden to all visitors. They believe their light and home are too pure to be soiled by outsiders, maintaining strict isolation not from arrogance, but from a sense of sacred duty.

These elves train the magnificent Wysynnbre—golden, luminant eagles that nest in the nearby Sunwing Peaks. They maintain their own sect of the Order of Bryn, believing Bryn to be an elf rather than human as others claim. Their Lightbearer priests are easily recognized by the sunlight that radiates from their eye sockets.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred light
- Isolated guardian of purity

#### Radiant Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to light. You can cause bright light to emanate from your body in a 15-foot radius and dim light 15 feet beyond that. This light dispels magical darkness and you can control it at will.

### Istori (Winter Elf)

The Istori are typically kind, benevolent, and regal elves who have traditionally secluded themselves in the northern reaches of Istora. They believed it more peaceful to remain alone than deal with the world's constant turmoil and conflicts.

However, their isolation has not protected them from strife, as they now find themselves locked in internal revolution. The very peace they sought to preserve has been shattered by ideological divisions within their own society.

#### Aspects

- Regal but embattled
- Seeker of lost peace

#### Winter's Resilience

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to cold damage and ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would slow you or reduce your movement speed.

### Sivakr (Silver Elf)

The Sivakr are gray-skinned elves who typically dwell underground in the realm of Myorna. In their society, physical exercise is considered vulgar and ugly—social relevance is determined entirely by influence gained through mental acuity and intellectual prowess.

The Sivakr possess a remarkable ability to manipulate memory, which they demonstrate in formal memory duels. These ritualistic contests involve two elves standing face-to-face with arms outstretched and fingers interlocked, each attempting to alter the other's memories to convince them they made a mistake in accepting the challenge.

#### Aspects

- Mind over matter
- Memory is malleable

#### Memory Plant

**Major ability.**
You may spend 20 hit points to alter the thoughts and memories of a non-hostile creature that you touch. You may replace up to one minute's worth of memories made by that creature from the last week with whatever memories you wish. They are unaware of any magic occurring.

### Starborn (Star Elf)

The Starborn are the enigmatic caretakers of the celestial order, dwelling in high mountain observatories where the veil between earth and sky grows thin. These elves have taken upon themselves the sacred duty of maintaining the stars' positions and brightness—a task they believe essential to preserving the cosmic balance that keeps darker forces at bay. Their skin has a subtle luminescence that becomes more pronounced under starlight, and their eyes reflect the constellations they tend.

Unlike their druidic cousins who immerse themselves in nature's wild passions, the Starborn maintain strict neutrality in worldly affairs. They view existence from a cosmic perspective where individual lives and even civilizations are but brief flickers against the eternal night. This detachment makes them seem cold to other races, but it stems from their burden of maintaining universal harmony rather than any lack of compassion.

The Starborn conduct nightly rituals to guide wayward stars back to their proper courses and rekindle those whose light begins to fade. They believe that should the stars ever fall from their appointed places, chaos would consume all creation.

#### Aspects

- The stars must maintain their course
- Cosmic neutrality preserves balance

#### Stellar Navigation

**Passive ability.**
You can always see the stars, even during daylight or through cloud cover, granting you perfect directional sense and making you impossible to disorient. You have advantage on all navigation checks and can determine your exact location by observing the sky for one minute.

Additionally, once per night while under an open sky, you may commune with the stars to gain cosmic insight. Ask one question about events occurring anywhere in the world within the last 24 hours. The stars provide a cryptic but truthful answer through their movements and brightness.

### Dark Elves (Shadow Elf)

The Dark Elves are an extinct lineage that once ruled the southern forests of Aboyuinzu as dragon riders of terrifying power. Their ashen gray skin and coal-black eyes marked them as a people touched by draconic magic, while their heavy furs protected them from the perpetual chill that followed in their wake. These elves formed soul-bonds with the great wyrms of the south, sharing consciousness with their mounts in a symbiosis that made them nearly invincible in battle.

Their civilization came to an abrupt end during the Dragon Purge, when rival nations united to destroy both the dark elves and their dragon allies. The forests of Aboyuinzu are now filled with towering totems to the old dragon gods—massive stone monuments that still radiate faint draconic power. Some say the dark elves' spirits linger near these totems, waiting for the day when dragons might return to the world.

Though believed extinct, there are whispers of dark elf bloodlines persisting in remote communities, their draconic heritage diluted but not entirely lost. Those who discover such ancestry often feel an inexplicable pull toward the ancient totems and may even hear the whispered words of long-dead dragons in their dreams.

#### Aspects

- Dragons' blood calls to dragons' blood
- The old ways demand remembrance

#### Draconic Echo

**Major ability.**
Though the true dragon bonds died with your ancestors, you retain a shadow of their power. Once per day, you may touch one of your people's ancient dragon totems (or any draconic artifact) to channel the lingering spirit within. For the next hour, you gain:

- The ability to speak and understand Draconic
- Resistance to one damage type associated with dragons (choose when activating)
- +2 to intimidation checks as draconic presence radiates from you
- Brief visions of the totem's history and the dragon it honors

If you are one of the few with true dark elf blood (work with your GM), you can use this ability without a totem once per week, manifesting faint dragon wings that grant a glide speed of 30 feet (fall at 10 feet per round) for the duration.

### Ythari (Moss Elf)

The Ythari are forest dwellers whose very beings have merged with the woodland essence. Their skin bears the deep green of forest canopies with distinctive flecks of black and brown that shift like dappled sunlight through leaves. These patterns change subtly with the seasons, becoming more brown in autumn and taking on hints of white during winter months. Their culture revolves around extreme generosity—status is measured not by what one owns but by what one has given away.

The Ythari speak sparingly, believing that words spent carelessly are gifts wasted. When they do speak, each word is chosen with the same care they use when selecting a gift. Their communities practice radical sharing where personal property barely exists; tools, homes, and even meals flow freely between community members based on need.

Most distinctively, Ythari families adopt wild animals as mentors for their children. Each child is paired with a creature whose temperament and skills complement what the child needs to learn. A timid child might be paired with a bold badger, while an impulsive one might learn patience from a turtle. These animal mentors live freely but visit regularly, forming bonds that last lifetimes.

#### Aspects

- Generosity is the highest virtue
- Actions speak where words fail

#### Gift of the Forest

**Heart ability.**
Your connection to nature and culture of giving manifests in supernatural ways. When you give away something of personal value (worth at least 10 ducats or of significant sentimental importance), you may invoke the Gift of the Forest. Choose one:

- **Silent Step**: You and up to 6 allies within 30 feet gain the ability to move without making any sound for the next hour. During this time, you automatically succeed on stealth checks related to moving quietly.
- **Animal Mentor**: Summon the spirit of your childhood animal mentor. It appears and aids you for 10 minutes, fighting alongside you with the stats of a Beast Companion but incorporeal (immune to physical damage, can't manipulate objects).
- **Nature's Reciprocity**: The forest provides what you need most. The GM determines what appears, but it will be something that helps your current situation—healing herbs if wounded, clean water if thirsty, or shelter if exposed.

Additionally, you can communicate basic concepts with any animal through gestures and body language, though complex ideas remain beyond this communication.

### Rakiten (Plains Elf)

The Rakiten tower above other elven lineages, their extraordinary height evolved over millennia to see over the endless grass seas of their homeland. Standing seven to eight feet tall with bronze skin that gleams like burnished metal in sunlight, they cut imposing figures on the rare occasions they venture beyond their plains. Their faces are distinctively flat with angular, somewhat square features, and their sharp teeth speak to a more carnivorous diet than their woodland cousins—a necessity when plant matter is scarce during the dry seasons.

What truly sets the Rakiten apart is their complete abandonment of spoken language. Whether due to the way sound carries unpredictably across the windswept plains or some ancient cultural trauma, the Rakiten communicate exclusively through an intricate sign language that incorporates hand movements, body positioning, and facial expressions. This visual language is so sophisticated it can convey complex philosophical concepts and poetry with greater nuance than spoken words. Even their names are signs rather than sounds—a flowing gesture rather than a collection of syllables.

The Rakiten organize their society around "sight-bonds"—groups of individuals who maintain visual contact while traveling the plains. These bonds become so attuned to each other that they can communicate through subtle shifts in posture visible at great distances. Their encampments are arranged in careful patterns that allow for maximum visual communication between all members, creating communities where a single gesture can ripple through the entire population in moments.

#### Aspects

- Silence speaks volumes
- Height grants perspective in all things

#### Silent Speech

**Passive ability.**
You are fluent in Rakiten Sign Language, which allows for completely silent communication with perfect clarity at any distance where you can see the speaker's hands and body. This language is so efficient that you can convey complex information faster than spoken language—any social skill check that relies on communication takes half the usual time when conducted in sign language with willing participants.

Additionally, your extraordinary height and visual acuity grant you the following benefits:

- You can see clearly up to 3 miles in flat terrain, and can make out details (like hand signals) at up to 1 mile
- You have advantage on perception checks to spot things at a distance
- In combat, your reach with melee weapons increases by 5 feet due to your height
- You can communicate basic tactical information (danger, direction, numbers) instantly to any ally who can see you, even in the midst of combat, without using any action

## Xalahir (Blood Elf)

The Xalahir are a cursed lineage of elves who long ago traded their connection to nature for immortal hunger. Where other elves' eyes shine with inner light, the Xalahir's are pools of absolute darkness, sunken deep into their pale, porcelain faces. Despite this horrific feature, they possess an otherworldly beauty that enchants and mesmerizes, drawing victims close enough for the Xalahir to feed. Their movements are fluid and hypnotic, their voices like silk, and their presence commands attention in any room.

Unlike common vampires who establish lairs and territories, the Xalahir are eternal wanderers, driven by both hunger and an ancient compulsion to never remain in one place. They arrive in settlements as mysterious strangers—perhaps a traveling merchant, a wandering minstrel, or a noble passing through—and systematically feed on the population before vanishing into the night. By the time their victims realize what has happened, the Xalahir is already three towns away, leaving only drained bodies and whispered warnings in their wake.

The Xalahir view other beings as nothing more than elegant wine bottles to be sampled and discarded. They feel no guilt for their predations, seeing emotional attachment as a weakness that their transformation freed them from. Their immortal existence is one of refined hedonism, seeking out the finest blood like sommeliers pursuing rare vintages. They particularly prize the blood of other elves, claiming it retains notes of the natural harmony they themselves have lost.

#### Aspects

- Mortals are merely vessels for my sustenance
- Beauty conceals the deepest horrors

#### Enchanting Predator

**Major ability.**
Your vampiric nature grants you tools to hunt among civilized prey. You possess an unnatural magnetism that makes others want to trust and confide in you, despite the wrongness in your sunken black eyes.

- You have advantage on all Presence checks to persuade, deceive, or seduce creatures that can see and hear you
- Once per long rest, when you touch a humanoid, you may subtly feed on their life force. They must make a presence saving throw against your presence challenge number or become charmed by you for 10 minutes. While charmed this way, they will not notice or remember you feeding on them
- When you successfully feed (either through this ability or by dealing damage with a bite attack), you heal hit points equal to your heart die and remove one level of any condition affecting you
- You have darkvision out to 30 feet, allowing you to hunt in darkness
- However, you must feed on humanoid blood at least once per week or gain a level of weakened that doesn't fade until you feed

## Dwarf

Dwarves are a short but hearty people, and are generally more pragmatic than the other races. While some live underground, many more do not.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 3.5-5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Hearty and Gruff

**Passive ability.**
It costs 1 less XP when you choose to spend XP to increase your maximum hit points.

Additionally, when wielding a shield or heavy weapon, you get +1 on your A/D rolls.

You are also immune to the frightened condition.

### Drasnian (Stout Dwarf)

Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and by far most populous of the dwarven heritages, dating back to before the Uline dwarves went underground. Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and live almost exclusively above ground or in homes built into hillsides. They have a long history of both prosperity and destitution, and through economic trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement, have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as in several countries where Drasnians have settled down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the believed birthplace of the Drasnians.

As a whole, they value education, money, and preserving their cultural and religious legacy. Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating worship, relationships, and one's day-to-day life.

#### Aspects

- Good with money and numbers
- I will do my duty

#### Alert

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on all cunning checks to determine if someone has bad intentions, and may choose to have first priority in combat.

In addition, you gain the perceptive talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have).

### Uline (Chain Dwarf)

The Uline originated from a particularly productive iron mine, many thousands of years ago. The mine, which had struck a rich vein of ore was so vast and deep that it would inevitably take more than a generation to complete. Rather than journey to and from the surface daily, they discovered that it was more efficient to temporarily station some dwarves within the mines for days, or even weeks at a time. With time, these temporary stations became more permanent residencies, and eventually, entire settlements. These dwarves became the Uline—named after the settlement that grew up in that first mine. Today, the Uline are the most industrious of the dwarves, preferring to live underground, mining, and making their homes in the mountains beneath the surface.

Living underground came with several unexpected effects, that the Uline now embrace or have adapted to. Beneath the surface, there are few people who can interfere with a settlement's growth. Defense from invaders is easier when underground, which has allowed the Uline to allocate more resources towards magnificent palaces, inventions, and other intellectual efforts. Additionally, within a single generation, the number of earth attuned individuals increased drastically, enhancing the population's ability to mine and control their environment underground.

However, underground life also came with several hardships. Fish, fungi, and insects are nearly the only things alive besides the monsters from the deep, and little airflow and high temperatures deep underground require complex air circulation systems in place. The Uline have gotten around this latter problem by implementing networks of air vents leading to the surface, manipulated through long chains, giving them their nickname of chain dwarves.

Even more difficult to deal with were the shadereavers and other monstrosities from the dark. While the Aureum dwarves invented huge mirrored passageways into the depths of the caves, using the sun's light to protect themselves from the creatures of the dark, the Uline resorted to iron. To this day, children are taught from a young age how to wield the heavy iron blades and hammers used to defend themselves from the monsters of the dark.

Living underground has shaped the Uline into a rough, tough, and pragmatic group, but they are usually goodnatured, and even sometimes downright jolly. However, it is unwise to get into an argument with most Uline; the Uline have done things in the same way for thousands of years, and change is not something many of them are welcome to. When disagreement does arise, arbitrage usually falls on higher ranking individuals within the community, who will have final say.

#### Aspects

- Stubborn to a fault
- I respect true authority

#### Mountain-born

**Passive ability.**
You gain your choice of a basic attunement to earth or darkness.

### Aureum (Sun Dwarf)

In the early days of the Uline, when no more than a few underground settlements existed, an upwelling of shadereavers from deep below nearly wiped out the underground population. Immediately, multiple factions emerged proposing different ways to avoid such catastrophes in the future. One of these such factions determined that nothing but the light of the sun could shield them from such monstrosities, and swore to find a way to brings the sun's light into the depths of the Uline caves. While many of the Uline thought this was impossible, and rejected the idea, some latched on, and the Aureum were born.

The Aureum use complex systems of mirrors and glass to illuminate their underground settlements with the warm glow of sunlight. Within a few more centuries, they had also discovered the secret to storing liquid sunlight, keeping them safe even when night came. Now, this liquid sunlight is smelted into much of their armor and weapons, and keeps them strong, and as they now believe, pure.

Aureum culture emphasizes law, honor, and truth. When the Aureum first broke away from the Uline, their leader, Aurea herself, promised to keep her people safe, so long as her followers trusted her, and followed her commands. They did, and she carried through—permanently cementing the importance of a promise and following one's leader.

#### Aspects

- The law comes first
- My word is my bond

#### Sunsmith

**Major ability.**
As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun's rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for any one of the following abilities:

- **Health and Rejuvenation:** As an interact action, you may drink the flask and gain the benefits of a short rest.
- **Smash:** As an interact action, you may crush or throw your flask to cast Blinding Sun.

Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise or sunset to capture the sun's rays. The sunlight within a flask expires after 12 hours.

Looking at the provided template and the brief descriptions, I'll create dwarven subraces that follow the established format and fit within the Heart Rush mechanical framework. Each will have lore, two aspects, and a racial ability.

### Glorindian (Gold Eyes)

The Glorindian dwarves emerged from the deepest gold mines of the eastern mountains, where centuries of exposure to auric veins awakened an supernatural connection to precious metals. Their distinctive golden eyes can perceive the glimmer of gold through solid stone, making them unparalleled prospectors and treasure hunters. This gift, however, has made them targets of exploitation throughout history, leading many Glorindian communities to become secretive and nomadic.

Their obsidian-dark skin contrasts strikingly with their luminous golden eyes, which seem to glow faintly in darkness. Glorindian culture values wealth not for luxury, but as a measure of one's connection to the earth's hidden treasures. They believe gold calls to those worthy of finding it, and that hoarding beyond one's needs brings misfortune.

#### Aspects

- Gold calls to the worthy
- What's hidden will be found

#### Auric Sight

**Passive ability.**
You can sense the location and approximate quantity of gold, silver, and other precious metals within 120 feet, even through solid barriers. When examining valuable objects, you automatically know their precise worth and can detect any counterfeits or impurities.

Additionally, once per long rest, you may spend 10 minutes concentrating to divine the location of the nearest significant treasure hoard within 1 mile.

### Hestrube (Graylings, Stone Dwarves)

The Hestrube are living stone given dwarven form, dwelling in the deepest caverns where earth and flesh merged through ancient elemental magic. Their bodies are composed of living granite that can shift between solid and fluid states at will. These stone dwarves have adapted to survive in the harshest underground environments, feeding on minerals and moving through solid rock as easily as others move through air.

Hestrube society operates more like geological formations than traditional communities—they cluster in colonies that can remain motionless for decades, then suddenly migrate through hundreds of miles of stone. Their patience rivals that of mountains, but their pragmatic nature makes them efficient problem-solvers when roused to action.

#### Aspects

- Patient as stone, hard as granite
- The deep earth provides all

#### Stone Flesh

**Passive ability.**
You gain an advanced attunement to earth. You can pass through unworked stone as if it were difficult terrain, and may choose to become partially incorporeal within stone, granting you total cover from attacks that don't originate from within the stone.

You sustain yourself by consuming 1 pound of stone or minerals daily instead of normal food. While underground, you have advantage on stealth checks and automatically succeed at navigation checks.

### Grendel (Chord Dwarves)

The Grendel are wandering dwarves who travel in close-knit family caravans, their culture built around music, storytelling, and fierce loyalty to blood relations. Often misunderstood and persecuted by settled folk who view them as thieves and troublemakers, the Grendel have developed a complex code of honor that governs interactions both within their clans and with outsiders.

Their musical traditions serve not just as entertainment but as historical records, with each family maintaining epic ballads that chronicle their lineage and travels. The Grendel possess an almost supernatural ability to harmonize, and their group performances can influence emotions and inspire extraordinary feats.

#### Aspects

- Family honor above all else
- The song remembers what words forget

#### Chord of Kinship

**Heart ability.**
When you and at least two allies who can hear you begin singing, humming, or playing instruments together, all participants gain +2 to their next attack roll and may use each other's rush points as if they were their own until the end of the round.

Additionally, you have advantage on all social skill checks when interacting with other Grendel, and disadvantage on such checks with authority figures from settled communities.

### Verucan

Born from the volcanic forges of the southern peaks, the Verucan dwarves channel the raw fury of molten earth through their bodies. Their obsidian-black skin bears glowing red veins that pulse with inner fire, and their legendary tempers are matched only by their mastery of flame and forge. These dwarves have built their civilization within active volcanoes, harnessing geothermal energy for their incredible metalworking.

Verucan society prizes passion and intensity in all things—their loves burn as hot as their hatred, and their craftsmanship reflects this fiery dedication. They view anger not as a weakness but as a sacred flame that drives innovation and excellence, though this philosophy often puts them at odds with more reserved cultures.

#### Aspects

- Forged in fire, tempered by fury
- Passion drives perfection

#### Molten Heart

**Passive ability.**
You gain an advanced attunement to fire. Your body radiates heat—unarmed attacks and grappling inflict 1 level of burning on contact. When you become enraged or use abilities that increase in power based on emotions, add your current rush points to the effect.

Once per combat, when you take a wound, you may immediately cast _Aura of Ignition_ without using an action or having the spell count against your daily limit.

### Yorinthian (Winter Dwarves)

The Yorinthian dwarves serve the ancient dragon goddess Nabuhe in the frozen wastes of Hannoweir, where they have been shaped by millennia of harsh winters and draconic influence. Their hearts have grown as cold as the glacial halls they inhabit, and their cruel philosophies reflect the unforgiving nature of their patron deity. They view mercy as weakness and believe that only through suffering can one achieve true strength.

These pale, frost-touched dwarves have developed a rigid hierarchy based on their ability to endure and inflict hardship. Their ice-blue eyes show little warmth, and their elaborate codes of conduct prioritize duty to Nabuhe above all personal bonds or mortal concerns.

#### Aspects

- Winter purifies the weak
- Nabuhe's will guides my hand

#### Winter's Embrace

**Major ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to water. As an action, you may cast _Chilling Wind_ or _Grasp of the Ice Witch_. For the next minute, whenever you deal damage with a melee weapon, the target gains 1 level of slowed.

Additionally, you are immune to cold damage and environmental cold effects, but take double damage from fire sources.

### Strømgodden (Battle Dwarves)

The Strømgodden have forged a culture around sacrifice, fury, and glorious combat, developing unique armor embedded with spikes and blades that turns their very bodies into weapons. Their signature combat technique involves hurling themselves bodily at enemies, using their spiked armor to deal devastating damage through close contact. This dangerous fighting style reflects their belief that true honor comes only through risking everything in battle.

These battle-scarred dwarves view each conflict as a sacred offering to the gods of war, and their society celebrates those who achieve the most spectacular and dangerous victories. Their settlements in Trømgar are built like fortresses, constantly ready for the next glorious battle.

#### Aspects

- Glory through sacrifice
- My body is my weapon

#### Spiked Charge

**Heart ability.**
When you dash at least 20 feet toward an enemy and enter an engagement with them, your armor becomes a weapon. Make an additional attack using your armor's defense bonus as your weapon die. Both you and the target take damage equal to the attack roll, but you may immediately make a second weapon attack with advantage.

While wearing medium or heavy armor, unarmed attacks and grappling deal additional damage equal to your armor's defense bonus.

### Nydor (Dark Dwarves)

The Nydor broke away from their Aureum cousins to embrace the darkness that the sun-worshippers rejected, establishing their brutal civilization in the shadowed realm of Emblydium beneath the black sun. These tusked, ash-skinned dwarves have become master slavers and creators of cruel war machines, trading instruments of oppression to surface nations in exchange for a steady supply of captives.

Their long, unkempt hair and prominent tusks give them a bestial appearance that matches their harsh philosophy. The Nydor believe that strength comes through domination, and their underground forges ring constantly with the creation of chains, weapons, and mechanical contraptions designed to control and terrorize.

#### Aspects

- Strength rules the weak
- Darkness reveals truth

#### Forge of Oppression

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to darkness and an advanced knowledge of mechanical devices. You have advantage on crafting checks for weapons, armor, and restraints, and can create makeshift shackles or cages from available materials in half the normal time.

Additionally, you can see in complete darkness as if it were bright light to a distance of 60 feet, and enemies cannot gain advantage on attack rolls against you due to concealment or darkness.

### Velwey (Dream Dwarves)

The Velwey have mastered the art of dream harvesting, using combinations of hallucinogenic substances, divine magic, and deoric rituals to extract and manipulate the dreams of sleeping minds. Their religious society in Movasi has built magnificent palaces powered by crystallized dreams, and they offer the profound service of helping individuals discover their true names through guided dream journeys.

These mystical dwarves serve as both healers and judges, able to enter the dreams of others to provide therapy, extract information, or even deliver merciful death to those ready to pass into eternal dreams. Their dream weavers are revered as divine agents who free worthy souls from the burdens of waking life.

#### Aspects

- Dreams reveal deeper truths
- The sleeping mind holds all secrets

#### Dreamwalker

**Weekly ability.**
By spending one hour in meditation with a sleeping creature, you may enter their dreams. While in the dream, you can communicate with them, observe their memories, or plant suggestions that will influence their actions for the next 24 hours.

Once per month, you may attempt to discern a creature's true name through an extended dream ritual requiring their willing participation and taking 3 days to complete.

### Einwissel (Celestial Draugr)

The Einwissel are the descendants of dwarves who survived a harrowing journey from the celestial plane of Celesté back to the material world. This planar transition left them forever changed, with blue-gray skin decorated with silvery speckles and a profound connection to daemonic forces. They can share thoughts and magical energy with one another, but fragments of their true names remain exposed, making them vulnerable to mystical attacks.

These reclusive dwarves hide in the remote Zhorheim and Miphoris mountains, maintaining strict matriarchal traditions inherited from their celestial exile. Their psychic abilities make them formidable allies but dangerous to be around, as their mental connections can be exploited by enemies who know their true names.

#### Aspects

- The celestial road changes all travelers
- Shared thoughts, shared burdens

#### Celestial Resonance

**Passive ability.**
You can telepathically communicate with other Einwissel within 1 mile and share rush points with willing Einwissel within 30 feet during combat. When another Einwissel within 30 feet takes damage, you may choose to split the damage between both of you.

However, any creature that learns part of your true name gains advantage on all mental attacks against you, and you automatically fail saves against effects that target your true name.

### Surry (White Dwarves)

The Surry dwarves have adapted to the deepest underground ecosystems where no sunlight ever penetrates, developing translucent skin and a diet consisting entirely of fungi, giant insects, and whatever protein sources wander into their territory—including unwary visitors. Their cannibalistic tendencies stem not from malice but from practical necessity in their resource-scarce environment.

These pale, ethereal-looking dwarves have evolved exceptional sensory abilities to navigate their fungal kingdom, and their alien perspective on nutrition often horrifies surface dwellers. They view all flesh as simply another form of sustenance, making no moral distinction between hunting an animal or taking advantage of a convenient traveler.

#### Aspects

- All flesh feeds the deep
- Hunger knows no moral boundaries

#### Corpse-pale Adaptation

**Passive ability.**
You require no sunlight and can survive on any organic matter, including normally inedible substances like leather, paper, or corpses. You have darkvision to 120 feet and can track by scent like a bloodhound.

When you consume part of a creature that died within the last week, you gain one of their memories from the last day of their life. Civilized creatures typically react with disgust to your dietary habits, imposing disadvantage on social interactions until they become accustomed to your culture.

### Gruynmar

The Gruynmar have taken to the seas in massive iron vessels that serve as floating cities for entire clans. These bronze-skinned, curly-haired dwarves have mastered naval warfare and are the only people who understand the secrets of gunpowder weapons. Their ships are legendary juggernauts that can devastate any naval opposition, making them both feared and respected across all maritime nations.

Clan loyalty runs deeper than blood among the Gruynmar, and abandoning one's ship-family is considered the ultimate betrayal. However, those rare individuals who do leave their floating homes often become exceptional pirates, mercenaries, or adventurers, bringing their unique seafaring skills and firearm expertise to land-based endeavors.

#### Aspects

- The clan-ship is my true home
- Thunder and iron rule the waves

#### Gunpowder Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You can craft and use firearms, which count as heavy ranged weapons with 90-foot range that deal piercing damage. Firearms require gunpowder charges and take a full action to reload after each shot, but they ignore armor bonuses to defense and deal +1d6 damage on successful hits.

You have advantage on all checks related to naval combat, ship handling, and maritime navigation. However, you suffer disadvantage on overland navigation and survival checks until you gain significant land-based experience.

### Fengruk (Forgewardens)

The Fengruk have elevated smithing from mere craft to sacred art, viewing the forge as a metaphor for all of life's transformative processes. Their deep golden skin and extraordinarily thick, bristly beards protect them from the heat of their sacred forges in Gondurak. These serious but fundamentally happy dwarves approach every aspect of existence with the methodical care of a master smith.

Fengruk philosophy teaches that just as raw metal must be heated, hammered, and tempered to become useful, so too must individuals be shaped by hardship and discipline to reach their true potential. Their respect for the forging process extends to all relationships and endeavors, making them patient teachers and steadfast allies.

#### Aspects

- The forge teaches all life's lessons
- Patience and heat create perfection

#### Master of the Forge

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on all crafting checks and can work with magical materials that would normally require special facilities. Your smithing work takes half the normal time, and weapons or armor you create gain +1 to attack or defense bonuses respectively.

Your thick beard provides +1 defense against fire damage and breath weapons that target your face. Once per long rest, you may spend one hour at a forge to grant a willing creature's weapon or armor a temporary magical enhancement that lasts until the next dawn.

### Cendelle (Celestial Draugr)

The Cendelle are perhaps the most mysterious of all dwarven heritages, dwelling in the deepest reaches of the earth where few dare to venture. Known as the Celestial Draugr, they are the sworn guardians of ancient portals that bridge the material plane with Celesté, a realm of ethereal beauty and otherworldly power. These portals, hidden in vast underground chambers beneath Dnykuul, have been watched over by the Cendelle for countless generations.

The discovery of these portals fundamentally changed the Cendelle's society. Where other dwarves found ore and stone in the depths, the Cendelle found doorways to another world. The energies seeping through these portals have subtly altered them over millennia, granting them an uncanny awareness of planar disturbances and the ability to sense otherworldly presences. Their eyes often carry flecks of celestial silver, and their hair tends toward unusual hues of deep blue or violet—marks of their long exposure to Celesté's influence.

Living so deep underground, the Cendelle have developed a culture centered around duty and vigilance. They maintain elaborate rituals and protocols for monitoring the portals, ensuring that nothing passes through without their knowledge. Their settlements are built in concentric rings around the portal chambers, with the most honored families living closest to the thresholds they guard. The Cendelle believe that their role as guardians is a sacred trust, one that supersedes personal ambition or comfort.

Unlike their cousins who fear the dark or seek the sun, the Cendelle have learned to navigate between light and shadow, between the material and the celestial. They are equally comfortable in the absolute darkness of the deep earth and the alien radiance of Celesté. This duality has made them philosophical and contemplative, often speaking in riddles and seeing patterns where others see only stone.

#### Aspects

- Between two worlds, belonging to neither
- The threshold must never be left unguarded

#### Portal Sense

**Heart ability.**

Your long exposure to planar energies has attuned you to disturbances in the fabric of reality. You gain the following benefits:

- You can sense the presence of any portal, gateway, or planar rift within 120 feet, even through solid stone. You know the general direction and approximate distance to such phenomena.
- As an action, you may attune yourself to the planar energies around you for the next minute. While attuned, you can see invisible creatures and objects within 30 feet as faint, shimmering outlines, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects that would transport you to another plane against your will.
- Once per long rest, when you or an ally within 10 feet would be affected by a teleportation effect, planar travel, or dimensional magic, you may use your reaction to either allow it to function normally or attempt to suppress it. If suppressing, the effect's originator must succeed on a saving throw against your cunning challenge number or the effect fails.

When you use any part of this ability, faint celestial runes briefly appear on your skin, glowing with soft silver light.

## Halfling

Blessed by Lady Fortune herself, all halflings are naturally just lucky. Other than their diminutive stature and uncanny fortune, they are remarkably similar to humans—sharing their adaptability, ambition, and capacity for both great kindness and terrible cruelty. What halflings lack in size, they make up for in their ability to find themselves on the right side of fate's coin toss.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3.5-4.5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-90 pounds

### Fortune's Favor

**Major ability.**
Lady Fortune smiles upon you. Once per day, when you or an ally within 30 feet would fail a skill check, saving throw, or attack roll, you may have them succeed instead. The result becomes the exact challenge number or defense roll required.

### Belenstrope

The Belenstrope halflings of Erasnus are renowned as the finest merchants and traders in all the realm. Their sprawling noble families control vast trade networks, with lords and ladies in every major settlement connected through a byzantine web of second cousins, third uncles, and distant relations. With their olive skin, high cheekbones, and piercing intelligent eyes, they cut striking figures in the markets and courts where they ply their trade. Their slender builds and quick minds serve them well in negotiations, where a single misplaced word can mean the difference between profit and ruin.

#### Aspects

- Everything has a price, if you know how to find it
- Family connections open all doors

#### Golden Touch

**Passive ability.**
You have an innate sense for value and profit. You automatically know the approximate worth of any item you handle, and you have advantage on all checks related to trade, negotiation, and detecting forgeries. Additionally, increasing your cunning die costs 2 less XP.

### Fieri

Deep beneath Hell Creek in Chimea, where the ground itself burns with the heat of the plane of fire, dwell the Fieri—the hellborn halflings. Cursed generations ago to live in this infernal realm, they have adapted to their burning prison with bodies that channel earth and flame. Their hatred for the surface world burns as hot as their homeland, and they kill any outsider foolish enough to descend into their domain. Red-skinned with eyes like glowing coals, the Fieri have become as merciless as the environment that shaped them.

#### Aspects

- The surface world abandoned us to burn
- Rage is the only warmth that matters

#### Hellborn

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to fire. The burning condition cannot reduce you below 1 hit point, and you take half damage from all fire sources. Your unarmed attacks deal fire damage and inflict one level of burning on a hit. You cannot venture into areas colder than temperate climate without taking one level of weakened that doesn't fade until you return to warmth.

### Dengar

In the fetid swamps of Phirexes, the Dengar halflings have made their peace with a life others would find unbearable. Ruled by the Gorgon Queen—whom they see as a benevolent protector rather than the tyrant she truly is—they've adapted to swamp life with remarkable optimism. Master brewers and foragers, they've turned the hostile swamp into a home, finding joy in fermented moss wine and mushroom stews. Their pragmatic cheerfulness in the face of constant danger from bog creatures and toxic fumes would be inspiring if it weren't so tragically misguided.

#### Aspects

- Every day you're not eaten is a good day
- The Queen protects us from worse things

#### Swamp Resilience

**Passive ability.**
The swamp has made you hardy. You are immune to all poisons, venoms, and diseases. You can identify edible plants and fungi automatically, and you know how to brew healing poultices from swamp materials (functions as a crude healing kit that replenishes daily). Additionally, you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your might die maximum.

### Wispen

The silver-skinned Wispen halflings are perhaps the strangest of their kind. Nomadic wanderers found throughout Grendenheim, they possess the unique ability to separate their souls from their shadows, animating objects with pieces of their own essence. Their encampments are unnerving places where tents walk on their own, tools work without hands, and furniture rearranges itself. To the Wispen, this is simply life—why carry your home when your home can carry itself?

#### Aspects

- My shadow and I don't always agree
- Everything is more alive than it appears

#### Soul Splinter

**Passive ability.**
You can detach a piece of your shadow to animate a single object no larger than a 5-foot cube. The object gains a move speed of 15 feet and can perform simple tasks. While an object is animated this way, you cast no shadow and have disadvantage on stealth checks in bright light. You can recall your shadow as an action. If the animated object is destroyed, your shadow returns after a long rest.

### Shailin

Yellow-eyed and patient as stone, the Shailin halflings of Sestros await their promised destiny. Every Shailin hears the whispers of Talresses, a daemon who has woven itself into their cultural consciousness so thoroughly that they mistake its voice for divine providence. They perform their daily lives with quiet certainty that they are the chosen people, destined for a greatness that always seems just beyond the horizon. Their squat frames and distinctive golden eyes mark them as blessed—or cursed, depending on one's perspective.

#### Aspects

- Our time will come, as was foretold
- The whispers guide us to our destiny

#### Daemon Whispers

**Passive ability.**
Talresses whispers secrets to you. Once per day, you may ask a yes or no question about the immediate future (next 10 minutes) and receive a truthful answer. However, whenever you roll a 1 on any die, you hear distracting whispers and must subtract 2 from your total roll as the daemon's voice overwhelms your thoughts. You have advantage on saves against being charmed by creatures other than daemons.

### Windorf

The seafaring Windorf halflings embody the best of halfling nature—kind, thoughtful, and possessed of a quiet courage that puts larger folk to shame. Making their homes in the coastal regions of Windor, they've taken to the sea with the same cheerful determination they bring to all endeavors. Their ships are marvels of halfling engineering, built low and sturdy to weather any storm. In the tradition of their ancient homeland, they value good food, comfortable homes, and the simple pleasure of helping a neighbor in need.

#### Aspects

- A good deed is its own reward
- The sea calls, but home calls louder

#### Stouthearted

**Passive ability.**
Your courage is legendary among halflings. You are immune to the frightened condition and have advantage on all saves against fear effects. When an ally within 30 feet would gain the frightened condition, you may use your reaction to shout encouragement, granting them advantage on their save. Additionally, you have a swim speed of 20 feet and can hold your breath for twice as long as normal.

### Whiteling

When a halfling dies with unfinished business or in a state of extreme emotional turmoil, they sometimes rise as a Whiteling—a corpse vampire that haunts their former communities. These undead halflings retain their memories but lose all empathy, becoming predators that hunt those they once loved. The transformation is tied to something deep in halfling biology and culture, though scholars debate whether it's Fortune's final curse or simply the price of their legendary luck.

#### Aspects

- I remember loving you, but feel nothing now
- The hunger is all that remains

#### Undead Fortune

**Passive ability.**
You are undead. You don't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. You are immune to poison and disease. Healing magic harms you (take damage instead of healing), but you can spend hit dice to heal during a short rest by consuming flesh. You have disadvantage on all social rolls with living creatures who know what you are. Fortune's Favor works differently for you—when you use it, the target fails critically instead of succeeding.

### Hookling

In the frozen wastes of Morelous, the Hookling halflings have adapted to an environment that would kill most others. Their gray-blue skin provides natural camouflage against the ice, while their characteristic hooked noses help warm the frigid air before it reaches their lungs. Severe and humorless by necessity, they've built a culture where waste is the greatest sin and frivolity is viewed as a dangerous weakness. Every calorie counts when winter never ends, and the Hooklings have learned that survival requires absolute discipline.

#### Aspects

- Waste nothing, want nothing
- Laughter is a luxury we cannot afford

#### Winter's Child

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to the effects of cold weather and take half damage from cold sources. You can survive on half the normal food and water requirements. You have advantage on survival checks in arctic environments and can naturally sense approaching blizzards 1 hour before they arrive. However, you have disadvantage on all rolls when in temperatures above comfortable, as the heat saps your strength.

## Gnome

Gnomes are small, naturally magical creatures, resembling miniature humans. They range in height from two to three feet, and are frequently quite slender and nimble. Gnomish adventurers are generally more magically adept than hearty, and will often have entire sleeves of handmagic tattoos stretching up their arms.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

### Gnomish Blood

**Passive ability.**
Handmagic talents and their destiny levels cost 2 less XP, and increasing your maximum hit point costs 1 more XP. Your size is small.

### Goshwen (Hill Gnome)

If there is one thing that can be said about Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get into trouble all the time—but they are definitely clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves, merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons. While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and competent.

Goshwen's culture of openness and constant change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of their communities. This has given rise to many different branches of Goshwen communities across Alaria with different quirks and identities. However, all of them maintain their appreciation for progress and wit.

#### Aspects

- Creative
- Let's just see what happens!

#### Clever

**Passive ability.**
You gain the talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with it's destiny level.

### Ezuri (Tree Gnome)

The Ezuri, or "tree people" as it translates to from Old Gnomish, stemmed from when Mad Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the forest dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters. While many fled the jungle, some were trapped, and forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty places.

The Ezuri also value connection with each other as well as the natural world around them, and are taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a young age. This, combined with their natural affinity for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger humanoids across Alaria.

#### Aspects

- Insightful
- Compassionate

#### Speaker for the Small

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Nature's Child talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level.

### Foxborne (Noble Gnome)

The Foxborne are a gallant and noble breed of gnomes who dwell in the picturesque Cherry Blossom Valley. These refined gnomes have formed deep bonds with foxes, riding them as mounts and treating them as honored companions rather than mere beasts. Their society is built around chivalric ideals and courtly traditions, making them perhaps the most aristocratic of all gnomish communities.

The Foxborne value honor, loyalty, and grace above all else. Their cherry blossom-adorned settlements are marvels of elegant architecture, and their mounted cavalry units are both beautiful and formidable in combat.

#### Aspects

- Noble bearing
- Honor before all

#### Vulpine Bond

**Passive ability.**
You gain a fox as a loyal mount and companion. The fox has the stats of a Beast Companion with d6/d6/d4/d4 abilities, 25 hit points, and a d8 heart die. It can carry you without penalty and has a move speed of 50 feet. If your fox dies, you can bond with a new one after a week of mourning.

### Bloodlings (Vampire Gnome)

The Bloodlings are pale, translucent-skinned gnomes who dwell in the dark caves of the Chimean Blood Mountains. These vampiric gnomes have adapted to a life sustained by blood rather than traditional sustenance, developing an eerie, ghostly appearance that reflects their unnatural dietary needs.

Living in complete darkness for generations, the Bloodlings have become masters of stealth and ambush. Their society is built around blood hierarchies, where status is determined by the quality and rarity of blood one can obtain.

#### Aspects

- Predator of the darkness
- Blood is life

#### Sanguine Sustenance

**Passive ability.**
You do not need to eat normal food, but must consume blood equivalent to one ration per week or gain a level of weakened that does not fade until you feed. You have darkvision out to 60 feet and gain +2 to stealth checks in darkness. You take double damage from bright light sources.

### Neka (Savage Gnome)

The Neka are dark-skinned, feather-adorned gnomes who rule as apex predators in the Nekanzi Jungle. With filed teeth and wild hair, they live in mud and palm huts while maintaining a culture that seems primitive to outsiders but is actually highly sophisticated in its own way. They consume raw animals and have been known to eat intruders, though they maintain complex customs around peace talks and greetings.

Despite their seemingly poor material culture, the Neka create fantastic tombs and have mastered fire magic for hunting and combat. They can imitate any animal sound and have no written language, passing knowledge through oral tradition.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator
- Fire and fang

#### Primal Mimic

**Passive ability.**
You can perfectly imitate any animal sound you have heard. You have a basic attunement to fire. You gain +2 to intimidation checks against creatures that have seen you eat raw meat, and your bite counts as an ultralight weapon.

### Ohblex (Gem Gnome)

The Ohblex are crystalline gnomes born from the gems and jewels deep within the Gemstone Peaks. Their skin reflects the colors of precious stones, and they sustain themselves by consuming a few gems each year rather than traditional food. Masters of clockwork and the sole keepers of clockmaking secrets on Nin, they craft incredible mechanical devices and jewelry.

The Ohblex live in elaborate underground mazes filled with mechanical traps, endlessly scheming against rival family houses in complex political games. They value secrecy, mystery, and complication above all else.

#### Aspects

- Lover of mysteries
- Gemstone heritage

#### Clockwork Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You do not need to eat normal food, instead consuming gems worth 10 ducats per month. You have advantage on checks to create, understand, or disable mechanical devices. You know the secrets of clockmaking and can craft complex mechanical items that others cannot replicate.

### Shyoka Saseidi (Beast Tender Gnome)

The Shyoka Saseidi are light-skinned, curly-haired gnomes who dwell in dens beneath the great pine trees of Nykotheryx Amberylika. While their Luma neighbors tend the trees, these gnomes serve as caretakers for all forest fauna. They maintain close relationships with badgers, squirrels, rabbits, and foxes, often wearing badger pelts as marks of respect.

Their society revolves around the sacred but dangerous dragon totems scattered throughout their forest, with only specially chosen priests permitted to approach these powerful artifacts.

#### Aspects

- Guardian of the wild
- Reverent of ancient powers

#### Forest Kinship

**Passive ability.**
You gain advantage on all skill checks involving small woodland creatures (badgers, squirrels, rabbits, foxes). You can communicate basic concepts with these animals and they will not attack you unless magically compelled. You have advantage on checks to track or navigate in forested terrain.

### Techgnomes (Lost Gnome)

The Techgnomes were once the most technologically advanced gnomes on Alaria, creators of incredible mechanical wonders including the mighty mechwurm. However, their greatest creation turned against them, and their civilization was virtually destroyed. Now essentially extinct, the few remaining Techgnomes wander as living relics of a lost age.

These surviving gnomes carry with them fragments of forgotten knowledge and broken mechanical devices, serving as both a warning about unchecked ambition and a repository of lost technological secrets.

#### Aspects

- Last of a lost age
- Technology's double edge

#### Mechanical Remnant

**Passive ability.**
You begin play with a damaged but functional mechanical device of your choice (subject to GM approval). You have advantage on checks to understand, repair, or operate technological devices. Once per day, you can jury-rig a simple mechanical solution to a problem using scrap materials.

### Qipi (Sinkhole Gnome)

The Qipi are the smallest of all gnome heritages, dwelling in the vast sinkhole cities of Tyberoskos. Generations of underground living have transformed these gnomes—their wrinkled green skin helps them blend with the mossy cavern walls, while their oversized eyes pierce through the perpetual twilight of their subterranean homes. Sharp, needle-like teeth have evolved to efficiently strip meat from the blind cave fish that populate their underground pools. Despite their somewhat fearsome appearance, the Qipi have developed a sophisticated culture centered around acoustic communication and echolocation, using complex clicking languages that echo through their vertical cities. They've mastered the art of fishing in complete darkness and have developed unique architectural techniques for building into sinkhole walls.

#### Aspects

- Vigilant
- Patient as stone

#### Eyes of the Deep

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Observant talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 30 feet and can see normally in dim light.

### Shyoka Saseidi (Fauna Keeper Gnome)

The Shyoka Saseidi of Nykotheryx Amberylika have long served as the forest's animal caretakers, complementing the Luma's role as tree-tenders. These pale-skinned, curly-haired gnomes build elaborate den networks beneath the protective boughs of ancient pines, creating comfortable homes that mirror the burrows of their beloved badgers. Their society revolves around the sacred dragon totems scattered throughout the forest—powerful artifacts they both revere and fear. Only specially trained priests, marked by ceremonial badger pelts, dare approach these totems to tend the creatures dwelling in their mystical auras. The Shyoka Saseidi have formed deep bonds with the forest's smaller creatures, particularly badgers, squirrels, rabbits, and foxes, learning their languages and sharing their lives. This connection runs so deep that many Shyoka Saseidi consider their animal companions to be family members rather than pets.

#### Aspects

- Protective
- Spiritually attuned

#### Totem-Blessed Bond

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Beast Companion talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. Your beast companion must be a badger, squirrel, rabbit, or fox. Additionally, you have advantage on all skill checks related to understanding or caring for forest animals.

### Whiteling (Prophet Gnome)

The Whitelings are perhaps the most mysterious and tragic of all gnome heritages. Their alabaster skin stretches taut over gaunt frames, giving them an ethereal, almost translucent appearance. These gnomes are blessed—or cursed—with the ability to perceive the threads of fate itself, their minds constantly awash with visions of possible futures. This gift comes at a terrible price: their bodies are frail as parchment, and their reproductive cycles occur perhaps once in a century. When Whitelings do mate, it is through elaborate rituals that can last days, treated with the solemnity of a religious sacrament. The resulting children, so rare and precious, are raised not by their parents but by specialized caretakers known as the Tuk-tuk—elderly Whitelings who have mastered the art of nurturing young prophets without overwhelming their developing minds.

Their extreme rarity and prophetic abilities make Whitelings objects of obsession throughout the world. Some cultures worship them as living oracles, building temples around solitary Whitelings and interpreting their every utterance. Others see them as tools to be captured and exploited, keeping them in gilded cages to divine military strategies or market trends. A free Whiteling is always in danger, for their very existence is both a blessing and a commodity. Most learn to speak in riddles and half-truths, not from duplicity but from self-preservation—for a prophecy too clearly spoken is a prophecy that invites intervention.

#### Aspects

- Fragile as glass
- Burdened by knowledge

#### Oracle's Burden

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Oracle talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. However, your connection to the threads of fate has left your body withered: your maximum hit points start at 25 instead of 40, and increasing your maximum hit points costs 1 additional XP (stacking with the gnomish penalty for 2 total). Additionally, your might die can never be increased above a d6.

## Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all raised together, with no knowledge of their specific mother. The brood-father, over the course of his lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen, who will mother the next brood-father—the first born son.

Most goblins live in communities around a single goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and friends are one's half-siblings. This can lead to bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict. Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

### Cooperative

**Passive ability.**
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or take the help action in combat, you provide two levels of advantage rather than one, and they may add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin, they gain three levels of advantage instead.

### Scalawag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature. They are viewed more as pests than as people by many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat similar to that of ants. However; living among Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are born into enormous broods, and are expected to defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will spend most of their lives doing just that, along with anything else they feel like doing. Besides the general wellbeing of the community, though, scalawags have few other obligations, and will sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.

Scalawag can be found across the mountains and scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are known for their incredible performers, parties, and oddly enough, philosophers.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally turbulent
- Impulsive and improvisational

#### Ankle biter

**Passive ability.**
Rules for moving through and climbing on creatures larger than yourself apply even if the creature is only one size larger than you. You have advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same space as a hostile creatures provides one level of cover from attacks from all other creatures.

### Etherweaver

Etherweavers get their name for their longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every goblin is born with an attunement to one of those elements.

Etherweavers are generally more reserved and cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value preparation, and are usually more conscientious, even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at protecting their broods using magic, and therefore require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a greater sense of individuality among the etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.

The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.

#### Aspects

- Level-headed
- Reflective and thoughtful

#### Etherweaver

**Passive ability.**
Choose and gain two attunements from the following list:

- Time
- Void
- Force
- Light
- Dark

### Coghead

The Cogheads are ingenious goblins who have embraced the marriage of flesh and machinery. Living within a massive hollowed-out machine in Kobuk, they have spent generations perfecting the art of mechanical augmentation, replacing or enhancing their natural body parts with intricate contraptions and gear-driven devices.

These goblins harbor a particular hatred for the Echean gnomes, viewing them as inferior tinkerers who lack the courage to truly commit to their craft. Where gnomes merely build external devices, Cogheads integrate machinery directly into their bodies, becoming living testaments to their engineering prowess.

#### Aspects

- Flesh is weakness, gears are strength
- Gnomes are inferior tinkerers

#### Tinkerer

**Passive ability.**
Through tinkering and contraption building, you have found a way to improve on your body's natural features. Choose one of the following modifications:

- **Spectacles:** Multi-lens glasses with infrared vision (90 feet), light inversion, and telescopic capabilities (10x magnification).
- **Rocket Boots:** Aether-powered boots that increase move speed by 10 feet and allow jumping 10 feet with 50-foot glide speed.
- **Multi-tool:** Replaced arm containing circular saw, knives, pliers, wrenches, torch, and lock picks. Grants advantage on tool-related skill checks.

You may spend 4 XP to gain additional modifications from this list.

### Darkling

The Darklings are pitch-black goblins who dwell in the shadowy realm of Lethos, their skin so dark it seems to absorb light itself. These unsettling creatures have adapted to perpetual darkness, subsisting on a diet of rodents and bats while developing an unnatural mastery over shadow itself.

Unlike other goblins, Darklings are genuinely frightening, their darkness attunement creating impenetrable shadows that only they can see through. They move like living nightmares through their underground lairs, and those who encounter them in the dark rarely live to tell the tale.

#### Aspects

- Child of eternal darkness
- Predator in the shadows

#### Umbral Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to darkness. Darkness you create cannot be seen through by any creature except other Darklings, and cannot be dispelled except by magical light. You have darkvision out to 120 feet and can see perfectly in any darkness, magical or natural.

### Rudding

The Ruddings are small, mysterious goblins with beady red eyes who inhabit the otherworldly copper and brick temples of the Copper Hills. These enigmatic creatures are driven by an unrelenting sense of justice and vengeance, carefully tracking every slight and wrong committed against them or their kin.

Despite their vengeful nature, Ruddings are remarkably skilled Deoric enchanters who have domesticated the massive Desert Mammoths. They will pursue slow, methodical revenge against wrongdoers unless proper reparations are offered in the form of copper or copper jewelry, which they prize above all else.

#### Aspects

- Vengeance delayed is vengeance perfected
- Copper is the currency of justice

#### Blood Debt

**Passive ability.**
When a creature deals damage to you or wrongs you in a significant way, you may mark them for vengeance. You always know the general direction and distance to marked creatures within 10 miles. You have advantage on all attack rolls and skill checks made against marked creatures. You may remove this mark if they provide reparations worth at least 100 ducats in copper.

### Red Devil

The Red Devils are the most malevolent of all goblin subraces, small creatures with burning red eyes and hearts full of genuine evil. Like their Rudding cousins, they inhabit the Copper Hills, but where Ruddings pursue calculated vengeance, Red Devils simply revel in causing pain and suffering for its own sake.

These goblins take pleasure in tormenting others and have no sense of honor or justice. They are cruel, sadistic, and utterly without mercy, making them feared throughout the region as harbingers of misfortune and malice.

#### Aspects

- Cruelty is its own reward
- Evil runs in my veins

#### Sadistic Glee

**Passive ability.**
Whenever you deal damage to a creature or cause a creature to gain a negative condition, you regain 1 hit point. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain 1 rush point at the start of the next round. You have advantage on intimidation checks against creatures that have witnessed your cruelty.

### Blitzling

The Blitzlings possess the strange and dangerous property of accumulating massive amounts of static electricity in their bodies before discharging it all at once in devastating electrical bursts. These energetic goblins inhabit the chain of hills south of the Dunes of Kunagi, in the settlement of Shyalaviin.

Their unique physiology makes them both fascinating and hazardous to be around, as they constantly crackle with barely contained electrical energy. When threatened or excited, they can release this stored power in spectacular and deadly displays.

#### Aspects

- Living lightning rod
- Electricity courses through me

#### Static Discharge

**Passive ability.**
You accumulate static charge throughout combat. At the start of each round, gain 1 charge point (maximum 5). As an action, you may discharge all stored charge, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per charge point to all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures wearing metal armor take double damage. You take half the total damage dealt.

### Mudzwiti

The Mudzwiti are tribal goblins who dwell in the dense Lyoki Ingi Ingi jungle, their bodies adorned with elaborate bone piercings and ritualistic scarification. These fierce warriors have formed a symbiotic relationship with the utahraptors that roam their jungle home, riding them into battle while wearing the skulls of fallen dinosaurs as helmets.

Their culture revolves around death and legacy, constructing incredibly elaborate tombs for their deceased leaders, complete with buried servants and accumulated riches. Their kings consume rare jungle plants that extend their lifespans dramatically, allowing them to accumulate vast wealth over centuries.

#### Aspects

- Dinosaur rider of the deep jungle
- Death builds the greatest monuments

#### Raptor Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have formed a bond with a utahraptor companion. The raptor has the stats of a riding horse but with a climb speed of 20 feet and the ability to make claw attacks (1d8 damage). If your raptor dies, you may spend a week in the jungle to bond with a new one. You have advantage on all checks related to dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures.

### Spine Goblin

The Spine Goblins are perhaps the most disturbing of all goblin subraces, afflicted with a leprosy-like disease that causes their bones to pierce through their skin. Their spinal columns protrude grotesquely from their backs, and rather than hide this deformity, they have embraced it by binding nails, spikes, and other sharp implements to their exposed bones.

These crude and malevolent creatures represent the darkest aspects of goblin nature, using their horrifying appearance and weaponized deformities to terrorize their enemies. They are among the most feared and reviled of all goblins, and for good reason.

#### Aspects

- My deformity is my weapon
- Pain has made me stronger

#### Bone Spikes

**Passive ability.**
Your exposed bones are fitted with sharp metal implements. Whenever a creature grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack, they take 1d4 piercing damage. You may use your bone spikes as ultralight piercing weapons. When you take damage, you may spend 1 rush point to cause the attacker to take 1d6 piercing damage if they are within 5 feet.

### Wydling

Wydlings, also known as icelings, are the frost-touched cousins of the goblin family tree. Born in the frozen wastes and glacial caverns of the far north, these pale blue goblins have adapted to survive in the harshest cold. Unlike their more communal relatives, Wydling broods are smaller and more nomadic, following the seasonal migrations of their prey across the tundra. Their razor-sharp icicle teeth have evolved to strip frozen meat from bones and crack through ice to reach fish below.

Wydling society values patience and cunning over the impulsiveness of their southern kin. They are master hunters and trackers, capable of waiting motionless in snowdrifts for hours before striking. Their long noses serve a practical purpose—warming frigid air before it reaches their lungs and detecting the faintest scents carried on arctic winds. While other goblins might gather in hundreds, Wydlings move in small hunting packs of extended family, each member knowing their role in the hunt.

Those Wydlings who venture south often find work as guides through mountain passes, ice sculptors, or surprisingly effective fishmongers—their natural affinity for cold keeping goods fresh far longer than normal.

#### Aspects

- Patient predator
- Cold pragmatism over warm emotions

#### Frostbite

**Passive ability.**  
Your icy heritage grants you several adaptations. You are immune to the effects of freezing temperatures and take half damage from cold-based attacks. Your razor-sharp teeth count as ultralight piercing weapons. Additionally, when you bite a creature you are grappling or that is restrained, they take 1d6 damage and gain one level of slowed as numbing cold spreads from your icy fangs.

## Minotaur

Minotaur are mighty, formidable creatures, known for their powerful builds and no-nonsense nature. Although most grow up in minotaur-dominated communities, they have spread out across Alaria, and can be found in great numbers in many large armies.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7.5 feet
- **Weight:** 200-350 pounds

### Minotaur Horns

**Passive ability.**
The horns on your head count as a heavy piercing melee weapon so long as you move at least 15 feet in a straight-line towards an enemy before immediately attacking. You get one level of advantage on your attacks made with your horns for every 15 feet you charged before you attack. This stacks up three times.

### Danaki

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as the baby minotaur children are raised by the village. Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they interested in finding out. From a young age, they are taught to fight and kill, usually long before they learn how to read and write.

Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk state of anger and pure, single-minded aggression. During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring many injuries.

Danaki are trained from a young age to express very little emotion, and suppress it if possible. Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not felt those things since they were a child. Marriages in Danaki villages are arranged by the village council once each member in the union has been deemed "stable". Most Danaki view their marriage as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing that you have completed your growth. The marriages are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.

Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to one another, they admit it only in confidence, and believe themselves capable of making decisions completely unaffected by that attachment.

#### Aspects

- Show no weakness
- Obstinately bullheaded

#### Berserk

**Major ability. Instant.**
It is said that the Danaki rage is the physical release of all the pent up emotions held within them. Whether this is true is up to you.

Whenever you take damage, you may enter a berserk state. While berserk, your movement speed increases by 20, and increase every instance of incoming and outgoing physical damage by 2. You remain berserk so long as you make an A/D roll or enter an engagement each round, up to a minute.

### Lorean Minotaur

While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the commanding general for a king's army. In describing the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most famously quoted that "Lorean think with their head, not with their horns". Of course, if you ask their spouses, they will say that they "think with their head, not with their hearts". This is the cursed blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded, but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems in any other way.

Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on education and sound decision making. To make a mistake because emotions clouded one's judgement is worthy of profound shame. It's not that Lorean don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them influence one's decision at all is weakness and failure, especially when other people's wellbeing is at stake.

This sense of duty towards protection lies as deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been placed in charge of his troop will die before letting his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the ultimate failure as a minotaur—worthy of self-exile. Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to such high standards, including other minotaur, every Lorean would never give such leniency to themselves.

#### Aspects

- Profoundly caring
- Emotions get in the way of logical thinking

#### Tactical Supremacy

**Passive ability.**
You may take an additional help action each round. When you take the help action, you may instead choose a willing creature within 30 feet and move it 5 feet in any direction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

Based on the existing minotaur subraces and the provided overview, here's the Rentar subrace:

### Rentar

The Rentar of Chechol represent a stark contrast to their more warlike cousins. Where Danaki suppress emotion and Lorean prioritize logic, the Rentar have found peace through spiritual devotion. Their reddish-tinged skin and elegant, curved horns reflect their more contemplative nature, as they spend their days in meditation, prayer, and scholarly pursuits of divine knowledge.

Rentar society is built around a complex theological framework that emphasizes personal spiritual growth, communal harmony, and the pursuit of divine wisdom. They believe deeply in the guidance of higher powers, interpreting signs and receiving what they consider divine inspiration through dreams and meditation. This spiritual confidence gives them an unshakeable sense of purpose and fierce pride in their autonomy—they would be deeply offended by any suggestion that their choices are not entirely their own.

What the Rentar do not realize is that their "divine guidance" has been corrupted. The lich Gynor the Conqueror has spent decades subtly influencing their spiritual practices, weaving his will into their religious experiences. Through careful manipulation of their dreams and visions, he has positioned himself to transform their peaceful community into his Red Army when the time is right. The Rentar's very strength—their unwavering faith and spiritual certainty—has become the mechanism of their enslavement, though they remain blissfully unaware of this dark truth.

#### Aspects

- My faith guides every decision
- Fiercely proud of my independence

#### Divine Communion

**Major ability.**
Through deep meditation and prayer, you commune with what you believe are divine forces for guidance in difficult situations. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes in spiritual communion to ask a single yes-or-no question about a course of action you are considering. The GM must answer truthfully, though the source of this "divine" knowledge may not be what you believe it to be.

Additionally, whenever you would make a saving throw against being charmed, confused, or frightened, you may choose to automatically succeed, drawing strength from your spiritual conviction.

Looking at the elf format and the orc information provided, here's the base orc race and all subraces:

## Orc

Orcs are a diverse and hardy race known for their physical prowess, tribal cultures, and fierce independence. Found across many different environments on Alaria, orcs have adapted to thrive in conditions that would challenge most other races. Their societies are typically clan-based, with strong traditions of warfare, survival, and loyalty to their chosen family groups.

While often misunderstood by other races as purely savage, orcish cultures are rich with tradition, spiritual practices, and complex social structures. Their natural resilience and strength have allowed them to carve out territories in some of the most hostile environments on Alaria.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-7 feet
- **Weight:** 160-280 pounds

### Orcish Resilience

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on saving throws against poisons and diseases. When you take a wound, you may immediately make a might saving throw against a CN equal to the wound's rank. On a success, reduce the wound's rank by 2.

### Hedroscobbi (Black Orc)

The Hedroscobbi are master smiths who have learned to forge iron combined with corrosive algae from rivers and swamps to create incredibly heavy armor. This armor is so abrasive that only their naturally tough skin can withstand wearing it. Their mastery of this unique metallurgy makes them nearly impervious to conventional weapons.

The Hedroscobbi's dark skin has adapted over generations to resist the corrosive properties of their algae-iron alloys. They are often found in the contested swamplands, where they fight alongside and against other orc clans for territory and resources.

#### Aspects

- Master of algae-iron smithing
- Skin like leather armor

#### Corrosive Armor Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You can wear specially crafted algae-iron armor that provides +8 defense instead of the normal +6 for heavy armor, but weighs twice as much. When a creature hits you with a melee weapon while you wear this armor, their weapon takes a -1 penalty to future attack rolls (cumulative). You are immune to acid damage.

### Glivornaxi (Gray Orc)

The Glivornaxi have dark eyes and muddy green skin, living in harmony with the natural world around the Grand Tolkarsus as it passes through the Plenjorn Swamp. This mystical swamp has regenerative properties that heal those who bathe in its waters, and the Glivornaxi have become its guardians.

They are skilled spear-fighters, using their weapons primarily as defense against the Shazuihni boar riders who frequently raid their territory. Their connection to nature runs deep, and they understand the swamp's moods and secrets better than any outsider ever could.

#### Aspects

- Guardian of the healing swamp
- One with the wetlands

#### Swamp Regeneration

**Passive ability.**
While in a swamp or marshland environment, you regain 1 hit point at the start of each round. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes bathing in swamp water to reduce all wound ranks by 1. You ignore difficult terrain in swamps and marshes.

### Tarni (Darkeyes)

The Tarni are orcs strong not just in body, but in spirit. They are virtually unkillable through conventional means, as they have learned to fortify their very souls against destruction. Their warriors wield special spirit weapons that can attack the essence of their enemies directly, bypassing physical defenses entirely.

These orcs have developed a unique understanding of the connection between spirit and flesh, making them formidable opponents who can fight on multiple planes of existence simultaneously.

#### Aspects

- Unbreakable spirit
- Warrior of two realms

#### Spirit Warrior

**Passive ability.**
When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, roll your heart die. On a result of 6 or higher, you remain at 1 hit point instead. Your weapons can be enchanted to deal spirit damage that ignores armor and shield bonuses to defense.

### Uihonaii (Wooden Men)

The Uihonaii have an extraordinary bond with trees—their bloodline is literally tied to the forest. When they die, they become trees, and when the time is right, they are reborn from their wooden forms. These walking forests possess bark-like skin when in their tree form and can live for centuries, accumulating vast wisdom.

However, they can only take root and transform in special soil, requiring them to always return to their homeland. Weapons crafted from their sacred wood are incredibly powerful, often becoming sentient artifacts.

#### Aspects

- Born from sacred groves
- Wisdom of centuries

#### Tree-Soul Bond

**Major ability.**
You may spend 1 hour to transform into a tree. While in tree form, you are immobile but gain +10 defense, immunity to most damage types, and can sense everything within 100 feet. You may remain in this form indefinitely but can only transform in soil from your homeland. If you die, you may choose to become a tree permanently, allowing for potential future rebirth.

### Shazuihni (Boar Rider)

The Shazuihni are hairy, ogre-like orcs with limited intelligence but incredible ferocity. They ride massive giant boars into battle, wielding enormous axes that can cleave through multiple enemies. Their brutal simplicity makes them unpredictable and extremely dangerous in combat.

These orcs live for the thrill of battle and the bond with their boar mounts. Their society is based on strength and the ability to control their savage beasts.

#### Aspects

- Savage boar rider
- Simple but deadly

#### Boar Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have a giant boar companion with 60 hit points, d8 might and agility, and a gore attack that deals 2d8 damage. While mounted, you and your boar move as one unit, and you may use heavy weapons with one hand. If your boar dies, you may bond with a new one after 1 week.

### Griebi (Lakemen)

The Griebi are blueish-gray skinned orcs who can breathe underwater and rarely speak above the surface. They hunt and fish in the depths of lakes and rivers, using their terrifyingly long, needle-like teeth to catch prey underwater. Their society is ruled by a mysterious hag queen who dwells in the deepest waters.

These silent orcs are perfectly adapted for aquatic life, making them formidable opponents both above and below the water's surface.

#### Aspects

- Silent hunter of the depths
- Servant of the hag queen

#### Aquatic Predator

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe underwater and have a swim speed of 40 feet. Your bite is a natural weapon that deals 1d8 piercing damage. You have advantage on stealth checks while underwater and can see clearly in murky water. You suffer no penalties for fighting underwater.

### Tytheri (Blood Orc)

The Tytheri are musclebound orcs with totally white skin and razor-sharp teeth, capable of smelling blood from miles away. Within their society, Tythmasters—orcs fed a diet rich in magical blood—grow to enormous size, reaching 10 feet in height as they become the leaders of their people.

These orcs are constantly at war with the Kadroka, and their entire culture revolves around blood, combat, and the pursuit of ever-greater physical power.

#### Aspects

- Hunter who smells blood on the wind
- Devoted to the crimson path

#### Blood Scent

**Passive ability.**
You can smell blood within 1 mile and track wounded creatures with perfect accuracy. When you deal damage to a bleeding creature (one that has taken a wound), add your heart die to the damage roll. If you consume magical blood, gain +2 to all physical ability checks for 24 hours.

### Xi'ivrach (Divine Orc)

The Xi'ivrach are deeply religious orcs who live in Jeh Bli, adorning themselves with heavy stone jewelry and clothing. They must be incredibly strong to bear the weight of their sacred stone garments. Their bodies are covered in ritual scarification, and their high priests are masters of Deoric magic.

Their entire culture is built around religious devotion and the pursuit of divine favor through physical and spiritual trials.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred stone
- Marked by divine ritual

#### Stone-Bearer's Strength

**Passive ability.**
You count as one size larger for carrying capacity and can wear stone armor that provides +8 defense but reduces your speed by 20 feet. Ritual scars covering your body grant you +1 to all presence checks when interacting with religious individuals. You may learn Deoric spells regardless of other prerequisites.

### Thrygun (Wild Orc)

The Thrygun are blue-skinned, red-haired orcs with prominent tusks who dwell in the White Hills. They represent the most primal and untamed aspects of orcish nature, living in small tribes and following ancient traditions that predate most civilizations.

Their wild nature makes them unpredictable allies and dangerous enemies, as they follow instinct and tribal law above all else.

#### Aspects

- Child of the wild hills
- Untamed and free

#### Primal Instincts

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on survival checks in wilderness environments. When you roll initiative, if you roll your maximum heart die result, you may immediately move up to your speed and make one attack. You have resistance to cold damage.

### Bloodreavers

The Bloodreavers inhabit Bloodwood and practice the ancient art of blood tattooing, using blood treated with preservative tree sap to mark their skin. All their clothing, armor, and weapons are stained with blood—not from cruelty, but from deep respect, as they believe blood imbues items with the aspects of its source.

Despite their terrifying appearance, they are actually protective and loyal, though generally quiet and reserved. They are frequently misunderstood by other races who see only the blood and miss the honor beneath.

#### Aspects

- Marked by honored blood
- Silent guardian of family

#### Blood Bond Ritual

**Passive ability.**
You may spend 1 hour treating a weapon or piece of armor with blood (yours or a willing donor's) to grant it a +1 bonus to attack rolls or defense for 1 week. If you use the blood of a defeated enemy you respected, the bonus increases to +2. You have advantage on checks to track creatures whose blood you have tasted.

### Enti

The Enti are brutal slave traders from the north, constantly at war with the Danaki minotaurs. They are huge, aggressive orcs who wear furs and gold as symbols of their wealth and conquests. Their no-nonsense approach to conflict has made them both feared and wealthy through their harsh trade practices.

These orcs believe that might makes right and that the strong have every right to profit from the weakness of others.

#### Aspects

- Trader in chains and gold
- Northern raider

#### Slaver's Dominance

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on intimidation checks against creatures smaller than you. When you successfully grapple a creature, they gain an additional level of restrained. You gain +2 to all checks related to capturing, restraining, or controlling other creatures.

### Xi'ivrach (Stone Bearers)

The Xi'ivrach are deeply religious orcs who have built their entire culture around devotion to their stone gods. Living in the sacred lands of Jeh Bli, they wear elaborate stone jewelry and garments as acts of worship, their bodies strengthened over generations to bear these tremendous weights. Their skin is marked with intricate ritual scarification that tells the stories of their faith and accomplishments.

Their priests are among the few mortals who have mastered fragments of Deoric, the language of truth, using it to channel divine power through their scarred flesh. The Xi'ivrach believe that the weight of stone brings them closer to their gods, and that each scar is a prayer written in flesh.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred stones
- Scarred vessel of divine truth

#### Stone Bearer's Strength

**Passive ability.**
Your body has adapted to bearing tremendous weight as an act of worship. You treat your might die as one size larger for determining encumbrance, and armor penalties to movement are reduced by 5 feet (minimum 0). When wearing stone ornaments or jewelry worth at least 100 ducats, you gain +1 to all presence checks when dealing with religious matters. If you have ritual scarification covering at least half your body, you may use your might die instead of your presence die when making religious or intimidation checks, as your devotion is written in your flesh.

## Lizardfolk

The Lizardfolk are an ancient people who walked Alaria long before the rise of the younger races. Their societies evolved in isolation, developing along four distinct paths shaped by the harsh environments they call home. While outsiders often dismiss them as primitive savages, the Lizardfolk possess complex social structures and deep cultural traditions passed down through countless generations.

All Lizardfolk share certain traits: they are cold-blooded, requiring external heat to maintain their energy; they possess scales that provide natural protection; and they view the world through the lens of predator and prey—a perspective that makes them seem alien and cruel to warm-blooded races. Yet this same perspective has allowed them to survive and thrive in some of Alaria's most inhospitable regions.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-7 feet (varies by subrace)
- **Weight:** 120-250 pounds

### Cold-Blooded Metabolism

**Passive ability.**

Your reptilian nature grants you unique advantages and disadvantages. While in warm temperatures (comfortable or hotter), you gain +10 feet to your movement speed and remove one additional level of fading conditions at the start of each round. While in cold temperatures (chilly or colder), your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet and you gain a level of slowed that does not fade until you warm up.

## Ix'Tyrann

The Ix'Tyrann are the most numerous and widespread of the Lizardfolk, dwelling in the swampy regions of Da Trang. Their society is built on strength and brutality, with villages ruled by the strongest chieftains who maintain power through displays of savage might. They are viewed by most civilized races as the embodiment of lizardfolk savagery—a reputation they've earned through centuries of fierce territorial conflicts.

Ix'Tyrann culture values survival above all else. Weakness is not tolerated, and those who cannot contribute to the tribe's strength are cast out or consumed. This harsh philosophy has produced a people who are incredibly resilient but struggle to form alliances with other races. Even those Ix'Tyrann who become adventurers and fight for noble causes are rarely seen as heroes—their methods are simply too brutal for polite society to accept.

Their scales range from muddy brown to dark green, providing natural camouflage in their swampy homes. Battle scars are worn with pride, each one a testament to survival.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds

### Aspects

- Views everything as predator or prey
- Values strength above mercy

### Savage Ferocity

**Passive ability.**

Your brutal fighting style makes you deadlier but also more vulnerable. Whenever you deal damage with an attack, add 2 to the damage dealt. However, whenever you take damage from any source, increase that damage by 2. Additionally, when you would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you may instead choose to reduce them to 1 hit point and inflict one of the following permanent conditions: blinded, deafened, or reduce their movement speed by half.

## Ix'Vasyla

The black-scaled Ix'Vasyla are the assassins and hunters of the Lizardfolk, evolved in the toxic marshlands of Nashua. Sleeker and taller than their Ix'Tyrann cousins, they possess a deadly elegance that belies their lethal nature. Their most feared trait is their venomous bite—even a small nip delivers toxins that cause days of excruciating pain before finally killing the victim.

Trapped in an endless war against the forces of Trømgar and Gorath, the Ix'Vasyla have refined patience into an art form. They strike from shadows, deliver their poisonous bite, then retreat to let their venom do its work. Their society values cunning over raw strength, and their leaders are chosen for their ability to outmaneuver enemies rather than overpower them.

Their distinctive black scales shimmer with an oily iridescence, and their jaws can unhinge like those of serpents, allowing them to swallow prey whole. This has given rise to terrifying tales among their enemies of entire scouts disappearing without a trace.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds

### Aspects

- Patient and calculating
- Takes pleasure in the hunt

### Venomous Bite

**Heart ability.**

Your bite delivers a potent neurotoxin that causes excruciating pain. When you make an unarmed attack against an adjacent creature, you may choose to bite instead. If your attack hits, the target takes normal damage plus 2 levels of poisoned. Additionally, at the start of each of their turns for the next minute, they take 1d4 damage from the lingering venom. A creature can only be affected by one instance of your venom at a time.

## Ix'Lorett

In the temperate forests of M'Svyla, the Ix'Lorett have evolved along a vastly different path from their warlike cousins. These iguana-like Lizardfolk move with deliberate slowness, their wrinkled scales and soft spines giving them an almost ancient appearance. Yet what they lack in speed and aggression, they make up for in wisdom and an incredible regenerative ability.

Ix'Lorett society centers around art, meditation, and the pursuit of inner peace. Their villages in the Crystal Mountains are adorned with intricate gemstone mosaics and painted murals that tell the stories of their people. They are philosophers and artists, spending decades perfecting a single painting or meditating on the nature of existence.

Their regenerative abilities are legendary—lost limbs regrow over months, wounds that would kill other races merely inconvenience them. This has led to a unique perspective on violence and conflict; when you can regrow from almost any injury, the urgency of combat fades. Many Ix'Lorett who become adventurers do so not for glory or wealth, but to see the world's beauty and understand its deeper meanings.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Aspects

- Contemplative and peaceful
- Values beauty and patience

### Regenerative Vitality

**Passive ability.**

Your body possesses remarkable regenerative properties. At the start of each round in combat, if you have taken any wounds, reduce the rank of one wound by 1. During a long rest, reduce the ranks of all your wounds by an additional 2 (3 total). Additionally, if you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows over the course of 2d6 months. You cannot die from bleeding out—if you would die from negative hit points, you instead stabilize at -1 hit point.

## Ix'Meglyakuk

Deep in the Dygon Beastlands, where massive dinosaurs thunder through ancient jungles and every shadow could hide a predator, the Ix'Meglyakuk have evolved to be the ultimate survivors. These Lizardfolk have developed heightened senses and an almost supernatural ability to navigate their dangerous homeland.

Living among creatures that dwarf them in size and strength, the Ix'Meglyakuk have learned that survival requires more than combat prowess—it demands an understanding of the jungle itself. They can read the slightest changes in bird calls, feel vibrations through the earth that warn of approaching titans, and move through the densest undergrowth without disturbing a single leaf.

Their scales shift between green and brown, providing active camouflage, and their eyes can track movement that others would miss. Ix'Meglyakuk who leave the Beastlands often become unparalleled scouts and guides, though they find the "tame" dangers of civilization almost laughably simple compared to their homeland.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 130-190 pounds

### Aspects

- Hyperaware of surroundings
- Respects nature's power

### Beastland Survivor

**Passive ability.**

Your life among titanic predators has honed your survival instincts to a supernatural degree. You have advantage on all perception checks and cannot be surprised. When you take the dodge action or choose the agility stance, you may move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks—this movement represents your instinctive repositioning. Additionally, you can perfectly mimic the sounds of any beast you've heard, and you always know which direction is north.

## Koren

The Koren are a feline people with the grace and power of great cats. Their society is sharply divided between the regal Kor and their wilder Korel cousins, each embodying different aspects of their predatory heritage.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4.5-5.5 feet
- **Weight:** 80-160 pounds

### Natural Predator

**Passive ability.**
Your heritage as hunters runs deep. You have darkvision out to 30 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to track creatures by scent, and you always land on your feet - you take half damage from falls and cannot be knocked prone by falling.

### Kor (Highborn)

The Kor are the ruling class of Koren society, bound by an intricate web of social customs and obligations. To be Kor is to master oneself completely - emotions are private battles never to burden others with. Their society values composure, precision, and adherence to tradition above all else. Breaking social custom means exile, a fate worse than death for most Kor.

Every gesture, word, and glance carries meaning in Kor society. They communicate as much through what is left unsaid as through speech itself, reading volumes in the angle of an ear or the position of a tail. This rigid structure has allowed them to build sophisticated civilizations and maintain order for centuries.

#### Aspects

- Social customs must never be broken
- My feelings are my own burden to bear

#### Claws of Courtesy

**Passive ability.**
Your claws and jaws count as light, melee weapons (slashing and piercing respectively). When you use them while in the agility stance, add 1d4 to your attack rolls.

Additionally, your lifetime of navigating complex social hierarchies grants you one of the following benefits (choose when you select this heritage):

- **Perfect Composure:** You are immune to the shaken condition and have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
- **Social Predator:** When you spend at least 10 minutes observing someone in a social setting, you learn their current attitude toward you and one secret they're trying to hide.

### Korel (Wildborn)

The Korel are what the Kor fear to become - Koren who embrace their feral nature. Whether descended from exiles, born outside Kor society, or simply those who rejected its constraints, the Korel live by instinct rather than etiquette. Where the Kor suppress their predatory nature, the Korel revel in it.

They form loose packs and hunting bands, valuing cunning and strength over propriety. Many work as scouts, thieves, or mercenaries, finding freedom in professions the Kor consider beneath them. Yet despite their reputation as savages, the Korel have their own codes - loyalty to the pack, the thrill of the hunt, and survival above all else.

#### Aspects

- The pack survives together
- I trust my instincts

#### Savage Grace

**Heart ability.**
You can unleash your feral nature in combat. When you do, your claws count as light melee weapons that deal slashing damage. For the next minute:

- Your move speed increases by 20 feet
- You can move through enemy spaces as if they were difficult terrain
- When you deal damage with your claws, the target takes 2 levels of weakened

Additionally, you gain the Nimble talent as a racial ability (it does not count toward the number of talents you have).

## Pixie

Born from the intersection of the material plane and the realm of fae, pixies are diminutive winged beings who exist in a state of heightened emotional and magical awareness. All pixies can hear the underlying Faesong that resonates through reality—a melody imperceptible to most other creatures. This attunement to the emotional and magical currents of the world shapes every aspect of pixie society, from their fierce protectiveness of natural spaces to their complex social hierarchies built on emotional resonance rather than physical might.

Pixies reproduce through a mystical process involving moonlight, flower nectar, and concentrated emotional energy. A new pixie emerges fully formed from a bloom after a gestation of exactly one lunar cycle, inheriting not just physical traits but emotional memories from their progenitors.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Minuscule
- **Height:** 6-10 inches
- **Weight:** 1-3 pounds
- **Wingspan:** 12-18 inches

### Fae-born

**Passive ability.**
You have a fly speed of 30 feet. Additionally, you can sense the emotional state of all creatures within 15 feet, gaining advantage on Presence checks to understand their motivations. Once per day, when a creature within 30 feet makes a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you may grant them advantage on that roll by harmonizing with the Faesong.

### Zelle

The Zelle pixies of the jungle kingdom Zelidia have built a society on justified paranoia and religious fervor. Ruled by a theocratic matriarchy that views all outsiders as either threats or sacrifices to their dark forest gods, they have survived centuries of invasion attempts through a combination of ruthless cunning and blood magic. Their wings are deep crimson and black, resembling tropical butterflies but with patterns that shift to display warning colors when threatened.

Zelle society revolves around their High Priestesses, who commune directly with the jungle spirits through ritual sacrifice. Every Zelle is trained from emergence to be both predator and protector, learning to navigate their xenophobic culture while maintaining the divine wards that keep their realm hidden from larger threats.

#### Aspects

- Paranoid xenophobe
- Devoutly bloodthirsty

#### Blood offering

**Passive ability.**
When a creature within 30 feet of you takes a wound, you may perform a swift ritual as a free action to gain 1d4 temporary hit points that last until your next long rest. Additionally, you have advantage on Intimidation checks against any creature that has seen you participate in violence within the last hour.

### Ianovko

The Ianovko pixies are master illusionists who blur the line between dream and reality. They build their settlements in the spaces between—twilight groves where day meets night, misty valleys where earth meets sky, and most importantly, in the minds of those who encounter them. An Ianovko community might exist simultaneously in the material plane and in the collective unconscious of a nearby village, feeding on dreams and nightmares alike.

Their wings appear to be made of captured starlight and shadow, constantly shifting between translucent and opaque. Ianovko culture prizes clever wordplay and elaborate pranks above all else, with social standing determined by the audacity and artistry of one's illusions.

#### Aspects

- Reality is negotiable
- Riddling trickster

#### Dreamweaver

**Passive ability.**
You can cast minor illusions at will without using an action, creating visual or auditory phenomena no larger than a 1-foot cube that last for up to 1 minute. Additionally, when you successfully deceive, confuse, or misdirect a creature through roleplaying or illusion, you gain a rush point. You can gain rush points this way even outside of combat, storing up to 3 rush points that last until used or until your next long rest.

### Icehearts

Icehearts are pixies transformed by their worship of winter itself—not as a season, but as an cosmic force of entropy and hunger. Their crystalline wings generate a constant aura of frost, and their very presence leeches warmth from their surroundings. This hunger extends beyond the physical; Icehearts feed on emotional warmth, leaving their victims feeling hollow and cold inside.

Despite their predatory nature, Icehearts maintain a twisted form of civilization built on careful rationing of their feeding. They view their hunger as a sacred burden, organizing elaborate rituals to determine who may feed and when, turning survival into a form of worship.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally vampiric
- Winter's devoted child

#### Frostbitten soul

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to damage from cold and the freezing environmental condition. Whenever you deal damage to a creature or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your abilities, you may inflict one level of slowed as frost spreads from your touch. Once per short rest, when you touch a willing or helpless creature, you may drain their emotional warmth to heal yourself for 2d4 hit points. The target gains one level of weakened until their next long rest as they feel emotionally drained.

### Luma

The Luma of Nykotheryx Amberylika forest represent pixie society at its most harmonious. Each Luma bonds with a grove of ancient trees upon emergence, becoming its guardian for life. Their iridescent wings capture and refract the aurora borealis, creating spectacular light shows during their ritual flights. Under the rule of Magera, the Frost Prince, they maintain the delicate balance between the ancient dragon totems and the living forest.

Luma culture emphasizes patience and cycles—they measure time in tree rings rather than years, and their oral histories stretch back to when the Dark Elves first walked among the silver birches. They alone among pixies remember the true names of some of the spirits bound within the dragon totems, treating this knowledge as their most sacred trust.

#### Aspects

- Patient as ancient trees
- Keeper of forgotten names

#### Aurora wings

**Passive ability.**
Your iridescent wings can store and release light. You can create bright light in a 20-foot radius or dim light in a 40-foot radius as a free action. Once per day, when you would take damage from a spell or magical effect, you may use your reaction to refract it through your wings, taking half damage and redirecting the other half to a creature of your choice within 30 feet (they may make appropriate saves as normal). Additionally, you have advantage on all skill checks related to ancient history, spirits, or the identification of magical phenomena.

## Children of Anubis

Anubis is one of several servants of Kahz, Lord of Malstaris. Anubis is in charge of ensuring that the shadows of the dead make it to Malstaris, and stay there, as well as weighing their souls for determining whether they enter the Gardens of Glyss—a paradise in Kahz's palace—or the Black Wastes—the name given to everything beyond.

Long ago, while on a trip to the material plane, Anubis had children with a mortal, who then gave birth to the first children of Anubis. Every child of Anubis passes on their heritage to their children, and thus the bloodline does not wane.

All children are born with the ability to communicate with Anubis on Malstaris. As they grow up, they can choose to serve Anubis, or turn their back on him and leave his guidance forever. This choice typically manifests during adolescence, marking them forever as either Servants or Forsaken.

Regardless of which path they follow, all children of Anubis are capable of weighing the souls of those they touch, an inheritance from their divine ancestor that allows them to perceive the moral weight of a person's deeds.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 120-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 160 years

### Weigher of Souls

**Passive ability.**

As an action, you may place your hand on a creature's chest to weigh their soul. When you do so, you learn:

- The weight of the creature's soul. If it is heavier than a feather, then the creature is unjust and deceitful. If it is lighter, then the opposite.
- What the last deceitful thing the creature said was.

### Servants of Anubis

Those who choose to serve their ancestral father become known as Servants of Anubis. They dedicate their lives to maintaining the natural order of death, ensuring that souls reach their proper destination in Malstaris and that none return to trouble the living. These children are famous for their work hunting liches, destroying the undead, and guiding lost souls to their final rest.

Servants often work as undertakers, exorcists, or wandering death-speakers, traveling from town to town to perform last rites and eliminate undead threats. They wear their connection to Anubis proudly, often adorning themselves with jackal imagery and carrying ankhs as symbols of their divine duty.

#### Aspects

- Duty to the natural order of death
- Death is sacred, undeath is abomination

#### Guardian of the Veil

**Passive ability.**

Anubis grants you power to fulfill your sacred duty. You gain the following abilities:

- You can sense any undead within 60 feet, even if they are hidden or invisible.
- When you make an attack against an undead creature, add 1d6 to your attack roll.
- Once per day, when you touch a corpse that died within the last hour, you may speak with it for up to one minute. The corpse can answer questions about its death and final moments.

### Forsaken of Anubis

Those who turn away from Anubis's guidance become the Forsaken, choosing to wield their inherited powers for their own purposes. Rather than allow their ancestral father to weigh souls for judgment, they choose to deliver justice themselves, acting as both judge and executioner. Like their father, they can feed souls to Ammit, devourer of souls. While Anubis only sends the most corrupted souls to be devoured, the Forsaken are bound by no such restrictions.

Feeding souls to Ammit is dangerous, for Ammit is eternally hungry and sometimes takes more than offered. The Forsaken walk a razor's edge between power and damnation, using their divine heritage as a weapon rather than a responsibility.

#### Aspects

- Judge, jury, and executioner
- Power justifies itself

#### Ammit's Justice

**Major ability.**

You begin to feed a still-living person's soul to Ammit. You may spend an action to cause an incapacitated creature that you are touching to decrease its heart die any number of times. Then roll 1d6. If the result is less than the number of levels you decreased, you lose an equal number of levels of your own heart die. If a creature would have its heart die decreased and it cannot fall any further, it instead falls to 0 hit points. If the creature is already at 0 hit points, or would lose two levels of its heart die while at its minimum, it dies.

## Trollkin

Half-breeds and outcasts—trollkin are the unwanted children of humans and trolls. Rare is the troll and human couple, and rarer still is the trollkin child that makes it past the first few months in the world. If not surreptitiously smothered or abandoned in a forest, most trollkin end up in orphanages, where they grow up as outsiders amongst their peers. In troll communities, they are viewed as weak and fragile, and in human communities, they are viewed as too stupid and emotionless to be effective members of society.

Unfortunately for trollkin, they are perfectly capable of understanding and figuring out many things, but are terrible at expressing it. Some trollkin abandon society to live alone in nature, becoming hermits and befriending the animals around them, who they may feel more comfortable around.

Others choose to become experts in a niche field of academics, where they do not need to interact with many people, but can still let their creative, roaming minds explore. Many of the greatest discoveries were made by trollkin, though credit may never be given to their name.

Still others turn to more violent areas of life. When faced with the constant frustration of trying to get others to understand you, some eventually consider violence. Due to their troll blood and hide, trollkin are formidable agents in combat.

### Aspects

- Thick-headed
- Contemplating what no one else is

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large
- **Height:** 7.5-8.5 feet
- **Weight:** 200-400 pounds

### Troll Blood

**Passive ability.**
At the beginning of each round, if you are conscious, regain 2 hit points, up to the maximum determined by your current heart die.

### Massive Build

**Passive ability.**
The XP cost of increasing your maximum hit points is reduced by 2. Your size is large.

## Revenant

Once you were dead, but now—well, you still are, kind of. Revenants are semi corporeal versions of their past, living, selves. When a creature dies and rather than leaving its physical form, chooses to remain within, it forfeits its ability to ever leave and is eternally trapped in the material world where they remain as a revenant. There are many reasons revenants may choose to stay, but the most common involve unfinished business. Whether it's getting revenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this goal is a top priority. While revenants may take detours along the way, they will always come back to their purpose for remaining in the material world.

By remaining in the material world, revenants forfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a revenant has completed whatever business kept them in this world, they generally slowly go crazy and are eventually hunted down and killed by children of Anubis or other specialized killers.

Due to revenant's near immortality, they are forced to watch as everyone they love inevitably grows old and dies, which contributes to the slow decaying of their sanity.

### Aspects

- Unfinished business
- [Choose one from your previous race]

### Vitals

You have whatever vitals you would have had before you died.

### Undead

**Passive ability.**
You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and cannot be poisoned.

You have already died, and can therefore not die again in the traditional sense. When you would normally die, you instead fall unconscious for 24 hours and are reborn where you died the first time with no memory of your life after death.

You take double damage from silvered weapons, and if you should die to a silver weapon, you are dead forever.

Also, your physical body is no longer fully alive, and it will slowly decay with passing time. Though you can generally maintain your appearance from your moment of death, your skin no longer closes up over wounds, so your body will begin to fall apart. For this reason, many revenants prefer to cover up as much of their skin as possible, and to travel unnoticed. Once you have died in a corpse three times, it is too mangled to ever return to.

### Detached Spirit

**Passive ability.**
You have a soul, shadow, and spirit—all necessary for true life, but they are no longer bound to your corporal body in the same way—instead, it is through willpower alone that you keep them attached to your physical form. This is a constant struggle, and when you waver, your form flickers as your spirit sloughs away from your skin. This, however, comes with benefits.

As an action, you may let your concentration fall, causing you to dissolve into a pool of light and shadow. While in this form, you gain the following effects:

- You can fit through any space larger than the width of a pebble.
- You cannot interact with the physical world
- You take half damage from all non-silver, non-iron sources, rounded down.
- You cannot take actions.
- You cannot speak.

Your physical body remains collapsed wherever you left it. You may return to it, or any other unoccupied corpse.

## Deva

Deva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very commanding presences that enter the world fully grown, intelligent, with no family, and a single, driving purpose. Several explanation exist on how they appear, though the most supported reasoning is that they are manifestations of collective thought and hope from the Psyic plane.

Deva generally have light, gray, blueish, lavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their eyes, which are pure white. They are on average, slightly taller than humans, though only slightly. Deva rarely appear looking younger than in their twenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although it does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and in combination with their striking features, they are generally at the center of attention of any room they enter.

Deva are always "born" with a deep feeling of hope and purpose. The source of that hope and purpose is never clear, but the force with which these drive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that goal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are usually somewhat noble, such as "freeing the region from tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat" or "leading their community safely to a new land". These purposes tend to align with the communities in which they spawn, supporting theories of their psyic origins.

Deva also are born with a feeling of having memories that are not entirely their own. They do not know how they know so many skills, as they remember nothing of learning them. They may have faint memories of past events within their communities, or even past experiences of other deva before them, but beyond that, it feels as though their lives began when they spawned.

When a deva dies, their body dissipates—there is no body left over. If they failed at their purpose, another deva may appear years later, or if they succeeded, another deva might not appear for hundreds of years.

### Aspects

- Core purpose: Choose one for your community
- Hope

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 140-240 pounds

### Naturally Charismatic

**Passive ability.**
Increasing your presence die costs 2 less XP. You do not need to reach PL2 in order to take the Draconic Presence paragon level.

### Memories Passed

**Major ability. Instant.**
The psyic energy from which you spawned occasionally provides imagery from others' memories of the past as well, guiding you when you face difficult challenges. You may use this ability to gain advantage on any skill check you make. If the skill check also aligns with your deeper purpose, you instead gain A3.

You also do not have a soul or shadow, and are thus invisible on both the ethereal and nethereal planes. This also excludes you from effects on creatures with souls or shadows.

## Ghoul

Ghouls are the descendants of servants spawned by ancient, powerful wizards. They were created as butlers, maids, and test subjects, fabricated from the combination of Deoric ritual and a body of the recently deceased, made to serve the wizards. Because of this, ghouls lack any spirit, making them immune to some effects, but incredibly susceptible to Kethic elemental magic. They exert no Kethic presence, meaning there's nothing stopping a water attuned mage from filling a ghoul's lungs with water, or a fire attuned mage from igniting the very skin of a ghoul.

After the age of great Deoric mages ended, ghouls lived on. They are rare, and not infrequently killed for their distinctive, gaunt, gray skin that identifies them as ghouls, an aspect that many try to cover up. This widely felt vehemence towards ghouls stems from the belief that they kill other humanoids and eat them—which is partially true.

Due to the nature of ghouls' origin, they feel an eternal emptiness within their bodies that aches to be filled. Eating magic, and the souls of other living things sate that hunger. While eating magic and flesh are not strictly necessary for ghoul survival, it usually feels that way, and any chance to eat magic or the recently deceased has a powerful frenzying effect on all ghouls. Many give in to this urge, feeling little sympathy towards a world that has given them nothing but hurt, creating a reputation for all ghouls of hunting and eating humans. Seeing a ghoul in a feeding frenzy is a truly horrifying experience—one that only needs to be seen once before never wanting to be near another ghoul again.

For these reasons, ghoul hunters can be found across Alaria. Nearly all are mages—capable of killing a ghoul in nearly an instant. While some ghouls try to flee or hide from the hunters, others fight back, usually gathering in small groups in the hopes of overwhelming the hunter.

Despite not being able to create biological offspring, some ghouls will create other ghouls, using the same cruel magic as was used to create the original few. The Deoric ritual is innately known by all ghouls, and requires nothing more than one dead body, and one live one for sacrifice. This ritual takes 1 hour to perform.

### Aspects

- I must eat flesh
- Terrifying presence

### Vitals

You have whatever vitals you gained from the body you were reanimated from.

### Soul Eater

**Passive ability.**
When you are adjacent to a humanoid or creature of greater power that has died within the last hour, you may spend an action to suck its soul out and ingest it. Doing so lets you heal, learn something about the creature, gain temporary magical power, or temporarily store its soul in your body to protect you from elemental magic.

When you ingest a creature's soul, choose one from the following list:

- **Replenish:** Regain 5 hp and any conditions affecting you.
- **Inspect:** The GM must tell you one secret about this creature's past life.
- **Devour:** If the creature had an ability die higher than your own, you may replace your ability die with their ability die for the next ten minutes.
- **Infuse:** For the next 1d10 days, spelltouched cannot use their action to inflict wounds upon you, as detailed in the Deoric Origins ability described below.

While flesh is a preferred substitute for standard food, you can still consume normal foodstuffs for nutrients.

### Deoric Origins

**Passive ability.**
Gaining oath talents and their destiny levels cost 2 XP less.

As an action, someone with a basic attunement may inflict 10 damage on you, so long as you are within 45 feet. If they have an advanced attunement, they inflict 20 damage instead, and the range increases to 90 feet. With a paragon level attunement, they may inflict 30 damage, and the range increases to 120 feet. The Infuse option from your Soul Eater can prevent creatures with elemental attunement from doing this.

## Savant

Savants, for reasons unknown, are born with rare differences in their physiology, sometimes sacrificing the ability to move, sense, or communicate effectively in exchange for excelling greatly in other ways. They can be born into nearly any race, from anyone. In some communities, savants are worshipped as supernatural beings, while in others they are shunned and treated as outcasts.

### Aspects

Choose one aspect from the following list, and one from the heritage or race from your Savant Birthright:

- Paranoid
- Emotionally cold
- Obsessed
- Vicious

### Vitals

You have the same vitals as the original creature.

### Savant Birthright

**Passive ability.**
When you choose this race, you must also choose a heritage from a different race. You are technically of that race, and gain all of the associated aspects. However, you will replace the abilities granted from the race—not the heritage—with your choice of abilities listed later in this section. For example, if you chose Uline dwarf, you would keep the Mountain-born ability, but lose the Hearty and Gruff ability.

Upon picking a heritage, choose one ability from the Physical & Mental Abilities section listed below, and gain its tier 1 ability.

Then, if you wish, you may choose and gain one of the conditions from the Physical and Mental Conditions section listed below. If you do, you gain the tier 2 ability for whichever talent you chose in the earlier step, or a different tier 1 ability.

### Physical & Mental Conditions

You may choose one passive ability from the options listed below. If you do, you may gain a second tier 1 ability, or the tier 2 ability of your initial chosen ability.

#### Blind

**Passive ability.**
You are completely blind, and therefore cannot see. You permanently have three levels of blindness.

#### Physically Disabled

**Passive ability.**
You use crutches or another device to aid your mobility. Your movement speed is reduced by 40 feet.

#### Deaf and Mute

**Passive ability.**
You are deaf and mute. You cannot understand anything more than simple ideas when people talk to you, and you cannot talk back.

### Physical & Mental Abilities

Choose an ability from this section and gain its tier 1 ability. You can gain the tier 2 ability, or choose a second tier 1 ability if you also take a condition from the Physical and Mental Conditions list above.

#### Telepath

**Passive ability.**

- **Tier 1:** You can communicate telepathically with any humanoid (or equally sentient creature) you touch. While you are touching them, they can communicate telepathically with you as well. You may also sense using their senses, during which you cannot sense through your own. Creatures are not aware that you are sensing through them.
- **Tier 2:** Your tier 1 abilities are not limited by touch, and instead extend to a range of 20 feet.

#### Tremorsense

**Passive ability.**

- **Tier 1:** By sensing vibrations in ground and air, you can sense the location and shape of anything within 20 feet of you, including through walls. This counts as being able to see that object for the sake of abilities that rely on sight. You cannot see color, and details are limited to only things larger than your fist. For example, you cannot read using this ability.
- **Tier 2:** The range of this ability extends to 60 feet.

#### Futuresight

**Passive ability.**

- **Tier 1:** You have the Sight, and can see glimpses into the future. Whenever you fall asleep or are unconscious, you have a vision. Before you wake up, you may ask the GM a question about an event in the future. The GM must give a vague answer (generally no more than a couple words), to the best of their ability.
- **Tier 2:** Your futuresight is more developed. Once, at the beginning of each day, roll three dice of any size you wish. Whenever you, the GM, or anyone else rolls a die with size matching one of the dice you rolled, you may replace the result with the result from your die roll. After doing so, you cannot use that die again.
