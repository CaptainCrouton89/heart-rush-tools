# Classes

Your class is the general role in combat that you fill. It doesn't say anything about what you do outside of combat, and in games where combat is more infrequent, your class will be less relevant to gameplay compared to your aspects and talents.

There are three different classes—stronghearts, battlehearts, and cleverhearts. Each has a distinct combat style that makes them unique.

- Stronghearts are beefier, and are responsible for preventing enemies from killing their allies.
- Battlehearts dish out the most damage, and are responsible for downing enemies quickly.
- Cleverhearts fill a more nebulous role of helping allies best fill their own roles, and hurting the enemies in ways that make them easier to deal with.

When you reach rank 1, choose one of the classes and gain the abilities listed with the Rank 1 tag. Then, upon reaching rank 2, choose one of the subclasses your class offers. Each subclass specializes its own unique play style. For example, a striker specializes in single targets, while a ravager specializes in dishing out lots of damage to everybody.

## Class & Subclass Overview

This section provides a comprehensive overview of all classes and subclasses to help you choose the right combat role for your character. Each class fills a distinct role in tactical combat, with subclasses offering specialized approaches within that role.

## Party Composition Guide

Heart Rush is a game where every role in the party will play a critical role in a team fight. Each class enables or takes advantage of the synergistic abilities of other classes, so a party where there is at least one of each class will almost always perform better than a party that's missing one of the core classes.

Obviously, don't feel like you have to choose a class because the rest of your party wants to choose the other classes—it's just something to keep in mind.

**Core Party Roles:**

- **Tank** (Strongheart): Absorbs damage and controls enemy positioning
- **Damage** (Battleheart): Eliminates priority threats quickly
- **Support** (Cleverheart): Enhances allies and disrupts enemies

**Quick Selection Guide:**

- **Protect the party?** → Strongheart Bastion
- **Control individual enemies?** → Strongheart Vicehand
- **Aggressive frontline fighter?** → Strongheart Wrathguard
- **Eliminate single targets?** → Battleheart Striker
- **Handle multiple enemies?** → Battleheart Ravager
- **Lead and coordinate?** → Cleverheart Battlemind
- **Disrupt and outmaneuver?** → Cleverheart Skirmisher
- **Combine magic and combat?** → Any class + Spelltouched

## Strongheart

Stronghearts are accustomed to taking the brunt of the damage in a fight. They can survive more hits than other classes, and do best when they are in the thick of the fight. They generally have ways of keeping enemies engaged with them, rather than threatening their allies.

Three types of stronghearts exist—bastions, wrathguards, and vicehands.

### In the Thick of It

_Passive ability. Rank 1._

You excel when in the center of battle. For each enemy adjacent to you, you get +1 to your attack and defense rolls.

Whenever you take damage, gain a rush point.

Damage converts to damage you can attack back with.

Counter attacks.

HP as a spendable resource (wrath guard).

### Cry of Defiance

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1._

You shout out, have a moment of inner peace, or by some other means recenter yourself in the moment. Choose one:

- Remove all levels of one condition from yourself.
- Remove one level of every condition from yourself.
- Gain hit points equal to your maximum heart die.

### Subclass: Bastion

Also known as: Guardian, Knight, Paladin

A burly woman stands her ground, unyielding as a wall, shielding the frightened villager behind her. Each time a wolf leaps, she strikes, knocking them aside, holding the line and keeping the pack at bay.

Blow after blow rains down on a hulking minotaur, surrounded by enemies. With a thunderous roar, he rears up, shaking off the attackers and sending them sprawling. The flurry of strikes seems to have left him unscathed.

A young dwarf in heavy armor strides calmly through the chaos of battle, his massive great hammer resting on his shoulder. Despite the storm of blades around him, he remains unscathed, and with a casual swing, he crushes enemies to the ground, as if at his whim.

Bastions are living fortresses, impenetrable and unmovable on the battlefield. They step in to shield their allies, absorb devastating blows, and unleash retribution on those foolish enough to ignore their defense.

#### Guardian's Sacrifice

_Passive ability. Rank 2._

You have the ability to step in when those nearby are in a vulnerable position. If a creature adjacent to you is about to be harmed or attacked, and the attack, defense, or damage rolls haven't been been made yet, you can choose to intervene and place yourself between them and the source of harm.

- If it's an attack, you make the defense roll and absorb the damage in their place.
- If it's unavoidable damage, you can take that on yourself too.
- You also have the option to switch positions with the creature you're protecting.

You can only save one creature during a round, but you can shield them from multiple sources of damage if needed.

#### Violent Defense

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

You hunker down, presenting a bristling wall of defense. Until the end of the round, you may add your weapon die to your defense rolls.

If you would make a defense roll and get a result greater than their attack roll, the attacker takes damage equal to the difference as you parry their blow and counterattack.

#### Hulking Blows

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

Your blows are slow, but absolutely devastating. After revealing stances, if you are wielding a heavy melee weapon, you may declare your attack to be a hulking blow.

- If you do, choose a creature in the engagement that you are able to attack. That creature may choose to forfeit all attack rolls during this engagement and instead automatically dodge your attack.
- If they don't, you may double the result of all dice from your attack roll.

#### Eternal Fortitude

_Major ability. Instant. Rank 4._

While others may fall, you fight on—nothing can bring you to your knees. You may spend any number of rush points.

- For each rush point spent, set aside 2d6.
- Whenever you make a defense roll, before seeing your result, you may remove and then roll any number of these dice and add them to your defense roll.

### Subclass: Vicehand

A massive orc clad in heavy armor strides forward, the weight of his presence palpable. With a swift, calculated movement, he snatches a charging brigand by the wrist, halting the attack before it begins. The brigand struggles, but the orc's grip is unyielding, yanking the brigand back and away from his allies.

In the heart of the battlefield, a trollkin stands firm, surrounded by chaos. With a fierce determination, she locks onto an enemy warrior, tackling him to the ground before pummeling him into a pulp with her fists.

A hulking, bare chested warrior has wrestled a dire lion to the ground. With terrifying strength, the warrior begins to constrict the snarling but completely helpless beast. As the seconds pass, the snarling becomes weaker and weaker as the life is squeezed from the mighty beast.

Vicehands are living clamps, expertly trained to restrain and dominate a single target while shielding their allies from harm. They thrive in melee combat, using their strength to hold foes in check and disrupt enemy plans, ensuring that no threat goes unchecked.

Vicehands gain the following abilities.

#### Grappler

_Passive ability. Rank 2._

You are a master of restraining and controlling opponents in close combat.

- You do not have to directly beat a creature's stance to attempt to grapple them.
- You can grapple as though you are one size larger than you are.
- You have advantage on rolls to grapple other creatures.
- While grappling a creature, your movement speed is 5 rather than 0.

#### Fists, Knees, and Elbows

_Minor ability. Rank 3._

Until the end of the round, when you make an unarmed attack roll against a creature you are grappling, add your might die to the roll.

Grappling the creature does not impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against the creature this round.

#### I don't think so

_Minor ability. Rank 3._

Make a grappling ability check against a creature you are already grappling. On a success, choose one:

- If you are standing, move the grappled creature 5 feet to a different space adjacent to you.
- The grappled creature cannot make sounds this round.
- You and the grappled creature fall prone.
- The creature takes a level of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.

#### Cinch Down

_Major ability. Rank 4._

You may only use this ability if you are grappling a creature. You gain the following benefits so long as you remain grappling the creature. X is equal to the number of rush points you spend on this ability.

- You get X levels of advantage on checks to maintain your grapple on the creature.
- Each round, as an action, you may roll your might die X times and deal that much damage to the creature.
- The creature gains X levels of restrained so long as they are grappled.

### Subclass: Wrathguard

Also known as: Warrior, Sentinel, Barbarian

A woman stands tall, war-hammer in hand, daring the snarling werebear to make a move. When the beast finally lunges, aiming to bypass her and strike her ally, she reacts with lightning speed, bringing her hammer down on its back with a resounding crack, sending it crashing to the ground, whimpering.

A knight, clad head to toe in gleaming plate mail, stands firm at the center of the fray. Shield raised, she swings her mace in wide arcs, keeping half a dozen goblins at bay. They scramble to dodge her whirling weapon, only to be cut down by her advancing allies.

As two armies prepare to clash, a lone figure in nothing but a kilt and a hammer charges out from the front lines. Arrows rain down upon him, but he does not falter. Reaching the enemy's ranks, he unleashes a sweeping blow, knocking three soldiers off their feet, and the battle begins with his roar echoing across the field.

Wrathguards are fierce, unyielding war machines, thriving in the heart of combat. They can withstand punishing blows and return them in kind, and no matter how battered they are, they rise again, ready to fight.

Wrathguards gain the following abilities.

#### Sentinel

_Passive ability. Rank 2._

You are a vigilant guardian, ready to strike at any enemy who dares move past you. You are always ready.

- Sidestepping does not let enemies avoid your opportunity attacks.
- Opportunity attacks do not require an action or rush points.

#### I Didn't Feel A Thing

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

You shrug off attacks that would fell lesser warriors, your resolve unshakeable.

- You take half as much damage from the next source of incoming damage, rounded down.
- If the source would cause you to move, you move 10 feet less.
- If the source would cause you to gain leveled conditions, you gain those condition at one level less.

#### Crippling Blows

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

Your blows are powerful enough to knock people off their feet.

When you deal damage to a creature with a heavy, melee weapon, choose one:

- Beat Down: The creature cannot take the sidestep action until the beginning of the next round. If the creature is no more than one size larger than you, it is knocked prone. Otherwise, it takes two levels of weakened.
- Smash: The creature is knocked 10 feet away from you.

#### Battle Spirited

_Major ability. Rank 4._

For each rush point spent on this ability, choose one of the following effects. The number of times you choose a given effect cannot be more than one more than the least-chosen effect. You and all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you gain the benefits of the chosen effects until the end of combat. For each ability, replace X with the number of rush points spent on this ability.

- Gain 2X hit points at the start of your turn
- +X to all defense rolls
- +X to all attack rolls
- Move speed +10X

## Battleheart

Battlehearts are best at dealing out lots of damage. Their abilities grant bonuses that make them more likely to hit, and more likely to deal more damage.

Two types of battlehearts exist—strikers and ravagers.

### Brutal Attacks

_Passive ability. Rank 1._

Your attacks are vicious and true. Whenever you roll the maximum result on one of the dice in an attack roll, or damage from a spell you cast, you may add another die of the same size and roll it, adding it to the result. This can trigger multiple times.

### Making it count

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1._

You may apply the effects of your stance twice during the current engagement.

### Subclass: Striker

Also known as: Ranger, Bounty-hunter, Assassin

A lone halfling stands atop a boulder, overlooking the chaos of the battlefield. In the blink of an eye, he draws and releases, and another enemy falls, his arrows swift and unerring.

From the shadows of the rafters, a woman drops silently onto the false king's back. With a swift, precise motion, her blade finds its mark, and blood spills before the king crumples to the floor. In the next instant, she vanishes, leaving no trace.

An old man perches high in the branches of a tree, unseen by the caravan below. With quiet precision, he draws back his bowstring and releases, sending an arrow straight through the driver's heart, ending the journey in a single, silent breath.

Strikers are lethal assassins, masters of precision and efficiency, capable of bringing down even the mightiest foes with deadly accuracy. Whether wielding a bow, blade, or any other weapon, Strikers turn their tools into instruments of death, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies.

Strikers gain the following abilities.

#### Called Shot

_Passive ability. Rank 2._

You exchange some defensive ability for overwhelming offensive prowess. You have disadvantage on defense rolls, but you may make called shots.
By aiming for a very specific location on your target, you maximize your potential damage, at the risk of dealing less damage if you miss. If you have advantage on an attack roll, you may declare the attack to be a called shot.
If you do, announce a target number for you attack roll. Keep this number in mind for later.
Then, it’s time to determine the multiplier. Your multiplier starts at one, though you may remove levels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it. To increase the multiplier by one, you must sacrifice a number of levels of advantage equal to the current level of the multiplier. So to increase the multiplier to two, you would have to spend one level of advantage. To then increase it to three, you would spend two levels of advantage, and so on.
Finally, make your attack roll. If any of the dice you rolled are equal to or higher than your target number, multiply your target number by the multiplier and add that to your attack roll.

#### Power Strike

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

Before you announce your stance in an engagement, you may declare the attack to be a power strike. If you do, all dice used in the attack roll trigger your Brutal Attacks ability if they land on a result greater than half the size of the die. For example, you would reroll and add another 1d10 to the result if you rolled a 6-10 on a d10 in your attack roll.

#### Execute

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you may choose for it to be an execution instead. If this damage would reduce the creature to zero or fewer hit points, the creature immediately dies.

#### Devastation Strike

_Major ability. Instant. Rank 4._

You deliver a massive blow, potentially finishing off your enemy.

- Until the end of the round, you may use each of your minor abilities once for free.
- You may spend any number of rush points to roll 1d6 and add it to your next attack roll this round.
- If you do not attack this round, it does not count as using this ability.

### Subclass: Ravager

Also known as: Berserker

A small woman with bloodshot eyes and a dagger in each hand whirls and dives, darting between the outstretched arms of her attackers and skewering them both in the sides as she passes.

A man stands before a horde of goblins, his belt jammed with nearly a dozen instruments of death. With a deep breath, the man leaps forward, bringing his sword down on the head of the first goblin before drawing a hand-axe and throwing it at the second, before leaping over the head of the next, and driving an arrow from his quiver into the eye of the last goblin.

A lithe woman draws forth a paper thin blade of steel, sharp as a razor. With a short hop, she begins to move, jumping like lightning from foe to foe, lopping off heads and severing limbs in an endless graceful dance that only she can understand.

Ravagers are masters of the horde. They have learned to wield multiple blades at once, always capable of choosing the right weapon to gain the edge in the fight. No battle is too thick for a ravager to enter, and then leave again with a trail of bloody corpses in their wake.

Ravagers gain the following abilities.

#### Everywhere at Once

_Passive ability. Rank 2._

You are capable of combatting multiple enemies at once.

- In an engagement, you make a melee attack against any number of valid targets in the engagement rather than only one.
- If you do not make any melee attacks, you may instead make a ranged attack against any number of valid targets in the engagement who are adjacent to each other.
- Additionally, object interactions to stow or draw shields or weapons are always free, and instant.

#### Lightning Reflexes

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

Your reflexes are faster than anyone else's on the battlefield. Treat your agility die as a d20 when determining who can go first when multiple people want to take actions. Nobody can interrupt you if you want to use multiple abilities in a row.

#### Bloodthirsty

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

You can launch from one foe to the next with grace.

- When you attack a creature that has not been attacked yet this round, you get +3 on the attack roll.
- When you deal enough damage to cause a creature to go unconscious or die this round, you gain an additional action you may take during the next action phase.

#### Blitz

_Major ability. Rank 4._

The rhythm of your movements synchronizes perfectly with the fight.

- Until the end of the round, you may spend one rush point to make a free opportunity attack against an enemy and take the sidestep action.
- You cannot make an opportunity attack against the same target more than once.

## Cleverheart

Cleverhearts are best at providing help to their teammates—either augmenting their attacks, or debuffing enemies to make their attacks weaker.

Two types of cleverhearts exist—battleminds and skirmishers.

### Above the Fray

_Passive ability. Rank 1._

Although not necessarily the best at dishing out the damage in a fight, cleverhearts excel at everything else.

Once per round, you may make an object interaction, sidestep, help, or trip action for free.

### Tactics

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1._

You can spot out the weak points in your enemies' defenses and direct your allies towards them.

Choose a creature within 30 feet. If the creature meets one of the following conditions, attacks against them have advantage. For each additional condition met, attacks against that creature are made with an additional level of advantage until the end of the round:

- Creature has a wall on two sides
- Creature is adjacent to two or more of your allies
- Creature is prone
- Creature has three or more levels of a single condition
- Creature is affected by three or more different conditions

### Subclass: Battlemind

Also known as: Commander, Mastermind, Tactician

A battalion commander stands atop a boulder, her voice cutting through the chaos as she issues sharp, precise commands.

Beneath her, soldiers move as one, each order turning the tide of battle further in their favor.

At the back of his company, a man with steely eyes watches a pack of wolves approach. With a swift gesture and a few barked orders, the company converges, taking down each wolf in turn with practiced efficiency.

A woman moves gracefully among her allies, her blade flashing as it strikes her opponent's shoulder. With a commanding shout, she rallies her companions, guiding their movements into a powerful, unified assault.

Battleminds are master strategists, shaping the flow of combat with keen insight and decisive action. Their presence boosts their allies, coordinating efforts to exploit every advantage and turn the tide of battle.

Battleminds gain the following abilities.

#### Versatile Training

**Passive ability. Rank 2.**

You have more versatility in combat.

- Gain 1 XP for each combat talent and 2 XP for each combat destiny level you have taken so far.

  - Remove all conditions affecting the creature.

You cannot choose the same effect more than once until all effects have been chosen.

### Subclass: Skirmisher

Also known as: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Jack of All Trades

A wiry figure darts between the shadows, slipping past a lumbering ogre's sweeping fist.

With a quick flick of the wrist, she throws a handful of sand into the creature's eyes, blinding it and slipping away before it can even roar.

Despite standing amid a dozen pikemen in a frenzied brawl, a goblin seems to simply melt away from the thrusting pikes, evading every swipe and thrust aimed at him.

Then, with a sly grin, he lashes out, tripping an overzealous soldier and leaving him sprawled at the mercy of the goblin's allies.

Skirmishers are elusive and unpredictable, dancing around the battlefield with an unsettling ease. They specialize in dirty tricks and misdirection, exploiting every weakness to leave their enemies vulnerable.

Hard to pin down and even harder to catch, they disrupt their foes and wear them down with a series of debilitating strikes.

Skirmishers gain the following abilities.

#### Improved Interference

_Passive ability. Rank 2._

You excel at disrupting enemies through clever positioning and dirty tactics.

- Choosing the same stance as another creature does not prevent you from using a non-attacking offensive action against them.
- Additionally, whenever you choose to hinder a creature, choose from the following list instead:
  - The creature takes 1d6 damage and 3 levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
  - The creature takes 1d6 damage and 2 levels of blinded.

Choose one:

- Acrobatics: The next time you sidestep, move up to 10 feet instead. Ignore difficult terrain.
- Scamper: Increase your climb speed by 20 feet this round.
- Shenanigans: The next time you perform a stunt, you have +3 on the contested ability check.
- Switcheroo: The next time you sidestep, you may sidestep into an adjacent and willing creature's space. Switch places with that creature. The creature must be no more than one size bigger or smaller than you.
- Taunt: After stances are chosen but before stances are revealed, you may choose a creature and call out their stance. After stances are revealed, if you guessed correctly, that creature gains a level of enraged towards you.
- Quick Reflexes: Other creatures cannot interupt actions and abilities you take this round. Treat your agility die as a d20 for the purposes of determining order of activities in the action phase.

#### Elusive

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

You react to danger with fluid grace, slipping away from harm at the last moment.

- Immediately after taking damage during an engagement, you may take the sidestep action as a free, instant ability.
- This may cause you to no longer be a valid target for some attackers.
- You cannot make any attack rolls this round.

#### Nasty Tricksies

_Major ability. Rank 4._

Your arsenal of dirty tricks can inflict lasting wounds and permanent disabilities on your enemies.

  - The creature takes your choice of X levels of blinded, or X/3 permanent levels of blinded.

## Spelltouched

Spelltouched can be used as a subclass for any other class. You can play a strongheart, and then replace any of the strongheart subclasses with the spelltouched subclass. Likewise, you could replace any of the battleheart or cleverheart subclasses with this subclass instead.

### Subclass: Spelltouched

Also known as: Gish, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Archer, Spellsword

A dwarf charges forward, cloaked in flames, his fists blazing with fiery energy.

With a swift motion, he raises a wall of fire behind the ogre, trapping it, and then strikes with a searing punch, sending the creature tumbling back in a smoldering heap.

A gnome darts ahead, each step propelled by the wind itself, carrying her swiftly toward the looming giant spider.

With a graceful twirl of her blade, she slashes at the creature's thorax, releasing a concussive blast of air that hurls it backward.

An elf raises her hand, and a towering wave rises from the earth, sweeping the fleeing thugs back toward her.

With a sharp stomp, the cobblestone beneath them seems to melt, dragging the panicked foes into the ground, immobilized.

Spelltouched blend elemental magic with martial prowess, wielding their attunements to shape the battlefield.

By casting spells, they can deny areas to their enemies, unleash devastating attacks, and manipulate the movement and position of their foes.

Spelltouched gain the following abilities.

#### Elemental State
