# Factions

Factions represent organized groups pursuing their goals through collective action. From small street gangs to mighty nations, factions shape the political landscape and create opportunities for adventure.

## Core Mechanics

### Faction Attributes

Factions have four attribute dice representing their capabilities:

- **Wealth Die** (d4-d20): Economic resources, trade power, and financial influence
- **Sovereign Die** (d4-d20): Internal cohesion, loyalty, and leadership effectiveness
- **Might Die** (d4-d20): Military strength, combat capability, and enforcement power
- **Intelligence Die** (d4-d20): Information networks, strategic planning, and espionage

### Size and Health

**Size** represents the faction's scale:

| Size | Population | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| 1 | ~100 | Street gang, small cult |
| 2 | ~200 | Merchant company, guard unit |
| 3 | ~500 | Large guild, small village |
| 4 | 1,000 | Town militia, major guild |
| 5 | 2,000 | Small town, trade confederation |
| 6 | 5,000 | Large town, minor noble house |
| 7 | 10,000 | Small city, military order |
| 8 | 20,000 | Large city, regional power |
| 9 | 50,000 | Major city-state |
| 10 | 100,000 | Small kingdom |
| 11+ | 200,000+ | Major nations |

**Faction HP** = Size Ã— 10

## Faction Actions

Each faction takes ONE primary action per month:

## Faction Conflicts

When factions clash:

1. Attacker declares action and target
2. Make contested rolls: Attribute die + Size
3. Loser takes damage = margin of failure
4. 10+ damage in one hit = faction wound

### Faction Wounds

Like PC wounds, faction wounds persist until healed:

**Economic Wounds** (Wealth attacks):
- "Trade routes disrupted" 
- "Markets destabilized"
- "Treasury plundered"

**Unity Wounds** (Sovereign attacks):
- "Leadership disputed"
- "Morale shattered"
- "Loyalties divided"

**Military Wounds** (Might attacks):
- "Forces routed"
- "Defenses breached"
- "Supply lines cut"

**Intelligence Wounds** (Intelligence attacks):

- "Plans exposed"
- "Communications compromised"

## Momentum

Factions build and spend Momentum (0-10 max):
