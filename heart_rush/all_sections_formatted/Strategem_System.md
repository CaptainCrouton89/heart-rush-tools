# Stratagem System

Stratagems are Heart Rush's "zoom out" mechanic—when you need to resolve complex endeavors without playing through every tedious detail. Whether commanding fleets in battle, managing trade empires from afar, or pursuing grand ambitions over years, stratagems handle coordinated actions that would bog down play if resolved moment by moment.

## When to Use Stratagems

**Use stratagems to:**

- Resolve complex endeavors requiring coordination between multiple people
- Handle activities you're managing from a distance ("my employees establish trade routes while I adventure")
- Abstract time-consuming tasks that would be tedious to roleplay
- Manage large-scale conflicts without individual combat
- Skip the boring parts while preserving meaningful choices

**Don't use stratagems for:**

- Personal combat (use combat rules instead)
- Direct roleplay conversations
- Simple, single-action tasks
- Situations where players want to handle each step personally
- Any task a single person can complete alone without coordination

## Core Mechanics

### The Stratagem Roll

When you pursue a stratagem objective, roll:

**d100 + ability die + skill modifier (if applicable) vs CN**

The d100 reflects the many variables and uncertainties inherent in complex, coordinated efforts. Your ability die represents your personal capability, while skills provide expertise in relevant areas.

### Challenge Numbers

- **Easy (CN 30)**: Favorable circumstances, minimal opposition
- **Moderate (CN 50)**: Typical difficulty, competent opposition
- **Hard (CN 70)**: Significant challenges, strong opposition
- **Extreme (CN 90)**: Near-impossible odds, overwhelming opposition

**Stakes are always transparent**—the GM announces the CN before you roll, allowing informed decisions about whether to intervene or accept the odds.

### Two Types of Objectives

**Positional Objectives**
One success fundamentally changes the situation:

- "Reach cannon range"
- "Breach the castle walls"
- "Establish trade monopoly"
- "Gain the king's favor"

**Accumulation Objectives**
Multiple successes required to achieve your goal:

- "Sink their flagship" (3 successes)
- "Convert the population" (5 successes)
- "Build legendary reputation" (10 successes)

Each success brings you closer; failures may add obstacles but don't erase progress unless the fiction demands it (e.g., "they repaired the damage").

## Running a Stratagem

### Step 1: Define the Stratagem

Before rolling, establish:

- **Objective**: What specific goal are you pursuing?
- **Type**: Positional or Accumulation? If Accumulation, how many successes?
- **Opposition**: Who or what resists your efforts?
- **Pace**: How much time does each action represent?
- **Parent Stratagem**: What larger goal does this serve? (if any)
- **Personal Involvement**: Are you directly involved or managing from afar?

### Step 2: The Action Cycle

Each action within a stratagem follows these steps:

**1. Situation**
Describe current circumstances based on previous actions and existing assets/hindrances.

**2. Approach**
How are you attempting to achieve the objective this time? Different approaches may affect difficulty or create different outcomes.

**3. Stakes**
The GM:

- Considers what would be typical difficulty
- Evaluates your assets (what makes you stronger than typical)
- Evaluates your hindrances (what makes you weaker than typical)
- Considers the opposition's current state
- Sets and announces the final CN

**4. Intervention (Optional)**
Before rolling, you may take direct action to influence the stratagem. Your intervention can dramatically shift the odds—for better or worse.

_Helpful interventions might:_

- Assassinate enemy leadership (−40 CN)
- Sabotage critical infrastructure (−20 CN)
- Rally demoralized troops (−10 CN)
- Secure insider information (gain asset)

_Harmful interventions might:_

- Botch assassination attempt (+20 CN, gain "High Alert" hindrance)
- Get captured while scouting (lose "Element of Surprise" asset)
- Insult their culture during negotiations (+30 CN)
- Reveal your plans accidentally (enemy gains asset)

Interventions must make narrative sense and often trigger zoomed-in scenes.

**5. Roll**
The character spearheading the effort rolls. For distant management, this might be you rolling for your organization's efforts.

**6. Resolution**

_Success:_

- **Positional**: Objective achieved, situation fundamentally changes
- **Accumulation**: Add one success toward your total

_Failure:_

- May create new hindrances
- May strengthen opposition
- Doesn't erase existing progress (unless fictionally appropriate)
- May force abandonment of the stratagem

_Complications (1 on any die):_

- Determine success/failure first
- Then zoom in to handle the immediate crisis
- Complications create urgent situations demanding attention

### Step 3: Completion

**Success**

- Positional objectives transform the situation
- Accumulation objectives conclude when you reach the target
- Usually creates assets for parent stratagems
- Opposition may cease to exist

**Abandonment**
Either side can abandon a stratagem when costs exceed benefits. Abandonment often creates hindrances ("Damaged Reputation," "Wasted Resources," "Demoralized Forces").

## Assets & Hindrances

Assets and hindrances modify your stratagem rolls by affecting the CN. They represent what makes YOUR forces or situation exceptional compared to typical circumstances.

### Assets (Reduce CN)

Your advantages:

- "Veteran Crew" — Your people are exceptionally skilled
- "Superior Intelligence" — You know enemy plans
- "Divine Blessing" — Supernatural aid supports you
- "Fresh Supplies" — Your forces are well-provisioned
- "Local Support" — The population aids your efforts

### Hindrances (Increase CN)

Your disadvantages:

- "Damaged Fleet" — Your equipment is compromised
- "Low Morale" — Your people lack fighting spirit
- "Saboteur in Ranks" — Internal threats weaken you
- "Operating Blind" — You lack crucial information
- "Hostile Territory" — The environment works against you

### How They Work

1. GM establishes base difficulty for a typical force
2. Your assets make you more capable (reduce CN)
3. Your hindrances impede you (increase CN)
4. Opposition's state is considered separately
5. Final CN is announced before rolling

## Nested Stratagems

Stratagems naturally nest within each other like Russian dolls. Grand ambitions require strategic campaigns, which require tactical operations, which may require immediate actions.

### Example: Becoming the Pirate King

**Grand Stratagem**: Become Pirate King

- _Type_: Accumulation (10 "Legendary Deeds")
- _Pace_: Each action represents ~6 months
- _Personal_: You're directly involved in building your legend

**Strategic Stratagem**: Capture the Merchant Prince's Galleon

- _Type_: Positional (counts as 1 Legendary Deed)
- _Pace_: Days of hunting and preparation
- _Parent_: Become Pirate King

**Tactical Stratagem**: Win the Naval Battle

- _Type_: First Positional ("Close to range"), then Accumulation ("Cripple and board" — 3 successes)
- _Pace_: Each action represents ~10 minutes
- _Parent_: Capture the Galleon

**Immediate Actions**: The Opening Chase

- _Type_: Accumulation (3 "Distance" before they get 3 "Escape")
- _Pace_: Each action represents ~2 minutes
- _Parent_: Win the Naval Battle

Success at lower levels creates assets for higher levels. Failure creates hindrances that cascade upward.

## Managing From Afar

Stratagems excel at handling endeavors you're not personally overseeing. When you delegate to employees, allies, or organizations:

- You still roll (representing your leadership and planning)
- Time scales up dramatically (one roll might cover weeks or months)
- Your intervention options are limited to what you could realistically influence
- Assets often represent the quality of your subordinates
- Hindrances might include communication delays or trustworthiness issues

_Example_: While you adventure in the northern wastes, your trading company attempts to establish new routes. You roll once for their month-long efforts, with your Cunning die representing your business acumen and prior instructions.

## Key Principles

### Fiction First

Let the narrative determine mechanics. If one cannonball could sink a ship, it might be positional. If you need to wear down their hull, it's accumulation. The story shapes the stratagem.

### Progress Persists

Successes toward accumulation objectives don't vanish on failure. Those two successes toward "Sink their ship" remain even if your third attempt fails. Only specific fictional circumstances ("they reached port for repairs") would reduce accumulated successes.

### Zoom Appropriately

Stratagems let you handle the boring parts quickly while zooming in for drama:

- Use combat rules for personal fights
- Use stratagems for fleet battles
- Zoom to combat when boarding begins
- Always zoom in for complications

### Player Agency Matters

Stratagems aren't just dice rolls—direct intervention can swing impossible odds to your favor. That CN 90 siege becomes CN 50 if you seduce the enemy general. Players shape their fate.

## Quick Reference

### Starting a Stratagem

1. Define objective and type
2. Identify parent stratagem (if any)
3. Set pace and opposition
4. Determine success requirements
5. Establish personal involvement level

### Action Sequence

**Situation → Approach → Stakes (CN) → Intervention? → Roll → Resolution**

### Accumulation Guidelines

- **Light**: 2–3 successes
- **Moderate**: 4–5 successes
- **Heavy**: 6–7 successes
- **Epic**: 10+ successes
- **Versus**: Successes = target's capacity

### Standard CNs

- **Easy**: 30
- **Moderate**: 50
- **Hard**: 70
- **Extreme**: 90

Remember: Stratagems handle the tedious parts so you can focus on the fun. When in doubt, zoom out with a stratagem and zoom in for the exciting moments.
