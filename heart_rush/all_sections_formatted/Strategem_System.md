# Stratagem System

When your ambitions extend beyond what you can personally accomplish—commanding fleets, building trade empires, or orchestrating months-long campaigns—the stratagem system lets you resolve these grand endeavors without getting bogged down in tedious details. This "zoom out" mechanic preserves meaningful choices and dramatic moments while skipping the boring parts.

## Understanding Stratagems

Stratagems handle any complex undertaking that requires coordination between multiple people or extends beyond your direct control. They transform what would be dozens of repetitive skill checks into dynamic scenes where your decisions truly matter.

**You'll use stratagems when:**

- Leading organizations or groups in coordinated efforts
- Managing endeavors from a distance while adventuring elsewhere
- Resolving large-scale conflicts without individual combat
- Pursuing goals that span weeks, months, or years
- Handling any multi-person effort too complex for simple skill checks

**Keep using normal rules for:**

- Personal combat encounters
- Direct conversations and negotiations
- Tasks you can complete alone
- Situations where you want to play through each moment
- Any scene where individual actions matter

## The Stratagem Roll

When pursuing a stratagem objective, you make a special roll that represents your leadership, planning, and the collective efforts of everyone involved:

**d8 + ability die + profession + aspect (if applicable) vs Challenge Number**

This differs from normal skill checks in crucial ways. The d8 represents baseline uncertainty in complex endeavors—your personal stamina doesn't affect large-scale coordination. Your ability die, profession, and aspects still matter, reflecting how your expertise shapes the overall effort.

**No one can help with stratagem rolls**—the coordination is already baked into the mechanic itself.

### Setting the Stakes

Before any stratagem roll, the GM transparently sets the Challenge Number based on your circumstances:

| Difficulty        | CN  | Typical Situation                               |
| ----------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Fairly Easy       | 6   | Overwhelming advantages, token opposition       |
| Average           | 9   | Favorable circumstances, competent opposition   |
| Hard              | 12  | Significant obstacles, skilled adversaries      |
| Very Hard         | 15  | Major disadvantages, elite opposition           |
| Nearly Impossible | 18  | Overwhelming odds against you                   |
| Heroic            | 21  | Legendary difficulty, miraculous success needed |

The GM always announces the CN before you roll, letting you decide whether to accept those odds or intervene to shift them.

## Two Types of Objectives

Every stratagem pursues either a positional or accumulation objective, which determines how success and failure work:

### Positional Objectives

One successful roll achieves your goal and fundamentally changes the situation:

- "Reach cannon range before they escape"
- "Breach the castle's outer walls"
- "Establish exclusive trade rights"
- "Win the duke's political support"

Success transforms the scenario. Failure might create complications but doesn't prevent future attempts unless circumstances change.

### Accumulation Objectives

Multiple successes build toward your goal:

- "Sink their flagship" (requires 3 successes)
- "Convert the province to your faith" (requires 5 successes)
- "Build legendary reputation" (requires 10 successes)

Each success brings you closer. **Progress persists**—those two successes toward sinking the ship remain even if your third attempt fails. Only specific fictional circumstances ("they reached port for repairs") would reduce accumulated successes.

## Running a Stratagem

### Setting Up

Before the first roll, establish these key elements with your GM:

**1. The Objective**: What specific goal are you pursuing? Be precise—"defeat the pirates" is too vague, but "capture their fortress island" works perfectly.

**2. Success Requirements**: Is this positional (one success) or accumulation (multiple successes)? For accumulation objectives, lighter goals need 2-3 successes, moderate ones 4-5, and epic undertakings 10+.

**3. Time Scale**: How much fictional time does each stratagem action represent? Naval battles might be 10-minute increments, while trade expansion could be monthly efforts.

**4. Your Involvement**: Are you personally leading the charge or managing from afar? This affects both your intervention options and the narrative framing.

### The Action Cycle

Each stratagem action follows this sequence:

**1. Current Situation**
The GM describes circumstances based on previous results, existing advantages, and the opposition's state. This grounds each roll in the evolving fiction.

**2. Your Approach**
How are you attempting the objective this time? Different approaches create different outcomes even with identical rolls. Attacking a fortress through deception plays differently than direct assault.

**3. Intervention Opportunity**
This is where stratagems truly shine. Before rolling, you can zoom back in to personally influence events. These interventions create the memorable moments that make stratagems exciting rather than procedural.

**4. Stakes & Roll**
The GM sets the Challenge Number based on all factors, you roll your dice, and together you narrate the results.

## Direct Intervention

The most exciting part of any stratagem is when you stop managing from afar and get your hands dirty. Interventions let you dramatically shift the odds through personal action, creating memorable scenes that affect the larger conflict.

### How Intervention Works

Before any stratagem roll, you can declare an intervention. This immediately zooms the action back in—you're no longer managing the battle but infiltrating the enemy camp, sabotaging their supplies, or rallying your demoralized troops. These scenes play out using normal Heart Rush rules (skill checks, combat, roleplay) with their outcomes directly affecting the stratagem's Challenge Number.

**Minor interventions** (adjust CN by ±3):

- Rally demoralized troops with an inspiring speech
- Sabotage non-critical enemy supplies
- Spread disinformation through the ranks
- Secure useful but not game-changing intelligence

**Major interventions** (adjust CN by ±6):

- Assassinate enemy leadership
- Destroy critical infrastructure
- Turn a key enemy to your side
- Discover and exploit a massive weakness

**Dramatic interventions** (adjust CN by ±9 or more):

- Single-handedly storm their command post
- Convince their entire force to defect
- Unleash ancient magic that changes everything
- Perform a deed so legendary it demoralizes all opposition

### Intervention Risks

Interventions aren't free success buttons—they're dramatic gambles. Failed interventions often make situations worse:

- **Botched assassination**: Enemy goes on high alert (+6 CN, gain "Heightened Security" hindrance)
- **Captured while scouting**: Lose "Element of Surprise" asset, enemy gains "Prisoner Leverage" (+3 CN)
- **Failed inspiration**: Your troops see your desperation (gain "Shaken Faith" hindrance)
- **Diplomatic insult**: Offend potential allies (+9 CN, may abandon stratagem entirely)

The best interventions emerge naturally from play. When the dice make a crucial roll difficult, creative intervention can snatch victory from defeat—or plunge you deeper into disaster.

### Intervention Example

_Your revolutionary army besieges the tyrant's fortress (CN 15 - Very Hard). Before rolling, you declare an intervention:_

**You**: "I'm going to sneak into the fortress through the old siege tunnels and open the gates from within."

**GM**: "Excellent! Let's zoom in. You're crawling through ancient stonework, your torch flickering..."

_[Full scene plays out with skill checks, encounters with guards, discovering the gate mechanism is damaged, improvising a solution, a desperate fight, and finally throwing open the gates as dawn breaks]_

**GM**: "Your soldiers pour through the open gates! The intervention reduces the stratagem CN from 15 to 9. Now roll for the overall battle..."

## Assets & Hindrances

Assets and hindrances represent what makes your forces or situation exceptional compared to typical circumstances. They modify stratagem difficulty by adjusting the Challenge Number.

### Assets (Reduce Your CN)

Your advantages that make success more likely:

- **Elite Forces**: "Veteran Mercenaries" or "Handpicked Crew"
- **Information**: "Enemy Plans Revealed" or "Perfect Maps"
- **Resources**: "Unlimited Funding" or "Master-Crafted Weapons"
- **Position**: "Defensive Advantage" or "Element of Surprise"
- **Support**: "Local Population Aids Us" or "Divine Blessing"

### Hindrances (Increase Your CN)

Your disadvantages that impede success:

- **Weakened Forces**: "Demoralized Troops" or "Sick Crew"
- **Lack of Information**: "Operating Blind" or "False Intelligence"
- **Resource Problems**: "Low Supplies" or "Damaged Equipment"
- **Poor Position**: "Exposed Flanks" or "Fighting Uphill"
- **Internal Issues**: "Saboteur in Ranks" or "Divided Leadership"

### How They Apply

The GM starts with base difficulty for a typical force in this situation, then adjusts based on your specific advantages and disadvantages. The opposition's strength is already factored into the base difficulty—your assets and hindrances represent what makes YOU exceptional.

**Example**: _Besieging a fortress is normally Hard (CN 12). Your "Veteran Siege Engineers" (-3) and "Superior Artillery" (-3) would reduce it to CN 6, but "Running Low on Supplies" (+3) brings the final CN to 9._

## Nested Stratagems

Grand ambitions naturally break down into smaller goals. While you don't need complex stratagem trees for everything, understanding how objectives can nest helps you pursue epic goals through manageable steps.

### Natural Progression

Consider a pirate pursuing ultimate infamy:

**The Grand Dream**: "Become the Pirate King" might require 10 legendary deeds—an accumulation stratagem where each deed takes months to accomplish.

**A Single Deed**: "Capture the Merchant Prince's Treasure Galleon" becomes its own positional stratagem. Success counts as one legendary deed toward your grand ambition.

**The Immediate Challenge**: Actually catching and defeating the galleon might involve several smaller stratagems or zoom straight into ship combat.

The key is letting the fiction guide you. If something feels too big for a single stratagem, break it down. If you're getting bogged down in nested objectives, zoom back out.

## Managing From Afar

Stratagems excel when you're not personally present. While adventuring in distant lands, your trading company still pursues profits, your revolutionary cells still spread propaganda, and your pirate fleet still raids shipping lanes.

### How Distance Management Works

- **You still roll**: Your dice represent leadership quality and advance planning
- **Time scales up**: One roll might cover weeks or months of activity
- **Limited intervention**: You can only interfere through messages, agents, or magic
- **Communication matters**: "Trusted Lieutenants" is a valuable asset; "Unreliable Messengers" is a crippling hindrance

**Example**: _While you explore ancient ruins, your merchant guild attempts to corner the silk market. You roll once for their month-long efforts, with your Cunning die representing the brilliant strategy you established before leaving._

## Play Example: The Siege of Thornwall

_The rebel alliance needs to capture Thornwall Fortress to control the mountain passes. Sarah plays Commander Blackwood, leading the siege._

**GM**: "Thornwall is a positional objective—one success breaks their defenses. The fortress is strong and well-supplied. Base difficulty would be Hard, CN 12. What advantages do you bring?"

**Sarah**: "We have 'Mountain Guides' who know secret paths, and I secured 'Siege Weapons' from the duke."

**GM**: "Each asset reduces difficulty by 3. But you also have the hindrance 'Winter Approaching'—your soldiers suffer in the cold. That increases difficulty by 3. Final Challenge Number is 9."

**Sarah**: "Before we roll, I want to intervene. My character leads a commando team through the secret paths to sabotage their water supply."

**GM**: "Perfect! Let's play that out..."

_[They zoom in for 15 minutes of tense infiltration, including skill checks, a brief combat with guards, and Sarah's character poisoning the fortress's main well while barely escaping]_

**GM**: "Success! Their 'Poisoned Water Supply' reduces the CN by 6. You're now rolling against CN 3—this siege is almost guaranteed to succeed. The question is how the story unfolds..."

**Sarah**: "Here's my roll for the siege itself: d8 gets a 5, plus my Might d10 gets 8, plus my 'Veteran Commander' profession at rank 3. Total of 16 versus CN 3!"

**GM**: "The poisoned water throws the defenders into chaos. As your forces attack at dawn, the gates open—desperate soldiers would rather surrender than die of thirst. Thornwall is yours! This success becomes the asset 'Controlled Mountain Passes' for your larger campaign stratagem..."

## Quick Reference

### When to Stratagem

- Multiple people must coordinate
- You're managing from a distance
- Extended time periods (days to years)
- The details would be boring to play through

### Basic Sequence

1. **Declare** objective and approach
2. **GM sets** Challenge Number transparently
3. **Intervene** if desired (zoom in for dramatic scenes)
4. **Roll** d8 + ability + profession + aspect
5. **Narrate** results and consequences

### Success Guidelines

- **Positional**: One success achieves the goal
- **Light Accumulation**: 2-3 successes
- **Moderate Accumulation**: 4-5 successes
- **Major Accumulation**: 6-7 successes
- **Epic Accumulation**: 10+ successes

### Intervention Impact

- **Minor** (±3 CN): Small advantages or setbacks
- **Major** (±6 CN): Significant tide-turners
- **Dramatic** (±9+ CN): Legendary moments

Remember: Stratagems exist to skip the tedious parts while preserving the exciting ones. When something would be fun to play through, zoom in and play it. When you need to resolve complex coordinated efforts, zoom out with a stratagem. The goal is always to get to the next interesting decision or dramatic moment.
