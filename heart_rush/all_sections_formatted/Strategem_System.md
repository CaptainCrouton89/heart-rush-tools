# Stratagem System

**A Stratagem is any complex endeavor requiring multiple coordinated actions involving multiple agents** - from minutes-long boarding actions to years-long empire building. Stratagems can nest within each other like Russian dolls.

_Note: Stratagems use a d100 roll plus your most relevant ability die compared against the CN. This reflects the many variables and uncertainties of large-scale actions._

## Core Concepts

### Stratagems Have Layers

Your ultimate goal might be "Become Pirate King" (a Grand stratagem taking years), which requires "Build Fearsome Reputation" (Strategic, taking months), which requires "Capture the Merchant Prince's Galleon" (Tactical, taking hours), which requires "Close to Boarding Range" (Immediate, taking minutes).

### Two Types of Objectives

**Positional Objectives**: Achieved with a single success

- "Reach cannon range"
- "Breach the walls"
- "Establish trade route"
- Success changes the situation fundamentally

**Accumulation Objectives**: Require multiple successes

- "Sink their ship" (3 successes)
- "Convert the population" (5 successes)
- "Destroy their army" (7 successes)
- Each success brings you closer; failures may make completion harder or impossible

## Running Stratagems

### 1. Define the Current Stratagem

- **Objective**: What specific thing are you trying to achieve?
- **Type**: Positional or Accumulation?
- **Opposition**: What resists you?
- **Pace**: How much time each attempt represents
- **Parent Goal**: What larger stratagem does this serve? (if any)

### 2. The Action Cycle

Each **action** in a stratagem follows these steps:

**Situation**: Where things stand based on previous actions

**Approach**: How you're trying to achieve the objective this time

**Stakes**:

- GM evaluates assets and hindrances against what's typical
- GM sets CN (Easy 30, Moderate 50, Hard 70, Extreme 90)
- Players always know the final CN before rolling

**Intervention**: Players should actively shape stratagems!

- Direct actions can dramatically shift difficulty - for better or worse
- Impact varies from minor (±10) to game-changing (±40 or more)
- Must make narrative sense

**Helpful Examples**:

- Kill enemy captain during boarding = Ship battle CN drops from 70 to 30
- Sabotage fortress water supply = Siege CN drops by 20
- Rescue captured spy = Gain crucial asset "Inside information"
- Seduce enemy general = Could drop battle CN from 90 to 50!

**Harmful Examples**:

- Botched assassination attempt = "Enemy on high alert" (+20 CN)
- Failed negotiation insults their culture = "Diplomatic incident" hindrance
- Captured while scouting = Lose asset "Element of surprise"
- Accidentally reveal your supply routes = Enemy gains "Intelligence on your logistics"

**Roll**: Player spearheading the endeavor rolls d100 + their most relevant ability die

**Resolution**:

- **Success (Positional)**: Achieve objective, situation fundamentally changes, often gain relevant assets
- **Success (Accumulation)**: Add one success toward your goal
- **Failure**: May create obstacles, add hindrances, reduce progress, or fundamentally alter situation
- **Complications** (1 on any die): After determining success/failure, zoom in to handle immediate crisis

### 3. When Objectives Complete

**Positional Success**:

- Situation fundamentally changes
- Often creates assets for parent stratagem
- May open new child stratagems

**Accumulation Complete**:

- Target achieved (ship sinks, army breaks, etc.)
- Usually creates major asset for parent stratagem
- Opposition may no longer exist

**Abandonment**:

- Either side can abandon a stratagem when the cost exceeds the benefit
- This often creates hindrances ("Shows cowardice", "Damaged morale")

## Nested Example: The Pirate King

**Grand Stratagem**: Become Pirate King

- _Accumulation_: Need 10 "Legendary Deeds"
- _Pace_: Each attempt represents ~6 months of operations

**Strategic Stratagem**: Capture the Merchant Prince's Galleon (counts as 1 Legendary Deed)

- _Positional_: Success means you have the ship
- _Pace_: Days of hunting and preparation

This breaks down into:

**Tactical Stratagem**: Naval Battle

- First: _Positional_ - "Close to engagement range"
- Then: _Accumulation_ - "Cripple and board" (need 2 successes)
- _Pace_: Each action represents ~10 minutes

Which might require:

**Immediate Stratagem**: The Chase

- _Accumulation_: Build 3 "Distance" successes before they get 3 "Escape" successes
- _Pace_: Each action represents ~2 minutes
- Assets like "Faster ship" or "Expert navigator" reduce CN
- Hindrances like "Damaged sails" or "Rocky waters" increase CN

## Types of Actions Within Stratagems

### Persistent Actions

Some objectives naturally repeat until circumstances change:

- Chasing/Fleeing (continues until distance achieved or abandoned)
- Siege bombardment (continues until walls breach or supplies run out)
- Conversion efforts (continues until population shifts or rulers intervene)

### Evolving Actions

The specific action changes based on progress:

- Naval battle: "Close distance" → "Engage with cannons" → "Board and capture"
- Siege: "Surround fortress" → "Starve defenders" → "Assault walls"
- Trade war: "Undercut prices" → "Bribe officials" → "Establish monopoly"

### Conditional Actions

Available only when circumstances allow:

- "Ram their ship" (only when adjacent)
- "Inspire the troops" (only when morale is low)
- "Call in favors" (only when you have favors to call)

## Assets & Hindrances

Assets and hindrances represent what makes YOUR forces/situation better or worse than typical. They don't describe enemy weaknesses - the GM tracks opposition separately.

**Assets** represent your advantages:

- "Veteran crew" (your sailors are exceptional)
- "The high ground" (you control superior terrain)
- "Fresh supplies" (your forces are well-provisioned)
- "Magical fair winds" (supernatural aid helps you)

**Hindrances** represent your problems:

- "Ship taking on water" (your vessel is damaged)
- "Demoralized troops" (your forces lack spirit)
- "Saboteur in ranks" (internal threats weaken you)
- "Operating blind" (you lack crucial information)

### How Assets & Hindrances Work

When determining CN, the GM considers:

1. What would be typical difficulty for this objective?
2. How do your assets make you more capable?
3. How do your hindrances impede you?
4. What is the enemy's current state? (GM tracks separately)
5. Final CN: Easy (30), Moderate (50), Hard (70), or Extreme (90)

## Key Principles

### Fiction Determines Structure

If it makes sense for a chase to continue indefinitely, it does. If a single cannon volley could end everything, it might. Let the narrative guide whether something is positional or accumulation.

### Progress Persists

Successes toward accumulation objectives remain even if you fail subsequent rolls or pivot to other strategies. Those 2 successes toward "Sink their ship" don't disappear on a failure - though failure might create new obstacles that make future success harder. Only specific narrative circumstances (like "they repaired the damage") would reduce accumulated successes.

### Abandonment Has Consequences

Walking away from a stratagem may have costs. Failed sieges might create hindrances like "Wasted resources" or damage your reputation, but sometimes retreating is simply prudent. The GM should make abandonment meaningful when it matters to the fiction.

### Zoom Appropriately

- Personal combat: Use normal combat rules, not stratagems
- Fleet battles: Use stratagems for overall battle, zoom to combat for boarding
- Trade wars: Use stratagems for market control, zoom to roleplay for key negotiations
- Complications: Always zoom in after determining success/failure of the roll

## Quick Reference

**Starting Any Stratagem**:

1. Define objective (Positional or Accumulation?)
2. Identify parent stratagem (if any)
3. Set pace and opposition
4. Determine success requirements

**Each Action**:

1. Situation → 2. Approach → 3. Stakes (CN) → 4. Intervention → 5. Roll → 6. Resolution

**Accumulation Tracking**:

- Light: 2-3 successes needed
- Moderate: 4-5 successes needed
- Heavy: 6-7 successes needed
- Epic: 10+ successes needed
- Versus: Successes = target's capacity

**Remember**: Stratagems nest, actions persist, and the fiction always leads.
