# Experience & Advancement

Your character's journey doesn't end with creation—through experience points (XP), you'll unlock new abilities, strengthen existing talents, and shape your hero's growth to match your evolving playstyle. Each point of XP represents hard-won lessons, mastered techniques, and the raw power gained from facing danger head-on.

## How Experience Works

Experience points fuel your character's advancement between adventures. Unlike rigid level systems, Heart Rush lets you choose exactly how your character develops—whether that's becoming tougher, more skilled, or unlocking entirely new capabilities.

### Gaining Experience

Your GM awards XP based on the campaign's focus and pacing. Common triggers include:

- **Pursuing Goals**: Achieving personal or party objectives
- **Story Milestones**: Completing major narrative arcs
- **Combat Victory**: Overcoming dangerous encounters
- **Session Length**: Consistent play rewards steady progress

**GM Guidance**: Award XP equal to the party's average combat rank as a baseline—this keeps characters advancing every few sessions. For faster progression, increase this by one or two points. Always communicate your XP triggers to players so they understand what drives advancement.

### When to Spend Experience

You can purchase upgrades:

- Between sessions
- During downtime in a session
- Any time you're not actively in combat

Choose upgrades that reflect your character's recent experiences or prepare them for upcoming challenges.

## Advancement Options

Each upgrade type serves a different purpose in shaping your character:

### Understanding Your Options

**Aspects** define who your character is and what they excel at. New aspects broaden your capabilities, while increasing existing ones deepens your expertise. Changing aspects costs nothing because character growth should never be penalized.

**Hit Points** represent your stamina and ability to withstand punishment. Each purchase adds 10 HP, making you significantly more durable in extended conflicts.

**Ability Dice** determine your raw potential in different areas. Higher dice mean more consistent success and spectacular results. Note that your Heart Die increases automatically through experience milestones (see below).

**Talents** provide specific techniques and abilities:

- **Combat Talents** enhance your effectiveness in battle
- **Noncombat Talents** expand your options outside fights
- **Elemental Talents** require elemental attunement but offer powerful magical effects

**Destiny Levels** transform good talents into legendary abilities, unlocking their full potential once you've mastered the basics.

## Automatic Progression

Your Heart Die—representing your character's spirit and determination—grows automatically as you accumulate experience:

| Total XP  | Heart Die | What This Means                         |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **0-199** | **d8**    | Starting hero finding their path        |
| **200+**  | **d10**   | Seasoned adventurer with proven mettle  |
| **500+**  | **d12**   | Veteran hero whose name carries weight  |
| **1000+** | **d20**   | Legendary champion of tremendous spirit |

These upgrades happen automatically when you reach each threshold—no purchase necessary. Your growing Heart Die reflects the confidence and inner strength that comes from surviving countless dangers.
