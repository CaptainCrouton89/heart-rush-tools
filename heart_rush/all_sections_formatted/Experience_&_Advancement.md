# Experience & Advancement

Over the course of many games, you will gain more and more XP.

With this XP, you can purchase new, interesting features for your character.

Characters grow and develop through experience points (XP), which represent lessons learned, skills honed, and power gained through adventuring.

### Gaining Experience

**GM Note:**
Granting XP equal to players' combat rank is a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading their character every few sessions.

If you want slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this by one, or even two can be okay.

It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players.

They can decide what they want to award XP for, depending on the type of game they want to run.

Common triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing goals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning combats, or just length of session.

Whatever the metric for determining XP, the GM should communicate this to the players.

### Spending Experience

Between sessions, or during sessions so long as you are not in combat, you may spend XP to access new features.

Use the following chart to find the cost of your desired new feature.
