# Combat

Combat occurs in rounds, broken up by abilities and engagements. Engagements are short scenes of combat between participants, and are used to abstract the actions of multiple combatants all trying to attack each other. During each round, everyone will have the chance to use whatever abilities they can and take actions, with sides alternating until no one wants to do anything more.

## Starting Combat

When combat begins, determine which side acts first. If one side wasn't expecting to get attacked, the other side goes first. If both sides saw combat coming, the players should roll 1d6 to determine which side gets to act first, with a 4 or higher resulting in the players going first. The starting side will begin each subsequent round first.

### Engagements are important

Engagements are the core of Heart Rush combat, and they might take a bit of time to wrap your head around. There's a whole section (Engaging the Enemy) on it, but the idea is that you're entering a chaotic melee where anyone could get hurt, including yourself.

## Alternating Actions

Combat flows with sides taking turns:

1. The active side chooses any character on their side to take an action or use an ability
2. The turn passes to the other side, who chooses any character on their side to act
3. This continues, alternating between sides
4. If a side has nothing they want to do, they pass their turn
5. The round ends when both sides pass consecutively

Note that abilities with the instant tag do not require a turn, can be used at any time, and do not cause the turn to pass to the other side.

## During Combat

During each round of combat, you can take up to one action, and use any number of abilities (following the frequency restrictions on the abilities themselves).

### Actions

You get one action per round. All actions are abilities, and you must use your turn to take them.

Note that the Dash action, Object Interaction action, and Call Out action do not cost an action the first time you perform them each round.

#### Engage the Enemy

Full action.  
As an action, you may engage with the enemy. This does not guarantee that you'll injure them, or even hit them in the first place. In fact, they might hit you instead.

Rules for engagement are complicated, and are described in detail in the Engaging the Enemy section below. As a simple analogy, using your action to engage the enemy can be described as initiating a rock-paper-scissors game of combat with the enemy, with the victor having the chance to injure the loser.

#### Cast a Spell

Full action.  
See the Spellcasting section for details and restrictions on casting spells. You cannot cast a spell if you do not know any spells.

#### Sidestep

Full action\*.  
Rather than using an action, you may instead spend a rush point to perform this ability.

When you take this action, you may move 5 feet or stand up from prone. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Dash

Full action\*.  
The first dash you take each round does not cost your action.

Move a number of feet up to or equal to your move speed. Unless stated otherwise, your move speed is 60 before accounting for equipment.

If you move more than 5 feet within a creature's melee range or leave their melee range without taking the sidestep action, the creature may make an opportunity attack against you. Resolve the attack before leaving the creature's range and completing the movement.

#### Object Interaction

Full action\*.  
The first object interaction you take each round does not cost your action.

Any sort of simple interaction with an object counts as an interaction action. Stowing a weapon or shield, or drawing a new one each count as an object interaction. Stowing a weapon and retrieving a new one are two separate object interactions.

#### Help

Full action.  
You aid another creature. Choose an adjacent creature. That creature gets advantage on its next A/D roll, skill check, or saving throw.

#### Call out

Full action\*.  
The first call out you make each round does not cost your action.

Say (or shout out) something. Up to one, reasonable-length sentence.

### Instant Actions

Below are some actions that you can take at instant speed, even while another creature is doing an action. They do not cause turns to pass to the other side.

#### Enter an Engagement

Full action. Instant.  
As an action, you may enter an engagement that has already been initiated between other characters but has not yet begun. Unlike other abilities, you do not need to use your turn for this ability. Instead, immediately after someone uses the Engage the Enemy action, everyone has the choice to take this.

[[Hard to get, but Great Opportunity attacks are like gold. They're hard to get, but when you do, you can throw everything you've got into the roll and nail the target exactly the way you want. For this reason, enemies will do a lot to avoid getting hit with them. Use that to your advantage.]]  
There must be a valid target in range of your weapon who is already part of the engagement in order to enter. To continue the analogy from the explanation of engaging the enemy, this is like deciding to jump into a rock-paper-scissors game going on between the people around you, and choosing to play as well.

#### Trip

Full action. Instant.  
Whenever a creature with a level of off-balanced moves (willingly or forced) through a space that is adjacent to you, if that creature is no more than one size larger than you, you may trip the creature, immediately knocking it prone in that space.

#### Opportunity Attack

Full action\*. Instant.  
Rather than using an action, you may instead spend a rush point to perform this ability.

Opportunity attacks represent moments when an enemy has presented an easily exploited weakness. They let you make an attack against them without first winning an engagement.

You can only take this action if one or more of the following conditions is met:

- The enemy willingly leaves your melee reach without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy willingly moves more than 5 feet within your melee reach without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy stands up without using the sidestep action.
- You are hidden.
- The target of your action is surprised.

When you take this action, make an attack roll against the creature with the stance of your choice.

## Rush Points

Rush represents the excitement and tension of a fight. As a fight goes on, rush points build, and you can perform more and more powerful moves. Rush is represented with a pool of points. At the start of combat, you have one rush point. At the beginning of each subsequent round, you gain rush points equal to the number of rounds in which you were part of an engagement, made an opportunity attack, or cast a spell, up to the current number of rounds. Other abilities may increase this pool further.

Unspent rush points are lost at the end of every round. Outside of combat, you have 0 rush points.

## Minor Abilities

[[Typical Rounds  
In most rounds, you'll want to move a bit— the first dash is free—and you'll want to start or enter an engagement, since that's the main way to deal damage. Sprinkled throughout, you'll use various abilities and occasionally you'll want to do something else with your action, but moving and engaging is the gist.]]

Minor abilities are special abilities unique to your class and subclass. Whenever you use a minor ability, you must spend one rush point for each time you've used the ability, including the current use. You have multiple minor abilities, so you will have to manage how many times you've used each separately. They do not require you to spend an action, but there may be limitations on when you can use them.

## Major Abilities

Major abilities are like ultimate moves your character has. Unlike minor abilities, major abilities can only be used once per day. Major abilities gained from your class have additional, optional rush point costs, meaning that your major abilities will get stronger and stronger the longer the fight lasts. They do not require you to spend an action, but there may be limitations on when you can use them.

## Special Use Cases

Rush points can also be spent to make opportunity attacks or to sidestep.

## Engaging the Enemy

An engagement with the enemy may be a short flurry of crossing blows, or it may be part of a larger melee with dozens of combatants.

In either case, when you first decide to engage the enemy—taking the Engage the Enemy action—choose an enemy you could theoretically hit with the weapon you are currently wielding. You and this enemy are now part of the engagement. The enemy does not have a choice in entering this engagement, and participating in this engagement does not cost them their action.

Once an engagement has begun, other creatures get a chance to join. Other creatures within weapon range of anyone in the engagement may decide to enter the engagement as well. If they wish to do so, they can spend their action to join the engagement. This is the Enter an Engagement action.

### Choosing Stances

Once everyone who wants to and is allowed to join the engagement has done so, every combatant within the engagement must secretly choose their stance: might, agility, cunning, or the defensive stance. Once everyone has chosen, everyone must reveal their choice. Attacks proceed in a manner similar to rock paper scissors, as outlined in the sections below.

Note that if the players wish to discuss which stance to choose among themselves, the GM should choose the stance for the enemies before the players decide for their characters, to prevent any accusations of cheating by reacting to the decisions made by the players.

### Stance Reference Chart

| Your Stance   | Beats   | Beaten By | Can Attack                      | Special Rules                                |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cunning**   | Agility | Might     | Agility, Defensive, Same Stance | Attacks first; Applies conditions vs Agility |
| **Agility**   | Might   | Cunning   | Might, Defensive, Same Stance   | Free sidestep; Attacks second                |
| **Might**     | Cunning | Agility   | Cunning, Defensive, Same Stance | Weapon might bonus; Attacks last             |
| **Defensive** | None    | All       | None                            | Takes half damage after defense              |

**Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Cunning → Agility → Might → Cunning  
**Same Stance**: Make contested attack rolls instead of separate attack/defense  
**Resolution Order**: Cunning → Agility → Might

### Quick Examples

- **Cunning vs Agility**: Cunning attacks first, applies conditions
- **Agility vs Might**: Agility sidesteps and attacks
- **Might vs Cunning**: Might gets weapon bonus damage
- **Same Stance**: Both make contested attack rolls
- **vs Defensive**: Attack normally, they take half damage

#### Cunning Stance

- **Beats**: Agility stance
- **Attacks**: Anyone who didn't choose Might stance
- **When**: First in resolution order
- **Bonus vs Agility**: Apply up to two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened

Those who chose cunning are able to easily read and avoid the attacks of anyone who can't beat them with raw strength, and get to make an attack against a single creature in the engagement that didn't take the might stance. Creatures that chose the cunning stance make their attack rolls first, in any order.

#### Agility Stance

- **Beats**: Might stance
- **Attacks**: Anyone who didn't choose Cunning stance
- **When**: Second in resolution order
- **Special**: Free sidestep before or after attack

Those who chose agility are able to maneuver their way past those who can't read their actions, and get to make an attack against a single creature in the engagement that didn't take the cunning stance. Creatures that chose the agility stance can make their attack rolls after all of the cunning stance attack rolls have been made.

Also, if you choose this stance, you may take the sidestep action for free during the engagement, right before or after you make your attack. Creatures that choose to attack before moving get to attack before creatures that sidestep and then attack. If creatures on opposite sides of a fight get to move via the agility stance, both sides should alternate who moves, starting with whichever side was originally engaged with.

#### Might Stance

- **Beats**: Cunning stance
- **Attacks**: Anyone who didn't choose Agility stance
- **When**: Last in resolution order
- **Bonus vs Cunning**: Trigger weapon's might stance bonus

Those who chose might are able to crush those who are not agile enough to get out of the way, and get to make an attack against a single creature in the engagement that didn't take the agility stance. Creatures that chose the might stance make their attack rolls last.

Additionally, whenever you attack a creature defending with the cunning stance, you trigger your weapon's might stance bonus. Check out the Weapons section to learn more.

#### Defensive Stance

- **Attacks**: No one
- **Defense**: Halve damage after subtracting defense roll
- **Target**: Can be attacked by any stance

Anyone who chose the defensive stance does not get to attack, but will not take as much damage. After subtracting your defense from an attack, halve the remaining damage, rounding up.

### Resolution

After everyone has revealed their stance, it is time for attacks. Everyone may attack one other character that their stance beats, and is within range of their weapon. All stances beat defensive stance. If no one else took a stance that they could beat, or they aren't in range of your weapon, you cannot attack in this engagement.

Attacks should happen in order of:

- Cunning
- Agility
- Might

Starting with cunning, anyone who chose the cunning stance may choose to attack each other or anyone who chose the agility or defensive stance. Proceed in order.

Although attacks of the same stance may not literally happen simultaneously, treat them as though they did. For example, if you push a creature away with a melee weapon using the might stance, it cannot prevent them from attacking a creature that they were previously in range of hitting with the might stance. Likewise, if the attack would kill them, they still get to hit another creature first.

Note that if an attack pushes a target before the target's stance goes, such as if a cunning attacker pushed someone who had chosen agility, the target might not be in range of anyone any more, and would be unable to attack or be attacked during the subsequent turns for the remaining stances.

#### Attacking

If you get to attack someone, you make an attack roll consisting of your heart die + ability die for the [[Example  
You initiate a fight, and dash towards the undead orc in front of you. The turn passes to the enemies. The orc's undead wolf dashes, coming adjacent to you as well. The turn passes back to you and your allies. Your ally decides she wants to shoot the first orc with an arrow, announcing she's entering an engagement. Since an engagement has started, other creatures can join before it resolves.  
You decide to join the engagement, since you can attack the orc too. The undead hound joins the engagement as well. The orc is already in the engagement, so it doesn't have to use its action to join.  
The engagement begins. You coordinate with your archer ally—you'll choose might, she'll choose agility. You announce you're ready, and stances are revealed. The orc chose might, and the hound chose cunning. Time to resolve attacks.  
Cunning happens first. Although cunning beats agility, the hound is not adjacent to your archer friend, so the hound does nothing.  
Agility comes next. Your ally chose agility, which beats the might stance of the orc. Your ally, seeing she's got the upper hand, decides to use her Execute ability, meaning her attack will deal a lot more damage. She makes an attack roll against the orc, and the orc makes a defense roll. The orc decides it's more damage than he's interested in, and decides to reduce his heart die to halve the damage. He remains alive.  
After agility comes might. You and the orc both chose might. Since you chose might, you can attack either the orc (since you tied stances), or the hound (might beats cunning). You decide to attack the orc since the orc is a greater threat and you want him dead. However, the orc decided to attack you as well, since you were its only target. You each make contested attack rolls, with the loser taking the difference in damage. Unfortunately you roll a bit lower, so you end up taking a few points of damage.  
The engagement ends, since everyone who can attack has done so. The other side now gets to act. At this point, nobody except for the orc has an action left, since the orc didn't have to use an action to join the engagement (they were forced to join). The orc might enter an engagement again with you, in which case nobody else would have actions left to join, or they might not. Combat continues with sides alternating. stance you chose + weapon die. Then, the defending creature makes a defense roll using their heart die + ability die corresponding to the stance you chose + armor bonuses.]]  
After both sides roll, the defender then takes damage equal to the result of the attack roll minus the defense roll. If this would be negative, the defender instead takes no damage. See the next section to determine how damage is dealt with.

Note that if you are attacking someone who is attacking you back with the same stance, make contested attack rolls rather than two separate attack and defense rolls.  
Anyone can attack someone who takes the defense stance. Make contested rolls as normal, but the resulting damage is halved.

### After the Engagement

After the engagement resolves, the turn passes to the side that was targeted when the engagement first started, and combat continues as usual.

## Taking Damage

When you take damage, you can choose to use some of your stamina to "shrug off" or "dodge" the injury. In this case, you take half as much damage, but your heart die falls one size. If you cannot decrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you must take the full amount of damage.

Regardless, whatever damage you do take gets subtracted from your hit points. If this would cause your hit points to reach a negative amount equal to your maximum hit points, you are dead.

### More than 10 Damage

If you take 10 or more damage, this represents serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit points, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain English description of the wound. For example, a wound could be "a nasty gash in your arm," or "a fractured leg," or "your guts are spilling out". Write this down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound. The rank is equal to the amount of damage you took. Read more about wounds in the next section.

## Wounds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points. Whenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase your hit points beyond your normal maximum minus the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you normally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have 23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit points.

Outside of combat, wounds are like aspects, which you can read about in the Aspects section (page 10). Since they have a description and a rank, you or the GM can invoke them for a penalty on a roll equal to the rank of the wound, in exchange for DP equal to the rank of the wound, up to 5.

### Treating wounds

Whenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it treated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large amount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a medicine skill check and reduce the rank of all untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by the rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's rank below zero, remove the wound completely.

If you are treating your own wounds, you have disadvantage.  
You can treat any number of wounds at once, but once a wound has been treated it cannot be treated again. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal over time when you take long rests. See the Rests & Healing section for more details.

## Zero Hit points

When your hit points reach zero, you are in bad condition. If you wish, you may choose to go unconscious. If you do not, you fall unconscious anyway after 10 minutes. If you take damage while at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and any wounds—you can go into the negative.

If your hit points ever reach an amount equal to or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.

Once you are unconscious, you remain unconscious so long as your hit points are zero or fewer.  
You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by taking rests. Read more in the Rests & Healing section.

### Why would I go unconscious??

If you're in a nasty fight, combatants tend to try to attack the people who are still fighting back. If you go unconscious, people usually won't view you as a threat, so you're a lot less likely to be attacked (and potentially die). Things trying to eat you generally don't abide by this, so in some cases this is definitely not recommended…

[[Example  
You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before it moves past you and attacks your badly hurt friend. You enter an engagement with it, choose stances, and stances are revealed. You chose cunning, and it chose agility. Since cunning beats agility, you get to attack. However, since you're trying to grapple it, you decide not to attack, and instead make a might check. Your ally used the help action earlier in the round, so you have advantage. The wolf makes an agility check to avoid getting grappled, but it rolls less than you. The wolf is now grappled, and you are now grappling. The wolf is stuck.]]

## Other Offensive Actions

If you want to do something to an enemy other than hit it with a weapon, such as grapple it, climb onto it, or otherwise mess with it, it still begins with winning an engagement. However, you must win the engagement by directly beating their stance—both choosing the same stance does not let you perform these types of acts. Assuming you have directly beaten their stance, you may forgo your attack roll and instead use one of these other options. If you do, the effects of the offensive action occur after all attack rolls have been made.

Some of these options require a contested skill check, rather than an attack and defense roll. These contested checks still receive advantage or disadvantage as though they were an attack or defense roll of their corresponding ability, but they should not use any additional dice (such as from your weapon) or bonuses from armor.

### Grappling

Make a might ability check against an adjacent creature, contested by the creature's own might or agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You gain the condition grappling and the opposing creature gains the condition grappled.

Unless otherwise specified, at least one hand must be free to grapple another creature. You can grapple with one or two hands. If grappling with only one hand, halve your grapple ability check, rounding up.

A creature can only be grappled by one creature at a time, and can only grapple one creature at a time.

While grappling a creature, rather than pushing the creature when you use the might stance, you may choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every size greater you are than the grappled creature.

### Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check contested by the creature's might or agility ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature. So long as you are on the creature, you have the creature climber condition. Likewise, the climbed on creature has the climbed on condition.

A creature can only climb on one creature at a time.

### Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform some other sort of option that interferes with your target. This could be represented by throwing sand in their eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target with this ability.

Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature 5 feet. It travels 5 feet less for every size larger than you it is, and 5 feet more for every size smaller. The creature gains 2 levels of off-balanced.

### Stunt

Choose your own effect, with the GM's permission. This could be something like stealing an item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their sword by the blade to turn it into clay, trying to taunt the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet.

In these cases, make a contested ability check against the creature.

## Special Circumstances

Combat doesn't always begin on equal footing. Various circumstances can dramatically alter how a fight unfolds, giving advantages or disadvantages to different participants.

### Surprise

In some cases when combat begins, one or more parties will be completely surprised, giving anyone who was already prepared to fight a large advantage.

Combat special rules apply in these circumstances.

A creature is not surprised if they can see their opponent before the round begins, and they are unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or don't know their opponent.

If one of the parties in an encounter is completely surprised by combat, then each un-surprised creature can use their action to make an opportunity attack, and each surprised creature does not get to use abilities or move on the first round of combat.

### Attacking the Helpless

Sometimes, you will make attacks against creatures that are completely unable to defend themselves. At the GM's discretion, you may make an opportunity attack against the creature. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

### Cover

Cover is an important part of staying alive—if you remain behind cover, you remain safe from ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist between the attacker and the defender. Determining what type of cover you have from an attacker can be done by drawing imaginary lines between any one point on the attacker and each corner of a square that the enemy takes the space of. For each line that is obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack that creature.

Sometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to the line blocked method of determining cover. It is then up to the GM to decide how much cover should be awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small but not very helpful like a small tree in the way of your shot will provide one level of cover. Things that the defender has to poke their body out from behind to attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a couch, provide two levels of cover. Lastly, things that are specifically designed for uni-directional attacks, such as arrow slits, will provide three levels of cover.
