# Combat

When violence erupts in Heart Rush, everything happens at once—warriors clash, spells fly, and combatants scramble for position in a chaotic melee. To help you navigate this chaos, the game splits each round into two phases: maneuvering for advantage and the inevitable clash of battle. In reality, these occur simultaneously over just a few seconds, but separating them lets you make tactical decisions while capturing the frenetic energy of real combat.

## Understanding Combat Flow

Combat unfolds in rounds, with each round representing a brief but intense exchange where everyone acts nearly simultaneously. During each round, you'll experience:

1. **The Action Phase** - You maneuver, cast spells, and position yourself while enemies do the same
2. **The Engagement** - Everyone comes together in an explosive exchange of attacks

This structure means you're never waiting for your turn. You act when it makes sense, interrupting and reacting dynamically. Think of it like a movie fight scene—people don't politely take turns hitting each other.

## Starting Combat

When violence erupts, combat begins immediately. There's no initiative to roll, no order to establish. You simply declare what you want to do and start doing it. The game uses a simple system to resolve conflicts when timing matters, but otherwise, everything flows naturally from the situation.

## The Action Phase

During the action phase, any combatant can declare and execute actions at any time. This creates the fluid, cinematic experience of a real fight where combatants react to each other dynamically. You might dash across the battlefield while an enemy archer draws their bow, or cast a spell as a warrior charges toward you.

**You get one action per round**, plus free movement up to your speed and the ability to speak. The key is choosing your moment—once you've used your action, you're committed until the next round.

### When Timing Matters

Sometimes multiple combatants want to act at the exact same moment—two archers racing to shoot first, or warriors trying to reach the same strategic position. When timing matters, here's how you resolve it:

**1. Compare Agility Die Size**
The combatant with the larger agility die acts first:

- d12 → d10 → d8 → d6 → d4

**2. Players Win Ties**
When combatants have the same die size, player characters act before NPCs

**3. Contested Rolls for Player Conflicts**
If players disagree on timing, make contested agility skill checks

This system means naturally agile combatants tend to act faster, but anyone can seize the initiative when opportunity strikes.

### Actions You Can Take

**Dash**  
Move a number of feet up to or equal to your move speed. Unless stated otherwise, your move speed is 60 before accounting for equipment.

If you move more than 5 feet within a creature's melee range or leave their melee range without sidestepping, the creature may make an opportunity attack against you.

**Cast a Spell**  
Cast a spell you know. Note that cantrips work differently—they're used during the engagement instead of weapon attacks.

See the Spellcasting section for details and restrictions on casting spells.

**Sidestep**  
Uses your action, or you may instead spend a rush point to perform this ability.

Move 5 feet or stand up from prone. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks—you're moving carefully and defensively.

**Object Interaction**  
The first object interaction each round is free. Additional interactions use your action.

Simple interactions count: drawing or stowing a weapon, opening a door, picking up an item. Complex actions like picking a lock would be a full action.

**Help**  
Aid an adjacent creature. They get advantage on their next ability check, saving throw, or attack/defense roll. You're providing cover, creating distractions, or lending a hand.

**Trip**  
When a creature with off-balanced moves through a space adjacent to you, you may trip them if they're no more than one size larger. They immediately fall prone in that space.

**Actions From Abilities**
Some abilities state that you can use them by spending an action. If they do, they have to happen during this phase, and they use your action.

**Other Actions**  
Attempt other actions with GM approval—breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, or creative solutions to problems. If it takes focus and effort, it probably uses your action.

### Opportunity Attacks

Opportunity attacks represent those perfect moments when an enemy drops their guard. They let you strike outside the normal flow of combat, delivering devastating blows when enemies make mistakes.

**Uses your action**, or spend a rush point if you've already acted. When you make an opportunity attack, nobody can go before you. It's an immediate reaction to the activity at hand, so nobody quicker than you can interrupt.

You can only make opportunity attacks when:

- An enemy leaves your melee reach without sidestepping
- An enemy moves more than 5 feet within your reach without sidestepping
- An enemy stands up without sidestepping
- You are hidden from your target
- Your target is surprised

When you make an opportunity attack, roll with the stance of your choice—this is your chance to hit exactly how you want.

[[Why Opportunity Attacks Matter

Opportunity attacks are combat gold. When you get one, you can unleash your best attack without risking a counter. Enemies know this and will burn resources to avoid giving you these openings. Use that fear tactically—sometimes the threat is more valuable than the attack itself.]]

## The Engagement

After everyone has acted (or chosen not to), all combatants come together in the engagement. This mandatory clash represents the moment when careful maneuvering gives way to violent collision. Swords meet, spells discharge at point-blank range, and everyone fights for survival.

**The engagement is inevitable**. It doesn't cost an action and you can't opt out. If you're in the fight, you're in the engagement. This is the climactic moment of each round—the explosion of violence that follows all that careful positioning.

### How Engagements Work

When the engagement begins:

1. **Everyone Participates** - All conscious combatants are automatically included
2. **Choose Your Stance** - Secretly select might, agility, cunning, or defensive
3. **Reveal Together** - Everyone shows their choice simultaneously
4. **Resolve Attacks** - Based on stance matchups, combatants strike each other

The entire process represents a few seconds of furious combat where everyone acts nearly simultaneously, but the game breaks it down so you can make meaningful tactical choices.

### Understanding Stances

Your stance represents your fighting approach in this crucial moment. Each stance beats certain others in a deadly dance of combat psychology:

- **Cunning beats Agility** - You read their movements and exploit openings
- **Agility beats Might** - You flow around powerful attacks to strike back
- **Might beats Cunning** - You power through tricks with overwhelming force
- **Defensive** - You sacrifice offense for survival

### Choosing Your Stance

Every combatant secretly chooses their stance: might, agility, cunning, or defensive. Players can discuss strategy, but the GM must lock in enemy choices first to prevent reactive cheating. Once everyone has chosen, reveal all stances simultaneously.

This simultaneous reveal creates the tension of real combat—you must predict your opponents' moves while they try to predict yours.

**Important Stance Selection Clarifications:**

- **GM Locks In First** - If players want to discuss stance choices, the GM must choose and lock in all enemy stances before players finalize their decisions. This prevents any appearance of the GM reacting to player choices.

- **Secret Selection Methods** - Use whatever method works for your table: closed fists with fingers for numbers (1=might, 2=agility, 3=cunning, 4=defensive), cards face down, or simply writing on paper. The key is simultaneous reveal.

- **No Changing After Reveal** - Once stances are revealed, they're locked in. No take-backs, no "I meant to say..." Everyone lives with their choices.

- **Communication During Selection** - Players can freely discuss strategy during selection ("I'll go might to handle the orc"), but remember enemies might be listening. Clever GMs might have intelligent enemies react to overheard plans in future rounds.

### Stance Resolution Reference

| Your Stance   | Beats   | Beaten By | Can Attack                      | Special Rules                                |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cunning**   | Agility | Might     | Agility, Defensive, Same Stance | Attacks first; Applies conditions vs Agility |
| **Agility**   | Might   | Cunning   | Might, Defensive, Same Stance   | Free sidestep; Attacks second                |
| **Might**     | Cunning | Agility   | Cunning, Defensive, Same Stance | Weapon might bonus; Attacks last             |
| **Defensive** | None    | All       | None                            | Takes half damage after defense              |

**Resolution Order**: Cunning → Agility → Might

### Cunning Stance

Those who chose cunning read and exploit their opponents' movements with precision. You attack first in the resolution order, getting to strike before your victims can react.

**You can attack**: Anyone who chose agility, defensive, or cunning stance

**Special vs Agility**: When attacking someone in agility stance, apply up to two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened to your target. You've completely read their movements and left them reeling.

### Agility Stance

Those who chose agility dance through combat with fluid grace. You attack after cunning resolves but before might, weaving between heavy blows.

**You can attack**: Anyone who chose might, defensive, or agility stance

**Free Movement**: Take a free sidestep (5 feet, no opportunity attacks) right before or after your attack. If multiple combatants get this movement and the order matters, use the action phase order rules.

### Might Stance

Those who chose might bring overwhelming force to bear. You attack last but hit hardest, crushing those who can't dodge your assault.

**You can attack**: Anyone who chose cunning, defensive, or might stance

**Weapon Bonus**: When attacking someone in cunning stance, trigger your weapon's might stance bonus. Raw power defeats clever tricks.

### Defensive Stance

The defensive stance sacrifices all offense for survival. You cannot attack, but you're much harder to hurt.

**Damage Reduction**: After subtracting your defense from an incoming attack, halve the remaining damage (round up). This makes you incredibly resilient against focused fire.

**Everyone Can Target You**: All stances can attack defensive stance, but your damage reduction makes you a less appealing target.

### Resolution Process

Attacks resolve in strict order to maintain fairness and clarity:

1. **Cunning attacks** (in any order among cunning attackers)
2. **Agility attacks** (in any order among agility attackers)
3. **Might attacks** (in any order among might attackers)

Within each stance group, attacks effectively happen simultaneously. If two might attackers kill each other, both attacks still resolve. If cunning pushes someone away, they still get their attack if they already declared a valid target.

**Range and Positioning**: You can only attack targets within your weapon's range. Getting pushed or moved before your stance resolves might leave you unable to attack anyone.

**Same Stance Attacks**: When attacking someone with the same stance, make contested attack rolls (both roll attacks, higher wins, loser takes the difference in damage).

### Making Attack Rolls

When you attack, roll:

- **Heart die** (your current stamina and fighting spirit)
- **Ability die** (for the stance you chose)
- **Weapon die** (your weapon's damage potential)

The defender rolls:

- **Heart die**
- **Ability die** (matching your attack stance)
- **Armor bonus** (if applicable)

Damage dealt = Attack roll - Defense roll (minimum 0)

### Combat Example

_You initiate a fight, dashing toward the undead orc before you. The orc's undead wolf companion dashes forward, ending adjacent to you as well. Your archer ally declares she's shooting the orc, starting an engagement._

_Since an engagement has begun, only instant abilities can be used now. You join the engagement (free, since you're in combat). The wolf joins too. The orc is automatically included._

_The GM secretly chooses stances: orc picks might, wolf picks cunning. You and your ally coordinate—you'll take might to match the orc's likely choice, she'll use agility to avoid getting caught in melee. Stances are revealed simultaneously._

_Resolution begins:_

**Cunning Phase**: The wolf chose cunning but isn't adjacent to your agility-stance archer, so it can't attack her. It could attack you (cunning beats itself), but saves its energy.

**Agility Phase**: Your archer's agility beats the orc's might. Sensing advantage, she triggers her Execute ability for bonus damage. She rolls high, the orc rolls poorly on defense. The orc burns stamina, reducing his heart die to halve the incoming damage. He survives, barely.

**Might Phase**: You and the orc both chose might. You could attack either the orc (same stance) or the wolf (might beats cunning). You target the orc—finish what your ally started. The orc attacks you back. You make contested attack rolls. The orc rolls slightly higher, dealing you the difference in damage.

_The engagement ends. The orc still has an action (didn't need one to join the engagement), while everyone else has spent theirs. The round continues with new possibilities._

## Spellcasting in Combat

**Key Distinction: Two Types of Magic in Combat**

Heart Rush uses magic in two completely different ways during combat. Do not confuse these:

### Magic in Combat

- **Spells**: Use the Cast a Spell action during your turn. Strategic magic like _Wall of Fire_, _Fireball_, or _Telekinesis_ that reshapes the battlefield. Cannot be used during engagements unless you have special abilities.
- **Cantrips**: Replace weapon attacks within engagements. Choose cantrip OR weapon attack, not both. Follow normal stance rules for targeting and resolution.
- **Instant Spells**: Can interrupt at any time, including during other creatures' turns, though they still require your action (unless you use _Warcaster_).
- **Spelltouched + Warcaster**: Can cast spells without using action.

### Combat Flow Example

1. **Your turn**: Cast _Wall of Stone_ to control the battlefield using Cast a Spell action
2. **Enemy turn**: They engage you with melee weapons
3. **In engagement**: You attack with Lightning Bolt cantrip instead of your sword
4. **Mid-engagement**: If you're Spelltouched with Warcaster, and you hadn't cast a spell yet, you could cast _Temporal Hiccup_ to disrupt enemy dice rolls, since the spell is instant

This system separates strategic spellcasting (reshaping combat) from tactical magical attacks (replacing weapon strikes), with Spelltouched characters able to blend both seamlessly.

## Taking Damage

When you take damage, you can choose to use some of your stamina to "shrug off" or "dodge" the injury. In this case, you take half as much damage, but your heart die falls one size. If you cannot decrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you must take the full amount of damage.

Regardless, whatever damage you do take gets subtracted from your hit points. If this would cause your hit points to reach a negative amount equal to your maximum hit points, you are dead.

### More than 10 Damage

If you take 10 or more damage, this represents serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit points, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain English description of the wound. For example, a wound could be "a nasty gash in your arm," or "a fractured leg," or "your guts are spilling out". Write this down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound. The rank is equal to the amount of damage you took. Read more about wounds in the next section.

## Wounds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points. Whenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase your hit points beyond your normal maximum minus the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you normally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have 23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit points.

Wounds also have non-combat effects—they count as aspects in addition to their max-hp reducing effect. Like aspects, they have a description and a rank. You may use wounds as aspects as well, though you cannot gain more than 5 DP from invoking the wound, even if the rank of the wound is higher.

For example, if you have the rank 12 wound, "Guts spilling out," you could gain 5 DP by taking a minus 12 penalty to nearly any athletics check, since it'd be logical that having that type of wound would make it very difficult to do almost anything physical.

### Treating wounds

Whenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it treated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large amount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a medicine skill check and reduce the rank of all untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by the rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's rank below zero, remove the wound completely.

If you are treating your own wounds, you have disadvantage.  
You can treat any number of wounds at once, but once a wound has been treated it cannot be treated again. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal over time when you take long rests. See the Rests & Healing section for more details.

## Zero Hit points

When your hit points reach zero, you are in bad condition. If you wish, you may choose to go unconscious. If you do not, you fall unconscious anyway after 10 minutes. If you take damage while at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and any wounds—you can go into the negative.

If your hit points ever reach an amount equal to or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.

Once you are unconscious, you remain unconscious so long as your hit points are zero or fewer.  
You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by taking rests. Read more in the Rests & Healing section.

### Why would I go unconscious??

If you're in a nasty fight, combatants tend to try to attack the people who are still fighting back. If you go unconscious, people usually won't view you as a threat, so you're a lot less likely to be attacked (and potentially die). Things trying to eat you generally don't abide by this, so in some cases this is definitely not recommended…

[[Example  
You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before it moves past you and attacks your badly hurt friend. You enter an engagement with it, choose stances, and stances are revealed. You chose cunning, and it chose agility. Since cunning beats agility, you get to attack. However, since you're trying to grapple it, you decide not to attack, and instead make a might check. Your ally used the help action earlier in the round, so you have advantage. The wolf makes an agility check to avoid getting grappled, but it rolls less than you. The wolf is now grappled, and you are now grappling. The wolf is stuck.]]

## Other Offensive Actions

If you want to do something to an enemy other than hit it with a weapon, such as grapple it, climb onto it, or otherwise mess with it, it still begins with winning an engagement. However, you must win the engagement by directly beating their stance—both choosing the same stance does not let you perform these types of acts. Assuming you have directly beaten their stance, you may forgo your attack roll and instead use one of these other options. If you do, the effects of the offensive action occur after all attack rolls have been made.

Some of these options require a contested skill check, rather than an attack and defense roll. These contested checks still receive advantage or disadvantage as though they were an attack or defense roll of their corresponding ability, but they should not use any additional dice (such as from your weapon) or bonuses from armor.

### Grappling

Make a might ability check against an adjacent creature, contested by the creature's own might or agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You gain the condition grappling and the opposing creature gains the condition grappled.

Unless otherwise specified, at least one hand must be free to grapple another creature. You can grapple with one or two hands. If grappling with only one hand, halve your grapple ability check, rounding up.

A creature can only be grappled by one creature at a time, and can only grapple one creature at a time.

### Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check contested by the creature's might or agility ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature. So long as you are on the creature, you have the creature climber condition. Likewise, the climbed on creature has the climbed on condition.

A creature can only climb on one creature at a time.

### Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform some other sort of option that interferes with your target. This could be represented by throwing sand in their eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target with this ability.

Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature 5 feet. It travels 5 feet less for every size larger than you it is, and 5 feet more for every size smaller. The creature gains 2 levels of off-balanced.

### Stunt

Choose your own effect, with the GM's permission. This could be something like stealing an item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their sword by the blade to turn it into clay, trying to taunt the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet.

In these cases, make a contested ability check against the creature.

## Special Circumstances

Combat doesn't always begin on equal footing. Various circumstances can dramatically alter how a fight unfolds, giving advantages or disadvantages to different participants.

### Surprise

In some cases when combat begins, one or more parties will be completely surprised, giving anyone who was already prepared to fight a large advantage.

Combat special rules apply in these circumstances.

A creature is not surprised if they can see their opponent before the round begins, and they are unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or don't know their opponent.

If one of the parties in an encounter is completely surprised by combat, then each un-surprised creature can use their action to make an opportunity attack, and each surprised creature does not get to use abilities or move on the first round of combat.

### Attacking the Helpless

Sometimes, you will make attacks against creatures that are completely unable to defend themselves. At the GM's discretion, you may make an opportunity attack against the creature. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

### Cover

Cover is an important part of staying alive—if you remain behind cover, you remain safe from ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist between the attacker and the defender. Determining what type of cover you have from an attacker can be done by drawing imaginary lines between any one point on the attacker and each corner of a square that the enemy takes the space of. For each line that is obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack that creature.

Sometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to the line blocked method of determining cover. It is then up to the GM to decide how much cover should be awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small but not very helpful like a small tree in the way of your shot will provide one level of cover. Things that the defender has to poke their body out from behind to attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a couch, provide two levels of cover. Lastly, things that are specifically designed for uni-directional attacks, such as arrow slits, will provide three levels of cover.
