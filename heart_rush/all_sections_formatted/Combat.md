# Combat

Combat in Heart Rush erupts suddenly and resolves quickly. Everyone acts at once—you'll dash for cover while arrows whistle past, cast spells as warriors charge through your defenses, and scramble for position in a deadly dance where seconds matter. The game captures this chaos through two phases that flow seamlessly together: positioning for advantage and the brutal moment when steel meets flesh.

## Understanding Combat Flow

Each combat round spans just a few heartbeats of real time, yet contains countless decisions and reactions. During these intense exchanges, you experience:

1. **The Action Phase** - Combatants maneuver, unleash abilities, and jockey for position in real-time
2. **The Engagement** - All declared attacks resolve in a simultaneous clash

You never wait for your turn because there isn't one. You act when you see an opening, react when threatened, and seize opportunities as they arise. Everyone participates simultaneously, creating genuine tactical chaos where positioning and timing matter more than initiative order.

## Starting Combat

Violence doesn't wait for formalities. When blades clear leather or spells begin forming, combat starts immediately. No initiative rolls slow the action—you simply declare your intent and act. The game provides quick resolution methods when exact timing matters, but otherwise events unfold naturally from the fiction.

## The Action Phase

The action phase operates on instinct and opportunity. Any combatant can declare and execute actions whenever they choose, creating the fluid reality of actual combat. You might sprint for cover as an enemy archer nocks an arrow, or begin weaving protective magic while assassins close the distance.

### Understanding Actions and Abilities

**You get one action per round**. This represents your major physical commitment—dashing across the battlefield, helping a fallen ally, or similar focused efforts. Once spent, you cannot take another action until the next round.

**During the action phase, abilities never cost actions unless explicitly stated.** You can use as many abilities as you want throughout the action phase, limited only by any usage restrictions on the abilities themselves. The vast majority of your combat options are abilities, not actions.

**During the engagement, only instant abilities can be used.** These reactive abilities trigger in response to attacks, letting you defend, counter, or enhance your strikes in the heat of battle. Regular abilities must be activated during the action phase.

Think of it this way:

- **Actions**: The short list of basic options below, plus any ability that specifically says "uses your action"
- **Abilities**: Everything else—talents, combat legacy features, class abilities, equipment powers, magical effects, or anything that gives you an option in combat. Free to use during the action phase unless the ability itself says otherwise.
- **Instant Abilities**: Special reactive abilities marked as "instant" that can trigger during engagements

### Common Ability Restrictions

While most abilities flow freely, some have built-in limitations:

- **"Uses your action"**: These rare abilities consume your action when activated
- **"Once per round/combat/day"**: Self-explanatory usage limits
- **"Weekly/Monthly"**: Powerful effects with long-term restrictions

If an ability doesn't mention any restrictions, you can use it repeatedly throughout combat without spending your action.

### Example Action Phase

_Combat begins. You activate Iron Stance and Warrior's Momentum (regular abilities)—still haven't used your action. An enemy archer uses their action to dash to high ground while activating Sniper's Focus (regular ability). You trigger Anticipate (regular ability) to track their movement. You then dash behind a pillar (action spent). Later in the action phase, you can still use Defensive Stance, Battle Cry, or any other regular abilities. When everyone's done acting, the engagement begins—at that point, only instant abilities can be used._

### When Timing Matters

Combat rarely requires turn order, but sometimes split-second timing determines outcomes—two archers drawing on the same target, warriors racing for the same choke point, or duelists striking simultaneously. When microseconds matter:

**1. Compare Agility Die Size**
Natural speed determines who acts first:

- d12 → d10 → d8 → d6 → d4

**2. Players Win Ties**
Heroes edge out NPCs when agility dice match

**3. Contested Rolls for Player Conflicts**
When players clash over timing, contested agility checks decide

This system rewards naturally quick combatants without locking anyone into rigid initiative. Even the slowest warrior can occasionally seize the moment through clever positioning or surprising aggression.

### Chaining Abilities

Combat flows dynamically—you cannot simply declare a complex sequence and execute it uninterrupted. Each action or ability you use creates an opening for others to respond. If you dash toward an enemy planning to trap them with stone walls, they might dodge away after your movement but before your spell completes.

Declare your intentions freely, but expect interruptions. Other combatants will inject their own actions between yours, creating realistic exchanges where plans adapt moment by moment. You must wait for all responses to your first action before proceeding to your second—combat is a conversation, not a monologue.

### Actions You Can Take

**Dash**  
Sprint up to your full movement speed (60 feet base, before equipment).

Moving more than 5 feet within an enemy's reach or leaving their threat range without sidestepping invites opportunity attacks—you're prioritizing speed over defense.

**Sidestep**  
**Uses your action**, or spend a rush point instead.

Carefully move 5 feet or rise from prone without dropping your guard. This defensive movement never provokes opportunity attacks.

**Object Interaction**  
Your first object interaction each round comes free—drawing a weapon, opening a door, or grabbing an item. Additional interactions require your action.

Complex tasks like picking locks or deciphering mechanisms always require your full action.

**Help**  
Support an adjacent ally through distraction, guidance, or direct assistance. They gain advantage on their next ability check, saving throw, or attack/defense roll. You're creating openings they can exploit.

**Trip**  
When an off-balanced creature moves through your adjacent space, you may sweep their legs if they're no more than one size larger. They crash prone immediately in that space—no action required from you.

**Actions From Abilities**
Certain abilities explicitly require your action to activate. These powerful effects must happen during the action phase and consume your one action for the round.

**Other Actions**  
Creativity thrives in combat. Propose other actions to your GM—toppling pillars, intimidating foes, or exploiting the environment. If it requires focus and effort, it likely uses your action.

### Opportunity Attacks

Opportunity attacks punish tactical errors with devastating consequences. These free strikes occur outside normal combat flow, allowing you to capitalize on enemy mistakes without risking counter-attack.

**Uses your action**, or spend a rush point. Opportunity attacks resolve instantly—no one acts before you strike. You're exploiting an immediate opening that even faster opponents cannot interrupt.

You earn opportunity attacks when enemies:

- Leave your melee reach without sidestepping
- Move more than 5 feet within your reach without sidestepping
- Stand from prone without sidestepping
- Remain unaware of your position (you're hidden)
- Enter combat unprepared (they're surprised)

Choose any stance for your opportunity attack—this free strike lets you unleash your most punishing techniques without fear of retaliation.

[[Why Opportunity Attacks Matter

Opportunity attacks fundamentally change how enemies approach you. Smart opponents burn resources avoiding these openings, often wasting actions on careful sidesteps or accepting disadvantageous positions. Sometimes threatening an opportunity attack provides more tactical value than actually taking it—enemies might abandon crucial objectives rather than risk your blade.]]

## The Engagement

After the dust of movement settles and abilities have been unleashed, every combatant crashes together in the engagement—a mandatory explosion of violence where careful positioning gives way to brutal reality. This is when blades finally meet flesh, spells detonate at point-blank range, and all that tactical maneuvering pays off... or doesn't.

**The engagement is inevitable**. It costs no action and offers no escape. If you're in the fight, you're in the engagement. This climactic moment caps each round with the violent collision everyone's been building toward.

**During the engagement, only instant abilities can be used.** Regular abilities must be activated during the action phase—once steel starts swinging, you're limited to reactive instant abilities that let you defend, counter, or enhance your strikes.

### How Engagements Work

The engagement transforms simultaneous chaos into tactical decisions through a simple process:

1. **Everyone Participates** - All conscious combatants automatically join
2. **Choose Your Stance** - Secretly select might, agility, cunning, or defensive
3. **Reveal Together** - All choices shown simultaneously
4. **Resolve Attacks** - Stance matchups determine who strikes whom

These few seconds of furious combat get broken down into meaningful choices while preserving the feeling that everything happens at once.

### Understanding Stances

Your stance represents your fighting approach during this crucial exchange. Each stance defeats specific others in a psychological dance of combat:

**The Core Triangle:**

- **Cunning beats Agility** - You read their movements and exploit openings
- **Agility beats Might** - You flow around powerful attacks to strike back
- **Might beats Cunning** - You power through tricks with overwhelming force
- **Defensive** - You sacrifice all offense for enhanced survival

This isn't arbitrary—it reflects real combat dynamics. Speed defeats power by never being where the blow lands. Power defeats precision by refusing to be deterred. Precision defeats speed by predicting where it will be.

### Choosing Your Stance

#### The Selection Process

Every combatant secretly chooses their stance for this engagement. The simultaneous reveal creates genuine tension—you must predict opponents' moves while they predict yours.

**Core Selection Rules:**

- **GM Locks In First** - When players discuss strategy, the GM must finalize all enemy stances before players commit. This prevents any reactive adjustments.
- **Simultaneous Reveal** - Use any method: closed fists (1=might, 2=agility, 3=cunning, 4=defensive), face-down cards, or written notes. The key is revealing together.
- **No Changes After Reveal** - Once shown, stances are locked. Everyone lives with their choices.
- **Strategic Discussion** - Players can coordinate openly ("I'll take might to handle the orc"), but remember—intelligent enemies might be listening and adapting in future rounds.

### Stance Resolution Guide

Each stance creates specific advantages and vulnerabilities:

| Your Stance   | Beats   | Beaten By | Can Attack                      | Special Benefits                              |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Cunning**   | Agility | Might     | Agility, Defensive, Same Stance | Attacks first; Inflicts conditions vs Agility |
| **Agility**   | Might   | Cunning   | Might, Defensive, Same Stance   | Free sidestep; Attacks second                 |
| **Might**     | Cunning | Agility   | Cunning, Defensive, Same Stance | Weapon might bonus; Attacks last              |
| **Defensive** | None    | All       | None                            | Takes half damage after defense               |

**Attack Resolution Order**: Cunning → Agility → Might

### Stance Breakdowns

#### Cunning Stance

You read the battlefield like a book, striking where enemies leave themselves vulnerable. Your attacks resolve first, before victims can react.

**Valid Targets**: Agility, defensive, or cunning stance opponents

**Special vs Agility**: Apply up to two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened when attacking agility stance. You've completely decoded their movements, leaving them reeling from perfectly-placed strikes.

#### Agility Stance

You flow through combat like water, dancing between heavy blows to strike exposed enemies. Your attacks resolve after cunning but before might.

**Valid Targets**: Might, defensive, or agility stance opponents

**Free Movement**: Take a free sidestep (5 feet, no opportunity attacks) immediately before or after your attack. When multiple combatants claim this movement and timing matters, use action phase ordering.

#### Might Stance

You bring crushing force that smashes through clever defenses. Your attacks resolve last but hit with devastating power.

**Valid Targets**: Cunning, defensive, or might stance opponents

**Weapon Bonus**: Trigger your weapon's might stance bonus when attacking cunning stance opponents. Raw power crushes careful planning.

#### Defensive Stance

You abandon offense entirely, focusing everything on survival. While you cannot attack, you become remarkably difficult to hurt.

**Damage Reduction**: After subtracting defense from incoming attacks, halve any remaining damage (round up). This stacks with your normal defenses, making you incredibly resilient.

**Universal Target**: All stances can attack you, but your damage reduction often makes you an unappealing target.

### Attack Resolution Process

Attacks resolve in strict phases to maintain clarity:

#### Resolution Phases

1. **Cunning attacks** resolve (any order among cunning attackers)
2. **Agility attacks** resolve (any order among agility attackers)
3. **Might attacks** resolve (any order among might attackers)

Within each phase, attacks effectively occur simultaneously. If two might-stance fighters kill each other, both attacks complete. Getting pushed away during an earlier phase might leave you out of range when your turn arrives.

#### Same Stance Combat

When attacking someone in your own stance, make **contested attack rolls**—both combatants roll attacks, higher wins, loser takes the difference as damage. This represents two fighters using similar tactics, with execution determining the victor.

#### Range and Positioning

**You can only attack targets within weapon range**. Movement during earlier resolution phases might leave you unable to reach intended targets. Plan accordingly.

### Making Attack Rolls

When you attack during engagement:

**Your Attack Roll:**

- **Heart die** - Your current stamina and fighting spirit
- **Ability die** - For your chosen stance (might/agility/cunning)
- **Weapon die** - Your weapon's damage potential

**Defender's Roll:**

- **Heart die** - Their endurance
- **Ability die** - Matching your attack stance
- **Armor bonus** - If applicable

**Damage dealt = Attack roll - Defense roll** (minimum 0)

[[Example
_Round begins. You activate Blade Dance (boosting agility attacks) and trigger Momentum Strike to store energy. You dash toward the undead orc, spending your action to close distance._

_The wolf uses Pack Hunter and dashes adjacent to you, spending its action on movement._

_The orc activates Undead Resilience for damage reduction. He uses his action to activate Crushing Blow—this ability specifically states "uses your action" and stores devastating power for the engagement._

_Your archer uses Eagle Eye and marks the orc with Hunter's Mark. She saves her action, waiting to see how things develop. After a pause where no one else acts, she decides to dash to better position, spending her action._

_With all actions resolved, the engagement begins automatically._

_The GM locks in enemy stances: orc picks might, wolf selects cunning. You and your ally coordinate—you'll use agility (boosted by Blade Dance) while she takes agility as well to counter the orc's likely might stance. Stances reveal._

**Cunning Phase**: The wolf's cunning beats your agility. It bites and triggers Hamstring, inflicting off-balanced. You activate Defensive Roll (an instant ability) to reduce incoming damage.

**Agility Phase**: Both you and your archer chose agility, which beats the orc's might. Your archer goes first, triggering Execute for bonus damage. Her arrow strikes true. The orc burns stamina to halve damage but staggers.

You sidestep free, then unleash stored Momentum Strike against the orc. The orc's prepared Crushing Blow can't connect as you both dance aside.

**Might Phase**: The orc's might stance leaves him with no valid targets—both of you are in agility, which might cannot attack. His stored Crushing Blow goes unused this engagement.

_Engagement ends. New round begins—everyone regains their action and can activate abilities freely once more._

## Taking Damage

When you take damage, you can choose to use some of your stamina to "shrug off" or "dodge" the injury. In this case, you take half as much damage, but your heart die falls one size. If you cannot decrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you must take the full amount of damage.

Regardless, whatever damage you do take gets subtracted from your hit points. If this would cause your hit points to reach a negative amount equal to your maximum hit points, you are dead.

### More than 10 Damage

If you take 10 or more damage, this represents serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit points, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain English description of the wound. For example, a wound could be "a nasty gash in your arm," or "a fractured leg," or "your guts are spilling out". Write this down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound. The rank is equal to the amount of damage you took. Read more about wounds in the next section.

## Wounds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points. Whenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase your hit points beyond your normal maximum minus the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you normally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have 23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit points.

Wounds also have non-combat effects—they count as aspects in addition to their max-hp reducing effect. Like aspects, they have a description and a rank. You may use wounds as aspects as well, though you cannot gain more than 5 DP from invoking the wound, even if the rank of the wound is higher.

For example, if you have the rank 12 wound, "Guts spilling out," you could gain 5 DP by taking a minus 12 penalty to nearly any athletics check, since it'd be logical that having that type of wound would make it very difficult to do almost anything physical.

### Treating wounds

Whenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it treated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large amount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a medicine skill check and reduce the rank of all untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by the rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's rank below zero, remove the wound completely.

If you are treating your own wounds, you have disadvantage.  
You can treat any number of wounds at once, but once a wound has been treated it cannot be treated again. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal over time when you take long rests. See the Rests & Healing section for more details.

## Zero Hit points

When your hit points reach zero, you are in bad condition. If you wish, you may choose to go unconscious. If you do not, you fall unconscious anyway after 10 minutes. If you take damage while at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and any wounds—you can go into the negative.

If your hit points ever reach an amount equal to or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.

Once you are unconscious, you remain unconscious so long as your hit points are zero or fewer.  
You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by taking rests. Read more in the Rests & Healing section.

### Why would I go unconscious??

If you're in a nasty fight, combatants tend to try to attack the people who are still fighting back. If you go unconscious, people usually won't view you as a threat, so you're a lot less likely to be attacked (and potentially die). Things trying to eat you generally don't abide by this, so in some cases this is definitely not recommended…

## Other Offensive Actions

If you want to do something to an enemy other than hit it with a weapon, such as grapple it, climb onto it, or otherwise mess with it, it still begins with winning an engagement. However, you must win the engagement by directly beating their stance—both choosing the same stance does not let you perform these types of acts. Assuming you have directly beaten their stance, you may forgo your attack roll and instead use one of these other options. If you do, the effects of the offensive action occur after all attack rolls have been made.

Some of these options require a contested skill check, rather than an attack and defense roll. These contested checks still receive advantage or disadvantage as though they were an attack or defense roll of their corresponding ability, but they should not use any additional dice (such as from your weapon) or bonuses from armor.

### Grappling

Make a might ability check against an adjacent creature, contested by the creature's own might or agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You gain the condition grappling and the opposing creature gains the condition grappled.

Unless otherwise specified, at least one hand must be free to grapple another creature. You can grapple with one or two hands. If grappling with only one hand, halve your grapple ability check, rounding up.

A creature can only be grappled by one creature at a time, and can only grapple one creature at a time.

[[Example  
You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before it moves past you and attacks your badly hurt friend. You enter an engagement with it, choose stances, and stances are revealed. You chose cunning, and it chose agility. Since cunning beats agility, you get to attack. However, since you're trying to grapple it, you decide not to attack, and instead make a might check. Your ally used the help action earlier in the round, so you have advantage. The wolf makes an agility check to avoid getting grappled, but it rolls less than you. The wolf is now grappled, and you are now grappling. The wolf is stuck.]]

### Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check contested by the creature's might or agility ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature. So long as you are on the creature, you have the creature climber condition. Likewise, the climbed on creature has the climbed on condition.

A creature can only climb on one creature at a time.

### Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform some other sort of option that interferes with your target. This could be represented by throwing sand in their eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target with this ability.

Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature 5 feet. It travels 5 feet less for every size larger than you it is, and 5 feet more for every size smaller. The creature gains 2 levels of off-balanced.

### Stunt

Choose your own effect, with the GM's permission. This could be something like stealing an item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their sword by the blade to turn it into clay, trying to taunt the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet.

In these cases, make a contested ability check against the creature.

## Special Circumstances

Combat doesn't always begin on equal footing. Various circumstances can dramatically alter how a fight unfolds, giving advantages or disadvantages to different participants.

### Surprise

In some cases when combat begins, one or more parties will be completely surprised, giving anyone who was already prepared to fight a large advantage.

Combat special rules apply in these circumstances.

A creature is not surprised if they can see their opponent before the round begins, and they are unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or don't know their opponent.

If one of the parties in an encounter is completely surprised by combat, then each un-surprised creature can use their action to make an opportunity attack, and each surprised creature does not get to use abilities or move on the first round of combat.

### Attacking the Helpless

Sometimes, you will make attacks against creatures that are completely unable to defend themselves. At the GM's discretion, you may make an opportunity attack against the creature. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

### Cover

Cover is an important part of staying alive—if you remain behind cover, you remain safe from ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist between the attacker and the defender. Determining what type of cover you have from an attacker can be done by drawing imaginary lines between any one point on the attacker and each corner of a square that the enemy takes the space of. For each line that is obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack that creature.

Sometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to the line blocked method of determining cover. It is then up to the GM to decide how much cover should be awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small but not very helpful like a small tree in the way of your shot will provide one level of cover. Things that the defender has to poke their body out from behind to attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a couch, provide two levels of cover. Lastly, things that are specifically designed for uni-directional attacks, such as arrow slits, will provide three levels of cover.
