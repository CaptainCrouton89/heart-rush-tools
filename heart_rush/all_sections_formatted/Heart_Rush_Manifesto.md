# The Heart Rush Design Manifesto

## Combat Should Tell a Story, Not Repeat One

Heart Rush was born from a simple frustration: why does round 3 of combat feel exactly like round 1? We believe every moment of battle should force new decisions, create new opportunities, and escalate the stakes. Our stance system ensures you can never autopilot through combat—each engagement is a mind game where predictability means death.

## Your Heart Drives Everything

At the core of every mechanic is your heart die—literally and philosophically. It represents your stamina, your will, your very essence. As combat wears on, your heart weakens, making every choice more desperate. Do you burn stamina to avoid that wound? Can you afford not to? This isn't resource management—it's betting pieces of yourself to survive.

## Heroes Are Forged, Not Born

You won't feel heroic at rank 0. You'll feel vulnerable, desperate, and very mortal. That's by design. When you finally reach those paragon levels, when you're deflecting blows that would kill lesser warriors, you'll have _earned_ it through blood, clever tactics, and probably more than a few close calls. Victory tastes sweeter when defeat was always one bad decision away.

## Cooperation Isn't Optional—It's Essential

Classes in Heart Rush don't just work well together; they're incomplete without each other. A Strongheart without a Cleverheart lacks the tactical edge to maximize their defense. A Battleheart without a Strongheart won't survive long enough to land their devastating strikes. This isn't about party balance—it's about creating moments where your success depends on your allies' choices as much as your own.

## Complexity With Purpose

Yes, Heart Rush is crunchy. We track wounds separately from HP. We use multiple types of conditions. We have detailed rules for grappling, climbing on larger foes, and magical crafting. But every rule serves the fiction. That rank 12 wound "guts spilling out" isn't just a number—it's a visceral reminder of how close you came to death, mechanically impacting every physical action you take.

## Magic Should Feel Magical

Elemental attunement isn't a spell list—it's understanding fire so deeply you can shape it with your will. A master of earth doesn't cast "Stone Shape"; they run their hands through solid rock like clay. The limitations make it more wondrous: you can't manipulate the blood in someone's veins because life itself resists such violation. Magic has rules, but they're rules that make the world feel more real, not less.

## Your Character Is More Than Numbers

The aspect system ensures your character's personality directly impacts gameplay. That "Never backs down from a challenge" aspect will get you into trouble—and you'll invoke it anyway because those Destiny Points let you succeed when it matters most. Your flaws aren't weaknesses; they're the engine that drives memorable stories and mechanical advantages.

## Momentum Matters

Rush points reward aggression and participation. Hiding in the back lines doesn't just make you less effective—it literally gives you fewer resources. The warrior who charges into every engagement has more options than the one who hangs back. Combat should feel like a rising tide, not a steady state.

## Death Is Always on the Table

Healing is slow. Wounds accumulate. That negative HP buffer isn't generous. We want you to feel the weight of violence, to understand that every fight could be your last if you're careless. This isn't about punishing players—it's about making victory meaningful and defeat consequential.

## Build Whatever You Want

A barbarian wizard. A ninja detective. A fire-bending assassin. The system doesn't tell you "no"—it asks you "how?" Want to be a scholarly orc grappler who solves problems through interpretive wrestling? The rules support it. Character optimization exists, but the optimal path is the one that makes you excited to play.

## Fail Forward, But Feel the Failure

Complications keep the story moving, but they're still complications. You picked the lock, but your picks break. You convinced the guard, but now you owe them a favor. Success with consequences creates more interesting stories than binary pass/fail, but those consequences need teeth.

## The Tactical Infinity

With stance selection, positioning, ability timing, and resource management all happening simultaneously, no two combats play the same. The decision space is vast but parseable—you always have meaningful choices, but you're never overwhelmed by options. Master players don't just know their character; they know how their character fits into the combat puzzle.

## This Is Not a Safe Game

Heart Rush embraces danger. It's simulationist where that makes combat feel weighty and gamist where that makes combat feel tactical. You can die from infected wounds. You can be strangled unconscious. You can fall off a cliff and break your legs. The world has teeth, and it will bite.

## In Conclusion

Heart Rush is a game for people who want their combat to matter—mechanically and narratively. It's for players who see resource management as dramatic tension, who view tactical cooperation as the highest form of gameplay, and who believe that true heroism is earned through adversity, not granted by level.

Your heart beats at the center of everything. How hard will you push it?
