## Chulpe

Savage, bestial humanoids that combine the worst aspects of predatory animals with a cruel intelligence, the Chulpe are among the most feared races in the known world. These monstrous beings possess powerful, muscular bodies covered in coarse fur, with elongated snouts filled with razor-sharp teeth and claws capable of rending flesh from bone. While their intelligence varies between subspecies, all Chulpe share an insatiable hunger for meat—particularly humanoid flesh—and a pack-based social structure built around dominance, violence, and the hunt. Their origins are shrouded in mystery, with some scholars believing them to be the result of ancient magical experiments, while others claim they are simply evolution's answer to creating the perfect predator.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Varies by subrace
- **Height:** Varies by subrace
- **Weight:** Varies by subrace

### Predatory Instincts

**Passive ability**

Your bestial nature grants you enhanced senses and combat reflexes. You have advantage on cunning checks to track creatures and detect threats. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 60 feet, and when you deal damage to a wounded creature (one that has taken a wound), you regain 2 hit points.

### Skree (The Pack Runners)

The smaller and more numerous of the Chulpe subspecies, Skree are vicious pack hunters roughly the size of large wolves. What they lack in individual strength compared to their Terrogone cousins, they more than make up for in speed, cunning, and sheer bloodthirsty aggression. Skree society is built around loose pack structures that form and dissolve based on hunting success and dominance displays. They are known for their hit-and-run tactics, using their superior numbers and coordination to bring down prey much larger than themselves.

Skree live in the harsh borderlands and wilderness areas, often competing with their larger Terrogone relatives for territory and prey. Their lean, wiry builds make them excellent climbers and runners, allowing them to pursue fleeing victims across virtually any terrain. While less intelligent than Terrogones, Skree possess a feral cunning that makes them expert ambush predators. They communicate through a complex series of growls, yips, and body language that allows entire packs to coordinate attacks with frightening efficiency.

The social structure of Skree packs is fluid and violent, with leadership constantly shifting as members challenge each other for dominance. They have no permanent settlements, instead following game trails and establishing temporary camps wherever the hunting is good. Skree reproduction is rapid, with large litters ensuring their numbers remain high despite their dangerous lifestyle and frequent conflicts with other predators.

### Aspects

- Bloodthirsty pack hunter
- Recklessly aggressive

### Pack Frenzy

**Passive ability**

Your violent nature intensifies when fighting alongside allies. When you are adjacent to an ally at the start of your turn, you gain one additional rush point. Additionally, when an adjacent ally deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that same creature until the end of the round.

### Terrogones (The Bone Crushers)

The massive, terrifying cousins of the Skree, Terrogones are apex predators that stand six feet high even when moving on all fours. These hulking monstrosities make their home in the savage wasteland of Echem Yiakraxis, where they have adapted to be the ultimate hunters in one of the world's most dangerous regions. Unlike their smaller Skree relatives, Terrogones possess enough intelligence to use crude tools, set elaborate traps, and employ sophisticated hunting strategies that have made them the undisputed masters of their domain.

Terrogone society is built around small family groups led by the largest and most successful hunters. These family units claim vast territories within Echem Yiakraxis, marking their borders with the bones of their victims and engaging in brutal conflicts with neighboring groups over prime hunting grounds. Their intelligence, while not matching that of most humanoid races, is sufficient for them to understand fear as a weapon, often keeping captured prey alive for days to terrorize other potential victims.

The physical presence of a Terrogone is overwhelming—their massive frames are covered in thick, mottled fur that provides protection against the harsh environment of their homeland, while their enormous heads house jaws capable of crushing armor and bone with equal ease. They have developed a complex relationship with the twisted ecosystem of Echem Yiakraxis, serving as both apex predator and, in some cases, protector of the region's most dangerous secrets. Their reproduction is slow and deliberate, with mated pairs raising their young together for several years before the offspring are strong enough to claim their own territory.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator with insatiable hunger
- Monstrous and intimidating presence

#### Crushing Might

**Passive ability**

Your massive size and strength make you a devastating opponent. You count as one size larger for the purposes of grappling, pushing, and intimidation checks. When you deal damage to a creature smaller than you with a melee attack, they must make a presence saving throw against your might challenge number or gain two levels of frightened toward you until the end of the encounter. Additionally, when using the might stance with heavy weapons, you may add your weapon die to the attack roll twice instead of once.

Looking at the provided description and abilities, here's the Sylthik race following the template:

## Sylthik

The Sylthik are a serpentine people whose scaled bodies and ophidian features mark them as children of the great snake goddess Sythikranos. These proud and merciless beings view themselves as the apex of creation, considering all other races to be inferior creatures unworthy of respect or mercy. Their society is built around a complex religious hierarchy that governs every aspect of daily life, from marriage and trade to warfare and diplomacy.

Ruled by venomous high priests who claim direct communion with their serpent deity, Sylthik settlements are often found in desert oases, ancient ruins, or deep caverns where snakes naturally congregate. Their architecture favors winding passages and circular chambers that mirror the movements of their sacred serpents. The Sylthik believe that their goddess will one day return to reclaim the world, and they see themselves as her chosen instruments to prepare for that glorious day.

Their natural ability to communicate with snakes makes them formidable opponents, as they often employ serpentine allies in their schemes. The Sylthik take great pride in their venomous nature, viewing their ability to kill with a single bite as proof of their divine superiority over the "warm-blooded vermin" that populate the world.

**Major ability.**
As a disciple of Sythikranos, you are granted occasional favors by your snake goddess. When you invoke the name of your patron god, choose one. You gain the ability for the next hour.

- Your snake scales harden and partially extend over the rest of your body. You have advantage on all defense rolls.

## Nyolci

The Nyolci are a maritime people whose distinctive cephalopod features mark them as some of the finest sailors and navigators in the known world. With humanoid bodies crowned by octopus-like heads bearing five dexterous tentacles and a sharp beak, they might seem alien to landlubbers, yet they have integrated seamlessly into coastal societies across every major port and trading hub.

Born from the marriage of sea and civilization, the Nyolci serve as the backbone of maritime commerce and exploration. Their natural affinity for water, combined with their ability to manipulate multiple objects simultaneously with their tentacles, makes them invaluable crew members, ship captains, and harbor masters. Their keen intuition for weather patterns, ocean currents, and the subtle signs that predict storms has saved countless vessels from disaster.

Despite their aquatic origins, the Nyolci have fully embraced life among the various races of the surface world. They can be found in every major port city, often serving as intermediaries between land-based merchants and the mysteries of the deep ocean. Their communities typically cluster around harbors, docks, and shipyards, where their expertise is most valued.

The Nyolci possess an almost supernatural ability to read people and situations, making them excellent negotiators and traders. This intuitive cunning, combined with their reputation for fairness in business dealings, has earned them respect and trust throughout the maritime world.
