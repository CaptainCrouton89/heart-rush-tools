## Chulpe

Savage, bestial humanoids that combine the worst aspects of predatory animals with a cruel intelligence, the Chulpe are among the most feared races in the known world. These monstrous beings possess powerful, muscular bodies covered in coarse fur, with elongated snouts filled with razor-sharp teeth and claws capable of rending flesh from bone. While their intelligence varies between subspecies, all Chulpe share an insatiable hunger for meat—particularly humanoid flesh—and a pack-based social structure built around dominance, violence, and the hunt. Their origins are shrouded in mystery, with some scholars believing them to be the result of ancient magical experiments, while others claim they are simply evolution's answer to creating the perfect predator.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Varies by subrace
- **Height:** Varies by subrace
- **Weight:** Varies by subrace

### Predatory Instincts

**Passive ability**

Your bestial nature grants you enhanced senses and combat reflexes. You have advantage on cunning checks to track creatures and detect threats. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 60 feet, and when you deal damage to a wounded creature (one that has taken a wound), you regain 2 hit points.

### Skree (The Pack Runners)

The smaller and more numerous of the Chulpe subspecies, Skree are vicious pack hunters roughly the size of large wolves. What they lack in individual strength compared to their Terrogone cousins, they more than make up for in speed, cunning, and sheer bloodthirsty aggression. Skree society is built around loose pack structures that form and dissolve based on hunting success and dominance displays. They are known for their hit-and-run tactics, using their superior numbers and coordination to bring down prey much larger than themselves.

Skree live in the harsh borderlands and wilderness areas, often competing with their larger Terrogone relatives for territory and prey. Their lean, wiry builds make them excellent climbers and runners, allowing them to pursue fleeing victims across virtually any terrain. While less intelligent than Terrogones, Skree possess a feral cunning that makes them expert ambush predators. They communicate through a complex series of growls, yips, and body language that allows entire packs to coordinate attacks with frightening efficiency.

The social structure of Skree packs is fluid and violent, with leadership constantly shifting as members challenge each other for dominance. They have no permanent settlements, instead following game trails and establishing temporary camps wherever the hunting is good. Skree reproduction is rapid, with large litters ensuring their numbers remain high despite their dangerous lifestyle and frequent conflicts with other predators.

### Aspects

- Bloodthirsty pack hunter
- Recklessly aggressive

### Pack Frenzy

**Passive ability**

Your violent nature intensifies when fighting alongside allies. When you are adjacent to an ally at the start of your turn, you gain one additional rush point. Additionally, when an adjacent ally deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that same creature until the end of the round.

### Terrogones (The Bone Crushers)

The massive, terrifying cousins of the Skree, Terrogones are apex predators that stand six feet high even when moving on all fours. These hulking monstrosities make their home in the savage wasteland of Echem Yiakraxis, where they have adapted to be the ultimate hunters in one of the world's most dangerous regions. Unlike their smaller Skree relatives, Terrogones possess enough intelligence to use crude tools, set elaborate traps, and employ sophisticated hunting strategies that have made them the undisputed masters of their domain.

Terrogone society is built around small family groups led by the largest and most successful hunters. These family units claim vast territories within Echem Yiakraxis, marking their borders with the bones of their victims and engaging in brutal conflicts with neighboring groups over prime hunting grounds. Their intelligence, while not matching that of most humanoid races, is sufficient for them to understand fear as a weapon, often keeping captured prey alive for days to terrorize other potential victims.

The physical presence of a Terrogone is overwhelming—their massive frames are covered in thick, mottled fur that provides protection against the harsh environment of their homeland, while their enormous heads house jaws capable of crushing armor and bone with equal ease. They have developed a complex relationship with the twisted ecosystem of Echem Yiakraxis, serving as both apex predator and, in some cases, protector of the region's most dangerous secrets. Their reproduction is slow and deliberate, with mated pairs raising their young together for several years before the offspring are strong enough to claim their own territory.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator with insatiable hunger
- Monstrous and intimidating presence

#### Crushing Might

**Passive ability**

Your massive size and strength make you a devastating opponent. You count as one size larger for the purposes of grappling, pushing, and intimidation checks. When you deal damage to a creature smaller than you with a melee attack, they must make a presence saving throw against your might challenge number or gain two levels of frightened toward you until the end of the encounter. Additionally, when using the might stance with heavy weapons, you may add your weapon die to the attack roll twice instead of once.

Looking at the provided description and abilities, here's the Sylthik race following the template:

## Sylthik

The Sylthik are a serpentine people whose scaled bodies and ophidian features mark them as children of the great snake goddess Sythikranos. These proud and merciless beings view themselves as the apex of creation, considering all other races to be inferior creatures unworthy of respect or mercy. Their society is built around a complex religious hierarchy that governs every aspect of daily life, from marriage and trade to warfare and diplomacy.

Ruled by venomous high priests who claim direct communion with their serpent deity, Sylthik settlements are often found in desert oases, ancient ruins, or deep caverns where snakes naturally congregate. Their architecture favors winding passages and circular chambers that mirror the movements of their sacred serpents. The Sylthik believe that their goddess will one day return to reclaim the world, and they see themselves as her chosen instruments to prepare for that glorious day.

Their natural ability to communicate with snakes makes them formidable opponents, as they often employ serpentine allies in their schemes. The Sylthik take great pride in their venomous nature, viewing their ability to kill with a single bite as proof of their divine superiority over the "warm-blooded vermin" that populate the world.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-7 feet (including tail length)
- **Weight:** 130-220 pounds

### Aspects

- Chosen of the serpent goddess
- Cold-blooded supremacist

### Snake Headed

**Passive ability.**
With the head of a snake, you have venomous fangs, which count as a light, piercing melee weapon. Once per day, you may inject venom with your bite, inflicting two levels of poisoned.

Additionally, your snake tongue gives you a superb ability to track down your prey. If you spend five minutes within 10 feet of someone, you always know which direction they are in when they are within 10 miles of you. If you bite them, the range extends to 100 miles instead.

### Disciple of Sythikranos

**Major ability.**
As a disciple of Sythikranos, you are granted occasional favors by your snake goddess. When you invoke the name of your patron god, choose one. You gain the ability for the next hour.

- You gain advantage on all attack rolls with your bite. Your bite afflicts an additional level of poisoned when you inject poison.
- Your snake scales harden and partially extend over the rest of your body. You have advantage on all defense rolls.
- You can communicate with snakes, and if any snakes are in the vicinity, a snake companion will join you within the next ten minutes. The snake cannot help in combat, but it can scout and observe at your command.

## Nyolci

The Nyolci are a maritime people whose distinctive cephalopod features mark them as some of the finest sailors and navigators in the known world. With humanoid bodies crowned by octopus-like heads bearing five dexterous tentacles and a sharp beak, they might seem alien to landlubbers, yet they have integrated seamlessly into coastal societies across every major port and trading hub.

Born from the marriage of sea and civilization, the Nyolci serve as the backbone of maritime commerce and exploration. Their natural affinity for water, combined with their ability to manipulate multiple objects simultaneously with their tentacles, makes them invaluable crew members, ship captains, and harbor masters. Their keen intuition for weather patterns, ocean currents, and the subtle signs that predict storms has saved countless vessels from disaster.

Despite their aquatic origins, the Nyolci have fully embraced life among the various races of the surface world. They can be found in every major port city, often serving as intermediaries between land-based merchants and the mysteries of the deep ocean. Their communities typically cluster around harbors, docks, and shipyards, where their expertise is most valued.

The Nyolci possess an almost supernatural ability to read people and situations, making them excellent negotiators and traders. This intuitive cunning, combined with their reputation for fairness in business dealings, has earned them respect and trust throughout the maritime world.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 140-220 pounds

### Aspects

- Master of wind and wave
- Reads hearts like tide charts

### Tentacle Dexterity

**Passive ability.**
Your five head tentacles can manipulate objects with surprising precision and independence. You can perform up to three separate object interactions per round instead of one. Additionally, you have advantage on any skill check that would benefit from manipulating multiple objects simultaneously, such as operating complex mechanisms, playing multiple instruments, or managing ship rigging.

### Oceanic Intuition

**Passive ability.**
Your deep connection to the sea grants you uncanny insight into both natural and social currents. You automatically succeed on navigation checks while at sea or following coastlines. Additionally, you have advantage on skill checks to predict weather, read people's intentions, or sense when someone is lying to you. Once per day, you may ask the GM one yes-or-no question about the immediate future of a situation you're currently in.

Looking at the example race template and the descriptions provided, I'll create these 9 races following the established format and mechanics consistent with Heart Rush's design principles.

## Skaag

The Skaag are a misunderstood people who have learned to thrive in the forgotten spaces beneath civilization. With the heads of rats and humanoid bodies, they are often met with disgust and fear by surface dwellers who believe them to be disease-ridden scavengers. The truth is far more complex—while the infamous Rat King Glathkus the Cruel has cast a dark shadow over their reputation, most Skaag live in large, loving families with a practical, survivalist culture.

These underground dwellers have developed an uncanny ability to find hidden treasures and avoid the many dangers that lurk in ruins and sewers. Their keen senses and natural wariness have kept their communities alive for generations in hostile environments. Though they prefer the safety of their subterranean homes, some Skaag venture to the surface world, hoping to prove that their people are more than the monsters they're believed to be.

Skaag settlements can be found in the undercities of major population centers across Alaria, connected by networks of tunnels that only they fully understand. Their communities are tight-knit but chaotic, with a "fend for yourself" mentality that produces remarkably resourceful individuals.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-100 pounds

### Aspects

- Misunderstood scavenger
- Underground survivor

### Accustomed to Darkness

**Passive ability.**
You can see in darkness as though it was dim light to a range of 45 feet, and can see in dim light as though it was bright light. You suffer no penalties for operating in underground or subterranean environments.

### Eye for Treasure

**Passive ability.**
Your whiskers and keen senses alert you to both opportunity and danger. If you would make a saving throw to avoid or mitigate the effects of a trap, you have advantage on that roll. If the trap deals damage, you take half as much damage. Additionally, your whiskers tingle when treasure or traps are within 1000 feet—you don't know which, but you can estimate distance by the intensity. You can perfectly appraise the value of rare artifacts and have advantage on checks to discern the nature of magical items.

## Satyr

The Satyr are creatures of primal passion and bloody revelry who have embraced their wild nature completely. With the upper bodies of humanoids and the lower bodies of goats, they reject the constraints of civilized clothing and armor, preferring to live as nature intended. Their culture revolves around ecstatic dances performed to haunting pipe music, often culminating in frenzied celebrations drenched in the blood of their prey.

These beings feed not just on blood, but on the raw emotion and chaos of the hunt and the kill. They are most alive during their blood-soaked festivities, where one plays the pipes while others dance themselves into transcendent states of violence and joy. To outsiders, these rituals appear horrifying, but to the Satyr they represent the purest expression of life itself.

Normal clothing and armor cannot accommodate their unique physiology, forcing them to rely on their natural resilience and supernatural abilities. They view civilized society with a mixture of pity and contempt, seeing it as a denial of the wild truth that courses through all living things.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds

### Aspects

- Wild and untamed
- Bloodthirsty reveler

### Blood Frenzy

**Major ability. Instant.**
When you kill a creature, you may shower yourself in its blood to enter an uncontrollable frenzy. For the next minute, you have A2 on all attack rolls and cannot choose the defensive stance. You must attack if able, prioritizing the nearest enemy.

### Enchanting Pipes

**Major ability. Full action.**
You play haunting melodies on your magical pipes. Choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear you. That creature must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. On a failure, they are charmed by you for the next hour and compelled to dance to your music, giving them D2 on all rolls. The charm immediately ends if you attack them, and they know they were charmed when the effect ends.

## Lyzine

The Lyzine are fallen nobility whose pride remains unbroken despite their exile to the depths below. With the graceful torsos of elegant humanoids seamlessly joined to the powerful, chitinous bodies of giant spiders, they embody both beauty and horror. Once rulers of great surface kingdoms, they were banished to the underground realms of Mez after their arrogance and cruelty became too much for even their subjects to bear.

Every year, the Lyzine attempt to reclaim their "rightful" place on the surface, sending expeditions to establish new footholds in the world above. They view themselves as inherently superior beings temporarily displaced by the jealousy and ignorance of lesser races. Their underground cities are marvels of web-architecture and dark elegance, maintained by strict hierarchies that mirror their lost surface kingdoms.

Despite their exile, the Lyzine have retained their sophisticated culture, complete with elaborate courts, intricate political maneuvering, and a refined aesthetic sense. They are skilled in both diplomacy and warfare, though their overwhelming pride often makes peaceful coexistence difficult.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Aspects

- Exiled nobility
- Inherently superior

### Arachnid Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed and can move across webs and similar surfaces without penalty. You can produce silk strong enough to support your weight, creating 50 feet of rope as an action. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to intimidate or impress others with displays of nobility or superiority.

### Web Weaver

**Heart ability. Full action.**
You can rapidly spin webs to control the battlefield. Choose a 20-foot square area within 30 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and creatures that enter or start their turn in the webbed area must make an agility saving throw against your cunning challenge number or become restrained. Creatures can break free with a successful might check against the same CN. The webs last for 10 minutes or until destroyed.

---

## Krell

The Krell are an ancient insectoid race whose very existence revolves around their massive colonial structure and absolute devotion to their queen. These chitinous beings live in enormous underground or mountain-carved hives that can house thousands of individuals, all working in perfect harmony toward the colony's goals. Every few centuries, when the current queen lays princess eggs, the colony prepares for the violent succession that will determine their future.

The princesses are raised in luxury for fifty years before engaging in ritual combat to the death. The survivor becomes the new queen, selects a mate, and leads a great migration called a "swarming" to establish a new colony elsewhere. During these swarmings, the Krell become a force of nature, destroying everything in their path as they claim new territory for their queen.

Individual Krell communicate through complex patterns of pheromones, antenna movements, and rhythmic footsteps that outsiders find impossible to decipher. While they possess vocal cords, they rarely use them, preferring their natural forms of communication. A single Krell poses little threat, but when the hive mobilizes, entire settlements vanish without a trace.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds

### Aspects

- Hive-minded
- Colony before self

### Hive Network

**Passive ability.**
You can communicate telepathically with other Krell within 1 mile through pheromone resonance. When within 30 feet of another Krell, you both gain advantage on attack rolls and cannot be surprised. You automatically know the general emotional state and basic intentions of any Krell within range.

### Swarm Tactics

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you are adjacent to at least one ally, you can coordinate a devastating group assault. Choose one enemy within reach of you or an adjacent ally. That enemy takes damage equal to your heart die + the number of allies adjacent to you. This ability can only be used once per engagement per target.

## Kendrel

The Kendrel are creatures of breathtaking beauty whose seahorse-like features embody the grace and mystery of the deep ocean. With flowing manes, elegant elongated faces, and bodies that shimmer with aquatic colors, they are considered among the most stunning beings in all of Alaria. Their culture revolves around elaborate courtship rituals, noble ceremonies, and the pursuit of aesthetic perfection in all things.

These peaceful beings make their homes in hidden fortress-cities within tropical coral reefs and underwater grottos, far from the conflicts that plague the surface world. The Kendrel are natural diplomats who prefer negotiation and artistry to violence, viewing warfare as crude and beneath their refined sensibilities. Their society is built on complex hierarchies of beauty, wisdom, and social grace.

Kendrel architecture seamlessly blends with natural coral formations, creating cities that appear to have grown from the ocean floor itself. They are master craftsmen who work with living coral, cultivated pearls, and other sea treasures to create works of art that can entrance even the most jaded observers.

### Vitals

### Stunning Presence

**Major ability. Full action.**
Your otherworldly beauty briefly overwhelms those around you. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see you must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. Those who fail are stunned until the end of their next turn as they become transfixed by your appearance. Creatures that succeed are immune to this ability for 24 hours.

---

## Chargon

The Chargon are an enigmatic people whose eel-like heads and serpentine grace mask hearts filled with unexpected kindness. Despite their unsettling appearance—smooth, elongated skulls with large eyes and mouths full of needle-sharp teeth—they are among the most courteous and genuinely caring folk one might encounter. Their mysterious nature stems not from malice, but from a deep cultural appreciation for subtlety and the hidden currents that flow beneath surface interactions.

Masters of stealth and misdirection, the Chargon can slip through shadows and squeeze through impossibly tight spaces with fluid ease. Yet they use these abilities primarily to help others, appearing unexpectedly to offer aid to travelers in need or to resolve conflicts through subtle intervention. Their philosophy emphasizes moving through the world like water—adapting to obstacles rather than confronting them directly.

Chargon communities are often built in coastal caves or riverside settlements where they can easily access both land and water. They serve as intermediaries between different cultures, their natural talent for reading emotional undercurrents making them exceptional mediators and counselors.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 110-170 pounds

### Aspects

- Mysteriously kind
- Hidden depths

### Serpentine Mobility

**Passive ability.**

### Emotional Currents

**Heart ability. Instant.**
You can sense the emotional undercurrents around you with supernatural clarity. For the next minute, you know the current emotional state of all creatures within 30 feet and can detect lies automatically. Additionally, you can choose one creature in range—they must make a presence saving throw against your cunning challenge number or have their attitude toward you improved by one step (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to neutral, etc.).

## Tuktuk

The Tuktuk are a warrior culture of turtle-folk who have claimed the volcanic island of Tyvern as their ancestral home. Their thick, naturally armored shells and stocky builds make them nearly indestructible in battle, while their fierce code of honor drives them to seek glory through combat and conquest. These rugged fighters believe that strength must be proven repeatedly through trial by combat and dangerous undertakings.

Tuktuk society revolves around martial prowess and clan loyalty, with disputes settled through formal duels and leadership earned through demonstrations of courage in battle. Their island home has shaped them into excellent seafarers and raiders, though they prefer stand-up fights to sneaky tactics. Young Tuktuk must prove themselves through a series of increasingly dangerous challenges before they are accepted as full warriors.

The volcanic forges of Tyvern produce some of the finest weapons and armor in the known world, as the Tuktuk have learned to work volcanic glass and rare metals found only near active lava flows. Their settlements are built to withstand both enemy assault and the frequent volcanic activity that shapes their homeland.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 180-280 pounds

### Aspects

- Honor-bound warrior
- Tyvern-forged

### Natural Armor

**Passive ability.**
Your thick shell provides +2 natural armor defense that stacks with worn armor. When you use the defensive stance, you take one-quarter damage instead of half. You can withdraw into your shell as an action, becoming incapacitated but gaining total cover and reducing all damage to 1 point until you emerge (free action on your turn).

### Battle Fury

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you take damage that would cause a wound, your warrior's rage ignites. For the rest of the combat, you gain +2 to all attack rolls and your first successful attack each round deals an additional 1d6 damage. This effect ends if you go an entire round without attacking or taking damage.

---

## Alekroin

The Alekroin are massive alligator-folk whose imposing presence and predatory mindset have made them both feared and respected throughout the frozen wastes of Shykasas. These powerfully built beings stand shorter than most humanoids but possess incredible physical strength and an unwavering belief in the fundamental truth that everything in existence falls into two categories: predator or prey. Their culture has remained unchanged for millennia, as rigid and unyielding as the ice that covers their homeland.

Alekroin society operates on strict hierarchies determined by hunting prowess and the ability to dominate others. They view adaptation and change as signs of weakness, maintaining their ancient traditions even when circumstances might suggest otherwise. This stubborn adherence to "the old ways" has served them well in their harsh environment, where their natural abilities and proven methods continue to ensure survival.

Despite their fearsome reputation, the Alekroin possess keen intelligence and insatiable curiosity about the world beyond their territory. However, they approach all new experiences through the lens of their predator-prey worldview, constantly evaluating whether something represents a threat to be eliminated, prey to be hunted, or a potential tool for their own advancement.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 220-320 pounds

### Aspects

- Apex predator
- Frozen in tradition

### Predator's Instinct

**Passive ability.**
You can automatically identify the strongest and weakest creature in any group within 60 feet. You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are wounded, frightened, or have fewer hit points than you. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your might die and gain advantage on your next attack roll.

### Death Roll

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you successfully grapple a creature, you can attempt to perform a devastating death roll. Make an opposed might check—if you win, you deal damage equal to twice your might die and both you and the grappled creature fall prone. If you win by 5 or more, the creature takes a wound with rank equal to the difference between your rolls.

---

## Troenka

The Troenka are perhaps the most feared inhabitants of the great forests, beings of living wood whose greatest pleasure comes from tormenting travelers who dare enter their domain. These cruel entities appear as tall, gaunt humanoids of bark and branch, but possess the terrifying ability to assume the form of ordinary trees, becoming completely indistinguishable from the natural forest around them. Their strength is legendary, and their intelligence far greater than most give them credit for.

Unlike other woodland folk who might be protective of their forests, the Troenka simply enjoy causing suffering. They feel no need for food, water, or shelter, existing in a state of perfect self-sufficiency that has bred an overwhelming sense of superiority over all "lesser" beings. This arrogance, combined with their sadistic nature, makes them view any intruders as entertainment rather than threats.

Troenka settlements exist wherever ancient forests grow thick and dark—places like Ichneum, the Tenekee Woods, and Goranyakak. They create elaborate hunting grounds designed to trap and torment victims for extended periods, turning sections of forest into nightmarish mazes where screams echo between the trees.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 200-300 pounds

### Aspects

- Cruel tormentor
- Living wood

### Tree Form

**Major ability. Full action.**
You can transform into an ordinary-looking tree, becoming indistinguishable from natural vegetation. While in tree form, you are immobilized but gain the ability to sense all movement within 60 feet. You can remain in this form indefinitely and transform back as an action. Creatures must succeed on a CN 15 cunning check to identify you as anything other than a normal tree.

### Woodland Superiority

**Passive ability.**
While in forest terrain, your move speed increases by 20 feet and you can move through difficult terrain without penalty. You have advantage on stealth checks in natural settings and on intimidation checks against creatures you have surprised or trapped. Your natural weapons (fists, branch-like appendages) count as light weapons and deal bludgeoning damage.
