# Chase

A chase starts out with a chaser and their prey, each positioned on a number line. The chaser starts at 0, and the prey start at some distance from chaser, usually between 2 and 4.
Over the course of the chase, the chaser and prey will move up the number line. If the difference between them ever grows to 6 or more (the GM should feel free to adjust this before the chase, depending on the environment), or if the person being chased reaches a target number (a safe location, determined by the GM), then the chase ends and the prey has escaped. If at any time the chaser and the prey are on the same space on the number line, the chase is over, and the prey has been caught.
Alternating turns, starting with the chasing party, each party can take up to one action and then move once.
The action can be literally anything logical that you should be able to do in a chase. Leaping up to the rooftops, ordering for people to move out of the way, disappearing into a crowd--these are all valid actions, depending on the situation. When you take one of these actions, the GM should set a CN for how difficult it is to pull the action off successfully. On a success, and if the GM thinks it would provide a reasonable advantage, they give you an appropriate reward from the following: Take A Shortcut, Fast Lane, and Slow â€˜Em Down. These are detailed below.
Note that not every situation necessarily has an action that can be taken to effectively change the distance between parties.

### Take a Shortcut

You go someplace hard to find, access, or pass through, allowing you to make substantial progress towards your goal. When you leave this space, you may skip the next space.

### Fast Lane

Either by finding a faster means of travel or using a vehicle of some sort, you have found a way to consistently move faster than your opposition. Whenever you move, you may move one additional time.

### Slow 'Em Down

You disrupt the terrain behind you, forcing those following you to slow down. Your current space requires one additional movement to leave for anyone else.

## Movement

After possibly taking an action, the active party may move once, incrementing their position on the number line by one.
In addition to actions and moving, on each turn you may also choose to exert. When you exert, make a CN 8 endurance skill check. On a success, you may move an additional time at the end of your turn. Regardless of if you succeed or fail, the CN increases by 2. If you rolled less than or equal to half of the CN, your means of transport is exhausted. If you were moving under your own power, you are too tired to continue. If you were in a vehicle, your vehicle crashes.

## Catching the Prey

If the chaser catches the prey, the chaser starts wherever they wish in a spot behind the prey. If they wish to enter combat, they automatically go first, even if the other party wishes to retreat.
