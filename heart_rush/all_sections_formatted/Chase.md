# Chase

Sometimes a conflict can't be resolved through combat or negotiation—it becomes a desperate race where speed, cleverness, and determination decide the outcome. When one party flees and another pursues through crowded markets, across moonlit rooftops, or through tangled forests, use these chase rules to create dynamic, cinematic scenes.

## When to Use Chases

Initiate a chase when all of the following are true:

- One party is actively fleeing while another pursues
- The participants are close enough that escape isn't guaranteed (typically within 120 feet)
- The environment or situation makes the pursuit dramatic rather than routine
- Normal movement rules wouldn't capture the tension of the scene

If someone is simply running away across an open field with no obstacles or complications, use normal movement rules instead. Chases are for when the pursuit itself tells a story.

## The Chase Track

Chases use an abstract number line to represent the relative positions of all participants. This isn't about exact distances—it's about dramatic proximity.

The chaser begins at position 0. The prey starts at position 2, 3, or 4, based on how the chase began:

| Starting Situation    | Initial Distance | Example                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Adjacent or grappling | 2 spaces         | Prisoner breaks free from guards     |
| Within 30 feet        | 3 spaces         | Thief spotted picking pockets        |
| 30-60 feet away       | 4 spaces         | Scouts notice intruders at camp edge |
| 60-120 feet away      | 4 spaces         | Merchant recognizes wanted criminal  |

### Ending Conditions

A chase ends when any of these conditions are met:

**Caught:** The chaser and prey occupy the same space on the track. The pursuer has closed the distance and can attempt to grab, tackle, or otherwise apprehend their quarry.

**Escaped:** The distance between participants reaches 6 or more spaces. The prey has broken line of sight, lost their pursuer in crowds, or simply outpaced them. The GM may adjust this number—dense forests might only require 5 spaces to lose someone, while open desert might require 10.

**Safe Haven:** The prey reaches a predetermined target number on the track, representing arrival at a safe location. The GM sets this number based on the distance to safety.

**Exhaustion:** Either party becomes too exhausted to continue (see Exertion).

## Running a Chase

Chases proceed in turns, with participants alternating actions. The prey always acts first, representing their role as someone who began to flee. Even if the chase is "initiated" by the chaser, the prey still goes first.

### Each Turn

On your turn, you perform these steps in order:

1. **Take an Action** (optional): Attempt something dramatic to change the chase dynamics
2. **Move** (required): Advance one space along the track
3. **Exert** (optional): Push yourself for extra movement

### Chase Actions

Actions represent the cinematic moments that make chases memorable—leaping between rooftops, sliding under market stalls, or rallying crowds to block pursuers. When you take an action, describe what you're attempting, then roll your heart die plus the appropriate ability die against a Challenge Number set by the GM.

**Choosing Your Ability Die:**

- **Might:** Raw physical power—smashing through obstacles, leaping great distances
- **Agility:** Speed and dexterity—parkour, acrobatics, nimble maneuvering
- **Cunning:** Clever thinking—finding shortcuts, predicting opponent's route
- **Presence:** Social manipulation—rallying help, intimidating pursuers, causing distractions

The GM sets the CN based on both the difficulty of the action and the environment:

| Environment        | Base CN | Examples                                        |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Open terrain       | 6-8     | Empty roads, open fields, calm water            |
| Light obstacles    | 9-11    | City streets, sparse forest, rolling hills      |
| Dense obstacles    | 12-14   | Crowded markets, thick jungle, busy docks       |
| Extreme conditions | 15+     | Rooftops in rain, cliff faces, stampeding herds |

### Success Effects

When you succeed on a chase action, you gain one of three advantages:

**Take a Shortcut**  
You've found a path others can't easily follow—through a narrow alley, across a hidden bridge, or up a drainage pipe. You enter a restricted space. You move one additional space.

**Fast Lane**  
You've secured a persistent speed advantage—commandeered a horse, caught a river current, or found a clear path through the chaos. For the rest of the chase, starting next turn, you move one additional space whenever you move.

**Slow 'Em Down**  
You've created an obstacle that hinders your opponents—overturned a cart, cut a rope bridge, or convinced guards to block the path. Choose one: either all chasers (if you're prey) or all prey (if you're a chaser) must spend one extra movement to leave your current space. Multiple obstacles in the same space stack.

The GM determines which effect makes sense for your described action. Leaping heroically between buildings suggests a shortcut, while toppling market stalls clearly slows pursuers.

### Complications

When you roll a 1 on either die during a chase action, you face the usual choice:

- **Accept Failure:** Your action fails with no other consequences
- **Accept Complication:** Reroll the die, but something goes wrong

Chase complications should create ongoing problems:

- You leave an obvious trail (disadvantage on future attempts to hide)
- Important equipment falls during your maneuver
- You anger locals who may interfere with future actions
- You create an obstacle that affects everyone, including you
- Your dramatic action attracts unwanted attention

### Movement and Exertion

After taking any action, you must move forward one space on the track. This movement is mandatory—in a chase, standing still means getting caught or left behind.

**Exertion:** After moving, you may push yourself beyond normal limits. Make a skill check using your heart die + might die against CN 8. On a success, immediately move one additional space. Whether you succeed or fail, the CN for your next exertion attempt increases by 2 (CN 10, then 12, then 14, and so on).

If you ever roll equal to or less than half the current exertion CN, you've pushed too hard. If running under your own power, you collapse from exhaustion and can no longer participate. If driving a vehicle, it breaks down or crashes.

[[Example Chase  
A thief flees through a crowded bazaar after stealing a noble's purse. The chase begins at distance 3.

**Round 1**

Prey (Thief): Attempts to "Slide under a carpet merchant's stall" using Agility. Rolls heart d8 + agility d10 vs CN 9, getting 7—fails. Still gets to use his movement, is now at space 4.

Chaser (Guard): Attempts to "Rally the crowd to stop the thief" using Presence. Rolls heart d8 + presence d6 vs CN 8, getting 11—success! Creates "Slow 'Em Down" in the thief's space that will affect the thief. Moves to space 1. Distance is 3.

**Round 2**

Thief: Attempts to "Climb to the rooftops" using Might. Rolls 12 vs CN 11—success! Takes a shortcut, allowing him to move two spaces and letting him advance one space (would have been two spaces but for the guard's "Slow 'em Down" action). Moves to space 5.

Guard: Simply moves from space 1 to 2, then exerts. Rolls 9 vs CN—success! Moves from space 2 to 3, but CN is now 10. Distance is now 2.

The chase continues with the thief trying to reach the docks (target number 12) before being caught...]]

## Special Circumstances

Some chases include unusual factors.

### Multiple Participants

When more than two parties are involved in a chase:

1. All participants roll initiative (1d20 + agility modifier) at the start
2. Act in initiative order rather than simple alternation
3. Track each participant's position separately
4. Groups can split up, with members taking different routes

### Different Movement Speeds

The chase system assumes roughly equal movement capabilities, but significant differences matter:

- **20+ feet faster base speed:** Gain +1 space on your first movement each turn
- **20+ feet slower base speed:** Must successfully exert to move on even-numbered turns
- **Special movement (flying, swimming):** May ignore certain obstacles at GM's discretion

### Mounted Chases

When riding a mount:

- Use the mount's movement speed for any speed differential calculations
- The rider makes all skill checks, including exertion
- If the rider fails an exertion check by 5 or more, they risk falling from their mount
- Mounts may grant advantage on certain actions or ignore specific obstacles

### Attacks During Chases

Sometimes pursuers try to end a chase with violence:

- Ranged attacks are only possible when within 2 spaces of your target
- Making an attack uses your action for the turn (you cannot gain chase advantages)
- Use opportunity attack rules—this is a full action
- Account for movement when determining range—treat effective range as one category worse

### Environmental Hazards

The GM may call for saving throws when the chase passes through dangerous areas:

- **Agility saves** to avoid environmental damage while maintaining speed
- **Might saves** to endure harsh conditions without slowing
- **Cunning saves** to maintain direction in confusing terrain

Failing a save might cause damage, lose a space of movement, or create complications.

## After the Chase

When a chase ends with the prey being caught:

- The chaser chooses their position relative to the prey
- If combat begins, the chaser acts first regardless of normal initiative
- The prey cannot use movement on their first combat turn

When a chase ends with escape:

- The prey has successfully broken pursuit
- The GM determines how long before another chase could reasonably begin
- Consider what the failed pursuit means for the story

## Quick Reference

**Turn Sequence**

1. Action (optional) → Roll heart + ability vs CN
2. Move (required) → Forward 1 space
3. Exert (optional) → Heart + Might vs CN 8 (+2 per attempt)

**Success Effects**

- **Shortcut:** Skip next space when leaving current space
- **Fast Lane:** +1 space per move for future moves
- **Slow Down:** Opponents need +1 move to leave their space

**Environmental CNs**

- Open terrain: 6-8
- Light obstacles: 9-11
- Dense obstacles: 12-14
- Extreme conditions: 15+

**Chase Ends When**

- Same space = Caught
- 6+ spaces apart = Escaped
- Reach target number = Safe
- Failed exhaustion = Chase over
