# Journeys

Not all travel needs rules. Walking between nearby villages on safe roads requires nothing more than narration. But when the journey itself holds danger and uncertainty—crossing frozen wastelands, navigating treacherous seas, or blazing trails through monster-infested wilderness—these rules help create memorable travel experiences without bogging down play.

## When to Use Journey Rules

The journey system serves three purposes: it creates risk for dangerous travel, it allows players to zoom in on interesting moments while glossing over repetitive ones, and it integrates travel challenges with the rest of the game's mechanics.

**Skip these rules entirely when:**

- Travel is safe and routine (roads between civilized areas)
- The journey isn't important to the story
- You want to jump straight to the destination

**Use a single journey roll when:**

- Brief but risky travel (crossing a dangerous valley)
- Time is critical but you don't want extended scenes
- The journey is notable but not the session's focus

**Use the full system when:**

- Multi-day expeditions through dangerous territory
- The journey is a major story element
- Resource management and survival matter
- You want the travel to feel earned and significant

## Journey Structure

Before beginning a journey, the GM divides it into segments. Each segment represents a significant portion of travel through relatively consistent conditions.

### Segments

The number of segments depends on journey length and danger:

- **1 segment:** Several hours to a full day of risky travel
- **2-3 segments:** Several days to a week
- **4-6 segments:** Week to month-long expedition

Segment boundaries occur at major transitions: terrain changes, resupply opportunities, or dramatic shifts in danger level. A journey from a port city to mountain ruins might have three segments: coastal roads (safe, no roll needed), foothills (1 segment), and high mountain passes (1 segment).

### Journey Difficulty

Each segment has a Challenge Number based on terrain and conditions:

| Difficulty  | CN  | Examples                                               |
| ----------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Favorable   | 6   | Known paths, mild weather, some shelter available      |
| Challenging | 9   | Wilderness travel, poor weather, limited resources     |
| Harsh       | 12  | Extreme terrain, severe weather, hostile environment   |
| Brutal      | 15  | Uncharted territory, deadly conditions, active threats |
| Nightmarish | 18  | Supernatural dangers, impossible conditions            |

## Making Journey Rolls

At the start of each segment, one character makes a journey roll. This is typically whoever is guiding the group—the best navigator, the local guide, or whoever has the most relevant expertise.

**The roll:** Heart die + relevant ability die + modifiers

**Choosing ability die:**

- **Might:** Enduring harsh physical conditions, forced marches
- **Agility:** Navigating treacherous terrain, climbing routes
- **Cunning:** Complex navigation, finding safe paths, weather prediction
- **Presence:** Maintaining group morale, negotiating passage

Other characters can help (granting advantage) if they could reasonably assist. A ranger might help navigate while a bard keeps spirits high.

### Journey Roll Results

**Success (meet or exceed CN):** The segment passes without major incident. Describe the journey as a montage—the challenges faced, sights seen, and progress made. The party finds adequate shelter and can automatically succeed on sleeping checks for this segment if the GM is tracking such things.

**Failure (below CN):** The party fails to achieve their core objective for this segment. They might become lost, make no progress, or find their route impassable. The GM selects one result from the Failure Consequences section.

**Complications (any die shows a 1):** Whether the roll succeeds or fails, an unexpected situation arises requiring immediate attention. Play zooms in to action mode as players deal with the complication. The GM selects from the Complications section.

## Failure Consequences

When a journey roll fails, the party has genuinely failed at their goal for that segment. The GM chooses one:

### Lost or Stalled

The party's navigation fails catastrophically:

- **Completely Lost:** The segment must be repeated—no progress made
- **Wrong Direction:** Add an extra segment as you correct course
- **Impassable Route:** The way forward is blocked; find another path (adding a segment) or turn back
- **Circles in the Wilderness:** Arrive back where you started the segment

### Unable to Find Safe Haven

The party cannot secure proper shelter or safety:

- **No Safe Camps:** Cannot find adequate shelter—all sleeping checks this segment have disadvantage
- **Exposed Camps:** Poor shelter in harsh conditions—everyone takes a rank 1d6 wound labeled "exposure"
- **Forced March:** Must travel without rest—everyone gains 2 levels of weakened

### Critical Delays

When time matters, the journey takes far longer than expected:

- **Missed Opportunity:** Arrive too late for time-sensitive goals
- **Season Change:** Weather turns against you—increase all remaining segment CNs by 3
- **Pursued:** Whatever you're fleeing catches up

## Complications

Complications represent unexpected challenges that arise during travel. They don't prevent progress but demand immediate attention. When a complication occurs, play zooms in to action mode—describe the situation and let players decide how to handle it.

## Resources and Survival

The journey system integrates with Heart Rush's existing survival mechanics. How closely you track resources depends on the situation's dramatic needs.

### Montage Mode (Default)

During successful segments with adequate supplies, don't track individual rations or daily activities. Simply narrate the journey's highlights and assume competent travelers manage their resources appropriately.

### Daily Tracking Mode

Switch to daily tracking when:

- Supplies run low (less than 3 days of food/water per person)
- The party has multiple wounded members needing recovery
- A failed journey roll results in "No Safe Camps"
- Resolving any complication
- Extreme weather conditions threaten survival
- Players choose to "zoom in" for any reason

During daily tracking:

- Consume 1 food and 1 water ration per person per day
- Make sleeping checks using normal rules
- Apply temperature and exposure rules as needed
- Track actual distance if time matters

### Equipment Impact

Journey preparation matters. Well-equipped parties journey more safely:

- **Food/Water Rations:** Without adequate supplies, use starvation and dehydration rules from Basic Needs
- **Tent:** Provides shelter and +20 to sleeping checks
- **Bedroll:** Grants +20 to sleeping checks
- **Healing Kits:** Essential for treating wounds during travel
- **Rope, Climbing Gear:** May grant advantage on rolls in mountainous terrain
- **Guide or Map:** May grant advantage on journey rolls

[[Example Journey
The party must reach the Storm Crown ruins before the cult completes their ritual—a journey of roughly 100 miles through increasingly dangerous terrain.

**GM Preparation:**

- Segment 1: Farmlands to forest edge (safe, no roll)
- Segment 2: Through the Darkwood (CN 9)
- Segment 3: Climbing the Stormpeaks (CN 12)
- Segment 4: The ruins approach (CN 15)

**Play Example:**
Segment 1 passes in narration. For Segment 2, the ranger rolls Heart (d8) + Cunning (d8) with advantage from the druid's help. Rolling 1, 7, and 6, they keep the 13—success despite the complication.

The GM describes a successful if tense journey through the forest, but the 1 triggers a complication: wildfire spreading from the west. The party must choose: race through on the known path (risking the flames) or detour through giant spider territory.

After resolving the fire escape, Segment 3 begins. The ranger rolls poorly: 5 total against CN 12. The party becomes lost in a blizzard, adding an extra segment to the journey. Will they still arrive in time?]]

## Running Journeys

Some quick advice for GMs and players.

### For GMs

The journey system creates a framework for travel drama without simulation. Focus on interesting choices rather than bookkeeping.

**Prepare segments based on story needs:** A desperate race might have many short segments with complications, while exploration might have fewer, longer segments.

**Let failure drive story:** Failed journey rolls shouldn't end adventures—they create new problems. The party hired to stop a ritual might arrive too late, shifting from prevention to damage control.

**Match complications to tone:** In a gritty survival game, complications might all threaten resources. In high adventure, they might offer mysterious discoveries or dramatic challenges.

**Know when to zoom out:** Once a complication resolves, return to montage mode unless resources are critically low or players want to continue in detail.

### For Players

Journeys are opportunities for adventure, not just transitions between locations.

**Prepare appropriately:** Equipment matters. A tent and bedroll can mean the difference between recovering from wounds and accumulating more.

**Consider guides:** Local knowledge grants advantage and might reveal better routes.

**Embrace complications:** These moments let you make meaningful choices about your journey. The ancient ruins might hold treasures—or threats.

**Resource management matters:** When supplies run low, every decision becomes critical. Do you push forward or hunt for food?

The journey system ensures that reaching your destination feels earned. The mountain peak is sweeter when you've survived the climb.
