# Journeys

## When the travel is safe and not a focus of gameplay

When the travel is safe and not a focus of gameplay, such as on a well-traveled road between nearby towns, you only need to know the basics of travel speed so you can determine how long it takes (described below). In these cases, you are assumed to reach your destination in the appropriate amount of time and the game can continue at the new location.

## When travel is a major focal point

However, in cases where travel is a major focal point of gameplay, the rest of this section describes the rules for travel.

### Travel Basics

The first step in beginning a journey is figuring out how long it will take. You can calculate this by using your daily travel speed. The GM should then segment the journey, and add events, which will be explained later in this section.

### Travel Speed

Your travel speed is calculated based off your movement speed. The following sections describe how far you can travel in different terrain. These distances represent miles of progress towards your destination, not absolute distance traveled.

When you begin, the GM should calculate how long it will take to reach your destination, assuming everything goes well.

#### On Foot

- If you are on a path on flat ground, you can cover 24 miles per day.
- In difficult terrain, such as swamps, jungles, and mountains (as determined by the GM), this distance is halved.
- If you are not on a path, this movement speed is also halved.

#### On a vehicle

- If you are on horseback, in a carriage, or traveling via some other land-vehicle, use the vehicle’s daily travel speed rather than your own.
- Horses and carriages have the same movement speed as humans for the purposes of calculating daily travel speeds, but they will have greater carrying capacity and will not be penalized by your own movement penalties, such as those from armor.

### Segmenting the Journey

On long trips through varied terrain, the GM should segment the journey into different distinct sections, broken at each major change in terrain. For example, if the trip is through the mountains and into the forests beyond, there may be a segment of mountain travel and a segment of forest travel. Most trips do not need multiple segments.

When segmenting trips, the GM should calculate how long each segment should take based on the distance and travel speed in that segment of the journey.

### Events

Besides survival, these are what make a journey into an adventure. Events can include things such as falling avalanches, bandits attacking, tombs being discovered, and just about anything else you can imagine creating a situation where danger or further investigation might be warranted.

The GM should add between one and five events to most journeys, sticking with lower numbers on shorter journeys or longer, safer ones, and higher numbers for longer, more dangerous journeys. If there are multiple segments in the trip, it’s usually a good idea to add at least one event per segment.

[[GM Note: Check out the Journey chapter in the GM section of this book. There’s lots of advice on how to come up with interesting events and advice on when to use them.]]

### Making the Journey

When you actually leave for the journey, for each segment, the GM should determine if any of the following survival challenges are necessary to the wellbeing of the players during the segment, and couldn’t be reasonably prepared for or already accounted for:

- Keep Watch
- Navigate
- Collect Water
- Gather Food
- Find Shelter

If you are bringing enough food and water for the duration of the segment, for example, the GM should not include Gather Food or Collect Water. The tasks the GM deems as necessary will each require one or more successful skill checks in order to avoid turning into a bigger problem for you and your party.

You or someone else from the party must make a skill check for each of these needs, using the challenge number from the table below. The same person can make multiple skill checks, but they get disadvantage on each skill check they make for every additional skill check they have to make. Conversely, anyone not making a skill check can grant advantage to exactly one skill check being made by another player.

| Terrain | Keep Watch | Navigate | Collect Water | Gather Food | Find Shelter |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Arctic | 7 | 10 | 5 | 12 | 8 |
| Coast | 8 | 4 | 6 | 6 | 5 |
| Canyons | 10 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 5 |
| Desert | 5 | 9 | 13 | 12 | 10 |
| Forest | 11 | 9 | 5 | 5 | 8 |
| Grassland | 5 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 7 |
| Hellscape | 8 | 8 | 16 | 14 | 10 |
| Jungle | 12 | 13 | 5 | 4 | 11 |
| Open Water | 4 | 10 | 15* | 8 | Impossible |
| Sprawling City | 13 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Swamp | 12 | 13 | 8 | 9 | 12 |
| Tundra | 6 | 8 | 7 | 10 | 9 |
| Underground | 12 | 14 | 4 | 12 | 8 |

*Note: 15* indicates a special case or higher difficulty.

### Total Success

On succeeding at every skill check, the journey progresses to the event phase. No challenge phases are triggered.

### Skill Check Failure

If a skill check is failed, players can face consequences. Each skill check has its own consequences for failure. If multiple skill checks are failed, the GM may choose to resolve them in whichever order they wish.

#### Skill check consequences

- **Keep Watch:** Succeeding on this skill check represents keeping a watchful eye on your surroundings throughout the travel phase. When you successfully keep watch, when an event occurs, you and the party see any threats present before they see you. On a failure, any people or creatures from an event surprise you.

- **Navigate:** Succeeding on this skill check represents consistently staying on track towards your destination. On a failure, the party fails to make progress towards the destination and the party enters an event phase. This event does not count towards the total number of events for the journey.

- **Gather Food:** Succeeding on this skill check represents successfully fishing, hunting, or foraging enough to keep everyone fed during the travel phase. On a failure, the travel phase ends and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get food, you cannot resume the travel phase. You may have to eat pack animals, consume unidentified plants, hunt more dangerous creatures, or go hungry until food becomes available again. When the challenge phase triggered by this failure ends, if the GM rules that food is still an issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill.

[[GM Note: Even though travel phases don’t all have to be the same duration and it’s all a montage anyway, it’s still important to have a good idea how long each leg of the journey lasts. This way, if players get stuck in a challenge phase at some point and decide to tough it out till the end, you know how many days it will take. It also means you can calculate how many long rests they have between events, so they can heal an appropriate amount. Check for the travel phase.]]

- **Collect Water:** Succeeding on this skill check represents consistently finding enough clean drinking water to keep everyone hydrated during the travel phase. On a failure, the travel phase ends and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get water, you cannot resume the travel phase. You may have to drink unclean water, journey to more dangerous water sources, or wait until water becomes available again. When the challenge phase triggered by this failure ends, if the GM rules that water is still an issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill check for the travel phase.

- **Find Shelter:** Succeeding on this skill check represents finding safe places to build shelter and get good rest away from the elements. If you have a tent, you get +4 to this roll. If you have a bedroll, you get +3. If you are not at a comfortable temperature, as per the rules in the Temperature section, you get -3 per temperature tier you are off by. On a failure, the travel phase ends. It is nightfall and you cannot find a safe place to set up camp. You may have to sleep in a more dangerous location, or skip sleep altogether. When the challenge phase triggered by this failure ends, if the GM rules shelter is still an issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill check.

### Other Interruptions

If you wish to stop the travel phase at any point, you may do so. Regular game-time resumes until you and your party agree to resume the journey. As long as your general ability to travel safely has not changed, you should resume the previous travel phase, keeping its rolls and results.

### Healing During Travel

If you lose health during an encounter or during a challenge phase, you...

[[Compounding Failure: Failing once and not resolving the issue even temporarily makes it harder to succeed again, and previously unresolved failures can build up quickly, resulting in being forced to face multiple challenges simultaneously. When feasible, it’s generally best to not let this happen.]]

## Challenge Phase

When a challenge phase begins, the montage of travel is over. Challenge phases begin when you have no food, no water, or no shelter. Gameplay slows down to normal pace. You must now make decisions as you would in a normal situation—the GM describes the situation, and you have to figure out what to do.

If you want to continue travel as you did before, you must now make daily checks to keep watch, gather food, collect water, navigate, and find shelter. Everyone should make skill checks for these as they would for the travel phase, unless they are doing something uniquely different compared to what they would have been doing during the travel phase. For example, if you were riding a horse, ran out of food, entered a challenge phase, and then butchered your horse for food, you would not need to make a skill check to gather food for a few days.

### Daily Consequences

Failing any of these skill checks results in the same consequences as normal, though they occur immediately, and do not trigger new challenge phases—you just remain in the existing one.

[[GM Note: For advice on how to make and run interesting events, see the Travel Events section. While in the challenge phase, it is possible you will spend time going hungry or thirsty, without sleep, or too hot or cold. Each has their own consequences as outlined in the Basic Needs section.]]

### Ending the Challenge Phase

If you start a day after succeeding at every required skill check the day before, you are capable of traveling, and there are no obvious threats to your immediate safety, the challenge phase ends and you resume the travel phase. The GM may continue the montage of travel.

Alternatively, if the GM rules that you’ve gone enough distance to reach your destination, the journey ends.

## Event Phase

Events represent highlights and notable moments from a journey (in addition to any struggles faced during challenge phases). They can take a wide variety of forms, some good, some bad, and they should be introduced as an interruption to travel. For example, the GM might describe rounding a hill after days of travel and seeing the colossal ruins of a destroyed dwarven fortress on the mountainside. The players can now investigate the fortress in normal game-time.

Once players are finished with an event, are no longer threatened by it, and have chosen to move on, the event phase ends and the next travel phase begins.

## Pack Animals

If you are traveling light, you may be able to carry all of the necessary gear you need on your back. However, on longer trips, you will likely want a pack animal, especially if you want to bring all your food with you. See the Equipment & Gear section for rules on carrying capacity and a list of common equipment.

## Journey Modes

When traveling long distances, there are two modes of gameplay: travel mode, and action mode.

- In travel mode, time passes quickly, and the GM should describe the activities of the party like a montage. You are welcome to chime in to describe what you are doing as you travel, but this gameplay occurs at macro pace. The GM may describe the highlights of the journey, small oddities you may have noticed along the trail, but nothing that out of the ordinary.

- The second mode of travel is action mode. In action mode, play returns to micro pace—you're back to deciding what you want to do, moment to moment, scene by scene.

During a journey, most of the distance traveled will likely occur in travel mode. However, when survival becomes a challenge, or notable incidents occur, the journey will switch to action mode and you and your party will have to figure out how to deal with it. Once you have dealt with whatever came up, along with any fallout, you may return to travel mode and continue along your journey.

## GM Trip Segmentation

The GM breaks the trip into segments of terrain. Each segment requires X successful travel checks to get through uneventfully, and is Y days of travel long. The GM should also make Z number of events to put in throughout the journey.

- Roll each check as necessary.
- As you reach different places along the journey, if you had been in travel mode, it triggers a re-roll.
- All failures occur simultaneously.
- When you fail a roll, the GM chooses which one actually causes the journey to grind to a halt. The rest of the failures just impose disadvantage on the next check to that roll.

Each travel segment should have a chance of...

- Splitting the trip into segments of terrain. Each terrain segment has its own travel mode roll. The GM should sprinkle failures throughout while players are in that section. Once action mode has begun, the GM can spend those failures on failures during action mode.
- When in action mode, the check to hunt is more interactive. Roll to find animals, roll to kill them; the animals you find are random durations of food. Others can help for advantage.
- Collecting water failure means you have to keep traveling into the night to find some.
- Shelter failure means you need to keep traveling, or not sleep, or find a more dangerous place to spend the night.
- Navigation failure means you make no progress and have a chance to encounter something new. Can make one in the day.

When action mode begins, have days of food equal to the surplus on the food-finding roll. Roll 1 higher, and you have one extra day of food. All canteens are full.

You can resume travel mode once more than half of the party has finished a successful long rest.

Segment the trip as necessary between different terrains, if present. Many trips will have just one terrain and therefore just one segment.

Approximate length of each segment in miles and time.

Add X events to the trip. They can occur whenever, though at least one per terrain is a good idea.

May Y rolls for each necessity for each segment, in order. If the segment requires 4 rolls, then the first roll represents the first quarter of the distance traveled.

Whenever a roll is failed, things go wrong immediately. The GM chooses which roll causes the party to fail. The remaining ones just act as disadvantage on the rolls during the action phase.
