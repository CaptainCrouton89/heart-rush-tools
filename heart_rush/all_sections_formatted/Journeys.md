# Journeys

Not all travel needs rules. Walking between nearby villages on safe roads requires nothing more than narration. But when the journey itself holds danger and uncertainty—crossing frozen wastelands, navigating treacherous seas, or blazing trails through monster-infested wilderness—these rules help create memorable travel experiences without bogging down play.

## When to Use Journey Rules

The journey system serves three purposes: it creates risk for dangerous travel, it allows players to zoom in on interesting moments while glossing over repetitive ones, and it integrates travel challenges with the rest of the game's mechanics.

**Skip these rules entirely when:**

- Travel is safe and routine (roads between civilized areas)
- The journey isn't important to the story
- You want to jump straight to the destination

**Use a single journey roll when:**

- Brief but risky travel (crossing a dangerous valley)
- Time is critical but you don't want extended scenes
- The journey is notable but not the session's focus

**Use the full system when:**

- Multi-day expeditions through dangerous territory
- The journey is a major story element
- Resource management and survival matter
- You want the travel to feel earned and significant

## Journey Structure

Before beginning a journey, the GM divides it into segments. Each segment represents a significant portion of travel through relatively consistent conditions.

### Segments

The number of segments depends on journey length and danger:

- **1 segment:** Several hours to a full day of risky travel
- **2-3 segments:** Several days to a week
- **4-6 segments:** Week to month-long expedition

Segment boundaries occur at major transitions: terrain changes, resupply opportunities, or dramatic shifts in danger level. A journey from a port city to mountain ruins might have three segments: coastal roads (safe, no roll needed), foothills (1 segment), and high mountain passes (1 segment).

### Journey Difficulty

Each segment has a Challenge Number based on terrain and conditions:

| Difficulty  | CN  | Examples                                               |
| ----------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Favorable   | 6   | Known paths, mild weather, some shelter available      |
| Challenging | 9   | Wilderness travel, poor weather, limited resources     |
| Harsh       | 12  | Extreme terrain, severe weather, hostile environment   |
| Brutal      | 15  | Uncharted territory, deadly conditions, active threats |
| Nightmarish | 18+ | Supernatural dangers, impossible conditions            |

## Making Journey Rolls

At the start of each segment, one character makes a journey roll. This is typically whoever is guiding the group—the best navigator, the local guide, or whoever has the most relevant expertise.

**The roll:** Heart die + relevant ability die + relevant skill + aspects

**Choosing ability die:**

- **Might:** Enduring harsh physical conditions, forced marches
- **Agility:** Navigating treacherous terrain, climbing routes
- **Cunning:** Complex navigation, finding safe paths, weather prediction
- **Presence:** Maintaining group morale, negotiating passage

Other characters can help (granting advantage) if they can provide unique expertise to the journey, beyond things that anyone with eyes, ears, and a brain could do. For example, if they are a sailor and it's a sea voyage, or if they have wilderness knowledge on a mountaineering trip.

### Journey Roll Results

**Success (meet or exceed CN):** The segment passes without major incident. Describe the journey as a montage—the challenges faced, sights seen, and progress made. The party finds adequate shelter and can automatically succeed on sleeping checks for this segment if the GM is tracking such things.

**Failure (below CN):** The party fails to achieve their core objective for this segment. They might become lost, make no progress, or find their route impassable. The GM selects one result from the Failure Consequences section.

**Complications (a die shows a 1):** Whether the roll succeeds or fails, an unexpected situation arises requiring immediate attention. Play zooms in to action mode as players deal with the complication. The GM selects from the Complications section.

## Failure Consequences

When a journey roll fails, the party has genuinely failed at their goal for that segment. The GM chooses from one of the options below, selecting one from the list below. They may also choose to offer the players a choice between a few, though they have no obligation to do so.

When they choose an option, the GM should describe exactly what is stopping the party from succeeding. Sometimes, the party will have an idea on how to overcome the failure, in which case they are welcome to try—play should zoom back in.

### Lost or Stalled

The party's navigation fails catastrophically:

- **Wrong Direction**
  - Add an extra, new segment as you correct course.
  - GM: "The mountain pass you've been following for days ends at a sheer cliff face. Your map shows this should connect to the valley road, but clearly something's wrong. You'll need to backtrack and find the correct route."
  - Party followup: The party may decide to scale the cliff, just to make sure. Maybe the trail continues?
- **Impassable Route**
  - The way forward is blocked; add an extra, new segment, or repeat the previous one.
  - GM: "The bridge spanning the gorge has collapsed, its stone blocks scattered in the rushing water below. The detour through the highland paths will add days to your journey."
  - Party followup: The party might attempt to repair the bridge, find materials to build a raft, or use magic to cross the gap directly.
- **Circles in the Wilderness**
  - Arrive back where you started the segment.
  - GM: "Something's not right—that lightning-struck oak looks familiar. Too familiar. You've been walking in circles for hours, and the sun is already setting where it should be rising."
  - Party followup: The party may climb high to get their bearings, use magical divination, or carefully examine the ground for their own tracks to break the pattern.

### Unable to Find Safe Haven

The party cannot secure proper shelter or safety:

- **No Safe Camps**
  - Cannot find adequate shelter for restful sleep—everyone takes 1 level of dazed, weakened, and off-balanced that do not fade until they sleep a full night.
  - GM: "As darkness falls, every potential campsite proves unsuitable—too exposed to wind, too rocky for bedrolls, or showing signs of dangerous wildlife. You're forced to huddle together in whatever meager shelter you can find."
  - Party followup: The party might use magic to create shelter, attempt to build better protection from available materials, or decide to travel through the night to find proper rest elsewhere.
- **Exposed Camps**
  - Poor shelter in harsh conditions—everyone takes a rank 1d6 wound labeled "exposure."
  - GM: "The storm hits harder than expected, and your makeshift shelter barely holds. Rain seeps through every gap, the wind cuts through your clothes, and by morning everyone is shivering and miserable."
  - Party followup: The party may try to find better materials to improve their shelter, use magic to ward off the elements, or seek out natural protection like caves or dense tree cover.
- **Forced March**
  - Must travel without rest—everyone gains 3 levels of weakened.
  - GM: "The ground here is too unstable to camp safely, and with the weather turning, you have no choice but to keep moving through the night. By dawn, everyone is stumbling with exhaustion."
  - Party followup: The party might look for any small shelter to rest briefly, use stimulants or magic to push through the fatigue, or decide to risk camping despite the dangerous conditions.

### Critical Delays

When time matters, the journey takes far longer than expected:

- **Missed Opportunity**
  - Arrive too late for time-sensitive goals.
  - GM: "You crest the final hill to see the merchant caravan's dust cloud disappearing over the horizon. The trading post keeper shakes his head—they left at dawn, couldn't wait any longer with winter coming."
  - Party followup: The party might try to catch up by pushing hard, seek alternative transportation, or find another way to accomplish their original goal.
- **Season Change**
  - Weather turns against you—increase all remaining segment CNs by 3.
  - GM: "The first snow begins to fall as you make camp, earlier than anyone expected. What started as autumn travel has become a winter expedition, and the mountain passes ahead will be far more treacherous."
  - Party followup: The party may decide to turn back while they still can, seek better cold weather gear from locals, or push forward despite the increased danger.
- **Pursued**
  - Whatever you're fleeing catches up.
  - GM: "The sound of hoofbeats echoes off the canyon walls behind you. Your pursuers have found your trail, and they're gaining fast. There's nowhere left to run—you'll have to face them here."
  - Party followup: The party might prepare an ambush, try to negotiate from a position of weakness, or look for a last-minute escape route like climbing the canyon walls.

## Complications

Complications represent unexpected challenges that arise during travel. They don't prevent progress but demand immediate attention. When a complication occurs, play zooms in to action mode—describe the situation and let players decide how to handle it.

## Resources and Survival

The journey system integrates with Heart Rush's existing survival mechanics. How closely you track resources depends on the situation's dramatic needs.

### Montage Mode (Default)

During successful segments with adequate supplies, don't track individual rations or daily activities. Simply narrate the journey's highlights and assume competent travelers manage their resources appropriately.

### Daily Tracking Mode

Switch to daily tracking when:

- Supplies run low (less than 3 days of food/water per person)
- The party has multiple wounded members needing recovery
- A failed journey roll results in "No Safe Camps"
- Resolving any complication
- Extreme weather conditions threaten survival
- Players choose to "zoom in" for any reason

During daily tracking:

- Consume 1 food and 1 water ration per person per day
- Make sleeping checks using normal rules
- Apply temperature and exposure rules as needed
- Track actual distance if time matters

### Equipment Impact

Journey preparation matters. Well-equipped parties journey more safely:

- **Food/Water Rations:** Without adequate supplies, use starvation and dehydration rules from Basic Needs
- **Tent:** Provides shelter and +20 to sleeping checks
- **Bedroll:** Grants +20 to sleeping checks
- **Healing Kits:** Essential for treating wounds during travel
- **Rope, Climbing Gear:** May grant advantage on rolls in mountainous terrain
- **Guide or Map:** May grant advantage on journey rolls

[[Example Journey
The party must reach the Storm Crown ruins before the cult completes their ritual—a journey of roughly 100 miles through increasingly dangerous terrain.

**GM Preparation:**

- Segment 1: Farmlands to forest edge (safe, no roll)
- Segment 2: Through the Darkwood (CN 9)
- Segment 3: Climbing the Stormpeaks (CN 12)
- Segment 4: The ruins approach (CN 15)

**Play Example:**
Segment 1 passes in narration. For Segment 2, the party navigator rolls Heart (d8) + Cunning (d8). Rolling 1, 6, they choose to take the complication, rerolling the 1 for a 5. They succeed with their new roll, and take a complication.

The GM describes a successful if tense journey through the forest, but the 1 triggers a complication: wildfire spreading from the west. The party must choose: race through on the known path (risking the flames) or detour through giant spider territory.

After resolving the fire escape, Segment 3 begins. The ranger rolls poorly: 5 total against CN 12. The party becomes lost in a blizzard, adding an extra segment to the journey. Will they still arrive in time?]]

## Running Journeys

Some quick advice for GMs and players.

### For GMs

The journey system creates a framework for travel drama without simulation. Focus on interesting choices rather than bookkeeping.

**Prepare segments based on story needs:** A desperate race might have many short segments with complications, while exploration might have fewer, longer segments.

**Let failure drive story:** Failed journey rolls shouldn't end adventures—they create new problems. The party hired to stop a ritual might arrive too late, shifting from prevention to damage control.

**Match complications to tone:** In a gritty survival game, complications might all threaten resources. In high adventure, they might offer mysterious discoveries or dramatic challenges.

**Know when to zoom out:** Once a complication resolves, return to montage mode unless resources are critically low or players want to continue in detail.

### For Players

Journeys are opportunities for adventure, not just transitions between locations.

**Prepare appropriately:** Equipment matters. A tent and bedroll can mean the difference between recovering from wounds waking up tired and unhealed.

**Consider guides:** Local knowledge grants advantage and might reveal better routes.

**Embrace complications:** These moments let you make meaningful choices about your journey. The ancient ruins might hold treasures—or threats.

**Resource management matters:** When supplies run low, every decision becomes critical. Do you push forward or hunt for food?

The journey system ensures that reaching your destination feels earned. The mountain peak is sweeter when you've survived the climb.
