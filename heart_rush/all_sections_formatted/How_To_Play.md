# How To Play

Heart Rush brings epic adventures to life through collaborative storytelling and dynamic dice mechanics. In this game, 3-6 players gather to weave tales of heroism, with one taking the role of Game Master (GM) to guide the world while others portray heroes shaping their destinies within it. What sets Heart Rush apart is its seamless flow between intimate character moments and grand strategic endeavors, all resolved through a unified system that keeps play moving and engaging.

This chapter teaches you the fundamental rhythm of play—from basic conversation at the table to rolling dice when fate hangs in the balance. You'll learn how to navigate different scales of action, structure satisfying sessions, and contribute to stories that surprise even their creators.

## The Flow of Play

Every moment in Heart Rush emerges from a structured conversation between players and GM. Unlike board games with rigid turn orders or video games with predetermined outcomes, Heart Rush creates its narrative through verbal exchange and shared imagination. The dice appear only when genuine uncertainty exists, adding tension and surprise to pivotal moments.

**Core Principle: The game flows through natural conversation punctuated by dice rolls when outcomes are uncertain and consequences matter.**

### The Conversation

The heartbeat of Heart Rush is a simple conversational loop that repeats throughout play. The GM presents situations, players respond with their characters' actions, and together you discover what happens next. This isn't idle chatter—it's the engine that drives your adventures forward.

**The Basic Loop**:

1. **GM describes the situation** — "The tavern falls silent as three hooded figures enter..."
2. **Players ask clarifying questions** — "Can I see their faces? Do they seem armed?"
3. **Players declare character actions** — "I casually move my hand to my sword hilt"
4. **Resolution (if needed)** — Dice determine uncertain outcomes
5. **GM narrates consequences** — "One figure notices your movement and whispers to the others..."
6. **The cycle continues** — Building tension, revealing information, creating story

Most gameplay happens in this conversational space. You might spend twenty minutes negotiating with a merchant prince without touching dice, then roll three times in rapid succession when assassins crash through the windows. The rhythm adapts to the fiction.

### When Dice Enter Play

**Dice appear when three conditions align:**

- **Meaningful uncertainty exists** — Success and failure are both plausible
- **Consequences matter** — The outcome will significantly impact the story
- **Character action requires resolution** — Someone attempts something challenging

Without all three conditions, play continues through pure narration. This keeps the game flowing and ensures dice rolls feel important rather than routine.

**Special Resolution: Combat**

When violence erupts and multiple participants engage in deadly struggle, the game shifts to the combat system. This specialized resolution framework handles the chaos of battle through structured phases that capture simultaneous action. Combat begins when:

- **Initiative matters** — Multiple combatants act with conflicting goals
- **Positioning is tactical** — Where you stand affects what you can do
- **Exchanges are lethal** — Attacks threaten immediate harm
- **Timing is critical** — Split-second decisions determine survival

A simple shove might use a basic skill check, but when swords are drawn and battle lines form, combat rules provide the granular detail these life-or-death moments deserve.

## Scales of Play

Heart Rush's elegant zoom mechanic allows seamless transitions between different scales of action. Like a film director choosing between close-ups and panoramic shots, you'll shift focus based on what serves the story best. Each scale has its own rhythm and rules, but transitions happen naturally through play rather than rigid mechanics.

**The Three Scales:**

- **Zoomed In**: Real-time, moment-to-moment action
- **Montage**: Compressed time for extended activities
- **Stratagems**: Grand endeavors spanning days to years

### Zoomed In: Moment to Moment

This is Heart Rush's default mode—experiencing the world through your character's immediate perceptions and choices. When zoomed in, time moves naturally. A five-minute conversation takes roughly five minutes to play out. Every detail matters, from the creak of floorboards to the glint in an opponent's eye.

**When to Use Zoomed-In Play:**

- **Exploration** — Investigating the abandoned tower room by room
- **Social Encounters** — Negotiating with the crime lord for safe passage
- **Combat** — Trading blows with cultists in the ancient temple
- **Problem Solving** — Determining how to bypass magical wards
- **Dramatic Moments** — Confronting your character's nemesis

**Characteristics of Zoomed-In Play:**

- Specific actions and dialogue
- Immediate consequences
- Tactical positioning matters
- Individual skill checks for discrete actions
- Real-time decision making

**Combat as Zoomed-In Resolution**

Combat represents the most granular form of zoomed-in play. When violence breaks out, the game zooms in even further to track individual attacks, defensive maneuvers, and split-second tactical decisions. While a tense negotiation might involve several skill checks over ten minutes, a combat encounter tracks every swing, spell, and desperate dodge in six-second rounds. This hyper-focused resolution ensures that life-or-death struggles feel appropriately intense and tactical.

**See the Combat section for complete rules on initiative, attack sequences, and tactical options.**

### Montage: Compressed Time

When the destination matters more than the journey, play shifts to montage mode. This compressed timeframe handles necessary but potentially tedious activities through abbreviated narration and key decision points. A week of travel might take five minutes to resolve, hitting only the highlights and meaningful choices.

**When to Use Montage:**

- **Travel** — "Over three days of hard riding, you reach the mountain pass..."
- **Downtime** — "You spend the week between adventures crafting and gathering information..."
- **Recovery** — "Ten days of rest in the monastery restore your strength..."
- **Training** — "After a month of practice, you've mastered the new sword technique..."
- **Research** — "Scouring the library for clues takes several days..."

**Key Montage Principles:**

- Time compression preserves momentum
- Players still make meaningful choices
- Complications can trigger zoomed-in scenes
- Resources (supplies, money) get consumed appropriately
- Character development happens between adventures

**See the Journeys section for structured travel montage rules**

### Stratagems: Grand Endeavors

The stratagem scale handles complex undertakings that would bog down play if resolved through normal means. When you command fleets, manage trade empires, or orchestrate political campaigns, stratagems abstract the coordination and logistics while preserving meaningful decisions and dramatic turning points.

**When to Use Stratagems:**

- **Leading Organizations** — Your mercenary company besieges a fortress
- **Managing from Afar** — Your trading house expands while you adventure
- **Long-term Projects** — Researching forgotten magic over months
- **Complex Conflicts** — Naval battles with multiple ships
- **Political Maneuvering** — Building influence through the royal court

**Core Stratagem Mechanic: Roll d8 + ability die + profession + aspect vs Challenge Number set by assets and hindrances**

Each stratagem roll represents significant time investment—hours, days, or months depending on scope. Success advances your position or accumulates progress toward victory. Direct intervention through zoomed-in scenes can dramatically shift the odds.

**See the Stratagem System section for complete rules**

## Structure of Sessions

A typical Heart Rush session runs 2-4 hours, though groups adapt to their preferences. Understanding session structure helps you maximize enjoyment and maintain narrative momentum. While every group develops unique rhythms, certain patterns emerge across most tables.

**Sessions contain three key phases: Beginning (establishing situation), Middle (active play), and End (reaching closure). Each phase serves specific purposes in creating satisfying gameplay experiences.**

### Beginning a Session

The opening 10-15 minutes set the tone and reestablish the fictional situation. Even with the same group playing weekly, everyone needs time to transition from real life into the game world. The GM facilitates this transition while ensuring everyone understands the current situation.

**Effective Session Openings Include:**

- **Recap** — "Last session, you discovered the baron was actually a vampire..."
- **Immediate Situation** — "You're still in the burning warehouse with guards approaching..."
- **New Information** — "As dawn breaks, a messenger arrives with urgent news..."
- **Player Goals** — "What are you hoping to accomplish today?"
- **Environmental Details** — "The port city bustles with morning activity..."

**Player Responsibilities:**

- Review your character sheet and notes
- Recall your character's immediate goals
- Ask clarifying questions about the situation
- Establish your character's current state (wounded? anxious? determined?)

### During Play

The session's main body consists of alternating periods of exploration, interaction, and tension. The GM presents situations while players pursue goals, investigate mysteries, and respond to challenges. Pacing varies naturally—intense combat sequences followed by thoughtful planning, tense negotiations preceding explosive action.

**Maintaining Engagement:**

- **Follow Your Interests** — Pursue what intrigues your character
- **Share Spotlight Time** — Support others' moments while claiming your own
- **Build on Contributions** — Reference other characters' actions and ideas
- **Embrace Consequences** — Let failures create new opportunities
- **Ask Questions** — Clarify situations before making crucial decisions

**Common Session Activities:**

- Investigating mysterious locations
- Negotiating with powerful figures
- Battling dangerous foes
- Solving environmental puzzles
- Advancing personal character arcs
- Discovering world lore

### Scene Transitions

The GM controls pacing through scene transitions, moving the narrative forward while preserving player agency. Like a film editor, they cut between locations and compress time to maintain momentum. Good transitions feel natural while efficiently handling necessary time passage.

**Types of Transitions:**

- **Hard Cuts** — "Three hours later, you reach the castle gates..." (skips travel time)
- **Soft Fades** — "As you finish dinner, what's your plan for tomorrow?" (player-directed)
- **Cliffhangers** — "The door swings open revealing... we'll find out next session!" (builds anticipation)
- **Montages** — "Over the next week of preparation..." (compresses downtime)
- **Scene Questions** — "Where do we find you the next morning?" (collaborative transition)

### Ending a Session

Sessions ideally conclude at natural stopping points—completing a mission, reaching safety, or facing a dramatic revelation. The final 10-15 minutes allow for experience awards, treasure distribution, and planning future sessions. Good endings provide closure while building anticipation.

**Effective Session Endings:**

- Reach a natural pause in the narrative
- Award experience points
- Discuss highlights and memorable moments
- Plan the next session's focus
- Handle administrative tasks (leveling up, equipment)

## Making Decisions

Your choices drive Heart Rush's narrative engine. Every decision—from grand strategic moves to subtle conversational tactics—shapes the unfolding story. The game provides clear frameworks for resolving these choices, ensuring that both careful planning and bold improvisation find their place at the table.

**Decision-making in Heart Rush follows clear principles: state your intent clearly, use the appropriate resolution mechanic, and embrace both success and failure as story fuel.**

### When You Act

Clear communication prevents misunderstandings and keeps play flowing smoothly. When declaring actions, provide enough detail for the GM to understand your approach and determine appropriate consequences. Vague declarations lead to confusion; specific intentions create engaging results.

**Effective Action Declaration Includes:**

- **Clear Goal** — What you're trying to accomplish
- **Specific Method** — How you're attempting it
- **Resources Used** — What abilities, equipment, or advantages you're employing
- **Risk Acceptance** — Understanding potential consequences

**Examples of Clear Declaration:**

✓ **Good**: "I want to scale the castle wall using my climbing gear. I'll take my time to find the best handholds and avoid the guards' sightlines."

✗ **Vague**: "I sneak into the castle."

✓ **Good**: "I'll intimidate the bandit leader by drawing my sword slowly while reminding him what happened to the last gang that crossed me."

✗ **Vague**: "I threaten him."

### When Dice Appear

The GM calls for specific dice rolls based on your approach and the situation. Not every action requires dice—only those with meaningful uncertainty and consequences. This keeps play flowing while ensuring important moments receive mechanical weight.

**The Four Types of Dice Rolls:**

1. **Skill Checks** — Attempting uncertain actions

   - Heart die + ability die + modifiers vs Challenge Number
   - Used for: climbing, persuasion, investigation, crafting

2. **Saving Throws** — Avoiding imposed effects

   - Heart die + ability die + modifiers vs Challenge Number
   - Used for: dodging hazards, resisting poison, maintaining balance

3. **Combat Rolls** — Resolving violent conflicts

   - Attack/Defense rolls with specific combat mechanics
   - Used when: Violence erupts between multiple participants
   - Why combat: Provides granular tactical resolution for life-or-death struggles
   - Includes: Initiative, positioning, attack sequences, defensive reactions

4. **Stratagem Rolls** — Managing complex endeavors
   - d8 + ability die + profession + aspect vs Challenge Number
   - Used for: leading organizations, long-term projects

**Knowing When Combat Begins**

The shift to combat rules happens naturally when:

- **Weapons are drawn with intent** — Not just threats, but actual violence
- **Multiple sides engage** — More than a simple shove or punch
- **Tactical positioning matters** — Cover, flanking, and distance become crucial
- **Order of actions is contested** — Everyone wants to act first

A barroom brawl might stay as skill checks if it's just shoving and posturing. But when bottles break into weapons and combatants circle for advantage, combat rules engage to handle the complexity.

### Types of Challenges

Heart Rush presents diverse challenges requiring different approaches. Understanding these categories helps you choose appropriate strategies and anticipate the type of resolution required.

**Environmental Challenges**

- **Physical Obstacles** — Chasms, walls, locked doors
- **Natural Hazards** — Storms, avalanches, quicksand
- **Magical Barriers** — Wards, illusions, curses
- **Resolution** — Usually skill checks, sometimes saving throws

**Social Challenges**

- **Negotiations** — Trade deals, alliance building, hostage situations
- **Deceptions** — Infiltration, false identities, misdirection
- **Persuasion** — Changing minds, rallying crowds, seeking aid
- **Resolution** — Skill checks modified by approach and relationship

**Combat Challenges**

- **Direct Confrontation** — Bandits, monsters, rival adventurers
- **Ambushes** — Surprise attacks requiring quick response
- **Duels** — Formal single combat with specific rules
- **Mass Battles** — Large-scale conflicts (often use stratagems)
- **Resolution** — Combat system when violence erupts; stratagems for armies

**Strategic Challenges**

- **Resource Management** — Supplies for long journeys
- **Time Pressure** — Racing against deadlines
- **Complex Problems** — Multi-part obstacles requiring planning
- **Resolution** — Combination of skill checks and player planning

## Character Growth

Heroes in Heart Rush evolve through both mechanical advancement and narrative development. Your character begins competent but grows into a legendary figure through accumulated experience, newfound abilities, and stories that spread across the land. This dual-track progression ensures characters feel both mechanically stronger and narratively richer over time.

**Growth happens through Experience Points (XP) that purchase mechanical improvements and through play experiences that develop your character's story, relationships, and reputation.**

### Experience Through Play

The GM awards Experience Points based on your group's preferred style. Most groups use hybrid approaches, combining multiple reward structures to encourage diverse play styles. Typical XP awards range from 3-5 points per session, allowing character upgrades every few games.

## The Cooperative Experience

Heart Rush thrives on collaboration between all participants. Unlike competitive games where players work against each other, everyone at the Heart Rush table shares the goal of creating compelling stories together. This cooperation extends beyond mere politeness—it's active collaboration where each person's contributions enhance everyone else's enjoyment.

**Core Truth: You're not playing to win; you're playing to create memorable stories together. Success comes from everyone having engaging experiences, not from individual victory.**

## Getting Started

Your first Heart Rush session might feel overwhelming—new rules, unfamiliar mechanics, and infinite possibilities can create decision paralysis. This is completely normal. Every experienced player remembers their initial uncertainty. Focus on core activities while letting the full system reveal itself through play.

**New Player Priority List:**

1. **Describe Actions Clearly** — Say what your character attempts
2. **Ask Questions Freely** — No question is too basic
3. **Roll When Requested** — The GM guides mechanical needs
4. **Engage the Fiction** — React to the story, not just mechanics
5. **Learn Through Play** — Rules become intuitive with practice

### Your First Session Checklist

**Before the Game:**

- Read your character sheet thoroughly
- Prepare 2-3 character goals
- Think about your character's personality
- Bring dice, pencil, and notes
- Arrive with an open mind

**During the Game:**

- Introduce your character memorably
- Listen actively to others
- Take notes on important names/places
- Try different action types
- Don't worry about optimal choices

**After the Game:**

- Discuss memorable moments
- Ask rules questions
- Plan character development
- Thank your GM
- Schedule the next session

### Common New Player Concerns

**"What if I make mistakes?"**
Everyone makes rules errors, even experienced players. The GM will guide you, and minor mistakes rarely matter. Focus on intent over perfection.

**"How do I know what to do?"**
When stuck, ask yourself: "What would my character want here?" Then pursue that goal. The GM will tell you how to resolve it mechanically.

**"What if my idea is stupid?"**
Bold ideas create memorable stories. The "stupid" plan that barely succeeds becomes legendary. Embrace creative solutions over optimal strategies.

**"I don't understand all these rules..."**
You don't need to. Learn your character's core abilities first. Other rules will make sense when they become relevant through play.

**Remember: Heart Rush is about collaborative adventure. You cannot "play wrong" if you're engaged, contributing to the story, and helping everyone have fun. Trust the process, embrace the journey, and let your hero's story unfold.**
