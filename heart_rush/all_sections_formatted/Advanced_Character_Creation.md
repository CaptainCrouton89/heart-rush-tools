# Advanced Character Creation

For added depth to character creation and progression, there are several other steps to character creation. Everyone in the group should decide together if they would like to use these optional rules.

## Skills

Skills represent your training and experience in specific areas. When creating your character, choose up to three skills and distribute 4 ranks between them, representing your background. These initial ranks are free and reflect your life before adventuring.

Skills can be broad professions (Diplomat, Blacksmith) or specific competencies (Lockpicking, Horseback Riding). Work with your GM to ensure appropriate scope.

### Skill Progression

After character creation, skills improve through practice and real-world application:

| Rank | Downtime Weeks | Challenges | Missions |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1    | 1              | -          | -        |
| 2    | 4              | 1          | -        |
| 3    | 9              | 2          | 1        |
| 4    | 16             | 3          | 2        |
| 5    | 25             | 4          | 3        |
| 6    | 36             | 5          | 4        |
| 7    | 49             | 6          | 5        |

### Challenges (Clarified)

A challenge must meet ALL criteria:

- Uses the skill in question
- CN â‰¥ (heart die max + current skill rank)
- Meaningful narrative consequences for failure
- Cannot be immediately retried if failed

Mark one challenge complete upon success.

### Missions (Clarified)

A mission must meet ALL criteria:

- Requires 3+ successful skill checks using the skill
- At least one check must be CN 15 or higher
- All checks must occur within a related narrative sequence
- The overall goal has significant stakes (reputation, wealth, lives, etc.)
- Failure of any check risks mission failure

**Mission Examples with Mechanical Clarity:**

- **Diplomat (Rank 3):** Negotiate a treaty between warring factions (3+ persuasion checks, including at least one CN 15+ with the hostile leader)
- **Thief (Rank 4):** Steal from the Duke's vault (bypass guards with stealth, pick the lock CN 15+, escape without raising alarm)
- **Ship Captain (Rank 5):** Navigate through a supernatural storm (3+ sailing checks including CN 18 to find safe passage)

### Using Skills

Add your skill rank to any check where the skill clearly applies. For tangentially related applications, add half your rank (rounded down).

Only one skill may apply to any given check.

### Syncopath

By weakening the connection between your mind and body, you can open yourself to the psionic winds that drift across the world. The psionic winds carry on them the thoughts and emotions of all sentient creatures, and can be listened to. However, weakening the link between mind and body comes with risks--as your mind flows freely with the ideas and feelings of others, your thoughts can be heavily influenced by those around you, and your sense of self becomes vulnerable. There is no "on or off" switch--as the boundary between mind and self weakens, there is no going back.

#### Tier 1

- The range of your mental powers is 15 feet, extending through walls and across physical boundaries.
- You gain the ability to roughly sense the emotional state of the sentient creatures within range. The GM will tell you the emotions being felt of creatures within range, but not which emotions belongs to which creatures.
- Whenever someone thinks about you while within range, you immediately know what they are thinking about you, as well as what their overall opinion of you is.
- If half or more of the conscious creatures in range dislike, distrust, or are in some other way associate negative emotions with you, you gain the aspect "Self loathing" at rank 1. It can apply a penalty to any type of skill check you take.

#### Tier 2

- The range of your mental powers increases to 45 feet.
- Whenever an ability allows you to sense the thoughts or emotional state of creatures around you, you can determine the direction from which those thoughts and emotions came from. When continually monitoring thoughts and emotions, you can only monitor one source at a time.
- You may choose something you can see, a sound you hear, or some other experience you've had in the last 5 seconds. You can hear the thoughts and emotions of all creatures in range that are about the subject you chose.
- When you are disliked, your rank in the "Self loathing" aspect is 2.
- If half or more of the conscious creatures in range have untreated wounds or are in severe pain, you gain a level of mental vulnerability.

#### Tier 3

- The range of your mental powers increases to 90 feet.
- Whenever an ability allows you to sense the thoughts or emotional state of creatures around you, you can pinpoint the exact source of those thoughts and emotions.
- Choose a topic. You can can hear the thoughts and feel the emotions of all creatures in range that are about that topic.
- When you are disliked, your rank in the "Self loathing" aspect is 3.
- If half or more of the conscious creatures in range have a mental condition such as confused, charmed, enraged, or frightened, you also gain that mental condition, at the highest rank experienced by those effected.

#### Tier 4

- By focusing on a single person, you can hear all of their thoughts and emotions as they occur.

## WIP Paths

These paths are currently in development and may change significantly before final release. They represent experimental character progression options.

### Physiarch

#### Tier 1

- You require twice as many rations each day.
- Whenever you make a skill check you may use your cunning die in the place of your might or agility die. If you roll higher than the maximum of the die you replaced, instead use the maximum of the replaced die.
- Increasing your might die, agility die, or maximum hit points costs two less XP.
- Whenever you take a long rest, you may choose to alter one superficial feature of your face or body to a different, healthy, and realistic state. For example, making your nose larger, your arms hairier, or your eyes a different color. Doing this ten times will make you unrecognizable compared to your original state. You cannot accurately replicate the appearance of anyone in particular using this ability.

#### Tier 2

- You require three times as many rations each day.
- Your ability to use your cunning die instead of your might or agility die extends to A/D rolls.
- When you decrease a treated wound's rank from a long rest, decrease its rank by two instead of one.

The GM has final say on which abilities are gained and lost.

Spend a minimum of 1 to communicate with your god in your dreams. 2 for images while youre conscious. 3 for a conversation with a vague entity. 5 for a proper conversation with a shard of your god. 10 to have its attention. 20 to have its full attention.

When you become a disciple of your god, you may need to create your own god within the world if your GM has not restricted which gods exist.

To begin, choose the tenets and beliefs of your god. List three aspects of your god but do not give them ranks.

Your relationship with your god is represented by divine favor. As you gain more of it, you have more sway with your god. As spend it, you lose it.

#### Tier 1

Each day you must spend 15 minutes dedicated to your god. Whatever this activity this is, be it prayer, meditation, making music, or anything else, it is necessary to curry favor with your god. It cannot be a task that directly benefits you--it must primarily be for and about your god. Each day you do this, you gain two points of divine favor. Each day you don't do this, you lose two points of divine favor. You can have a maximum of ten divine favor.

When you spend time dedicated to your god, if you spend that time at a church, sacred shrine, or other, religiously significant location, gain twice as many points of divine favor for that day.

Choose three handmagic talents. These are minor blessings that your god can grant you as their follower. You may spend one point of divine favor to have access to any one of these talents until the next dawn. Talents chosen must be approved by the GM to ensure they fit the thematic character of the god. Each additional talent you choose to access costs one additional point of divine favor.

You may spend points of divine favor on a skill check in which one of your god's aspects applies as though the aspect was your own. You may spend up to two points of divine favor each time you do this.

At any time, you may spend any number of points of divine favor to ask for a miracle. It is entirely up to the GM to decide what occurs.
