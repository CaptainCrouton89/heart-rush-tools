You may communicate with it through your song, though the animal cannot communicate back. The animal remains in your aid for the rest of the day.

Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense for where there may be more to discover, and what you might find. Once per month, while exploring a location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that there is more to be discovered.

The GM may ask you to choose a different direction, or a different discovery.

## Keen Eye

Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.

If you spend one week gathering knowledge about your target, you may make an “educated guess” about the security around your target. The GM will confirm or deny your educated guess with a simple “yes” or “no”.

**Destiny Level**  
Before you perform your act of espionage, you may choose to lay out a detailed plan. You must describe your plan to the GM.

The illusion cannot be seen through, and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion until they have interacted with it in some way, at which point the illusion fades from their sight. Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of another object, though they appear as three-dimensional objects, so they cannot be illusions of darkness, empty space, or your immediate surroundings.  
If a creature has reason to suspect it is an illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or disappears, they may make a cunning check contested by your cunning challenge number. On a success, they see through the illusion.

You may create and control up to three undead servants with this talent.

## Observant

## Poisoner

Passive ability. Cognitive talent.  
So long as you can disguise it as another action, you automatically succeed on any check to slip poison into someone's food or drink, even while in plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they will not notice there is poison in their food, only that they will not realize that you are poisoning the food as you do it.  
For every 10 times you digest a single type of poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it, and take 10 damage less from every instance of damage it deals.

**Destiny Level**  
You know your poisons. You immediately know if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as well as all of its properties.

Passive ability. Handmagic.  
If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were an extension of your arm, including floating straight up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a weapon. The control persists only while you hold the rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

## Runescribe

Passive ability. Cognitive talent.  
If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or a similar aspect, you may now begin making handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you can memorize that sign and tattoo hands with that sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and titan bone, which equates to about half the price of getting a new handmagic sign.

**Destiny Level**  
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or a similar aspect, you may make the additional modifications to a handmagic sign to make its destiny level upgrade. You must spend a week studying and practicing before memorizing and inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.

## Silver Tongue

Major ability. Handmagic.  
As an action, you may charm a person you are talking to. They gain 2 ranks of charmed towards you for the next hour, after which they know they were magically charmed by you. They lose all ranks of charmed if you take a hostile action towards them.

**Destiny Level**  
The effect lasts twelve hours rather than one. The person does not realize they were charmed when the effect ends.

## Siren's Song

Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.  
After playing your instrument for a minute or more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are enthralled with your performance, and struggle to pull their gaze away. So long as you play and they are not in obvious danger, they will approach you up to 10 feet, and will not pull their gaze from you. They have D3 on checks to notice their surroundings.

**Destiny Level**  
The range of your song increases to 120 feet. In addition, you may choose to exclude individuals from the collection of creatures you enthrall.

## Smooth Talker

Passive ability. Cognitive talent.  
Whenever you speak, your words come out like smooth butter. You have A2 on presence skill checks to persuade, intimidate, and deceive.

**Destiny Level**  
When you gain this destiny level, choose persuasion, intimidation, or deception. Whenever you make a skill check in that category, before you roll, you may choose to instead use the maximum result of your presence die rather than rolling.

## Song of Rage

This effect lasts for the rest of the day.

**Destiny Level**  
That creature gains three levels of enraged towards that creature until the end of the day.

## Song of Desire

If they were neutral, they become close. This effect lasts for the rest of the day.

## The Spider

Passive ability. Cognitive talent.  
You have a network of spies and informants at your fingertips. Once per day while within a city within the range of your influence, you may meet with your informants to learn what is going on around town. You may ask two unique questions of the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or more, your spies return with answers. The GM answers one of your questions truthfully, and either gives false information about the other, or else doesn't answer it at all. Any information that fewer than 25 people know about cannot be answered by your spy network.

**Destiny Level**  
You may ask up to three questions, and may ask questions with answers that are known by no fewer than five people. The GM must truthfully answer two of the three questions.

## Smell Something Fishy

Heart ability. Cognitive talent.  
When investigating the location of a mystery or crime, you may ask the GM if there are any undiscovered clues related to a question of your choice about whatever event occurred in your location. The GM must answer truthfully.

**Destiny Level**  
When investigating a mystery or crime, or when interrogating a suspect, you may posit a hypothesis about what happened to the GM. Then, the GM rolls a d4 in secret. On a 2, 3, or 4, the GM must nod their head if you are right, and shake their head if you are wrong. On a 1, the GM must do the opposite.

## Stargazer

Weekly ability. Full action. Handmagic.  
As an action, if you can see the stars, you may use this ability. You may ask one yes or no question about the past or present.  
The GM will do their best to answer your question.

**Destiny level**  
You may instead use this ability to ask an open-ended question with a one-word answer. Roll 1d10. On a 8, 9, or 10, the GM must answer truthfully with one word.

## Two-faced

Passive ability. Handmagic.  
You have two faces, your natural face and a second face with features you decide, which you can switch between by passing a hand over your face. The second face is always the same face. It requires an action to perform this ability.

**Destiny Level**  
Your face can change to any face you've seen before when you use this ability.

## Voice Actor

Passive ability. Cognitive talent.  
You gain the following abilities:

- You can imitate voices nearly perfectly.
- You can produce any sound you have heard before, so long as it is within your normal vocal volume.
- A CN 12 cunning check will reveal imperfections in your imitation.

**Destiny Level**  
You gain the following additional abilities:

- You can speak and produce sound without moving your mouth or lips.
- You can throw your voice up to 15 feet.
- The CN for identifying your mimicry increases to a 14.

## Waltz of the Weissenkauer

Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.  
You play a macabre and sinister tune. After playing your instrument for a minute or more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot gain one level of frightened towards you for the rest of the day.

**Destiny level**  
You may choose for them to gain three levels of frightened instead, and you may choose to exempt creatures from the effects.

## Worldly Traveler

Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.  
You have traveled the world and met many, many people. When you meet someone whom the GM describes as someone you've never met, you may choose to claim some connection to them. If you do, the GM will explain how you recognize them, and the nature of your connection. This connection may be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is possible there is no feasible connection between you and this person. In this case, you may either regain the use of this ability, or take three destiny points. You cannot use this ability to claim connections with people more influential than yourself.

**Destiny Level**  
Rather than claim a connection to someone you meet, you may use this ability before actually running into someone. For example, while at a bar in a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM also believes this to be plausible, your connection becomes real (though their location and condition may have changed since the last time you talked with them). If the GM doesn't believe this to be reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.
