## Damage & Consequences

There are several sources of damage besides combat.

Characters face many dangers in their adventures. Understanding how damage works and its various sources helps you navigate these threats.

### Combat

Combat is one of the most common ways to lose health.

Check out the Combat section to learn more.

### Hazards & Traps

There will be times when you have to avoid damage from the environment.

For example, being hit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or getting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship.

In these cases, you should make a saving throw, detailed in the Saving Throws section.

On a failure, you will take damage.

### Falling

When falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility saving throw against the height fallen.

If you roll less than the distance fallen, you take the difference as damage, and fall prone.

### Suffocation and Strangulation

There are different effects on one's body depending if you are holding your breath, or getting strangled or suffocated by something else.

When holding your breath, make a might check.

You can hold your breath a number of rounds equal to your result.

Subtract one from the total number of rounds whenever you take an action or move while holding your breath.

After you run out of breath, you take the suffocating condition.

If you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were suddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin suffocating immediately.

### Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across various poisons.

Different poisons have different properties and means of application.

Some may paralyze you, but only if ingested, while others may kill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream, but are otherwise harmless if swallowed.

Some are long lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to weapons and maintain potency for minutes to days, while others can't be applied to weapons at all.

While most poisons will have specific rulings applied to them individually, some general poisoning rules apply to most of them.

Due to the difficulty of properly applying poison, poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.

Each application of the poison uses up one dose of that poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with poison applied to it uses up the poison.

Most poisons can be applied to weapons prior to combat.

The length that the poison remains potent on the weapon will vary from poison to poison, after which the poison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in order to still garner the same effects.

Damage from poison happens after the weapon attackâ€”it is not rolled with the attack dice.
