# Combat Legacy

When you perform legendary feats in battle—moments that make allies gasp and enemies hesitate—you earn bloodmarks. These supernatural battle-scars represent your growing reputation as a warrior, manifesting as abilities that reflect your unique fighting style. Each bloodmark transforms you further from mere combatant into seasoned hero, with no limit to how legendary you might become.

## Earning Your Legacy

The GM awards bloodmarks for combat achievements that go beyond simple victory. Think cinematic moments: defeating a superior foe against impossible odds, protecting allies through heroic sacrifice, or turning the tide of battle through sheer audacity. These aren't participation trophies—they're recognition of the moments when you transcend normal combat into something memorable.

[[GM Note: When to Award Bloodmarks

Award bloodmarks to players after you feel they have achieved a major, story milestone in combat. Their first bloodmark may be just for defending a caravan from goblin thieves—what matters is that the moment felt significant to the story and the player rose to meet it.

As players progress, raise the bar. Their second bloodmark might come from holding a bridge against overwhelming odds while townsfolk escape. By their third, they should be performing feats that define campaign arcs—slaying the dragon that's terrorized the region, or defeating their rival in single combat before the entire royal court.

Look for moments where:

- The player's actions fundamentally changed the story's direction
- They achieved victory despite genuine risk of character death
- Their combat choices created a scene everyone at the table will remember
- They used the combat system in clever ways that surprised even you

Space bloodmarks to maintain their significance—roughly one every 4-6 sessions feels right for most campaigns. If a player does something truly spectacular, don't hold back just because they earned one recently. Conversely, don't feel pressured to award them on schedule if no worthy moments have occurred.

Remember: bloodmarks represent the evolution from "person who fights" to "warrior of growing legend." Each one should feel earned through memorable action, not simply accumulated through time.]]

## Bloodmark Progression

Your combat legacy grows with each bloodmark you earn:

| Bloodmark Level    | Abilities Gained                       | What This Means                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1st Bloodmark**  | 1 Specialization                       | Your fighting style begins to evolve beyond survival instincts           |
| **2nd Bloodmark**  | 1 Specialization + 1 Signature Ability | Combat becomes second nature; specialized techniques emerge              |
| **3rd Bloodmark**  | 2 Signature Abilities                  | You master advanced maneuvers that chain into devastating combinations   |
| **4th Bloodmark**  | 1 Combat Mastery                       | You reach minor hero status with a signature combat technique            |
| **5th+ Bloodmark** | 1 Paragon Ability (each)               | Each new bloodmark grants another legendary technique as your myth grows |

**Specializations** grant permanent enhancements to your fighting style—brutal strikes that explode into devastating damage chains, defensive awareness that lets you protect nearby allies, or combat versatility that reduces training costs. These passive abilities fundamentally change how you approach every fight. Choose from the Specializations list below.

**Signature Abilities** are powerful techniques you activate by spending rush points—tactical commands that enhance your whole team, defensive stances that turn attacks into counterstrikes, or mobility tricks that let you control battlefield positioning. Each costs escalating rush points per fight (1 for first use, 2 for second, etc.). Select from the Signature Abilities list below.

**Combat Masteries** represent once-per-day ultimate techniques—abilities so powerful they can single-handedly turn the tide of battle. Whether you're shrugging off lethal damage, inspiring allies beyond their limits, or unleashing devastating combination attacks, these define your heroic moments. Choose from the Combat Masteries list below.

**Paragon Abilities** transcend normal combat entirely—class-specific techniques that mark you as a legendary warrior. From assassinating enemies in a single strike to commanding the battlefield with tactical supremacy, these abilities separate mythic heroes from everyday adventurers. Select from the Paragon Abilities list below when you achieve your fifth bloodmark.

Each ability you select shapes your combat identity. Will you become an untouchable duelist, a battlefield controller who dominates positioning, or a berserker whose fury grows with each wound? Your bloodmarks tell that story.

## Specializations

Passive abilities are always active.

#### In the Thick of It

_Passive ability._

You excel when in the center of battle. For each enemy adjacent to you, you get +1 to your attack and defense rolls.

#### Brutal Attacks

_Passive ability._

Your attacks are vicious and true. Whenever you roll the maximum result on one of the dice in an attack roll, or damage from a spell you cast, you may add another die of the same size and roll it, adding it to the result. This can trigger multiple times.

#### Above the Fray

_Passive ability._

Even while in the thick of combat, you are keenly aware of your surroundings and able to act with a cool head.Once per round, you may make an object interaction, sidestep, help, or trip action for free.

#### Warcaster

_Passive ability._

You are naturally talented at handling the elements.

- Gaining elemental talents costs only X+3 XP where X is the number of elemental talents you have.
- You gain a basic elemental attunement

#### Guardian's Sacrifice

_Passive ability._

You have the ability to step in when those nearby are in a vulnerable position. If a creature adjacent to you is about to be harmed or attacked, and the attack, defense, or damage rolls haven't been been made yet, you can choose to intervene and place yourself between them and the source of harm.

- If it's an attack, you make the defense roll and absorb the damage in their place.
- If it's unavoidable damage, you can take that on yourself too.
- You also have the option to switch positions with the creature you're protecting.

You can only save one creature during a round, but you can shield them from multiple sources of damage if needed.

#### Grappler

_Passive ability._

You are a master of restraining and controlling opponents in close combat.

- You do not have to directly beat a creature's stance to attempt to grapple them.
- You can grapple as though you are one size larger than you are.
- You have advantage on rolls to grapple other creatures.
- While grappling a creature, your movement speed is 5 rather than 0.

#### Sentinel

_Passive ability._

You are a vigilant guardian, ready to strike at any enemy who dares move past you. You are always ready.

- Sidestepping does not let enemies avoid your opportunity attacks.
- Opportunity attacks do not require an action or rush points.

#### Called Shot

_Passive ability._

You exchange some defensive ability for overwhelming offensive prowess. You have disadvantage on defense rolls, but you may make called shots.
By aiming for a very specific location on your target, you maximize your potential damage, at the risk of dealing less damage if you miss. If you have advantage on an attack roll, you may declare the attack to be a called shot.
If you do, announce a target number for you attack roll. Keep this number in mind for later.
Then, it’s time to determine the multiplier. Your multiplier starts at one, though you may remove levels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it. To increase the multiplier by one, you must sacrifice a number of levels of advantage equal to the current level of the multiplier. So to increase the multiplier to two, you would have to spend one level of advantage. To then increase it to three, you would spend two levels of advantage, and so on.
Finally, make your attack roll. If any of the dice you rolled are equal to or higher than your target number, multiply your target number by the multiplier and add that to your attack roll.

#### Everywhere at Once

_Passive ability._

You are capable of combatting multiple enemies at once.

- In an engagement, you make a melee attack against any number of valid targets in the engagement rather than only one.
- If you do not make any melee attacks, you may instead make a ranged attack against any number of valid targets in the engagement who are adjacent to each other.
- Additionally, object interactions to stow or draw shields or weapons are always free, and instant.

#### Versatile Training

_Passive ability._

You have more versatility in combat.

- Gain 1 XP for each combat talent and 2 XP for each combat destiny level you have taken so far.
- Future combat talents cost 1 fewer XP, and their destiny levels cost 2 fewer XP.

#### Improved Interference

_Passive ability._

You excel at disrupting enemies through clever positioning and dirty tactics.

- Choosing the same stance as another creature does not prevent you from using a non-attacking offensive action against them.
- Additionally, whenever you choose to hinder a creature, choose from the following list instead:
  - The creature takes 1d6 damage and 3 levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
  - The creature takes 1d6 damage and 2 levels of blinded.
  - The creature is knocked prone so long as it is not more than two sizes larger than you.
  - Push the creature 10 feet. It travels 5 less feet for every size larger than you that it is, and 5 more feet for every size smaller.
  - If the creature can see or hear you, it gains one level of enraged towards you.
  - If the creature is no more than one size bigger or smaller than you, switch places with it.

## Signature Abilities

Minor abilities are like any other ability, but they require rushpoints to use. The first time you use a minor ability, it costs one rush point. The second time, two, and so on. All usage of your minor abilities resets after a fight ends.

#### Cry of Defiance

_Minor ability. Instant._

You shout out, have a moment of inner peace, or by some other means recenter yourself in the moment. Choose one:

- Gain hit points equal to your maximum heart die.

#### Violent Defense

_Minor ability. Instant._

You hunker down, presenting a bristling wall of defense. Until the end of the round, you may add your weapon die to your defense rolls.

If you would make a defense roll and get a result greater than their attack roll, the attacker takes damage equal to the difference as you parry their blow and counterattack.

#### Hulking Blows

_Minor ability. Instant._

Your blows are slow, but absolutely devastating. After revealing stances, if you are wielding a heavy melee weapon, you may declare your attack to be a hulking blow.

- If you do, choose a creature in the engagement that you are able to attack. That creature may choose to forfeit all attack rolls during this engagement and instead automatically dodge your attack.
- If they don't, you may double the result of all dice from your attack roll.

#### Fists, Knees, and Elbows

_Minor ability._

Until the end of the round, when you make an unarmed attack roll against a creature you are grappling, add your might die to the roll.

Grappling the creature does not impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against the creature this round.

#### I don't Think So

_Minor ability._

Make a grappling ability check against a creature you are already grappling. On a success, choose one:

- If you are standing, move the grappled creature 5 feet to a different space adjacent to you.
- The grappled creature cannot make sounds this round.
- You and the grappled creature fall prone.
- The creature takes a level of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.

_Minor ability. Instant._

You shrug off attacks that would fell lesser warriors, your resolve unshakeable.

- You take half as much damage from the next source of incoming damage, rounded down.
- If the source would cause you to move, you move 10 feet less.
- If the source would cause you to gain leveled conditions, you gain those condition at one level less.

#### Crippling Blows

_Minor ability. Instant._

Your blows are powerful enough to knock people off their feet.

When you deal damage to a creature with a heavy, melee weapon, choose one:

- Beat Down: The creature cannot take the sidestep action until the beginning of the next round. If the creature is no more than one size larger than you, it is knocked prone. Otherwise, it takes two levels of weakened.
- Smash: The creature is knocked 10 feet away from you.

#### Making it count

_Minor ability. Instant._

You may apply the effects of your stance twice during the current engagement.

#### Power Strike

_Minor ability. Instant._

Before you announce your stance in an engagement, you may declare the attack to be a power strike. If you do, all dice used in the attack roll trigger your Brutal Attacks ability if they land on a result greater than half the size of the die. For example, you would reroll and add another 1d10 to the result if you rolled a 6-10 on a d10 in your attack roll.

#### Execute

_Minor ability. Instant._

Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you may choose for it to be an execution instead. If this damage would reduce the creature to zero or fewer hit points, the creature immediately dies.

#### Lightning Reflexes

_Minor ability. Instant._

Your reflexes are faster than anyone else's on the battlefield. Treat your agility die as a d20 when determining who can go first when multiple people want to take actions. Nobody can interrupt you if you want to use multiple abilities in a row.

You can launch from one foe to the next with grace.

- When you attack a creature that has not been attacked yet this round, you get +3 on the attack roll.
- When you deal enough damage to cause a creature to go unconscious or die this round, you gain an additional action you may take during the next action phase.

#### Tactics

You can spot out the weak points in your enemies' defenses and direct your allies towards them.

#### Elusive

_Minor ability. Instant._

You react to danger with fluid grace, slipping away from harm at the last moment.

- Immediately after taking damage during an engagement, you may take the sidestep action as a free, instant ability.

## Paragon Abilities

After your 4th bloodmark, all future bloodmarks grant paragon abilities. Paragon abilities represent the pinnacle of combat prowess.

Paragon levels have tags on them indicating if there are any limitations on which classes can take the paragon level. If your class isn't listed, you can't take the paragon level. Additionally, some paragon levels also have a tag indicating a minimum paragon level you must be at in order to gain the ability. This will take the form “PL: X,” where X is the paragon level you must be at or above.

[[GM Note
Paragon abilities are on a whole different level compared to other abilities. They make a strong character busted. They should only be given out once you are comfortable with your players reaching a heroic tier of play, and should be given out sparingly thereafter.]]
