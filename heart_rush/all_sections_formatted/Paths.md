# Paths

**IMPORTANT: This section is WIP.**

Paths represent fundamental transformations that forever change how your character interacts with the world. Unlike classes which define your combat role, paths alter your very nature—granting profound abilities at equally profound costs.

## Path Mechanics

### Acquiring a Path

Paths are not chosen lightly. They require both narrative justification and mechanical investment:

- **Cost**: 20% of your total accumulated XP (minimum 10 XP, requiring at least 50 total XP)
- **Requirement**: A significant in-game event that triggers the transformation
- **Limit**: You may only ever have one path

### Path Tiers

Each path has four tiers of transformation. Once you begin a path, you automatically progress to Tier 1. Further progression requires:

- **Tier 2**: 12 XP
- **Tier 3**: 16 XP
- **Tier 4**: 20 XP

You cannot skip tiers—each builds upon the previous transformation.

## Available Paths

### Vampire

The vampire path represents a dark transformation into an undead predator. You gain immortal power at the cost of humanity and terrible vulnerabilities.

#### How to Become a Vampire

You must be bitten by another vampire and fail a might saving throw (CN = 10 + vampire's tier × 3), or willingly accept vampiric blood during a dark ritual. Some rare curses or artifacts might also trigger the transformation.

#### Tier 1: Fledgling

- When you successfully grapple and bite a humanoid in the neck (requiring a successful attack roll against a grappled target), heal HP equal to your heart die maximum

**Drawbacks:**

- Gain the aspect "Cannot resist the taste of blood" at rank 1. This aspect cannot be decreased or removed
- Cannot heal from long rests unless you've fed within the last 24 hours

#### Tier 2: Nightstalker

- Only need blood once per year
- Victims you bite must make a might saving throw (CN = your cunning challenge number) or begin transformation into a Tier 1 vampire over 3 days

**Drawbacks:**

- The thirst for blood never truly leaves—you always know where the nearest source of fresh blood is within 1000 feet

### Lycanthrope

The lycanthrope path bonds you with a primal beast spirit, granting its strength at the cost of control. When you first gain this path, choose your beast form: wolf, bear, tiger, boar, rat, or another animal approved by your GM.

#### How to Become a Lycanthrope

Either be bitten by a lycanthrope during a full moon and fail a might saving throw (CN 15), or be born into a bloodline carrying the curse. Some ancient rituals performed at sacred beast sites can also trigger the transformation.

#### Beast Upgrades

As you progress, you gain ranks in beast upgrades. No single upgrade can have more ranks than tier + 1.

- **Enhanced Senses**: Advantage on perception/investigation checks based on your animal (scent for wolf/bear, sight for tiger/owl, hearing for rat/bat)
- **Natural Speed**: Increase a movement speed by 20 feet or gain climb speed 20 feet

- Your dreams are always from your beast's perspective
- Must hunt and kill at least once per month or gain one level of enraged that doesn't fade

### Syncopath

By weakening the boundary between your mind and others, you gain psionic awareness at the cost of mental autonomy. The psionic winds carry thoughts and emotions across the world, and you've learned to open yourself to them—but in doing so, you risk losing yourself.

#### How to Become a Syncopath

Undergo intense meditation at a ley line convergence, consume certain forbidden substances, survive massive psychic trauma, or have your mind touched by aberrant entities. The awakening must be voluntary—you consciously choose to let down your mental barriers. There is no way to reverse this process once begun.

#### Tier 1: Awakened

**Benefits:**

- Mental powers range: 15 feet (penetrates walls and physical barriers)
- Roughly sense emotions of all sentient creatures in range (GM describes the emotional landscape)
- When someone thinks about you while in range, immediately know their thoughts about you and overall opinion

- Can sense hostile intent before it manifests (advantage on initiative if enemies are in range)

**Drawbacks:**

- "Self loathing" becomes rank 2 when triggered
- If half the creatures in range have untreated wounds or severe pain, gain one level of mental vulnerability
- Cannot benefit from long rests if more than 10 sentient creatures are within range
- Begin to unconsciously mimic the mannerisms of those around you

#### Tier 3: Psychic Lattice

**Benefits:**

- Can maintain awareness of multiple thought sources simultaneously
- Know the exact number and general emotional state of all creatures in range at all times

**Drawbacks:**

- "Self loathing" becomes rank 3 when triggered

- If ever alone (no sentient creatures in range), gain one level of confused per hour
- Automatically fail saving throws against mental conditions if the source is within range
- Sometimes speak the thoughts of others instead of your own

### Physiarch

Rather than letting your body regulate itself unconsciously, you've learned to consciously control every aspect of your physical form—from your heartbeat to your appearance. This grants incredible abilities but requires constant mental focus and enormous energy.

#### How to Become a Physiarch

Requires months of training with a master physiarch, discovering ancient body cultivation texts, or undergoing experimental procedures. You must succeed on a CN 15 cunning check during a long rest while in perfect health to achieve the initial breakthrough.

#### Tier 1: Initiated

**Benefits:**

- May use cunning die instead of might or agility die for skill checks (if you roll higher than the replaced die's maximum, use that maximum instead)
- Reduce XP costs by 2 for: increasing might die, agility die, or maximum HP
- During any long rest, alter one superficial feature (hair color, eye color, nose shape, skin tone, etc.)
- After 10 alterations, you become unrecognizable from your original appearance

**Drawbacks:**

- Require twice the normal food and water rations
- Gain aspect "Mind Over Matter" at rank 1—when dazed, lose all Physiarch benefits

- Control your apparent age (looking anywhere from young adult to elderly)

**Drawbacks:**

- "Mind Over Matter" increases to rank 3
- Gain aspect "Fragile Control" at rank 2—taking a wound forces cunning save (CN = damage taken) or be stunned for 1 round

#### Tier 4: Transcendent

**Benefits:**

### Beastheart

Through shared trials and mystical bonding, you and your animal companion have become something more than master and beast—you are two halves of a greater whole. This path deepens that connection until the boundary between your souls dissolves entirely.

#### How to Become a Beastheart

Requires the Beast Companion talent and at least one year of constant companionship. The bond typically forms during a moment of shared mortal peril where you and your companion choose to save each other rather than yourselves. Some druids know rituals that can forge this connection, and certain magical locations where the boundary between human and animal is thin can spontaneously create beasthearts.

#### Tier 1: Bonded

**Drawbacks:**

**Drawbacks:**

- "Shared Soul" increases to rank 5

- If companion dies, immediately drop to -10 HP and gain wound "Severed Soul" at rank 20

- Share a single HP pool (combined maximum of both)
- Cannot be more than 100 feet apart without both gaining stunned

- Cannot be resurrected separately—both must be brought back together

## Using Paths in Your Game

Paths are not mere character options—they're story-defining transformations that should emerge from play. When a character gains a path, it should feel like a pivotal moment that forever changes their narrative arc.

### For GMs

- Paths should arise from dramatic moments in the story
- Use path drawbacks to create roleplaying challenges and moral dilemmas
- NPCs with paths make memorable allies or terrifying enemies
- Consider how society reacts to transformed individuals
- Path abilities might attract unwanted attention from those who fear or covet such power

### For Players

- Choose paths that enhance your character concept, not just for mechanical benefit
- Embrace the drawbacks—they create the most interesting stories
- Consider how your transformation affects your relationships
- Remember that paths are permanent—choose wisely
- Work with your GM to determine how your path manifests in the story
