# Kethic Elementalism

Kethic elementalism, also known as Kethic and elemental magic, is one of the most prevalent systems of magic. Its basis is in one of attunement. By understanding a fundamental element completely, and having a primal bond with that thing, one can develop power to control that element. As that bond and understanding grows, one's power over that element grows.

There are nine fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With these elements, nearly everything is created.

By attuning to different elements, you have some basic power over those elements. There are three different levels of attunement for each element—each of which grant you increasing abilities.

However, attuning to an element is difficult. Most people never attune to any elements in their lifetimes, and your spirit must be able to handle the additional pressure of resonating with your attuned element. Those who do will frequently do so by accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to one of these such elements. More advanced attunements require even more exposure, and paragon level attunements generally require special activity dedicated to developing an attunement to that element.

Kethic also comes with limitations. Every living thing has some very low level attunement with all the elements, and for this reason, it is nearly impossible for another creature to interfere with elements especially close to another living being, such as its blood or flesh.

## Resonate Substances

One of the primary forms of elemental manipulation is through attunement to resonate substances. These are the collection of materials that you have control over. Different types of substances have different rules dictating your affinity to them at different levels, however. For example, a master of earth still won't be able to create as much stone as an equally skilled master of air can create breathable air—the solid stone is just fundamentally more difficult to work with.

The limitations to your control over different types of substances are listed in the following sections. There are three different categories of substances: solids, liquids, and gasses.

### Solids

#### Manipulation

- You can physically manipulate the shape and form of the substance with your hands as though it was clay. It is about as fast as literally shaping something out of clay.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 15 feet. You do not have to physically touch the material to shape it. Even though your hands are not touching the material, their movements control the manipulation as though the solid was in your hands.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 45 feet.

#### Sensing

- You can sense the direction and approximate shape and size of the substance within 15 feet, even if you can't see them. Your approximations are in 5-foot cube increments.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your sensing increases to 45 feet. For substances that you can hold in your hands, you can sense precise details as though you were looking through it.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The range of your sensing increases to 120 feet.

#### Creation & Destruction

- As an action, you can create or destroy up to a 1-foot cube of the substance in your hands. If digging a passageway in this way, you can burrow a humanoid-sized hole at a rate of 1 foot per minute. When creating this solid, it is created in shapeless, 1-foot cubes, and requires further action to shape them further.

#### Advanced Attunement

- You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of 2 feet per minute.

#### Paragon Attunement

- You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of 5 feet per minute.

### Liquids

#### Manipulation

- As an action, you can crudely manipulate the flow of the substance in a 15-foot range around you, such as creating eddies or a current in one direction or another. Currents you create can be up to 2 miles per hour. Additionally, you can hold up to a 1-foot cube of it in your hands without a container.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 45 feet. You can cause currents of up to 4 miles per hour.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 120 feet. You can cause currents of up to 6 miles per hour.

#### Movement

- While in this substance, your swim speed is increased by 10 feet.

#### Advanced Attunement

- While in this substance, your swim speed is increased by 20 feet. Additionally, you can walk on this substance.

#### Paragon Attunement

- While in this substance, your swim speed is increased by 40 feet.

#### Sensing

- You can sense the direction of the substance within 120 feet, even if you can't see it. Your approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.

#### Creation & Destruction

- You can create or destroy up to a 1-foot cube of the substance in your hands as an action.

#### Advanced Attunement

- You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in your hands as an action.

#### Paragon Attunement

- You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in your hands as an action.

### Gasses

#### Manipulation

- As an action, you can crudely manipulate the flow of the substance in a 15-foot range around you, such as creating eddies or a current in one direction or another. Currents you create can be up to 10 miles per hour.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 45 feet. You can cause air speeds up to 20 miles per hour.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 120 feet. You can cause air speeds up to 40 miles per hour.

#### Movement

- While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 50 feet per round, and may travel 5 feet for every 5 feet you fall, up to 30 feet of lateral movement. You take half fall damage if you fall through this substance.

- You can jump up to 10 feet in the air while in this substance, and over creatures size medium and smaller.

#### Advanced Attunement

- While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 25 feet per round, and may travel 10 feet for every 5 feet you fall, up to 60 feet of lateral movement. You take no fall damage from falling.

- You can jump up to 15 feet in the air while in this substance, and over creatures size large and smaller.

#### Paragon Attunement

- You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (affected by armor and other movement penalties as well). You ascend at half speed.

#### Sensing

- You can sense the direction of the substance within 120 feet, even if you can't see it. Your approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.

#### Creation & Destruction

- You can cause this substance to slowly appear or disappear from around you as an action. If this substance causes a condition such as blindness or suffocation, it can be produced at a maximum of a single level. You can produce a 5-foot cube once each round as an action, and in no more than a 5-foot radius from you. You cannot create or destroy in air-tight locations, including within liquids. Gasses dissipate after a minute, or immediately if blown away with a breeze.

#### Advanced Attunement

- You can create or destroy up to a 10-foot cube as an action instead, and in a 15-foot radius.

#### Paragon Attunement

- You can create or destroy up to a 15-foot cube as an action instead, and in a 45-foot radius.

### Converting between Substances

Sometimes, you will be able to convert between different types of substances, such as with ice and water, or lava and stone. These conversions use the following rules:

- Conversions happen at a rate equal to twice the creation rate of whatever substance you are turning it into, and at a range equal to the corresponding manipulation range.

- For example, with an advanced attunement to a solid, you can create a 1.5-foot cube as an action. If you are instead turning a liquid into a solid, you can create a 2-foot cube of solid as an action, and you can do it at a range of 15 feet.

- If you instead were converting that solid into a liquid at an advanced level, you would have the same increase in volume, but would instead be able to do it at a range of 45 feet, since that is the advanced liquid manipulation range.

#### Trapping a creature

- If you try to convert the substance a creature is standing in into a solid, it is usually slow enough that the creature can escape becoming trapped, unless it already cannot move.

## The Elements

There are nine different elements—fire, air, water, earth, light, dark, force, void, and time. When you have a level of attunement with an element, you gain all of its benefits, as well as the benefits from every level before it. Gaining attunements to elements is also one of the primary ways to gain attunements to resonate substances. You can gain an elemental attunement with the Elemental Affinity talent, found in the Talents section.

### Fire

#### Basic Attunement

- As an action, you can ignite or put out small flames within 5 feet without touching them.

- You can sense any fire within 45 feet, including how much, its general direction, and intensity.

- You take half damage from the burning condition.

#### Advanced Attunement

- Add ash to your resonate substances as a basic, solid attunement.

- Add smoke to your resonate substances as a basic, gaseous substance attunement. Smoke blinds and suffocates those who stand in it.

- As an action, you can ignite or put out flammable items within 45 feet.

- You can sense fire within a 300 feet, including how much, its general direction, and intensity.

- You are immune to the burning condition.

#### Paragon Attunement

- Add lava rocks, such as pumice and obsidian to your resonate substances at basic, solid substance attunements.

- Your attunements to ash and smoke become advanced.

- As an action, you can ignite or put out flammable items within 120 feet.

- As an action, you can manipulate all fire and smoke within 120 feet into shapes, patterns, and different colors.

### Air

#### Basic Attunement

- Add “neutral air” to your resonate substances as a basic gaseous attunement. Neutral air is breathable, inert, harmless, invisible, and unscented.

- You may turn any gaseous substance within the range of your manipulation into “neutral air”.

- You can breathe underwater.

#### Advanced Attunement

- Your attunement to “neutral air” becomes advanced.

- Creatures within the range of your “neutral air” attunement creation radius can also breathe while underwater.

#### Paragon Level

- Your attunement to “neutral air” becomes paragon.

### Water

#### Basic Attunement

- Add water to your resonate substances as a basic liquid attunement.

#### Advanced Attunement

- Your attunement to water becomes advanced.

#### Paragon Attunement

- Your attunement to water becomes paragon.

### Earth

#### Basic Attunement

- Add stone, dirt, and clay to your resonate substances as basic solid attunements. Stone includes all non-precious rocks.

#### Advanced Attunement

- Your attunements to stone, dirt, and clay become advanced.

#### Paragon Attunement

- Your attunements to stone, dirt, and clay become paragon.

### Void

#### Basic Attunement

- As an action, you may cease to exist, and disappear. When you do so, choose any length of time. After that time, you reappear in the same spot. Note that if that spot has any solid objects passing through it when you return, those objects are now passing through you—potentially killing you.

#### Advanced Attunement

- As an action, you can send a non-living object you touch into the void, causing it to cease to exist forever. The object must not be larger than a 1-foot cube. The entire object must be able to fit within the cube, and must be a distinct object—not part of something larger.

#### Paragon Attunement

- Whenever you move, you may instead choose to teleport half the distance.

- The maximum size of objects you send to the void increases to a 5-foot cube.

### Time

#### Basic Attunement

- Once per day, immediately after learning the result of an action you took, you may choose to go back to right before you made that action and choose not to take it. This could include things such as stepping onto a trap, making a conversational gaffe, or

- By touching a nonliving object for a minute, you can cause it to age a year. The object must be able to fit within a 5-foot cube.

#### Advanced Attunement

- When you unwind time, you may choose to instead unwind time when another creature makes an action rather than yourself. You may make an action now.

- The size of the object to age increases to a 10-foot cube.

#### Paragon Attunement

- The size of the object to age increases to a 100-foot cube.

- You may choose to use your own timeline to fix the past. The entire world reverts to whatever state it was 24 hours ago. You gain 3 levels of dazed that don't fade until you take a long rest, and your body ages by 10 years.

### Light

#### Basic Attunement

- You can produce bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light 30 feet beyond that. It dispels magical darkness. By touching an inanimate object, it gains this property. You cannot produce more than one source of light.

- You may inflict three levels of blindness to creatures you are touching.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The bright light you can produce extends up to 60 feet, and 60 feet of dim light beyond that. You can produce up to three sources of this light.

- You may cast blinding sun on yourself any number of times per day.

#### Paragon Attunement

- You can raise the light level to dim light in any number of locations that you can see. This overrides any magical darkness, and cannot be turned into darkness.

- Whenever you cast blinding sun, you may inflict up to 5 levels of blindness.

### Darkness

#### Basic Attunement

- You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet, or increase your current darkvision by 30 feet.

- As an action, you dim the light in a 30-foot radius, turning non-magical, bright light into dim light, or dim light into darkness.

[[A note on Light and Dark]]
It's hard to actually “hurt” someone with light or darkness. Many of the other elements have physical aspects or obvious connections to sources of damage, but light and dark do not. You'll notice in the spell sections that spells with the light and dark tags only deal damage when they're paired with another element.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.

- The range at which you can create darkness increases by 30 feet.

#### Paragon Attunement

- Other creatures with darkvision cannot see through darkness you create.

- The range at which you can create darkness increases by 60 feet.

### Force

#### Basic Attunement

- As an action, you can apply up to 10 pounds of force to any non-living object within 90 feet. You can manipulate fine objects, so long as they only require one, linear force applied to them.

#### Advanced Attunement

- The force you can apply increases to a maximum of 20 pounds.

- You may divide this force between up to three different objects.

- You can manipulate fine objects that would not otherwise require a skill check to manipulate, and can apply rotational force.

#### Paragon Attunement

- You may divide this force between any number of different objects.

- You may manipulate objects that would require a skill check to use. You cannot wield a weapon using this force.

# Spellcasting

## Gaining Spells

- Learning a spell represents mastery over some aspect of one's connection with an element, allowing the user to perform some fantastical feat. Anyone with an attunement can learn to cast a spell.

- By spending XP, as described in the Gaining and Spending XP section, one can gain a new spell, chosen from the list of spells in the Spells section. You must have at least a basic attunement to all of the elements in the tags listed below each spell in order to learn that spell.

## Casting Spells

- Casting a spell is more difficult than simple elemental manipulation performed with just an attunement, as it requires more precise control for a longer duration. Performing a powerful act of elemental control while in the thick of a fight takes skill and practice, and comes with the following restrictions:

- Casting a spell requires your action.

- You may cast only one spell per round.

- Casting a spell requires at least one free hand.

- If casting a spell, you cannot have moved more than half your movement speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties), rounded up.

- After casting the spell, you cannot move more than half your movement speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties).

- Casting spells is strenuous, and takes a toll on your body, and without proper preparation, can wreak havoc on your ability to channel your attunement in that way again for a while. You must wait four long rests before casting that spell again, though that time may vary as per the following rules:

  - Subtract one long rest for each consecutive round taken before this action spent unmoving, taking no actions and using no abilities, and not communicating (in complete, meditative concentration).

  - Subtract one long rest if you have an advanced attunement with the elemental type of the spell you are casting.

  - Subtract two long rests if you instead have a paragon attunement with the elemental type of the spell you are casting.

- If the total number of long rests would be reduced to zero, you must still wait at least one short rest before casting the spell again.

## Spellcasting Ability

- Whenever a creature has to make a saving throw against your spellcasting ability, it must make a check against the maximum of your current heart die, plus two times your paragon level.
