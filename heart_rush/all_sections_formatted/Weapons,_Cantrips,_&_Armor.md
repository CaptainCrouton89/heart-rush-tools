# Weapons, Cantrips & Armor

Equipment encompasses all of the gear you might use while adventuring. When you first create your character, you will likely start out with a weapon and some armor, though it is up to the GM.  
Also in this section are the rules for cantrips. Cantrips are very similar to weapons; you choose stances, and on a hit you usually get to make an attack roll with your chosen stance. Cantrips differ from weapons in that there is no physical weapon used to strike the opponent, and only those with magical attunements can use them.

## Weapons

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and damage type, which together describe the weapon and its properties. You may choose one weapon to be your primary weapon. This weapon does not use up equipment slots.  
You can only wield one weapon at a time. If wielding a weapon does not require being held in your hands, it does not count towards this restriction.

\*Slots not used if weapon is your primary weapon or part of your body.

### Attack Types & Range

| Attack Type | Range                          | Hands Required                   | Movement Restrictions                                                                                 | Might Stance Bonus                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Melee**   | 5 feet                         | Heavy: Two<br />Light/Ultra: One | None                                                                                                  | Push target 10 feet away; enter their vacated spaces without provoking opportunity attacks             |
| **Ranged**  | Light: 30 ft<br />Heavy: 60 ft | Two (unless noted)               | Cannot choose non-defensive stance if moved >½ speed; cannot move >½ speed after non-defensive stance | Target cannot add armor defense bonus                                                                  |
| **Thrown**  | 20 feet                        | One                              | Cannot be used in water                                                                               | Make immediate follow-up attack with another thrown weapon against different target in same engagement |
| **Whip**    | 20 feet                        | One                              | Cannot be used in water                                                                               | Add another weapon die to attack roll                                                                  |

**Range Notes:**

- Attacking beyond listed range: Disadvantage for every 10 feet over (ranged) or 5 feet over (thrown), up to double weapon's range
- **Reach tag:** If you haven't dashed this round, melee range becomes 10 feet instead of 5

### Damage Types & Stance Bonuses

**Damage type bonuses reward using the optimal stance for your weapon's material.** These bonuses apply to **every attack** when using the matching stance, regardless of your opponent's stance choice. This encourages matching your fighting style to your weapon.

| Damage Type     | Best Stance | Always-On Stance Bonus                              | Examples                |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Bludgeoning** | Might       | Add additional weapon die when using might stance   | War hammers, clubs      |
| **Slashing**    | Agility     | Add additional weapon die when using agility stance | Swords, scythes         |
| **Piercing**    | Cunning     | Add additional weapon die when using cunning stance | Rapiers, arrows, spears |

**Important:** These damage type bonuses are **separate from and stack with** Attack Type bonuses (listed in the table above), which only trigger when you beat your opponent's stance. A bludgeoning maul wielder in Might stance always gets the extra weapon die (damage type bonus), and additionally gets the push effect when attacking Cunning opponents (attack type bonus).

### How Weapon Bonuses Stack

Understanding how damage type and attack type bonuses combine is crucial for maximizing your combat effectiveness. Here are concrete examples:

#### Example 1: Heavy Bludgeoning Maul (Melee) in Might Stance

A classic warrior's weapon that rewards aggressive play.

- **vs Cunning opponent:** Heart + Might + 1d12 (base) + 1d12 (damage type) + push 10ft (attack type) = **2d12 + push effect**
- **vs Defensive opponent:** Heart + Might + 1d12 (base) + 1d12 (damage type) = **2d12 damage only**
- **vs Might opponent:** Contested roll using Heart + Might + 2d12 (damage type bonus applies to contested rolls)

The maul user always benefits from the damage type bonus when using Might stance, making it a powerful choice even against defensive enemies.

#### Example 2: Heavy Bludgeoning Whip in Might Stance

An exotic weapon that stacks both bonuses as additional dice.

- **vs Cunning opponent:** Heart + Might + 1d12 (base) + 1d12 (damage type) + 1d12 (whip attack type) = **3d12 total damage!**
- **vs Defensive opponent:** Heart + Might + 1d12 (base) + 1d12 (damage type) = **2d12 damage**
- **vs Might opponent:** Contested roll using Heart + Might + 2d12

The whip is unique because its attack type bonus is also an additional die, allowing for devastating burst damage when everything aligns.

#### Example 3: Light Piercing Rapier (Melee) in Might Stance

Using a weapon with the "wrong" stance reduces your damage potential.

- **vs Cunning opponent:** Heart + Might + 1d8 (base) + push 10ft (attack type) = **1d8 + push**
- **vs Defensive opponent:** Heart + Might + 1d8 (base) = **1d8 damage only**

No damage type bonus because Piercing weapons need Cunning stance, not Might. However, you still get the melee attack type bonus when beating Cunning opponents.

#### Example 4: Light Slashing Sword (Melee) in Agility Stance

A finesse weapon used with its optimal stance.

- **vs Might opponent:** Heart + Agility + 1d8 (base) + 1d8 (damage type) + free 5ft sidestep (attack type) = **2d8 + mobility**
- **vs Defensive opponent:** Heart + Agility + 1d8 (base) + 1d8 (damage type) = **2d8 damage**
- **vs Agility opponent:** Contested roll using Heart + Agility + 2d8

The slashing sword excels with Agility stance, offering both increased damage and tactical repositioning.

#### Example 5: Heavy Piercing Longbow (Ranged) in Cunning Stance

Ranged weapons have different attack type bonuses.

- **vs Agility opponent:** Heart + Cunning + 1d12 (base) + 1d12 (damage type) + apply 2 conditions (attack type) = **2d12 + conditions**
- **vs Defensive opponent:** Heart + Cunning + 1d12 (base) + 1d12 (damage type) = **2d12 damage**

The longbow benefits from Piercing + Cunning for maximum damage, and when beating Agility opponents, the archer can apply debilitating conditions instead of dealing extra damage.

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Always match your stance to your damage type** when possible—it's free extra damage on every attack
2. **Attack type bonuses are "win conditions"**—they reward you for making the right stance prediction
3. **Damage type bonuses apply even in contested rolls** when both fighters choose the same stance
4. **Whips are uniquely powerful** in the right circumstances because both bonuses add dice
5. **Defensive stance opponents** still take damage type bonus damage, making them less safe against matched weapons

### Special Weapons

Some weapons don't deal damage but have other tactical effects:

| Property        | Value                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Size**        | Light (1d8)                                                                             |
| **Attack Type** | Thrown (20 feet)                                                                        |
| **Damage Type** | Special (no damage)                                                                     |
| **Effect**      | On hit, target gains the Entangled condition                                            |
| **Might Bonus** | Target gains an additional level of restrained (2 total)                                |
| **Special**     | Reusable if intact; 5 HP, defense 10; creatures >1 size larger only gain 1 level slowed |

## Cantrips

Cantrips are magical weapons that function identically to physical weapons in combat. Unlike spells (which are separate strategic abilities), cantrips are used within engagements and follow all normal weapon attack rules.

However, unlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you have an attunement to the corresponding element.  
Also, since elemental attacks are not always physical, they don't always deal damage, and the bonus granted by the might stance is sometimes different.

**Cantrips Are NOT Spells**

- Cantrips have no cooldowns, casting restrictions, or action requirements
- They're used exactly like weapons during engagements
- They don't count toward your "one spell per round" limit
- Movement restrictions for spellcasting don't apply to cantrips

**Concept:**  
Cantrips and weapons are conceptually different. However, the rules for spells are similar to ranged weapons. Unlike spells, they are used during engagements in the same way as weapons.  
People with attunements can use them like “utility” arrows, where each type of bolt and blast has some convenient effect, possibly in addition to damage.

### Types of Cantrips

There are two types of cantrips—bolts, and blasts.  
Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line from your hand, while blasts are short bursts of energy emitted from the caster themselves.  
Each have more specific rules outlined in their sections.

#### Bolts

Bolts are individual streaks of elemental energy or matter that are fired from a single hand.  
They behave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though they do not get a bonus from damage type.  
All bolt cantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement to that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and 120 feet at paragon attunement.

**Lightning Bolt**  
Air.  
You shoot a crackling bolt of lightning from your hand.  
This attack deals damage as an ultralight, ranged, spell-weapon attack.  
If the target is wearing metal armor or is wet, double the result of your attack roll.

**Fire Bolt**  
Fire.  
You shoot a bolt of fire from your hand.  
This attack does no damage, but ignites the target, dealing 2 levels of burning.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of burning.

**Water Bolt**  
Water.  
You may shoot a heavy jet of water from your hand.  
This attack deals damage as a light, ranged, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.  
On a hit, the target is drenched in water, and takes a level of off-balanced.

**Earthen Bolt**  
Water.  
You may launch a massive stone from your hand.  
This attack deals damage as a heavy, ranged, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.

**Force Bolt**  
Force.  
You shoot a roiling bolt of force from your hand.  
This attack does no damage, but the target is pushed back 20 feet.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** They are pushed 30 feet instead.

**Void Bolt**  
Void.  
You shoot a bolt of pure void from your hand.  
The faint sound of faesong can be heard in the air as the bolt travels.  
This attack does no damage, but the target takes a level of confused as faesong rips through their body.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of confused.

**Dark Bolt**  
Dark.  
You shoot a bolt of darkness from your hand.

**Might Stance Bonus:** Add two levels of weakened.

**Radiant Bolt**  
Light.  
You shoot a bolt of brilliant light from your hand.  
This attack does no damage, but the target takes 2 levels of blinded as light ripples across their body.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of blinded.

**Time Bolt**  
Time.  
You shoot a bolt of time from your hand.  
This attack does no damage but the target takes a level of stunned as time temporarily freezes for the creature.  
Once a creature has been stunned from a time effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add two levels of dazed.

#### Blasts

Blasts are outbursts of an element centered on one's self, generally taking the form of a rapidly expanding circle of elemental matter or energy.  
They behave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that you must choose a stance, can only attack those whom your stance beats, and gain the benefits associated with each stance—though not all blasts deal damage, and not all blasts are attacks.  
You must have both hands free to use blast cantrips.

After choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up to two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of you.  
At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any number of valid targets in range.  
At paragon attunement, the range of your blast increases by 5 feet.

**Blast of Lightning**  
Air.  
You spread your arms, sending electricity crackling away from you.  
This attack deals damage as an ultralight, melee, spell-weapon attack.  
If targets are wearing metal armor, double the result of your attack roll.

**Blast of Fire**  
Fire.  
You spread your arms, radiating large waves of fire.  
This attack does no damage, but the target is ignited, taking two levels of burning.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of burning.

**Blast of Water**  
Water.  
You spread your arms, sending a short but powerful wave of water away from you.

**Might Stance Bonus:** They are pushed 30 feet instead.

**Blast of Void**  
Void.  
You spread your arms, launching thousands of grains of pure void.  
This attack does no damage, but targets take a level of confused as faesong rips through their body.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of confused.

**Blast of Darkness**  
Dark.  
You spread your arms, engulfing yourself and the area around you in rippling darkness.  
This attack does no damage, but targets take two levels of weakened as they are sapped of their energy by the shadowy tendrils engulfing them.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add two levels of weakened.

**Blast of Radiance**  
Light.  
You spread your arms, emitting brilliant white light.

Once a creature has been stunned from a time effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add two levels of dazed.

## Armor

Armor works by increasing your defense rolls, making it harder for damage to get through. Armor does not require equipment slots while being worn.

### Armor Properties

| Armor Type  | Defense Bonus | Move Speed Penalty | Slots\* |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| **Heavy**   | +6            | -15 feet           | 5       |
| **Medium**  | +4            | -10 feet           | 2       |
| **Light**   | +2            | -5 feet            | 1       |
| **None**    | +0            | None               | 0       |
| **Natural** | Variable      | None               | 0       |

\*Slots only used when not being worn.

**Natural Armor:** Some creatures have natural armor that provides any amount of defense bonus with no movement penalty. You cannot choose to have natural armor.

## Shields

Like armor, shields help you stay alive. You must have a free hand available to wield a shield (e.g., wielding a light melee weapon in the other hand).

### Shield Properties

| Shield Type | Defense Bonus | Move Speed Penalty | Slots\* | Special Properties                                          |

| **Heavy**   | +2            | -5 feet            | 2       | Allies may treat your space as a wall for talents/abilities |
| **Light**   | +1            | None               | 1       | None                                                        |

\*Slots only used when not being worn.
