# Magic

Spell casting and traditional magic in Heart Rush primarily involves elemental magic.

If you want to start using magic, the best way to start is by taking the _Elemental Affinity_ talent, which grants you an attunement to one of the elements. Having an attunement to an element lets you cast cantrips with that element, and lets you pick up elemental talents, whic hare like magic spells.
