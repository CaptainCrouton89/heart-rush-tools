# Talents

Talents represent specific abilities you have learned, been gifted, or know how to perform through religious or magical ritual. Each talent will fall into one of three types of abilities: passive abilities, heart abilities, or major abilities. As with abilities gained from your class, passive abilities can be used whenever and at no cost, and major abilities can be used once per day. Heart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you take a wound.

Additionally, talents may also have the instant or full action tag. If it is instant, then you can use the ability at literally any time, even right before you roll. If it has the full action tag, it requires you to use your action.

## Types of Talents

Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by their tags. Each require different conditions to be met in order to gain that talent.

### Cognitive and Martial Talents

Martial talents are those that require physical prowess and training. They represent the culmination of extensive practice and training. There are no prerequisites for taking a martial talent.

Cognitive talents, like martial talents, come from vigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.

### Gaeic Melodies

Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that reverberate throughout all living things—left over from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world into life.

Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to them have magical effects. However, they cannot be discovered innately, and require a teacher or a songbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or higher aspect in musical talents in order to play them.

When playing a gaeic melody, it requires your action to play the instrument. You can move up to half your move speed while playing, but cannot move more than that. You cannot play more than one gaeic melody at the same time.

### Handmagic

Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create their effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where words spoken in it simply come true.

Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the back of one's hand, inscribed in the blood of magical creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the tattooed hand in specific ways, one can then create those magical effects. The knowledge and necessary materials to inscribe hand runes is rare and expensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely require you to be in a city.

### Elemental Talents

Elemental talents include passive elemental effects and powerful invocations of elemental power. Each talent will have one or more elemental tags, indicating the element it is associated with, and the attunement(s) required to pick up the talent. Elemental talents are listed in their own section of the talent list. Gaining an elemental talent represents long periods of study, practice, and meditation.

## Combat Talents

The talents in this section are combat-related talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding talents, and has no other effect.

### Action Surge

_Major ability. Martial talent._

You push your body and mind beyond normal limits, moving with impossible speed and precision. When you use this ability on your turn, immediately gain an additional action that must be used during this same turn. This action follows all normal rules and restrictions, and you may use other major abilities with this extra action.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use Action Surge, you also immediately gain 3 rush points. However, these rush points cannot be spent to enhance your class's major ability - they must be used for minor abilities, opportunity attacks, or sidestepping.

### Adrenaline spike

_Major ability. Handmagic._

Increase the size of an ability die for a single roll. You can't increase the size of the die beyond a d12.

**Destiny Level:**
Increase the size of the die by two instead, or increase a d12 to a d20.

### Agile

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

When you choose the agility stance, you may sidestep twice instead of once.

**Destiny Level:**
Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D rolls made this round. Increase the die's size by one for each consecutive time you chose this stance.

### Assassin

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You have learned the art of debilitating your foes and killing them silently. When you enter an engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately make a might or agility check against their agility challenge number. On a success, you either gag them, garrote them, or in some other way remove their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.

**Destiny Level:**
Once per month, you may declare a humanoid to be the target of your assassination. So long as that creature never learns you are an assassin, they remain marked. Given you spend one month studying the target of your assassination before attempting to kill them, you have A5 on opportunity attacks made against your target, and advantage on all other attacks against it.

### Backstab

_Minor ability. Instant. Martial talent._

When you have flanking position on an enemy (you can draw a straight line from any corner of your space through the enemy's space to any corner of your ally's space), you may treat your weapon as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against that enemy until end of the round. You must be wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the benefits of this ability.

You may also use this die if you are granted an opportunity attack due to being hidden.

**Destiny Level:**
You may replace your weapon die with 2d20 instead.

### Baited Attack

_Minor ability. Instant. Martial talent._

If a creature makes an attack against you and deals no damage to you, they instead deal damage equal to their roll to another creature behind you as you redirect their attack. A creature is considered behind you if at least one straight line can be drawn from a corner of the attacker's space, through your space, and to a corner of the new victim's space.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use this ability, both creatures gain 2 levels of enraged towards you.

### Ballad of Björn

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, you may choose any number of creatures besides yourself within 60 feet and in earshot. They lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had any, and are immune to both conditions for the next 24 hours. In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest, and gain one additional rush point the next time they gain rush points today.

**Destiny Level:**
This ability becomes a major ability. You may include yourself in the creatures affected by your song.

### BattleFrenzy

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

While there are two or more enemies adjacent to you, you have advantage on your attack roll for each enemy adjacent to you.

**Destiny Level:**
Whenever you start the round with two or more enemies adjacent to you, you gain a rush point for each adjacent enemy.

### Battleweave

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you sidestep, you deal damage to an adjacent creature at your new location equal to twice the number of enemies you began the round adjacent to.

**Destiny Level:**
You may choose to either deal twice as much damage to the target of this ability, or the same amount of damage to every adjacent enemy.

### Beast Bond

_Passive ability. Handmagic. Prerequisite: Beast Companion._

You can magically, telepathically communicate with your companion, and over any distance. As an action, you may begin sensing through the senses of your beast companion. You cannot use your own senses again until you spend an action returning to your own body.

**Destiny Level:**
As an action, you may take total control of your beast companion. While in control, you play each round as the animal instead of yourself. You may use any cognitive and martial talents you have, but the cooldowns are not separate for your animal. For example, once you've used a major ability, you cannot use it yourself or as your animal until you take a long rest. You may also cast spells you know and use your attunements as the animal. While controlling your companion, your body falls prone and is incapacitated, and you cannot sense using your body's senses. You may return to your body as an action.

### Beast Companion

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

Choose an animal with the GM's approval. It has a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, must be of small size or smaller, has 20 hit point capacity, and a d6 heart die (you may work with your GM to adjust these values). You can communicate simple ideas with it from a distance using verbal and somatic commands. The animal obeys all your commands. When in combat, your companion is not very effective on its own. Your companion cannot use its action to enter engagements, though it can still be forced into engagements by other combatants. It can otherwise use its action normally.
You may take this talent any number of times. If your companion dies, you may choose to replace this talent with another talent instead.

**Destiny Level:**
You may spend XP on your beast companion as though it were yourself. Beast companions cannot gain talents as oaths, and cannot gain cognitive talents. Your beast companion cannot gain a beast companion.
While adjacent to your companion, if you or your companion would be forced to make a defense roll, the other may choose to step in to make the defense roll and take the damage instead. If that creature was already being attacked from the same source, they cannot use this ability.

### Blood Bond

_Passive ability. Handmagic._

Through Deoric runes tattooed with mixed blood, you create a mystical life-link between yourself and others. To establish a bond, you and another creature with this talent must spend one minute as a handmagic practitioner inscribes connecting runes on both participants using a mixture of their blood and titan blood.

Once bonded, you may freely transfer hit points between yourself and any bonded creature within 120 feet as an instant ability requiring no action. You may transfer up to 40 hit points per day in this way. Hit points transferred cannot exceed either creature's maximum.

You may be bonded to a number of creatures equal to your presence die.

**Destiny Level:**
The mystical connection transcends all distance - you may transfer hit points to bonded creatures anywhere in existence. The daily limit increases to 100 hit points. Additionally, when transferring hit points, you may choose to also transfer one condition affecting you to the recipient or vice versa (with their permission).

### Bloodblade

_Passive ability. Handmagic._

### Bloodoath

_Weekly ability. Handmagic._

As an action, you swear vengeance against a creature that you believe has wronged you. You can only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time. While you have sworn vengeance against a creature you always know where the creature is, and whenever you engage with or make an opportunity attack against the creature you gain a rush point at the beginning of the next round.

**Destiny Level:**
You have advantage on A/D rolls against your sworn enemy. In addition, you do not need to use your action to use this ability.

### Body Shield

_Minor ability. Instant. Martial talent._

The next time you are hit by a melee attack from a source that is adjacent to both you and a creature you are grappling, if the attacking creature's stance did not directly beat your own, you may use the grappled creature as a body shield. Add the creature's defense bonus to your own and split the damage between you, rounding up.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use this ability against ranged attacks as well, so long as the grappled creature is between you and the source (a line can be drawn from one of your corners to theirs that passes through the grappled creature's space). When you use this ability, the grappled creature takes all of the damage and makes the defense roll instead.

### Boundless Fury

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever your attack deals more damage than the defending creature's maximum heart die, you may enter an engagement with a different, adjacent creature immediately after the current engagement ends. You cannot attack a creature you have already attacked this round. After the new engagement, you gain one level of weakened for each time you used this ability in the round.

- You may treat all defense rolls you make as their maximum result.

### Burst of Speed

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You may choose to move 50 more feet this round, spread out however you wish between your dashes. If you do, you gain two levels of slowed at the end of this round.

Whenever you move 20 feet or more in a straight line towards an enemy and immediately engage them with a heavy melee weapon, if you make an attack roll against them, they fall prone.

**Destiny Level:**
Add or subtract 2d6 instead.

### Critical Observation

_Major ability. Martial talent._

You may spend a minute examining a creature to try to identify a weakness in a creature's defenses. Make an observation (cunning) skill check contested by 8 plus the creature's defense bonus. On a success, you get AD2 on all attack rolls against the creature.

**Destiny Level:**
Roll an additional 4d6 instead.

### Reckless Attack

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Upon entering an engagement or making an opportunity attack, but before choosing stances, you may declare this to be a reckless attack. You may add 1d4 to each of your attack rolls until the end of the round. Enemies have advantage on their attack rolls against you until the end of the round.

**Destiny Level:**
Add 1d8 to your attacks instead.

**Destiny Level:**
The creature takes as much damage as you take, instead.

### Rejuvenate

_Major ability. Handmagic._

As an object interaction, you may lay your hands on someone else, causing some of their wounds to close up, at the cost of your own health. When you use this ability, you may reduce your hit points by any amount, increasing the target's hit points by half that amount.

**Destiny Level:**
The healing is equal to the full amount spent, rather than being halved.

### Savage Attacker

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you push a creature back with a heavy weapon using the might stance, they take 1d8 damage for every 5 feet of movement blocked by a wall, rather than 1d6.

### Slippery

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to try to physically dodge a trap or an area effect, you may choose to first sidestep and fall prone. Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to avoid or escape being restrained, you may choose to replace the result of either die with its maximum, after rolling. You cannot be grappled.

**Destiny Level:**
Once per round, if you roll doubles on a defense roll, you may immediately sidestep. If you are no longer a valid target for your attacker, you do not take damage.

### Staggering Blows

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you roll the maximum on one of the dice in your attack roll, the defending creature takes three levels of off-balanced.

### Still Fresh

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

If you are at your maximum heart die size, levels of dazed, off-balanced, and weakened fade twice rather than once.

**Destiny Level:**
Enemies cannot inflict upon you the dazed, off-balanced, or weakened conditions while your heart die is still at its maximum.

### Sundering Blows

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make an attack roll with the might stance, using a heavy melee weapon against someone who chose the cunning stance, you may choose to permanently decrease the defense bonus from their armor by 2, to a minimum of 0. If the armor is natural, the penalty lasts until the creature heals all of its wounds. If it is physical armor, then the armor requires repairs before it can work effectively again.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures you hit with this ability can have a negative defense bonus.

### Take Advantage

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

Whenever an enemy has two or more levels of weakened, dazed, or off-balanced, or has two or more conditions affecting it, you have A2 on your attacks against them.

### Target the Weakness

_Minor ability. Instant. Cognitive talent._

During an engagement, but before anyone declares stances, you may use this ability. Announce a stance, and a creature in the engagement. Once stances are revealed, any attack roll against the creature made using the announced stance ignores half of the target's defense roll.

Ignore the creature's entire defense roll instead.

**Destiny Level:**
Regain 5 hit points instead.

### Whipmaster

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You may forgo making an attack roll with your whip to instead inflict one level of restrained on the creature until the end of the round. Whips you use are treated as light weapons rather than ultralight weapons.

**Destiny Level:**
In addition to restraining the creature, you may immediately jerk the whip back, knocking the creature prone so long as the creature is no more than one size larger than you. It takes 1d6 damage if it falls prone.

### Whirlwind Strike

_Major ability. Instant. Martial talent._

When you make an attack roll against an enemy using a melee slashing weapon, you may make the attack a whirlwind attack. If you do, creatures of your choice within melee range must make a defense roll against your attack roll and take the damage as well. This only counts as making one attack.

**Destiny Level:**
This ability becomes a minor ability instead.

### Whispers of Madness

_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may lace otherworldly whispers into the mind of your target. They gain a level of dazed and shaken for the next minute as they try to remain focused.

**Destiny Level:**
You may repeat this action for free on consecutive rounds, up to three times total. Each time you do so, the target creature gains another level of dazed and shaken.

## Noncombat Talents

The talents in this section are noncombat-related talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding talents, and has no other effect.

### Adherence

_Major ability. Handmagic._

As an action, you may point at a non-living, unoccupied object or space within 30 feet. Up to a 5-foot cube worth of volume of that object becomes covered in an extremely sticky slime, with sticking power equal to 100 pounds. If a creature steps on the object, they must use their action to step free of it, and the space counts as difficult terrain.

### Astral Navigator
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

So long as you can see the stars, you may ignore the navigation challenge number for your environment and use a default value of 10. You do not have disadvantage if you make this roll as part of a navigation camp action at night. If you are already lost, you cannot identify your location only by looking at the stars, though a successful navigation check will tell you that you are lost.

**Destiny Level:**  
You have advantage on navigation checks. You can identify your location from a successful navigation check.

### Attraction

**Destiny Level:**
Batch sizes are doubled instead. The chance for extra unique consumables increases to 50%. Additionally, when making items in batches, if you succeed on all crafting checks without any failures, one item in the batch is of exceptional quality (minor beneficial property determined by GM).

### Beastform
_Major ability. Handmagic._

When you pick this talent, work with your GM to pick a common and mundane creature that you can transform into. As an action, you may transform into this creature. You maintain your mental stats, though take on the physical stats and abilities of the chosen creature.  
The creature cannot have a fly speed or a swim speed, and should use either a d4 and d8, or two d6s for its might and agility ability dice. It must be either a small or medium creature. It has the same maximum hit points and heart die as you do.  
You automatically revert to your natural form after one hour, or as an action any time before then.

**Destiny Level:**  
This becomes a passive ability. You may stay in your transformed state for any amount of time. The creature you transform into may be tiny, and may have a swim speed. The creature can have 2d8s, or a d4 and d10 for its might and agility dice.

### Befuddle

**Destiny Level:**  
The target does not realize that you performed mind-altering magic on it.

### Call of Delorn
_Monthly ability. Gaeic melody._

You play a song, making a plea to the wilds for their help. After playing your instrument for an hour, a friendly, non-humanoid animal comes to your aid. The animal is not your servant, but will do its best to help you in any way that does not put itself in danger. You may communicate with it through your song, though the animal cannot communicate back. The animal remains in your aid for the rest of the day.

### Cat's Feet

### Chaos Gambler
_Passive ability. Handmagic._


You have inscribed runes of pure chaos upon your hands, channeling unpredictable forces through your very being. When you take this talent, choose physical or mental. You gain one level of permanent vulnerability in your chosen type (complications and failures occur on 1s and 2s for might and agility checks if physical, or cunning and presence checks if mental).

In exchange, whenever you roll the maximum result on any die during a skill check of your chosen type, you may immediately roll another die of the same size and add it to your result. This can trigger multiple times on the same roll - each maximum roll grants another die. Note that multiple 1s _always_ triggers total failure and a complication.

**Destiny Level:**
The chaos runes spread across your body like living tattoos. You gain an additional level of vulnerability in your chosen type (complications and failures now occur on 1s, 2s, and 3s). However, your exploding dice now trigger on the maximum result OR one below maximum (e.g., 5-6 on a d6, 11-12 on a d12) for skill checks of your chosen type.

### Coin Jingle
_Major ability. Gaeic melody._

If you wish, you may press further and make a presence check contested by their cunning challenge number. This check is made with disadvantage if they are unfriendly or hostile towards you. On a success, you learn any one specific piece of information that the target knows and is not actively hiding. On a fail, they know that you are fishing for information about your topic.

**Destiny Level:**  
You do not make this check with disadvantage against unfriendly creatures, and you make the check with advantage if it's against a friendly or neutral creature. In addition, if you fail, the creature does not know that you were probing for details on your topic.

### Dancing Fingers
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

As an action, you can make a small object (less than a couple pounds, no bigger than your hand) disappear on your person so long as you are wearing clothes and your hands are free.

The GM must either answer it truthfully, or you may put 1 XP into the experience bowl. You cannot use this ability more than once per session, and you cannot ask the same question again, regardless of if the GM answered it.

**Destiny Level:**  
Rather than ask a yes or no question, you can ask any question, and get no more than a couple of words in answer.

### Dream Thief
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

By spending one minute concentrating on someone else within 10 feet, you can pull thoughts from their mind. Make a contested cunning check against another character. On a success, you may ask one yes or no question about what they are thinking. On a failure, they know that you tried to break into their mind.

**Destiny Level:**  
As an action, you can meld with a tree, or other, equally large plant. By doing so, your body and gear disappear, and your spirit inhabits the wood of the tree. You can sense your surroundings out to a range of 45 feet.  
While transformed as a tree, you maintain the stats of your untransformed character, though your defense becomes 8, and you may double your current and hit points. You are also incapacitated, and cannot speak. You may transform back to your original form at will, or at the end of the round if in combat.

### Druid's Voice
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

You can communicate with plants, so long as you are touching them. Plants recognize you as an ally, and will generally be willing to help in any way they can.

Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense for where there may be more to discover, and what you might find. Once per month, while exploring a location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that there is more to be discovered. Then name either ruin, settlement, or natural wonder, and choose a direction that you have not been in before. Whatever you named is located somewhat closely in the named direction. The GM may ask you to choose a different direction, or a different discovery.

### Faceless Servant

You have a cause, and you are good at rallying those around you to it. If you spend ten minutes talking to a crowd of ten or more, you convert 1/10th of the people who are at least one level of influence lower than you into followers.  
You have advantage when trying to persuade your followers to take an action that aligns with your ideology.

**Destiny Level:**  
Your rhetoric is so strong, you can convert 1/4th of a crowd to followers, rather than 1/10th.  
When you take this destiny level, you may also choose and describe how you gain one devotee to your ideology. You may take this destiny level multiple times.

### Impenetrable Fog
_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._  

Add fog to your resonate substances as a gaseous attunement. Your attunement to fog is equal to the lower of levels between your attunements to water and air. Fog cannot be seen through.

**Destiny Level:**  
The fog you create is incredibly thick, and hangs heavy in the air. It takes 1 hour to dissipate instead of 1 minute, and mutes the sounds within it, granting A3 on all stealth checks to remain quiet while navigating within the fog.

### Inanimate Object
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may transform into any generic object that would fit in a space somewhere between a 1 inch cube and a 10 foot cube. You remain sentient but cannot move. You can sense your surroundings in a 5 foot radius. The transformation lasts for one hour, or until you spend your action to transform back into your natural form.

**Destiny Level:**  
There is no limit to the duration you can remain transformed.

### Inspiring Presence
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._


Your natural leadership and encouragement elevate those around you to perform beyond their normal capabilities. When you use the help action, the creature you're helping may use your presence die instead of their heart die when making the skill check, in addition to gaining advantage.

Additionally, when you help someone who is already being helped by another creature, your assistance grants them an additional level of advantage beyond the normal cap of one.

**Destiny Level:**
You can help multiple creatures with a single action. When you take the help action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see and hear you. All chosen creatures gain the benefits of your help for their next applicable roll.

### Keen Eye
_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._

When you make a perception check, you may declare one thing that is unusual but nearly unnoticeable about the current scene. It must be an addition to the scene, not a change to what's already happening. The GM may then declare one additional thing, modifying your stated fact.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may add one detail to whatever thing you notice.

### Let it Go
_Major ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Void._

As an action, you may touch an inanimate object that could fit inside a 30-foot cube. The object permanently disappears. There must be no sentient creatures contained inside the object.

**Destiny Level:**  
The object must fit inside a 100-foot cube instead.

### Lucky
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

If you have no applicable bonuses to a skill check and you do not have advantage already, you may choose to gain advantage on the roll. You cannot get further bonuses to the roll.

**Destiny Level:**  
You have A2 on all of those rolls. You gain your choice of permanent physical or permanent mental vulnerability.

### Mad Inventor
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._


Your unorthodox methods allow you to push beyond normal crafting limits. When inventing items, you may use components that are one level lower than normally required. However, all items crafted this way are automatically unstable (as per the unstable creation rules) with maximum starting instability points.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use components that are up to two levels lower than required. When you do this, the item is "very unstable". Very unstable items cannot be stabilized. When instability triggers, a 6 triggers a random, one-time minor benefit instead of stabilizing.

### Master of Espionage
_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._

Whether it be heists, spying, or sabotage, you are accomplished in the ways of espionage. You may declare an object as the target of your espionage. If you spend one day gathering knowledge about the security around your target, you have advantage on all rolls related to accessing that object, and then escaping thereafter.  
If you spend one week gathering knowledge about your target, you may make an "educated guess" about the security around your target. The GM will confirm or deny your educated guess with a simple "yes" or "no".

**Destiny Level:**  
Before you perform your act of espionage, you may choose to lay out a detailed plan. You must describe your plan to the GM. While you execute your espionage, so long as everything goes as planned, you may choose to replace any roll made during the heist with the maximum of your relevant ability die. These benefits do not extend to contingency plans, nor to tasks that were not clearly specified in the plan.

### Medic
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

You have advantage when making cunning checks to treat wounds or perform first aid.

**Destiny Level:**  
You have A3 instead.

### Memories Fading

You may replace up to one minute's worth of memories made by that creature from the last ten minutes with whatever memories you wish. You gain 3 levels of dazed until you take a long rest. They are unaware of any magic occurring.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may instead replace one hour's worth of memories from the last day.

### Merchant's Luck

_Major ability. Handmagic._

Fortune favors the bold in business. When making any roll related to trading, buying, selling, or negotiating prices, you may immediately reroll all dice showing results of 3 or lower. You must keep the new results. This includes rolls for finding buyers/sellers, determining trader levels, negotiating prices, or avoiding trade-related complications.

**Destiny Level:**
This ability becomes a passive ability instead. Additionally, when you roll the maximum value on any die during a trade-related roll, you may roll that die again and add the result.

### Metallurgy
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Earth._  

Add iron and steel to your resonate substances as a basic solid attunement.  
Whenever you are hit with a melee weapon made of iron or steel, you may catch the blade in your hand, warping and bending it in your grip. Do not roll a defense roll—you take the full damage—but the weapon is rendered useless, and cannot be used again.

**Destiny Level:**  
If you have a paragon attunement to earth, you gain an advanced attunement to iron and steel.

### Misty Illusions
_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._  

You can manipulate the water in the air to create realistic illusions. Add mist to your resonate substances as a liquid attunement.  
As an action, you may make an illusion of a single object within the range of your mist manipulation. The illusion cannot be seen through, and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion until they have interacted with it in some way, at which point the illusion fades from their sight. Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of another object, though they appear as three-dimensional objects, so they cannot be illusions of darkness, empty space, or your immediate surroundings.  
If a creature has reason to suspect it is an illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or disappears, they may make a cunning check contested by your cunning challenge number. On a success, they see through the illusion.

**Destiny Level:**  
By agitating the molecules in the air, you can also cause the illusion to emit realistic sounds of your choice. You may manipulate the image and sounds as an object interaction.

### Nature's Child
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

You can sense basic intentions and communicate simple ideas with wild animals. When you take this talent, you may choose to limit this ability to only one type of animal, such as ravens, spiders, or wolves. If you do, those creatures will never attack you and you have A3 on all interactions with those creatures.

**Destiny Level:**  
As an action, you can summon forth wild animals in a mile radius. If you have chosen a specific animal, you gain exclusively that animal instead.

### Necromancy
_Major ability. Handmagic._

You can raise the dead. By sacrificing a creature, you can reanimate another creature of the same type. The ritual takes one hour, and at the end you have a creature with stats identical to the dead creature, with the same might die, d2 cunning, agility, and presence dice, half of the hit point maximum, and no ability to communicate. It loses any special combat abilities it had, and obeys any orders you give it to the best of its ability. You can have no more than one undead creature under your control.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may create and control up to three undead servants with this talent.

### Observant
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

You have A4 on cunning checks to notice things.  
In addition, so long as you can see someone's lips and understand the language they are speaking, you know what they are saying, even if you can't hear them.

**Destiny Level:**  
Hidden attackers cannot make opportunity attacks against you, you do not suffer any penalty from attacking an obscured enemy, and obscured enemies gain no advantage when attacking you.  
In addition, if you spend your action watching a creature fight for three rounds or more, you learn the creature's strengths and weaknesses, and have advantage on all A/D rolls made against that creature.

### Oracle
_Monthly ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may choose a creature other than yourself. That creature's next roll is replaced with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a complication occurs. At any time, the GM may replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum possible result. It cannot be rerolled or replaced. The GM may not do so again until you use this ability again.

**Destiny Level:**  
This no longer takes an action.

### Pinky Swear
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

While the smallest finger of your hand is interlocked with the smallest finger of another person's hand, neither you nor that person can knowingly utter a lie.

**Destiny Level:**  
While your fingers are intertwined, both people are compelled to speak truthfully. They cannot withhold information.

### Poisoner
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

So long as you can disguise it as another action, you automatically succeed on any check to slip poison into someone's food or drink, even while in plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they will not notice there is poison in their food, only that they will not realize that you are poisoning the food as you do it.  
For every 10 times you digest a single type of poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it, and take 10 damage less from every instance of damage it deals.

**Destiny Level:**  
You know your poisons. You immediately know if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as well as all of its properties.

### Rapid Growth
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may place your hand on a non-living object that fits in a space somewhere between a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows to fill a 10-foot cube, or shrinks to fit a 2-inch cube, though it will not grow if it is enclosed. The transformation lasts for one hour, or until dismissed as an action.

**Destiny Level:**  
The transformation lasts indefinitely, though you may not use this ability on more than three different objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases to a 25-foot cube.

### Rejection

_Major ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Force._

Choose any two objects. Those objects repulse each other with 50 pounds of force if they are within 10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you choose two new objects.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may choose up to 5 objects, and the repulsive force begins at 100 feet away.

### Rope Servant
_Passive ability. Handmagic._  

If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were an extension of your arm, including floating straight up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a weapon. The control persists only while you hold the rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

**Destiny Level:**  
The rope becomes unbreakably strong while being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.

### Runescribe
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or a similar aspect, you may now begin making handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you can memorize that sign and tattoo hands with that sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and titan bone, which equates to about half the price of getting a new handmagic sign.

**Destiny Level:**  
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or a similar aspect, you may make the additional modifications to a handmagic sign to make its destiny level upgrade. You must spend a week studying and practicing before memorizing and inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.

### Salvage Master

_Major ability. Cognitive talent._

The effect lasts twelve hours rather than one. The person does not realize they were charmed when the effect ends.

### Siren's Song
_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are enthralled with your performance, and struggle to pull their gaze away.

The GM will do their best to answer your question.

### The Spider
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

You have a network of spies and informants at your fingertips. Once per day while within a city within the range of your influence, you may meet with your informants to learn what is going on around town. You may ask two unique questions of the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or more, your spies return with answers. The GM answers one of your questions truthfully, and either gives false information about the other, or else doesn't answer it at all. Any information that fewer than 25 people know about cannot be answered by your spy network.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may ask up to three questions, and may ask questions with answers that are known by no fewer than five people. The GM must truthfully answer two of the three questions.

Additionally, while working in a level 4+ workspace, you get +2 on all crafting skill checks. If you own a workspace, you may spend a month customizing it to your techniques; a customized workspace grants +4 instead.

### Worldly Traveler
_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._

You have traveled the world and met many, many people. When you meet someone whom the GM describes as someone you've never met, you may choose to claim some connection to them. If you do, the GM will explain how you recognize them, and the nature of your connection. This connection may be as distant as "you saw them drinking in a bar in a neighboring country", or as close as, "this woman bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister". It is possible there is no feasible connection between you and this person. In this case, you may either regain the use of this ability, or take three destiny points. You cannot use this ability to claim connections with people more influential than yourself.

**Destiny Level:**  
Rather than claim a connection to someone you meet, you may use this ability before actually running into someone. For example, while at a bar in a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM also believes this to be plausible, your connection becomes real (though their location and condition may have changed since the last time you talked with them). If the GM doesn't believe this to be reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.
