# Paragon Abilities

After reaching combat rank 4, further ranks come in the form of paragon levels. Paragon levels are awarded to the group at the GM's discretion, usually as a reward for a feat of incredible triumph. When you gain a paragon level, you may gain an ability from this list.

Paragon levels have tags on them indicating if there are any limitations on which classes can take the paragon level. If your class isn't listed, you can't take the paragon level. Additionally, some paragon levels also have a tag indicating a minimum paragon level you must be at in order to gain the ability. This will take the form “PL: X,” where X is the paragon level you must be at or above.

[[GM Note
Paragon abilities are on a whole different level compared to other abilities. They make a strong character busted. They should only be given out once you are comfortable with your players reaching a heroic tier of play, and should be given out sparingly thereafter.]]
