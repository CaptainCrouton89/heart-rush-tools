# Mounted Combat & Mounts

Mounts provide speed, mobility, and tactical advantages in both travel and combat. From warhorses charging into battle to griffons soaring overhead, mounts expand your tactical options while adding new risks and considerations to combat.

## Basic Mount Rules

These rules cover the fundamentals of riding and controlling mounts, from determining what creatures can serve as mounts to the mechanics of movement and dismounting. Understanding these basics is essential before engaging in mounted combat.

### What Makes a Suitable Mount

For a creature to serve as a mount, it must be at least one size category larger than its rider and either trained to accept riders or controlled through magical means. The creature also needs appropriate anatomy - while horses and camels make natural mounts, a giant serpent would not. The GM has final say on what creatures can serve as mounts.

Common mounts include Large creatures like horses and camels that can carry Medium or smaller riders. Larger creatures expand these options: L2 mounts such as dire bears can carry Large or smaller riders, L3 mounts like elephants can carry L2 or smaller riders, and L4 mounts such as dragons can carry L3 or smaller riders.

### Movement and Control

When you're mounted, you use your mount's movement speed instead of your own, ignoring your personal movement penalties from armor or encumbrance. During each round, your mount typically uses its action to dash, allowing it to move up to twice its speed while leaving your action free for other activities. You automatically move with your mount without requiring any additional movement or actions from you.

Mounts with special movement types grant their riders access to those capabilities. If your mount can fly or swim, you can use those movement modes while mounted, following all the normal rules for those movement types. Difficult terrain affects your mount just as it would affect any creature of its size moving through that terrain.

### Mounting and Dismounting

Mounting or dismounting a creature is treated as an object interaction, which you can perform once per round without using your action. If you're knocked off your mount involuntarily, dismounting doesn't require any action on your part. In dangerous situations, you can use the sidestep action to perform an emergency dismount, safely leaving your mount and moving up to 5 feet to avoid immediate threats.

## Mounted Combat

Combat while mounted adds layers of tactical complexity. Your elevated position provides advantages, but you must also protect your mount from harm while coordinating your attacks.

### Engaging While Mounted

When mounted, you and your mount function as a coordinated unit in combat, though enemies can choose to engage either of you separately. When an enemy initiates an engagement, they must declare whether they're targeting you or your mount. If they target your mount, you are not automatically part of that engagement unless you choose to enter it using your action. Similarly, if they target you, your mount isn't automatically included.

Either you or your mount can initiate an engagement on your turn, but not both, as doing so requires an action. Once in an engagement, both you and your mount participate together if you're both valid targets.

### Stance Resolution for Mounts

During engagements, your mount uses the same stance you choose. This represents your control and coordination with your mount - as you shift your weight and guide the mount, it responds to your combat rhythm. When you choose cunning, your mount acts with cunning. When you choose might, your mount charges with might.

If your mount has natural weapons such as a dragon's bite or an elephant's trunk slam, it can make attacks when its stance (which matches yours) beats the opponent's stance. If your mount lacks natural weapons, it can still be targeted in engagements but cannot make attacks of its own. In situations where your mount is forced into an engagement without you, you still choose its stance even though you're not participating directly.

### Mounted Combat Advantages

Riding a trained mount into battle provides several tactical advantages. When you're mounted on a creature larger than your target, you gain the high ground condition, granting advantage on your attack rolls. This represents the difficulty of defending against attacks from above.

If your mount moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before you make a melee attack, you can deliver a mounted charge. Your devastating momentum adds 1d6 to your melee attack damage as you strike with the full force of your mount's movement behind you.

Your reach with melee weapons extends based on your mount's size. When mounted on a Large creature, you can make melee attacks against targets 5 feet further away than normal. On L2 or larger mounts, this extension increases to 10 feet, allowing you to strike at enemies while remaining out of their immediate reach.

### Targeting and Forced Dismounting

Combat puts both rider and mount at risk. When your mount takes significant damage - 15 or more points from a single attack - the violent impact threatens to throw you from the saddle. You must make an agility saving throw with a CN equal to the damage dealt. On a failure, you're thrown from your mount and land prone in an adjacent space of the attacker's choice.

If your mount falls prone for any reason, you're automatically dismounted and must make a CN 10 agility saving throw. Success means you land on your feet adjacent to your mount; failure means you fall prone as well. If your mount dies while you're riding it, you must make the same saving throw or take 1d6 falling damage in addition to landing prone.

### Controlling Mounts in Battle

The complexity of controlling a mount in combat depends on the mount's intelligence and training. Intelligent mounts with a cunning die of d6 or higher act independently, making their own decisions that may not always align with your wishes. These mounts act on their own initiative and the GM controls their actions, though they generally cooperate with trusted riders.

Trained mounts with lower intelligence act on your initiative and require successful presence checks to perform any action other than movement or dashing. The base CN is 10, but increases by 2 for each wound the mount has taken as pain and fear make it harder to control. If you fail this check by 5 or more, your mount panics and flees in a random direction, using its action to dash away from danger.

Mounts bonded through special training or magical means respond to your commands without requiring checks for basic actions, though the GM may still require checks for particularly dangerous or unusual commands.

## Mount Equipment

Proper equipment is essential for effective mounted combat and travel. A basic saddle is required for anything beyond the shortest rides, providing the necessary stability and control.

| Equipment            | Effect                                            | Slots | Price |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| **Saddle, Basic**    | Required for riding anything but short distances  | 5     | 50d   |
| **Saddle, Military** | +2 to checks to remain mounted                    | 8     | 200d  |
| **Saddle, Exotic**   | Allows riding of unusual mounts (flying, aquatic) | 10    | 500d  |
| **Saddlebags**       | Mount can carry +20 slots                         | 2     | 20d   |
| **Barding, Light**   | Mount gains +2 defense, -5 ft movement            | 6     | 500d  |
| **Barding, Medium**  | Mount gains +4 defense, -10 ft movement           | 12    | 1500d |
| **Barding, Heavy**   | Mount gains +6 defense, -15 ft movement           | 18    | 4000d |

Military saddles provide superior stability in combat, while exotic saddles are specially designed for unusual mounts like griffons or sea serpents. Barding protects your mount in combat but reduces its mobility, following the same rules as armor for characters.

## Mounts Outside Combat

A few additional rules apply to mounts outside of combat.

### Long Distance Travel

While mounts don't significantly increase the distance you can cover in a day - still approximately 24 miles under normal conditions - they provide crucial advantages for long journeys. Riders avoid the exhaustion of walking while being able to carry substantially more equipment. Some mounts provide specific advantages in certain terrain, such as camels requiring half the normal water in desert conditions.

### Mount Care and Maintenance

Mounts require significant resources to maintain. They consume three times the food and water of a humanoid creature their size, requiring 3 rations of food and 3 rations of water daily. Mounts must rest when you rest or begin accumulating exhaustion levels just as characters do. Wounded mounts heal through the same mechanisms as characters - taking long rests and having their wounds treated.

Stabling costs vary by location and quality, typically ranging from 1 ducat per night for basic stables to 5 ducats for premium care including grooming and high-quality feed. In wilderness settings, you must account for grazing time or carry additional feed.

### Social Considerations

Mounts can significantly impact social interactions. Riding a fine horse or exotic mount effectively increases your influence by 1 in appropriate social settings, as such displays of wealth and power command respect. However, some locations prohibit certain mounts - dragons are rarely welcome in civilized cities, and even war horses may be barred from certain peaceful establishments.

The type of mount you ride sends a message. Arriving on a simple riding horse suggests practicality, while arriving on a griffon or nightmare suggests power and possible danger. Consider your mount choice carefully when diplomacy is required.
