# Gameplay Basics

This section describes how general gameplay proceeds in Heart Rush.

## Using Abilities

When creating your character, you will inevitably gain a lot of abilities.

Abilities are any chunk of rules that let you create an effect, perform some activity, or do anything at all.

Examples include class abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels, though some abilities grant you their own abilities.

You can most easily recognize an ability because of the format it has in this book:

**Ability Name**  
_Ability tags._  
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.

All abilities listed in this rulebook have their name, followed by tags (in italics), and then followed by their rules.

For the most part, abilities can be used whenever you want. However, some have restrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very specific, in the ability rules itself.

All tags in an ability are separated by periods. Each tag will contain information about when you can use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for gaining that ability.

While many tags will be explained by whichever section they appear in, there are a few types which can show up on any type of ability. These are listed below.

### Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often it can be used.

An ability can be either passive, minor, heart, major, weekly, or monthly.

This tag is always listed as the first tag.

- **Passive ability**: There are no restrictions on how many times you can use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability, it is assumed to always be active.
- **Minor Ability**: You may use this ability by spending a rush point for each time you have used this ability including this one during the current encounter. You may not use it outside of an encounter.
- **Heart Ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest. If you take a wound, you may use the ability again.
- **Major ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest.
- **Weekly Ability**: You may use this ability once per week.
- **Monthly ability**: You may use this ability once per month.

### Timing Tags

Outside of combat, you can use an ability whenever you want—there are no restrictions besides the ones listed on the ability itself.

However, during combat, timing matters. Every non-passive ability must have one of the following timing tags that determines when you can use it:

- **Slow**: If an ability is marked as slow, it can only be used during your own turn.
- **Quick**: If an ability is marked as quick, it means you can use the ability during any ally's turn (including your own). You cannot use it during enemy turns or during engagements.
- **Instant**: If an ability is marked as instant, it means that the ability can be used literally any time, even when you don't have your turn. This includes interrupting other actions as they're happening and during engagements.

Passive abilities do not have timing tags since they are always active.

**Understanding Timing Tags**

The three timing tags create a hierarchy of flexibility:

**Slow Timing:**

- Must be used on your own turn
- Cannot be used during other creatures' turns
- Cannot be used during engagements
- Most restrictive timing

**Quick Timing:**

- Can be used during any ally's turn (including your own)
- Cannot be used during enemy turns
- Cannot be used during engagements
- Allows tactical coordination with allies

**Instant Timing:**

Instant abilities can be used at literally any moment during the game, even interrupting other actions as they're happening. This creates a true "interrupt system" where you can react to new information as it unfolds.

**Any time means any time:**

- While someone else is taking their action
- After seeing the result of a dice roll (yours or someone else's)
- In response to movement, damage, or any game event
- Even after seeing the consequences of an action

**Common examples:**

- See your attack roll result → boost damage with an instant ability
- Get hit by an attack → instantly use a defensive ability to reduce damage
- Watch an enemy move out of range → react with an instant repositioning ability
- Opponent reveals their stance choice → respond with an instant counter-ability

**During Engagements:**
Instant abilities can interrupt at any point during the engagement sequence:

- After stances are revealed but before attacks
- Between different stance attack resolutions (cunning → agility → might)
- After seeing an attack roll but before damage
- After taking damage but before the engagement ends

**Multiple Instant Abilities:**
When multiple people want to use instant abilities simultaneously, resolve them in "last-in, first-out" order:

- The person who declared their instant ability **last** resolves it **first**
- Then work backwards through who declared when
- This continues until all instant abilities are resolved

You must declare the way in which you are using your ability when you announce that you are using an ability.

## Environmental Rules

These additional rules cover various situations that can arise during gameplay.

The world presents many challenges beyond hostile creatures. These rules help adjudicate how characters interact with their environment.

### Terrain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous environments that all pose their own unique challenges.

#### Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy foliage.

While in difficult terrain, after accounting for other movement penalties, your remaining movement speed is halved.

#### Water

Doing anything while in or under water comes with severe limitations.

While shallow water counts only as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that you move at your swim speed.

Unless you explicitly have a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.

If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement.

If you cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have D5 on all of those rolls instead.

Ranged weapons travel half their distance when fired underwater.

#### Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a might check to determine if you can climb at all.

On a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which unless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.

### Lighting

There are three different states of lighting that can occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and dark.

Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern, and intense fire all produce bright light.

There are no penalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit area.

Dim light can be found in alleyways, twilight, and in all the spaces between bright light and darkness.

Perception and observation skill checks are made with disadvantage for creatures that require light to see.

Darkness is anywhere there is no light.

Unless you have darkvision, you cannot see anything.

### Darkvision

Some creatures have darkvision.

A creature with darkvision can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and can see in darkness as though it were dim light.

### Hiding

If the environment provides suitable places to hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may choose to hide.

This requires more than a single action, and cannot be performed during combat.

When you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill check.

On a success you are hidden, and count as unseen for the purposes of attacking.

While hidden, you may use your action to make an opportunity attack against a creature you are hidden from.

You may still be obscured after you attack, but you do not count as hidden and you cannot make opportunity attacks.

All hidden creatures that wish to make opportunity attacks may use their action to attack before combat begins.

### Size

Creatures range from minuscule to colossal, with significant mechanical differences.

#### Size Categories

| Size      | Spaces Occupied | Per Space | Examples         |
| --------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Minuscule | 0               | 1,000     | Fairy, Sprite    |
| Tiny      | 0               | 10        | Cat, Raven       |
| Small     | 0               | 5         | Halfling, Goblin |
| Medium    | 1               | 1         | Human, Elf       |
| Large     | 1               | 1         | Horse, Owlbear   |
| L2        | 4 (2×2)         | 1         | Young Dragon     |
| L3        | 9 (3×3)         | 1         | Adult Dragon     |
| L4+       | Level²          | 1         | Ancient Dragon   |

#### Size Combat Effects

**Movement Through Spaces:**
One creature can occupy and move through the space of another creature if it is at least two sizes smaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain. While in the same space as a non-hostile creature, you also have one level of cover.

**Weapon Restrictions:**

- Creatures of size small or tiny cannot wield heavy weapons
- Creatures of size tiny cannot wield heavy or light weapons

**Might Stance Push Modifiers:**
Whenever an attacking creature uses the might stance to push a defending creature of a different size, the defending creature may move more or less than the default of 10 feet:

- If the defending creature is smaller than the attacker, the defending creature moves an additional 5 feet for each level of size difference
- If the defending creature is larger than the attacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet for each level of size difference
- This could mean that the defending creature is not pushed at all

**Grappling Size Effects:**
When making grappling checks: If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

While grappling a creature, rather than pushing the creature when you use the might stance, you may choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every size greater you are than the grappled creature.

**Climb On Requirements:**
Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check contested by the creature's might or agility ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature.

**Prone/Knockdown Limits:**
Many combat abilities that knock creatures prone specify "no more than one size larger than you" - creatures significantly larger are too massive to knock down.

**Carrying Capacity**
By default, you can carry slots equal to 6 + half of your might die. If you are size large, it is 6 + your might die instead, and if you are small, then it is 6 + a quarter your might die, rounded down.

### Forced Movement

If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and this movement is interrupted by a wall, another creature that is within two sizes of your own, or a heavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for every 5 feet remaining in your movement.

If this movement is stopped by a creature that is not wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and the total damage is split evenly between the two creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to move.

## Damage & Consequences

There are several sources of damage besides combat.

Characters face many dangers in their adventures. Understanding how damage works and its various sources helps you navigate these threats.

### Combat

Combat is one of the most common ways to lose health.

Check out the Combat section to learn more.

### Hazards & Traps

There will be times when you have to avoid damage from the environment.

For example, being hit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or getting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship.

In these cases, you should make a saving throw, detailed in the Saving Throws section.

On a failure, you will take damage.

### Falling

When falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility saving throw against the height fallen.

If you roll less than the distance fallen, you take the difference as damage.

### Suffocation and Strangulation

There are different effects on one's body depending if you are holding your breath, or getting strangled or suffocated by something else.

When holding your breath, make a might check.

You can hold your breath a number of rounds equal to your result.

Subtract one from the total number of rounds whenever you take an action or move while holding your breath.

After you run out of breath, you take the suffocating condition.

If you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were suddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin suffocating immediately.

### Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across various poisons.

Different poisons have different properties and means of application.

Some may paralyze you, but only if ingested, while others may kill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream, but are otherwise harmless if swallowed.

Some are long lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to weapons and maintain potency for minutes to days, while others can't be applied to weapons at all.

While most poisons will have specific rulings applied to them individually, some general poisoning rules apply to most of them.

Due to the difficulty of properly applying poison, poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.

Each application of the poison uses up one dose of that poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with poison applied to it uses up the poison.

Most poisons can be applied to weapons prior to combat.

The length that the poison remains potent on the weapon will vary from poison to poison, after which the poison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in order to still garner the same effects.

Damage from poison happens after the weapon attack—it is not rolled with the attack dice.

## Experience & Advancement

Over the course of many games, you will gain more and more XP.

With this XP, you can purchase new, interesting features for your character.

Characters grow and develop through experience points (XP), which represent lessons learned, skills honed, and power gained through adventuring.

### Gaining Experience

**GM Note:**
Granting XP equal to players' combat rank is a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading their character every few sessions.

If you want slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this by one, or even two can be okay.

It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players.

They can decide what they want to award XP for, depending on the type of game they want to run.

Common triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing goals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning combats, or just length of session.

Whatever the metric for determining XP, the GM should communicate this to the players.

### Spending Experience

Between sessions, or during sessions so long as you are not in combat, you may spend XP to access new features.

Use the following chart to find the cost of your desired new feature.

| Type                        | XP Cost                          | Effect                                                                                                                   |
