# Gameplay Basics

This section describes how general gameplay proceeds in Heart Rush.

## Core Dice Mechanics

Heart Rush resolves uncertain actions through dice rolls that combine your natural talent, current stamina, and training. Understanding these fundamental mechanics is essential for play.

### Rolling Dice

Heart Rush uses a combination of dice to determine the outcomes of uncertain actions, creating dynamic results that reflect both capability and chance.

### Skill Checks

Whenever you attempt to do something that has a realistic chance of failure, the GM may ask you to roll a skill check to see if you succeed.

#### Basic Procedure

1. **Roll your dice**: Roll your heart die and one ability die (might, agility, cunning, or presence) that corresponds to the activity
2. **Add modifiers**: Add any bonuses from skills, aspects, or other sources
3. **Compare to CN**: If your total equals or exceeds the Challenge Number (CN), you succeed

#### Adding Skill Ranks

If you have a skill that directly applies to the check, add your full skill rank to the roll. For tangentially related applications, add half your rank (rounded down). Only one skill may apply to any given check.

#### Using Aspects for Bonuses

By spending destiny points (DP) up to an aspect's rank, you may add that amount to any skill check where the aspect applies. The aspect must align with the meaning of your roll, as approved by the GM.

**Example**: With "Former city guard captain" at rank 2, you could spend 2 DP to add +2 when persuading town guards, drawing on your shared professional experience.

#### Gaining DP from Negative Aspects

If an aspect would complicate a situation or indicate weakness, you may choose to let it hinder you and gain DP equal to the aspect's rank. This represents your character acting according to their nature, even when disadvantageous.

**Example**: With "Quick to draw my sword" at rank 3, you might gain 3 DP by threatening a shopkeeper who insults you, creating complications but staying true to your character.

### Difficulties

The GM should use the following chart to set the challenge number:

| CN  | Difficulty        | Skill level | Success Chance (percent) |
| --- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 6   | Fairly Easy       | 79%         | 95% / 100%               |
| 9   | Average           | 44%         | 77% / 93%                |
| 12  | Hard              | 13%         | 44% / 74%                |
| 15  | Very Hard         | –           | 16% / 45%                |
| 18  | Nearly Impossible | –           | 2% / 19%                 |
| 21  | Heroic            | –           | –                        |

The percentages in the cells correspond to the chance of success for a typical human at full heart with low (d8+d6), high (d8+d8+2), and very high (d8+d10+4) skill level. Note that players can eventually reach up to d12+d20+10, and that this chart does not account for complications.

### Complications

As your heart leads you through your life and story, there may be times that it stutters. When it does, you may fail at whatever you are doing, or something else may go wrong. This is represented by rolling a 1 on a skill check.

Whenever you make a skill check, if the result on one of the dice is a 1, you must choose to either automatically fail the check, or else you may re-roll that die, using the new result. If you choose the latter, a complication occurs.

A complication does not mean you fail to do what you were trying to do—use the total result after re-rolling your dice to determine that. Instead, something related to the task at hand but not determinate of your success or failure goes wrong. This can be many things, such as breaking your lock picks if you were trying to open a door, or sparking a new line of interrogation if you were trying to smooth talk your way past guards.

If you roll additional 1s they do not cause complications.

If you roll two 1s as your first roll, you fail the check, and there is a complication.

#### Examples of Complications

**When climbing:** You reach the top, but your rope frays and won't support another person safely.

**When gathering information:** You learn what you wanted, but someone notices you asking questions and becomes suspicious.

**When foraging for food:** You find enough food for the day, but you catch the attention of a large predator.

**When sneaking:** You get past undetected, but you accidentally leave muddy footprints that could be followed.

**When persuading:** They agree to help you, but they expect a favor in return that you hadn't planned on.

**When picking a lock:** You successfully open the lock, but your tools break in the process and can't be used again.

#### Guidelines for GMs

Good complications should feel like natural consequences that move the story forward. They create new problems to solve rather than simply undoing the player's success. When in doubt, think about what secondary effects the character's actions might have on their equipment, the environment, or nearby people.

## Types of Rolls

Heart Rush uses different types of rolls for different situations. Each serves a specific purpose and has unique mechanics that distinguish it from the others.

### Skill Checks

Used whenever you attempt something with a realistic chance of failure. See Core Dice Mechanics above for full details.

### Saving Throws

Whenever you have to roll to avoid or mitigate the effects of someone else's action, such as dodging a falling boulder or withstanding a powerful venom, make a saving throw.

Saving throws are identical to skill checks, except they do not provoke complications. Instead, rolling equal to or over the challenge number implies you avoid the negative effect, and rolling under implies suffering the negative effect.

When the effect was created by another creature, they are usually made against that creature's ability challenge number. If it was an effect from the environment, the CN will be determined by the GM.

### Attack & Defense Rolls

Attack and defense rolls, or A/D rolls, are made whenever you roll to deal or negate damage in an engagement or opportunity attack.

Roll the relevant ability die, your heart die, and add any necessary modifiers.

A/D rolls are explained in greater detail in the Combat section.

### Stratagem Rolls

When undertaking complex endeavors that involve multiple coordinated actions over time—from minutes-long chases to years-long empire building—you use stratagem rolls. This is a summary of the basic mechanics.

**Basic Mechanics:**

- Roll d8 + ability die + skill + aspect (if applicable)
- Uses a flat d8 instead of heart die (unaffected by stamina)
- Cannot be helped or use other skill check modifiers
- Compare against standard CNs (9/12/15/18)

**When to Use:**

- Naval battles or chases
- Sieges or large-scale warfare
- Trade wars or economic campaigns
- Political intrigue spanning weeks
- Any multi-part endeavor with meaningful opposition

**Quick Overview:**

- **Positional objectives**: One success changes the situation (e.g., "reach cannon range")
- **Accumulation objectives**: Multiple successes needed (e.g., "sink their ship" requires 3 successes)

Complete stratagem rules are detailed later in this section and expanded fully in the Stratagem System section.

### Group Rolls

Sometimes, everyone in a group will need to make the same check, or will want to help on the same check.

For example, working together to break down a door, sneaking past some guards, or persuading a judge could all be group rolls.

Rolls are calculated differently, depending on the exact type of task.

If everyone is making a check where the group is only as strong as the weakest link, such as sneaking past guards as a group, only one person rolls.

Find the person in the group who is the worst at making this roll, and they make the roll for the group with advantage.

It is assumed that everyone else will succeed, but if this person fails, everyone else may fail as well.

However, if it is a task where people work together, such as when everyone works together to convince someone of the truth, then only the person best at the task has to roll, and they may roll with advantage.

## Modifying Rolls

Various factors can influence your dice rolls, representing circumstances, assistance, training, and personal traits that make success more or less likely.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Advantage and disadvantage give you bonuses or penalties to a roll.

For each instance of advantage you have on a roll, roll an additional instance of the lowest of the dice, and then remove the lowest result when calculating the total.

When rolling with disadvantage, instead roll an additional instance of the highest of the dice, and then remove the highest result from the dice you rolled.

Advantage and disadvantage cancel out, and multiple instances of either one can stack.

Multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage are referred to as Ax or Dx, where 'x' indicates the number of instances.

When determining the outcome with advantage or disadvantage, treat the final result as if only the dice that were kept were rolled.

For instance, if you have an ability that activates when a specific number is rolled, disregard the results from the extra dice gained through advantage or disadvantage, and consider only the results of the retained dice.

**Example:**
You are trying to lift a heavy portcullis. Due to various elements at play, you have three sources of advantage, and one source of disadvantage. Your might die is a d6, and your heart die is a d8.

When you make the roll, you would roll with 2 levels of advantage—1d8 and 3d6.

Let's say you get a 3, 6, 5, and 1, respectively. The final result would be 11 (6 + 5).

### Skills

When you have training in a relevant skill:

- **Direct application**: Add your full skill rank to the roll
- **Tangential application**: Add half your skill rank (rounded down)
- Only one skill may apply to any given check

### Aspects

Aspects can modify rolls in two ways:

**Positive invocation**: Spend DP up to the aspect's rank to add that amount to your roll

- The aspect must clearly apply to the situation
- Requires GM approval
- Use only the highest-ranking applicable aspect

**Negative invocation**: Accept a penalty or complication to gain DP equal to the aspect's rank

- You must roleplay the aspect causing problems
- Creates narrative complications
- Can gain up to 5 DP per scene from negative invocations

### Helping

When someone wishes to assist another person with a skill check, they can choose to help.

If you are in combat, this requires your action.

Helping grants the person making the check advantage, so long as you reasonably could provide help in that situation.

Being helped multiple times does not grant additional levels of advantage.

If you help someone, you are both liable to suffer any consequences from any complications or failures.

### Raising the Stakes

Whenever you or another player makes a skill check, but before the dice are rolled, you may choose to raise the stakes.

When you raise the stakes, you increase the effectiveness of a success, and increase how disastrous the complication or failure is on a fail.

You may do this once per session, on any roll that any player makes.

## Determining Challenge Numbers

### Standard Difficulties

Use the difficulty table in Core Dice Mechanics for most skill checks and saving throws:

- **CN 6**: Fairly Easy
- **CN 9**: Average
- **CN 12**: Hard
- **CN 15**: Very Hard
- **CN 18**: Nearly Impossible
- **CN 21**: Heroic

### Ability Challenge Number

When another creature is avoiding an effect that you have caused, the GM may have them roll a saving throw.

The CN for this roll is equal to the maximum of your most applicable ability die, plus two times your paragon level (which starts at zero).

This number is generically called your ability challenge number, though more specifically, you would have might, agility, cunning, presence, and even heart challenge numbers.

Use whichever ability is most relevant for the roll, or if no ability die fits—such as the case with magical effects—use your heart challenge number—the maximum of your heart die instead.

### Stratagem CNs

Stratagem CNs use the same scale as skill checks, with difficulty based on assets and hindrances:

- **CN 9**: Easy - Significant advantages or weak opposition
- **CN 12**: Moderate - Balanced forces or standard difficulty
- **CN 15**: Hard - Strong opposition or significant obstacles
- **CN 18**: Extreme - Overwhelming odds or near-impossible circumstances

The GM evaluates your assets (advantages) against your hindrances (disadvantages) to set the final CN.

## Stratagems in Detail

Stratagems handle complex endeavors requiring multiple coordinated actions over time. They scale from tactical encounters to grand campaigns. This section provides an overview of the core concepts—see the Stratagem System section for complete rules, examples, and guidance.

### When Stratagems Apply

Use stratagems for:

- **Naval encounters**: Chases, battles, boarding actions
- **Sieges**: Surrounding fortresses, starving defenders, breaching walls
- **Large battles**: Army movements, flanking maneuvers, routing enemies
- **Economic warfare**: Trade monopolies, market manipulation, guild conflicts
- **Political campaigns**: Building influence, converting populations, diplomatic missions
- **Any complex multi-part endeavor** with meaningful opposition

**Key Differences from Skill Checks:**

- Use a flat d8 (unaffected by fatigue/wounds)
- Cannot be helped by others
- Represent coordinated group efforts over time
- Success often creates lasting assets or changes

### Running Stratagems

Each stratagem follows this action cycle:

1. **Define the Stratagem**

   - Objective (positional or accumulation)
   - Opposition and pace
   - Parent stratagem (if nested)

2. **The Action Cycle**

   - **Situation**: Current circumstances
   - **Approach**: How you're attempting the objective
   - **Stakes**: GM sets CN based on assets/hindrances
   - **Intervention**: Direct actions can modify CN dramatically
   - **Roll**: d8 + ability die + skill + aspect (if applicable) vs CN
   - **Resolution**: Success, failure, or complications

3. **Resolution**
   - **Success**: Progress toward or achieve objective
   - **Failure**: Setbacks, new hindrances, or altered situation
   - **Complications** (1 on any die): Zoom in to handle immediate crisis

### Positional vs Accumulation Objectives

**Positional Objectives** (one success to achieve):

- "Close to boarding range"
- "Breach the outer wall"
- "Establish trade route"
- Success fundamentally changes the tactical situation

**Accumulation Objectives** (multiple successes needed):

- "Sink their ship" (3 successes)
- "Rout their army" (5 successes)
- "Convert the population" (7 successes)
- Progress persists even through failures
- Each success brings you closer to the goal

### Nesting Stratagems

Stratagems naturally nest within each other:

**Example**: "Become Pirate King" (grand stratagem)

- Requires "Build Fearsome Reputation" (strategic stratagem)
- Which requires "Capture Merchant Galleon" (tactical stratagem)
- Which requires "Naval Battle" (immediate stratagem)

Each completed child stratagem typically creates assets for its parent.

### Direct Intervention

Players can take direct actions to influence stratagem CNs:

**Helpful interventions** (reduce CN):

- Kill enemy captain: -6 to ship battle CN
- Sabotage water supply: -3 to siege CN
- Seduce enemy general: -6 to battle CN

**Harmful complications** (increase CN):

- Botched assassination: +3 CN, "High alert" hindrance
- Insulting diplomacy: +3 CN, "Diplomatic incident"
- Captured while scouting: Lose "Element of surprise" asset

### Transitioning Between Systems

**Complications**: When you roll a 1 during a stratagem, zoom in to regular gameplay to handle the immediate crisis.

**Scale appropriately**:

- Personal combat: Use normal combat rules
- Fleet battles: Use stratagems for overall battle, zoom to combat for boarding
- Trade wars: Use stratagems for market control, zoom to roleplay for negotiations

For complete stratagem rules including detailed examples, GM guidance, and advanced concepts, see the Stratagem System section.

## Using Abilities

When creating your character, you will inevitably gain a lot of abilities.

Abilities are any chunk of rules that let you create an effect, perform some activity, or do anything at all.

Examples include class abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels, though some abilities grant you their own abilities.

You can most easily recognize an ability because of the format it has in this book:

**Ability Name**  
_Ability tags._  
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.

All abilities listed in this rulebook have their name, followed by tags, and then followed by their rules.

For the most part, abilities can be used whenever you want. However, some have restrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very specific, in the ability rules itself.

All tags in an ability are separated by periods. Each tag will contain information about when you can use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for gaining that ability.

While many tags will be explained by whichever section they appear in, there are a few types which can show up on any type of ability. These are listed below.

### Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often it can be used.

An ability can be either passive, minor, heart, major, weekly, or monthly.

This tag is always listed as the first tag.

- **Passive ability**: There are no restrictions on how many times you can use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability, it is assumed to always be active.
- **Minor Ability**: You may use this ability by spending a rush point for each time you have used this ability including this one during the current encounter. You may not use it outside of an encounter.
- **Heart Ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest. If you take a wound, you may use the ability again.
- **Major ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest.
- **Weekly Ability**: You may use this ability once per week.
- **Monthly ability**: You may use this ability once per month.

### Timing Tags

Outside of combat, you can use an ability whenever you want—there are no restrictions besides the ones listed on the ability itself.

However, during combat, timing matters. Every non-passive ability must have one of the following timing tags that determines when you can use it:

- **Slow**: If an ability is marked as slow, it can only be used during your own turn.
- **Quick**: If an ability is marked as quick, it means you can use the ability during any ally's turn (including your own). You cannot use it during enemy turns or during engagements.
- **Instant**: If an ability is marked as instant, it means that the ability can be used literally any time, even when you don't have your turn. This includes interrupting other actions as they're happening and during engagements.

Passive abilities are always on, so do not have a dedicated timing tag.

**Understanding Timing Tags**

The three timing tags create a hierarchy of flexibility:

**Slow Timing:**

- Must be used on your own turn
- Cannot be used during other creatures' turns
- Cannot be used during engagements
- Most restrictive timing

**Quick Timing:**

- Can be used during any ally's turn (including your own)
- Cannot be used during enemy turns
- Cannot be used during engagements
- Allows tactical coordination with allies

**Instant Timing:**

Instant abilities can be used at literally any moment during the game, even interrupting other actions as they're happening. This creates a true "interrupt system" where you can react to new information as it unfolds.

**Any time means any time:**

- While someone else is taking their action
- After seeing the result of a dice roll (yours or someone else's)
- In response to movement, damage, or any game event
- Even after seeing the consequences of an action

**Common examples:**

- See your attack roll result → boost damage with an instant ability
- Get hit by an attack → instantly use a defensive ability to reduce damage
- Watch an enemy move out of range → react with an instant repositioning ability
- Opponent reveals their stance choice → respond with an instant counter-ability

**During Engagements:**
Instant abilities can interrupt at any point during the engagement sequence:

- After stances are revealed but before attacks
- Between different stance attack resolutions (cunning → agility → might)
- After seeing an attack roll but before damage
- After taking damage but before the engagement ends

**Multiple Instant Abilities:**
When multiple people want to use instant abilities simultaneously, resolve them in "last-in, first-out" order:

- The person who declared their instant ability **last** resolves it **first**
- Then work backwards through who declared when
- This continues until all instant abilities are resolved

You must declare the way in which you are using your ability when you announce that you are using an ability.

### Action Tag

During each round of combat, you only have one action.

By default, abilities don't use your action unless they have the full action tag.

- **Full action**: If an ability is marked as full action, it means that the ability uses your action. If you don't have an action left during this round, you cannot use the ability.

**Special Case:** Some abilities are marked as both "Full action" and "Instant". These abilities still use your one action per round, but can be performed at any time (not just on your turn). For example, making an opportunity attack uses your action but can be done instantly when triggered.

## Environmental Rules

These additional rules cover various situations that can arise during gameplay.

The world presents many challenges beyond hostile creatures. These rules help adjudicate how characters interact with their environment.

### Terrain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous environments that all pose their own unique challenges.

#### Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy foliage.

While in difficult terrain, after accounting for other movement penalties, your remaining movement speed is halved.

#### Water

Doing anything while in or under water comes with severe limitations.

While shallow water counts only as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that you move at your swim speed.

Unless you explicitly have a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.

If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement.

If you cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have D5 on all of those rolls instead.

Ranged weapons travel half their distance when fired underwater.

#### Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a might check to determine if you can climb at all.

On a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which unless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.

### Lighting

There are three different states of lighting that can occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and dark.

Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern, and intense fire all produce bright light.

There are no penalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit area.

Dim light can be found in alleyways, twilight, and in all the spaces between bright light and darkness.

Perception and observation skill checks are made with disadvantage for creatures that require light to see.

Darkness is anywhere there is no light.

Unless you have darkvision, you cannot see anything.

### Darkvision

Some creatures have darkvision.

A creature with darkvision can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and can see in darkness as though it were dim light.

### Hiding

If the environment provides suitable places to hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may choose to hide.

This requires more than a single action, and cannot be performed during combat.

When you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill check.

On a success you are hidden, and count as unseen for the purposes of attacking.

While hidden, you may use your action to make an opportunity attack against a creature you are hidden from.

You may still be obscured after you attack, but you do not count as hidden and you cannot make opportunity attacks.

All hidden creatures that wish to make opportunity attacks may use their action to attack before combat begins.

### Size

Creatures range from minuscule to colossal, with significant mechanical differences.

#### Size Categories

| Size      | Spaces Occupied | Per Space | Examples         |
| --------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Minuscule | 0               | 1,000     | Fairy, Sprite    |
| Tiny      | 0               | 10        | Cat, Raven       |
| Small     | 0               | 5         | Halfling, Goblin |
| Medium    | 1               | 1         | Human, Elf       |
| Large     | 1               | 1         | Horse, Owlbear   |
| L2        | 4 (2×2)         | 1         | Young Dragon     |
| L3        | 9 (3×3)         | 1         | Adult Dragon     |
| L4+       | Level²          | 1         | Ancient Dragon   |

#### Size Combat Effects

**Movement Through Spaces:**
One creature can occupy and move through the space of another creature if it is at least two sizes smaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain. While in the same space as a non-hostile creature, you also have one level of cover.

**Weapon Restrictions:**

- Creatures of size small or tiny cannot wield heavy weapons
- Creatures of size tiny cannot wield heavy or light weapons

**Might Stance Push Modifiers:**
Whenever an attacking creature uses the might stance to push a defending creature of a different size, the defending creature may move more or less than the default of 10 feet:

- If the defending creature is smaller than the attacker, the defending creature moves an additional 5 feet for each level of size difference
- If the defending creature is larger than the attacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet for each level of size difference
- This could mean that the defending creature is not pushed at all

**Grappling Size Effects:**
When making grappling checks: If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

While grappling a creature, rather than pushing the creature when you use the might stance, you may choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every size greater you are than the grappled creature.

**Climb On Requirements:**
Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check contested by the creature's might or agility ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature.

**Prone/Knockdown Limits:**
Many combat abilities that knock creatures prone specify "no more than one size larger than you" - creatures significantly larger are too massive to knock down.

**Carrying Capacity**
By default, you can carry slots equal to 6 + half of your might die. If you are size large, it is 6 + your might die instead, and if you are small, then it is 6 + a quarter your might die, rounded down.

### Forced Movement

If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and this movement is interrupted by a wall, another creature that is within two sizes of your own, or a heavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for every 5 feet remaining in your movement.

If this movement is stopped by a creature that is not wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and the total damage is split evenly between the two creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to move.

## Damage & Consequences

There are several sources of damage besides combat.

Characters face many dangers in their adventures. Understanding how damage works and its various sources helps you navigate these threats.

### Combat

Combat is one of the most common ways to lose health.

Check out the Combat section to learn more.

### Hazards & Traps

There will be times when you have to avoid damage from the environment.

For example, being hit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or getting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship.

In these cases, you should make a saving throw, detailed in the Saving Throws section.

On a failure, you will take damage.

### Falling

When falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility saving throw against the height fallen.

If you roll less than the distance fallen, you take the difference as damage.

### Suffocation and Strangulation

There are different effects on one's body depending if you are holding your breath, or getting strangled or suffocated by something else.

When holding your breath, make a might check.

You can hold your breath a number of rounds equal to your result.

Subtract one from the total number of rounds whenever you take an action or move while holding your breath.

After you run out of breath, you take the suffocating condition.

If you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were suddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin suffocating immediately.

### Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across various poisons.

Different poisons have different properties and means of application.

Some may paralyze you, but only if ingested, while others may kill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream, but are otherwise harmless if swallowed.

Some are long lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to weapons and maintain potency for minutes to days, while others can't be applied to weapons at all.

While most poisons will have specific rulings applied to them individually, some general poisoning rules apply to most of them.

Due to the difficulty of properly applying poison, poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.

Each application of the poison uses up one dose of that poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with poison applied to it uses up the poison.

Most poisons can be applied to weapons prior to combat.

The length that the poison remains potent on the weapon will vary from poison to poison, after which the poison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in order to still garner the same effects.

Damage from poison happens after the weapon attack—it is not rolled with the attack dice.

## Experience & Advancement

Over the course of many games, you will gain more and more XP.

With this XP, you can purchase new, interesting features for your character.

Characters grow and develop through experience points (XP), which represent lessons learned, skills honed, and power gained through adventuring.

### Gaining Experience

**GM Note:**
Granting XP equal to players' combat rank is a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading their character every few sessions.

If you want slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this by one, or even two can be okay.

It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players.

They can decide what they want to award XP for, depending on the type of game they want to run.

Common triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing goals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning combats, or just length of session.

Whatever the metric for determining XP, the GM should communicate this to the players.

### Spending Experience

Between sessions, or during sessions so long as you are not in combat, you may spend XP to access new features.

Use the following chart to find the cost of your desired new feature.

| Type                        | XP Cost                          | Effect                                                                                                                   |
