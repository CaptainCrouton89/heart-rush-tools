# Wealth System

As your fortune grows in Heart Rush, so does your perspective on money. What once seemed like careful budgeting becomes loose change rattling in your purse. This system naturally reduces bookkeeping as characters accumulate wealth, letting you focus on adventure rather than accounting.

## Currency

The world uses five tiers of currency, each worth ten times the previous:

| Currency   | Value (in iron) | Common Uses                                           |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Iron piece | 1               | Street food, candles, simple supplies                 |
| Obol       | 10              | Day's wages, basic equipment, cheap lodging           |
| Lire       | 100             | Weapons, comfortable accommodations, skilled services |
| Ducat      | 1,000           | Warhorses, masterwork items, property                 |
| Crown      | 10,000          | Ships, castles, armies                                |

### Quick Conversion

- 10 iron = 1 obol
- 10 obol = 1 lire
- 10 lire = 1 ducat
- 10 ducats = 1 crown

## The Wealth Threshold

**Core Rule: Once you possess any amount of a currency, you stop tracking purchases made in currencies two or more tiers below it.**

This means:

- Have any **lire**? Stop tracking iron purchases
- Have any **ducat**? Stop tracking iron and obol purchases
- Have any **crown**? Stop tracking iron, obol, and lire purchases

You always track purchases in your highest currency and the one directly below it.

### Examples

[[**Example**

Jasper has 47 iron and 3 obol:

- Tracks all iron and obol purchases
- Buying 2-iron meal? Now has 45 iron and 3 obol]]

[[**Example**

Mira has 2 ducats and 15 lire:

- Ignores all iron and obol purchases
- Tracks only lire and ducat expenses
- Staying at a 2-lire inn? Now has 13 lire
- Buying a torch (1 iron)? Doesn't track it]]

[[**Example**

Lord Blackwood has 5 crowns, 23 ducats:

- Ignores all iron, obol, and lire purchases
- Tracks only ducat and crown expenses
- Hiring mercenaries for 3 crowns? Now has 2 crowns]]

## Converting Currency

Convert smaller denominations to larger ones whenever convenient:

- When you accumulate 100+ of any currency, consider converting
- Always round down when converting up
- Track only what matters for your wealth level

[[**Example**

A merchant with 347 iron pieces would typically convert to 34 obol (plus 7 iron). But if they already have any lire, they'd ignore the iron entirely and just track 34 obol.]]

## Starting Wealth

Work with your GM to determine starting wealth based on your character concept:

| Background  | Typical Starting Wealth |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Destitute   | 10-50 iron              |
| Common      | 5-20 obol               |
| Comfortable | 5-20 lire               |
| Prosperous  | 5-20 ducats             |
| Noble       | 2-10 crowns             |

## Typical Prices

## Group Finances

Adventuring parties can handle wealth in two ways:

**Individual Tracking**: Each character manages their own money and purchases. Use each character's personal wealth threshold.

**Party Fund**: Pool resources into shared wealth. Use the wealth threshold based on the party's combined highest currency.

[[**Example**

If the party fund contains 3 ducats, the group ignores all iron and obol expenses, regardless of individual member wealth.]]

## Treasure and Rewards

When finding treasure or receiving payment:

- Loot lists specific amounts and denominations
- Convert to appropriate currencies based on total value
- Distribute according to party agreement

[[**Example**

Finding a chest with 2,450 iron pieces:

- Could be tracked as 245 obol
- Or as 24 lire and 5 obol
- Or simply as 24 lire (if you already have ducats)]]
