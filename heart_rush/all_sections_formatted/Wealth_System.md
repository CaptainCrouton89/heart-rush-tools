# How To Play

Heart Rush is a collaborative storytelling game where you and your friends create epic adventures together. One player takes the role of Game Master (GM), guiding the world and its inhabitants, while the other players portray heroes navigating that world. This section explains how gameplay flows and what to expect at the table.

## The Flow of Play

Every game of Heart Rush unfolds through natural conversation and shared imagination. There's no board to constrain you, no predetermined path to follow—just a world of possibilities shaped by your choices and the roll of dice. Understanding this flow helps you engage confidently with the game's rhythm.

### The Conversation

At its core, Heart Rush is a conversation. The GM describes situations, you describe your character's actions, and together you discover what happens next. This back-and-forth creates the story.

**The Basic Loop**:

1. GM describes the situation
2. Players ask questions and declare actions
3. If the outcome is uncertain, dice determine results
4. GM narrates consequences
5. The cycle continues

Most of your time will be spent in this conversational flow, with dice appearing only when actions have meaningful risk and consequence.

## Scales of Play

One of Heart Rush's strengths is its ability to shift focus like a camera lens—zooming in for intense personal moments, pulling back to montage through traveling sequences, or taking a bird's eye view of grand strategic endeavors. The game naturally flows between these different scales based on what's most interesting in the moment.

### Zoomed In: Moment to Moment

**Default mode of play**. You experience the world through your character's eyes, making decisions as events unfold in real time.

- **Exploration**: Investigating ancient ruins room by room
- **Social Encounters**: Negotiating with the merchant guild representative
- **Combat**: Trading blows with bandits on a narrow bridge
- **Problem Solving**: Figuring out how to cross a raging river

When zoomed in, every choice matters. You decide exactly what your character says, where they move, what they examine. Time moves naturally—a five-minute conversation takes about five minutes to play out.

### Montage: Compressed Time

**For routine or extended activities**. When the journey matters more than each individual step, play shifts to montage mode.

- **Travel**: "After three days following the river, you reach the forest's edge..."
- **Downtime**: "You spend the week crafting potions and gathering rumors..."
- **Recovery**: "Over the next few days, your wounds heal as you rest at the inn..."

During montages, you still make meaningful choices ("Do we take the mountain pass or the longer valley route?"), but mundane details fade into the background. See the **Journeys** section for structured travel rules.

### Stratagems: Grand Endeavors

**For complex, coordinated efforts**. When you pursue goals requiring organization, planning, or management from afar, the game uses stratagems.

- **Leading Organizations**: Your trading company establishes new routes
- **Military Campaigns**: Commanding your mercenary company in a siege
- **Political Maneuvering**: Building influence in the royal court
- **Long-term Projects**: Researching ancient magic over months

Stratagems let you pursue grand ambitions without getting bogged down in logistics. Each roll represents days, weeks, or even months of effort. See the **Stratagem System** section for complete rules.

## Structure of Sessions

While every gaming group develops its own rhythm, most Heart Rush sessions follow recognizable patterns. Understanding these patterns helps you navigate the game's flow and make the most of your time at the table. Sessions typically last 2-4 hours, though some groups prefer longer or shorter games.

### Beginning a Session

Sessions typically start by reestablishing the situation. The GM might:

- Recap recent events
- Describe your current surroundings
- Present immediate opportunities or challenges
- Ask what you want to pursue

**Your agency matters**. While the GM presents the world, you decide your goals and how to pursue them. There's no predetermined story—only situations and your responses to them.

### During Play

**Follow Your Interests**: Heart Rush thrives on player initiative. See something intriguing? Investigate it. Have a personal goal? Pursue it. The GM will integrate your choices into the unfolding narrative.

**Embrace Uncertainty**: When you attempt something risky or challenging, dice determine the outcome. Success brings triumph, but failure creates new complications and opportunities. Both drive the story forward.

**Share the Spotlight**: In group play, ensure everyone gets chances to contribute. Support each other's moments while pursuing your own goals.

### Scene Transitions

The GM controls pacing by cutting between scenes:

- **Hard Cuts**: "Three days later, you arrive at the fortress..."
- **Soft Transitions**: "As evening falls, where do you make camp?"
- **Cliffhangers**: "As the door swings open, we'll find out what's behind it next session..."

These transitions keep the story moving, skipping unnecessary downtime while preserving meaningful choices.

## Making Decisions

Your choices drive the story in Heart Rush. Every decision—from how you approach a guard to which path you take through the mountains—shapes the narrative. The game provides structured ways to resolve these choices when their outcomes are uncertain, ensuring that both careful planning and bold improvisation have their place.

### When You Act

Describe your intentions clearly. The GM needs to understand:

- What you're trying to accomplish
- How you're attempting it
- What resources or abilities you're using

**Good**: "I want to convince the guard we're merchants. I'll show him our forged trade documents and mention the Baron's recent decree about encouraging commerce."

**Less Helpful**: "I lie to the guard."

### When Dice Appear

The GM calls for dice rolls when:

- Success and failure are both possible
- The outcome is uncertain
- The consequences matter

If your action would obviously succeed or fail, no roll is needed. Dice create tension and surprise, not arbitrary obstacles.

### Types of Challenges

**Skill Checks**: Attempting uncertain actions (see **Dice Mechanics**)

- Climbing the castle wall
- Deciphering ancient text
- Tracking through wilderness

**Saving Throws**: Avoiding imposed effects (see **Dice Mechanics**)

- Dodging falling rocks
- Resisting poison
- Maintaining balance on a ship deck

**Combat**: When violence erupts (see **Combat**)

- Defending against bandits
- Hunting dangerous beasts
- Dueling a rival

**Stratagems**: Managing complex endeavors (see **Stratagem System**)

- Establishing trade routes
- Conducting siege warfare
- Building political influence

## Character Growth

Heroes in Heart Rush don't remain static—they learn, adapt, and grow more capable through their adventures. This growth happens both mechanically (through experience points and new abilities) and narratively (through relationships, reputation, and story developments). The game tracks both forms of advancement, ensuring your character evolves in meaningful ways.

### Experience Through Play

Your character grows by facing challenges and pursuing goals. The GM awards Experience Points (XP) based on your group's preferred style:

- **Milestone-Based**: XP for reaching story goals
- **Session-Based**: XP for consistent play
- **Challenge-Based**: XP for overcoming obstacles
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple methods

### Spending Experience

Between sessions (or during quiet moments), spend XP to develop your character:

- **New Capabilities**: Gain talents, spells, or aspects
- **Improved Abilities**: Increase skills and attributes
- **Enhanced Vitality**: Boost hit points and stamina

See **Experience & Advancement** for costs and options.

### Narrative Development

Beyond mechanical advancement, your character evolves through play:

- Relationships form and change
- Reputations spread
- Goals shift based on experiences
- New aspects emerge from memorable moments

## The Cooperative Experience

Heart Rush isn't a game you win or lose—it's an experience you share. Everyone at the table works together to create compelling stories, even when your characters might be at odds. This cooperative spirit extends beyond just "getting along"; it's about actively building on each other's contributions to create something greater than any individual could imagine alone.

### Player Contributions

You're not just controlling a character—you're helping create a world:

- **Ask Questions**: "What does the temple smell like?" "Does the merchant seem nervous?"
- **Add Details**: "My character nervously adjusts their sword belt"
- **Build Connections**: Reference other characters' backgrounds and goals
- **Embrace Consequences**: Let failures create interesting new directions

### Working with the GM

The GM isn't your adversary—they're your partner in creating memorable stories:

- They present challenges to make your successes meaningful
- They build on your ideas and interests
- They maintain world consistency while embracing surprises
- They share narrative control through your choices

### Table Dynamics

**Respectful Play**: Everyone should feel comfortable and included. Discuss boundaries before play begins and respect them throughout.

**Shared Narrative**: While the GM guides the world, everyone contributes to the story. Your descriptions, questions, and reactions shape the narrative as much as any dice roll.

**Flexible Focus**: Sometimes you're the protagonist, sometimes you're supporting cast. Both roles matter for creating engaging stories.

## Getting Started

Your first session might feel overwhelming with new rules and possibilities. That's normal! Focus on:

1. **Describing Your Character's Actions**: What would they do in this situation?
2. **Asking Questions**: When uncertain, ask the GM for clarification
3. **Rolling When Asked**: The GM will tell you when and what to roll
4. **Learning Through Play**: Rules become intuitive with practice

Remember: you can't "play wrong" if you're engaged and contributing to everyone's enjoyment. Heart Rush is about collaborative adventure—embrace the journey and see where it leads.
