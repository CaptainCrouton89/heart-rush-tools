# Dice Mechanics and Resolution System

## Overview

Every hero faces moments of uncertainty—the leap across a chasm, the desperate plea to a hostile king, the crucial strike against a deadly foe. These pivotal moments are resolved through dice, where your character's natural talent, current condition, and hard-won experience all contribute to the outcome. This chapter provides everything you need to understand how dice shape your story.

At its core, you'll roll just two dice and add them together. But the circumstances of your action—your training, your allies' support, even your character's personality—can dramatically shift the odds. Whether you're a player learning the basics or a GM mastering every nuance, these mechanics will become second nature through play.

## Core Dice System

### The Basic Roll

At the heart of every uncertain action lies a simple formula: combine your current stamina with your natural ability to determine success. Both your condition and your talents matter in every roll.

**The fundamental mechanic:**

- **Your Heart Die**: Represents your stamina and vitality—as you tire or take wounds, this die shrinks
- **An Ability Die**: Represents your natural talent in one of four areas (Might, Agility, Cunning, or Presence)

The sum of these dice, plus any modifiers from your training and circumstances, determines whether you succeed or fail. This creates a dynamic where even skilled characters must manage their resources carefully, while less talented heroes can still triumph when fresh and determined.

### When to Roll

Not every action requires dice. Rolls are reserved for moments that matter—when failure would be interesting, success isn't guaranteed, and the outcome will shape the story. The GM calls for rolls only when these conditions align.

**Roll dice when the action:**

- Has a realistic chance of failure
- Would have interesting consequences for failure
- Cannot be resolved through roleplay alone

A master thief doesn't roll to pick a simple lock in their workshop. But that same lock during a midnight heist, with guards approaching? That's when dice hit the table.

## Types of Rolls

Four distinct types of rolls serve specific situations. While they share the core mechanic of rolling dice against a target number, each type has unique features that make it perfect for its purpose. Understanding when to use each type is key to smooth gameplay.

### 1. Skill Checks

Skill checks are your bread and butter—the rolls you'll make most often when attempting anything with a chance of failure. From scaling castle walls to deciphering ancient texts, from haggling with merchants to tracking beasts through snow, skill checks handle any task where your character's abilities are tested against the challenges of the world.

**When to Use**: Attempting any action with a chance of failure where you're actively trying to accomplish something.

The GM sets a target number called the Challenge Number (CN) based on the difficulty of the task. You need to meet or exceed this number to succeed. Common CNs range from 6 (Fairly Easy) to 21 (Heroic)—see the Challenge Numbers section for the full table.

**Basic Procedure**:

1. Roll your heart die + one ability die
2. Add any applicable modifiers (professions, aspects)
3. Compare total to the Challenge Number (CN) - a target number set by the GM
4. Success if total ≥ CN

**Example**: _Climbing a cliff face_

- Roll: Heart die (d8) + Agility die (d10)
- Add: +2 from "Mountain Guide" profession
- Challenge Number: 12 (Hard)
- Result: 5 + 7 + 2 = 14. Success!

#### The Complication Rule

Sometimes the dice betray you at the worst possible moment—but you have a choice about how to handle catastrophic rolls. When fate turns against you, you can accept failure gracefully or push through at a cost. This rule creates dramatic moments where success comes with unexpected consequences.

When you roll a 1 on any die during a skill check, you must choose:

- **Option A**: Automatically fail the check
- **Option B**: Re-roll that die and accept a complication

A complication doesn't affect your success—it creates an additional problem related to your action. You might pick the lock, but your tools break. You might convince the guard, but now he wants a favor. Success with strings attached.

**Special Cases**:

- Additional 1s after re-rolling don't cause more complications
- Two 1s on initial roll = automatic failure + complication

**Complication Examples**:

- **Climbing**: You reach the top, but your rope frays and won't support another climber
- **Lockpicking**: The door opens, but your tools break and can't be reused
- **Persuasion**: They agree to help, but demand an unexpected favor in return
- **Sneaking**: You pass undetected, but leave muddy footprints behind
- **Gathering Information**: You learn what you need, but someone notices your questions
- **Foraging**: You find food, but attract a dangerous predator

### 2. Saving Throws

Where skill checks represent your active attempts to accomplish goals, saving throws represent your reactive attempts to avoid disaster. When danger comes for you—whether a sorcerer's curse, a collapsing ceiling, or a hidden pit trap—saving throws determine if you can twist away at the last second. They use the same basic mechanics as skill checks but with crucial differences that reflect their defensive nature.

**When to Use**: Avoiding or mitigating effects imposed by others or the environment.

**Mechanics**: Identical to skill checks, but:

- No complications on 1s
- Success = avoid the negative effect
- Failure = suffer the negative effect

**CN Determination**:

- Against creatures: Their ability challenge number
- Environmental effects: GM sets CN

**Example**: _Dodging a falling boulder_

- Roll: Heart die + Agility die
- CN: 12 (set by GM)
- Success avoids damage, failure takes full damage

### 3. Attack & Defense Rolls (A/D Rolls)

Combat brings its own specialized rolls that handle the deadly dance of weapons and magic. Attack and Defense rolls share the core mechanics but add layers specific to battle—weapon skills, combat talents, and the chaotic flow of melee. These rolls form the backbone of the fast and lethal combat system.

**When to Use**: Dealing or negating damage in combat.

**Mechanics**:

- Roll ability die + heart die + modifiers
- Detailed rules in the Combat section

### 4. Stratagem Rolls

Sometimes your ambitions extend beyond what any single action can accomplish. When you're commanding fleets, building merchant empires, or pursuing grand schemes that unfold over weeks or months, stratagem rolls let you resolve these complex endeavors without getting bogged down in details. They represent a "zoom out" mechanic that keeps epic-scale actions manageable.

**When to Use**: Complex endeavors involving multiple coordinated actions over time—from naval battles to political campaigns.

**Key Differences**:

- Uses flat d8 instead of heart die (unaffected by stamina)
- Cannot be helped by others
- Cannot use standard skill check modifiers

**Basic Roll**: d8 + ability die + profession + aspect (if applicable) vs Challenge Number

_See the Stratagem System section for complete rules._

## Modifying Rolls

Raw dice tell only part of the story. In Heart Rush, your circumstances, training, personality, and allies all influence your chances of success. This section details the various modifiers that transform a simple dice roll into a reflection of your character's full capabilities and current situation. Understanding these modifiers is key to maximizing your effectiveness and creating memorable moments at the table.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

The circumstances of your action can dramatically shift the odds. When you have the high ground, the perfect tool, or the element of surprise, you gain advantage—extra dice that improve your chances. When you're wounded, distracted, or working with inferior equipment, disadvantage makes success less likely. This system creates swingy, cinematic results where preparation and positioning truly matter.

These mechanics create swingy, dramatic results that can turn desperate situations into triumphant successes—or seemingly simple tasks into comedic failures. The GM awards advantage or disadvantage based on the fiction of the scene, making the narrative circumstances mechanically meaningful.

**Advantage Mechanics**:

1. Roll additional dice equal to your lowest die type
2. Remove the lowest results after rolling
3. Multiple advantages stack (noted as A2, A3, etc.)

**Disadvantage Mechanics**:

1. Roll additional dice equal to your highest die type
2. Remove the highest results after rolling
3. Multiple disadvantages stack (noted as D2, D3, etc.)

**Important**: Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

**Example with Multiple Modifiers**:
_Lifting a heavy portcullis with 3 advantages and 1 disadvantage_

- Might die: d6, Heart die: d8
- Net effect: A2 (2 levels of advantage)
- Normal roll would be: 1d8 + 1d6 (2 dice total)
- With A2: Roll 1d8 + 3d6 (4 dice total)
- Results: 8, 6, 5, 1
- Remove 2 lowest: Discard the 1 and 5
- Final total: 14 (keeping 8 + 6)

### Profession Bonuses

Years of training and experience provide concrete mechanical benefits. Your profession represents deep expertise that can be applied in both obvious and creative ways. A career soldier knows more than just swordplay; they understand logistics, fortifications, and military hierarchy. Players who think creatively about their professional knowledge will find many opportunities to apply it.

Professional knowledge can be applied both directly (a blacksmith forging a sword) and indirectly (that same blacksmith recognizing the quality of metal in a piece of armor).

**Direct Application**: Add full profession rank

- The profession directly relates to the task
- Clear professional expertise applies

**Tangential Application**: Add half rank (rounded down)

- The profession somewhat relates
- Professional knowledge helps indirectly

**Restriction**: Only one profession applies per check

**Examples**:

- _Sailor +3 navigating in storm_: Full +3 (direct)
- _Sailor +3 recognizing knots_: Full +3 (direct)
- _Sailor +3 haggling for supplies_: +1 (tangential, half of 3 rounded down)

### Using Aspects

Your character is more than a collection of numbers—they're a person with beliefs, flaws, relationships, and history. Aspects capture these defining elements and make them mechanically relevant through the Destiny Point economy. This creates a game where being true to your character is rewarded, whether that nature helps or hinders you. The same stubborn pride that helps you resist interrogation might sabotage your attempts at diplomacy.

What makes aspects special is their double-edged nature. The same trait that helps you in one situation might hinder you in another—and you're rewarded for playing both sides. By spending or gaining Destiny Points (DP), aspects become a currency of narrative influence, letting you succeed when your character's nature aids them or earn resources when it causes problems.

#### Positive Invocation (Spending DP)

When your character's nature aligns perfectly with the task at hand, you can spend Destiny Points to channel that aspect into mechanical success. This represents those moments when who you are makes all the difference.

- Spend Destiny Points up to the aspect's rank
- Add that amount to your roll
- Requires GM approval
- Aspect must clearly apply

**Example**: _"Former City Guard Captain" Rank 2_

- Persuading town guards to let you pass
- Spend 2 DP to add +2 to the roll
- Draw on shared professional experience

#### Negative Invocation (Gaining DP)

The most interesting characters have flaws, compulsions, and troublesome traits. When these aspects would logically cause problems, you can lean into the complication to earn Destiny Points. This encourages players to create drama and stay true to their character even when it's disadvantageous.

- Choose to let an aspect hinder you when it applies
- Gain DP equal to aspect's rank by either:
  - Taking the aspect's rank as a penalty to your roll
  - Accepting a complication that reflects the aspect
- Must roleplay the aspect causing problems
- Maximum 5 DP per scene from negative invocations

**Example**: _"Quick to Draw My Sword" Rank 3_

- Option 1: Take -3 penalty when trying to negotiate peacefully, gain 3 DP
- Option 2: Threaten the shopkeeper with violence (creating complications), gain 3 DP

#### Gaining DP from Negative Aspects

If an aspect would complicate a situation or indicate weakness, you may choose to let it hinder you and gain DP equal to the aspect's rank. You can do this by either taking the rank as a penalty to your roll or accepting a narrative complication. This represents your character acting according to their nature, even when disadvantageous.

**Example**: With "Quick to draw my sword" at rank 3, you might take a -3 penalty when trying to negotiate peacefully, or you might threaten a shopkeeper who insults you (creating complications). Either way, you gain 3 DP for staying true to your character.

### Helping

Adventures are rarely solo affairs. When challenges arise, heroes naturally work together—one picking the lock while another watches for guards, one distracting the merchant while another picks their pocket. The helping rules make cooperation mechanically powerful while ensuring that teamwork carries shared risks. This encourages the kind of collaborative problem-solving that makes tabletop gaming special.

Helping always grants advantage (one of the strongest bonuses in the game), but helpers share the risks. This creates interesting tactical decisions—is it worth risking multiple characters on a single roll?

**Mechanics**:

- Grant advantage to another's skill check
- In combat, requires your action
- Must be able to reasonably provide assistance
- Multiple helpers don't grant additional advantage
- Helpers share consequences of failure/complications

**Example**: _Helping a friend pick a complex lock_

- You hold the torch steady and watch for guards
- Your friend gets advantage on their roll
- If they fail or get a complication, you're both affected

#### Group Skill Checks

When the entire party faces the same challenge together, these situations can be resolved without repetitive rolling while maintaining appropriate difficulty. There are two distinct situations: tasks where one failure ruins everything, and tasks where the group can support each other. This keeps the game moving while preserving the tension of group challenges.

##### Weakest Link Tasks

Some challenges are only as strong as their weakest link. When sneaking past guards, the stealthiest rogue can't compensate for the clanking paladin. When crossing a narrow beam, one person's fall alerts everyone. These situations require a different approach than individual rolls.

**Procedure**:

- Identify the character worst at the task
- That character rolls with advantage
- Success means everyone succeeds; failure affects everyone

**Example**: _Four adventurers sneaking past guards_

- The heavily armored knight (worst at stealth) rolls
- They get advantage from the group's help
- One roll determines everyone's fate

##### Collaborative Tasks

Other challenges benefit from combined efforts. When persuading a council, different speakers can cover for each other's weaknesses. When lifting a portcullis, multiple strong backs make the difference. These tasks let the group's strength shine through.

**Procedure**:

- The character best at the task rolls
- They roll with advantage
- Success benefits from everyone's contribution

**Example**: _Party persuading a merchant guild_

- The smooth-talking bard (best at persuasion) rolls
- They get advantage from the group's support
- Success represents the combined effort

## Challenge Numbers

The beating heart of the difficulty system, Challenge Numbers (CNs) create a consistent framework for the GM to communicate how hard any task will be. From the trivial to the legendary, this unified scale helps everyone at the table understand the stakes before dice hit the table. Whether you're attempting a simple skill check or commanding armies in a stratagem, the same intuitive scale applies.

Understanding the CN scale helps both players and GMs calibrate expectations. Players can gauge whether an action is within their capabilities, while GMs can consistently set appropriate difficulties across different situations. The system uses the same scale for everything from skill checks to stratagems, creating a unified difficulty framework.

### Standard Difficulties

This table serves as your primary reference for setting and understanding difficulty. Each tier represents a significant jump in challenge, helping GMs quickly assign appropriate CNs and letting players understand their chances before committing to an action.

| CN  | Difficulty        | When to Use                      |
| --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 6   | Fairly Easy       | Routine tasks under pressure     |
| 9   | Average           | Standard professional challenges |
| 12  | Hard              | Difficult tasks requiring skill  |
| 15  | Very Hard         | Exceptional challenges           |
| 18  | Nearly Impossible | Legendary feats                  |
| 21  | Heroic            | Superhuman achievements          |

### Ability Challenge Numbers

Not all challenges come from the environment—sometimes you're the one creating effects that others must resist. When you grapple a foe, dazzle a crowd with your presence, or weave magical effects, your natural abilities determine how hard you are to resist. These numbers scale with your growth as a hero through paragon levels, ensuring that your innate talents remain relevant throughout your adventures. Different characters excel at different types of effects based on their strongest abilities.

**Calculation**: Maximum of relevant ability die + (2 × paragon level)

**Types**:

- Might Challenge Number
- Agility Challenge Number
- Cunning Challenge Number
- Presence Challenge Number
- Heart Challenge Number (for magical effects)

**Example**: _A veteran warrior (Might d10, Paragon 2)_

- Might Challenge Number = 10 + (2 × 2) = 14
- Enemies must meet or beat 14 to resist their grapples

### Stratagem CNs

Large-scale endeavors use the same difficulty scale but with additional considerations. Your forces' advantages and disadvantages modify the base CN—preparation and circumstances matter as much as raw ability.

Use the same scale as skill checks, modified by:

- **Assets**: Advantages that reduce Challenge Number
- **Hindrances**: Disadvantages that increase Challenge Number

The GM weighs assets against hindrances to set final Challenge Number.
