# Dice Mechanics and Resolution System

Heart Rush uses dice to resolve uncertain actions, combining your natural talent, current stamina, and training to create dynamic outcomes. This chapter covers all the fundamental mechanics you'll need to play.

## Core Dice System

Heart Rush uses a simple two-die system where you roll your Heart Die (representing stamina) plus an Ability Die (representing natural talent) to resolve uncertain actions. Success is determined by meeting or exceeding a Challenge Number set by the GM, with modifiers from your training and circumstances affecting the outcome.

### The Basic Roll

In Heart Rush, you resolve uncertain actions by rolling two dice:

- **Your Heart Die**: Represents your stamina and vitality
- **An Ability Die**: Represents your natural talent (Might, Agility, Cunning, or Presence)

The sum of these dice, plus any modifiers, determines your success.

### When to Roll

The GM calls for a dice roll whenever you attempt something that:

- Has a realistic chance of failure
- Would have interesting consequences for failure
- Cannot be resolved through roleplay alone

## Types of Rolls

Heart Rush uses four distinct types of rolls, each serving a specific purpose:

### 1. Skill Checks

**When to Use**: Attempting any action with a chance of failure.

The GM sets a target number called the Challenge Number (CN) based on the difficulty of the task. You need to meet or exceed this number to succeed. Common CNs range from 6 (Fairly Easy) to 21 (Heroic) - see the Challenge Numbers section for the full table.

**Basic Procedure**:

1. Roll your heart die + one ability die
2. Add any applicable modifiers (professions, aspects)
3. Compare total to the Challenge Number (CN) - a target number set by the GM
4. Success if total ≥ CN

**Example**: _Climbing a cliff face_

- Roll: Heart die (d8) + Agility die (d10)
- Add: +2 from "Mountain Guide" profession
- Challenge Number: 12 (Hard)
- Result: 5 + 7 + 2 = 14. Success!

#### The Complication Rule

When you roll a 1 on any die during a skill check, you must choose:

- **Option A**: Automatically fail the check
- **Option B**: Re-roll that die and accept a complication

A complication doesn't affect your success—it creates an additional problem related to your action.

**Special Cases**:

- Additional 1s after re-rolling don't cause more complications
- Two 1s on initial roll = automatic failure + complication

**Complication Examples**:

- **Climbing**: You reach the top, but your rope frays and won't support another climber
- **Lockpicking**: The door opens, but your tools break and can't be reused
- **Persuasion**: They agree to help, but demand an unexpected favor in return
- **Sneaking**: You pass undetected, but leave muddy footprints behind
- **Gathering Information**: You learn what you need, but someone notices your questions
- **Foraging**: You find food, but attract a dangerous predator

### 2. Saving Throws

**When to Use**: Avoiding or mitigating effects imposed by others or the environment.

**Mechanics**: Identical to skill checks, but:

- No complications on 1s
- Success = avoid the negative effect
- Failure = suffer the negative effect

**CN Determination**:

- Against creatures: Their ability challenge number
- Environmental effects: GM sets CN

**Example**: _Dodging a falling boulder_

- Roll: Heart die + Agility die
- CN: 12 (set by GM)
- Success avoids damage, failure takes full damage

### 3. Attack & Defense Rolls (A/D Rolls)

**When to Use**: Dealing or negating damage in combat.

**Mechanics**:

- Roll ability die + heart die + modifiers
- Detailed rules in the Combat section

### 4. Stratagem Rolls

**When to Use**: Complex endeavors involving multiple coordinated actions over time—from naval battles to political campaigns.

**Key Differences**:

- Uses flat d8 instead of heart die (unaffected by stamina)
- Cannot be helped by others
- Cannot use standard skill check modifiers

**Basic Roll**: d8 + ability die + profession + aspect (if applicable) vs Challenge Number

_See the Stratagem System section for complete rules._

## Group Skill Checks

Sometimes multiple characters attempt the same task together. The system handles these situations differently based on whether the group succeeds only if everyone succeeds, or whether they can work together cooperatively.

### Weakest Link Tasks

When the group is only as strong as its weakest member (e.g., sneaking past guards as a group), failure by one means failure by all.

**Procedure**:

- Identify the character worst at the task
- That character rolls with advantage
- Success means everyone succeeds; failure affects everyone

**Example**: _Four adventurers sneaking past guards_

- The heavily armored knight (worst at stealth) rolls
- They get advantage from the group's help
- One roll determines everyone's fate

### Collaborative Tasks

When characters can meaningfully combine their efforts (e.g., persuading a judge, lifting a heavy gate), the strongest member leads while others support.

**Procedure**:

- The character best at the task rolls
- They roll with advantage
- Success benefits from everyone's contribution

**Example**: _Party persuading a merchant guild_

- The smooth-talking bard (best at persuasion) rolls
- They get advantage from the group's support
- Success represents the combined effort

## Modifying Rolls

The dice tell only part of the story. Your training, circumstances, personality traits, and the help of allies all influence your chances of success. This section covers the various ways your rolls can be modified to reflect these factors.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Sometimes circumstances make a task notably easier or harder than normal. Maybe you have the perfect tool for the job, or perhaps you're trying to pick a lock in complete darkness. Advantage and disadvantage represent these situational modifiers by giving you extra dice to roll, then letting you keep the best (or worst) results.

These mechanics create swingy, dramatic results that can turn desperate situations into triumphant successes—or seemingly simple tasks into comedic failures. The GM awards advantage or disadvantage based on the fiction of the scene.

**Advantage Mechanics**:

1. Roll additional dice equal to your lowest die type
2. Remove the lowest results after rolling
3. Multiple advantages stack (noted as A2, A3, etc.)

**Disadvantage Mechanics**:

1. Roll additional dice equal to your highest die type
2. Remove the highest results after rolling
3. Multiple disadvantages stack (noted as D2, D3, etc.)

**Important**: Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

**Example with Multiple Modifiers**:
_Lifting a heavy portcullis with 3 advantages and 1 disadvantage_

- Might die: d6, Heart die: d8
- Net effect: A2 (2 levels of advantage)
- Normal roll would be: 1d8 + 1d6 (2 dice total)
- With A2: Roll 1d8 + 3d6 (4 dice total)
- Results: 8, 6, 5, 1
- Remove 2 lowest: Discard the 1 and 5
- Final total: 14 (keeping 8 + 6)

### Profession Bonuses

Your training provides bonuses when relevant:

**Direct Application**: Add full profession rank

- The profession directly relates to the task
- Clear professional expertise applies

**Tangential Application**: Add half rank (rounded down)

- The profession somewhat relates
- Professional knowledge helps indirectly

**Restriction**: Only one profession applies per check

**Examples**:

- _Sailor +3 navigating in storm_: Full +3 (direct)
- _Sailor +3 recognizing knots_: Full +3 (direct)
- _Sailor +3 haggling for supplies_: +1 (tangential, half of 3 rounded down)

### Using Aspects

Aspects are character traits that can help or hinder you.

#### Positive Invocation (Spending DP)

- Spend Destiny Points up to the aspect's rank
- Add that amount to your roll
- Requires GM approval
- Aspect must clearly apply

**Example**: _"Former City Guard Captain" Rank 2_

- Persuading town guards to let you pass
- Spend 2 DP to add +2 to the roll
- Draw on shared professional experience

#### Negative Invocation (Gaining DP)

- Choose to let an aspect hinder you when it applies
- Gain DP equal to aspect's rank by either:
  - Taking the aspect's rank as a penalty to your roll
  - Accepting a complication that reflects the aspect
- Must roleplay the aspect causing problems
- Maximum 5 DP per scene from negative invocations

**Example**: _"Quick to Draw My Sword" Rank 3_

- Option 1: Take -3 penalty when trying to negotiate peacefully, gain 3 DP
- Option 2: Threaten the shopkeeper with violence (creating complications), gain 3 DP

### Helping

Heart Rush recognizes that heroes rarely work alone. When someone attempts a challenging task, their allies can lend aid—whether that's steadying a ladder, distracting a guard, or offering words of encouragement. The helping mechanic makes teamwork meaningful without bogging down play with multiple rolls.

Helping always grants advantage (one of the strongest bonuses in the game), but helpers share the risks. This creates interesting tactical decisions—is it worth risking multiple characters on a single roll?

**Mechanics**:

- Grant advantage to another's skill check
- In combat, requires your action
- Must be able to reasonably provide assistance
- Multiple helpers don't grant additional advantage
- Helpers share consequences of failure/complications

**Example**: _Helping a friend pick a complex lock_

- You hold the torch steady and watch for guards
- Your friend gets advantage on their roll
- If they fail or get a complication, you're both affected

### Raising the Stakes

Sometimes a roll represents a pivotal moment in the story—a turning point where everything hangs in the balance. The raising the stakes mechanic lets players highlight these crucial moments, transforming ordinary rolls into dramatic crescendos that everyone at the table will remember.

This is a meta-mechanic that any player can invoke, not just for their own rolls but for any roll happening at the table. It represents those cinematic moments where time seems to slow down and everyone holds their breath. Use it sparingly—its power comes from its rarity.

**When**: Once per session, before any player rolls dice

**Effect**:

- Success becomes more effective/impressive
- Failure/complications become more disastrous
- Applies to any roll by any player

**Example**: _Raising stakes on a diplomacy check_

- Normal success: Noble agrees to help
- Raised success: Noble pledges full military support
- Normal failure: Noble refuses
- Raised failure: Noble is insulted and becomes an enemy

## Challenge Numbers

Challenge Numbers (CNs) are the target numbers you need to meet or exceed to succeed at tasks. They're the GM's primary tool for communicating difficulty and setting the stakes for any given roll. A CN of 6 might represent climbing a ladder in a hurry, while a CN of 18 could be leaping across a chasm in full armor during a thunderstorm.

Understanding the CN scale helps both players and GMs calibrate expectations. Players can gauge whether an action is within their capabilities, while GMs can consistently set appropriate difficulties across different situations. The system uses the same scale for everything from skill checks to stratagems, creating a unified difficulty framework.

### Standard Difficulties

| CN  | Difficulty        | When to Use                      |
| --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 6   | Fairly Easy       | Routine tasks under pressure     |
| 9   | Average           | Standard professional challenges |
| 12  | Hard              | Difficult tasks requiring skill  |
| 15  | Very Hard         | Exceptional challenges           |
| 18  | Nearly Impossible | Legendary feats                  |
| 21  | Heroic            | Superhuman achievements          |

### Ability Challenge Numbers

When you create effects that others must resist—whether grappling an enemy, dazzling them with your presence, or weaving magic—your natural capabilities set the difficulty. Ability Challenge Numbers represent how hard it is for others to overcome your inherent talents and developed power.

This system scales with character advancement through paragon levels, ensuring that as heroes grow in power, their abilities become increasingly difficult to resist. It also means that different characters excel at different types of effects based on their strongest abilities.

**Calculation**: Maximum of relevant ability die + (2 × paragon level)

**Types**:

- Might Challenge Number
- Agility Challenge Number
- Cunning Challenge Number
- Presence Challenge Number
- Heart Challenge Number (for magical effects)

**Example**: _A veteran warrior (Might d10, Paragon 2)_

- Might Challenge Number = 10 + (2 × 2) = 14
- Enemies must meet or beat 14 to resist their grapples

### Stratagem CNs

Use the same scale as skill checks, modified by:

- **Assets**: Advantages that reduce Challenge Number
- **Hindrances**: Disadvantages that increase Challenge Number

The GM weighs assets against hindrances to set final Challenge Number.
