# Rests & Healing

## Example

You just survived a nasty fight. You have 14 hit points, a d4 heart die, and a rank 12 wound. At first, you take a short rest—you have more distance to cover before the day is done. Your heart die becomes a d8 once more. Then, night comes, and you take a long rest. It’s warm, but you have no shelter. You fail your sleeping check. Since your maximum hit points was 28 (40 - 12), and you are currently at 14, you regain 7 hit points, going up to 21. Additionally, you start the next day with a level of dazed.

The next day you reach your destination, getting a bed, warmth, and shelter, thereby automatically succeeding your sleeping check. Your wound decreases to rank 11, you heal to 29 hp (40 - 11), and you remove your level of dazed.

You realize you can spend some time in the town without feeling pressured to leave, so you stay safe and don’t leave, reducing your wound by one each night till fully healed after 11 more days.

## Healing Methods

There are a few ways to regain hit points. The primary method is by taking rests, but magic, racial abilities, potions, and more can all cause healing in other ways.

# Rests

You can heal hit points, refresh heart dice, and reduce wounds all with rests. There are two types of rests: short rests and long rests.

## Short Rest

A short rest is nothing more than 10 minutes of stationary relaxation. When you take a short rest, your heart die returns to its maximum. You can take any number of short rests per day.

## Long Rest

When you go to sleep for the night, that is a long rest. Long rests must be at least 7 hours, and you can only take one each day. 

When taking a long rest away from shelter, bed, and warmth, you must also make a sleeping check. Succeeding at a sleeping check results in a “successful” long rest. On failing the check, you have an unsuccessful long rest.

To make the sleeping check, roll 1d100 and add all the relevant modifiers from the Sleeping Conditions table below. On a 100 or higher, you succeed.

While you do have warmth, a bed, and full shelter, you do not need to make this check and are assumed to succeed. If you do not rest for the night, take the penalties associated with failing a sleeping check.

### Successful Sleeping Check

On a success, reduce the ranks of each of your wounds by one, and heal hit points up to your current maximum (it will be reduced if you have wounds).

### Failed Sleeping Check

On a failure, do not reduce the ranks of your wounds, and regain half of your missing hit points, rounded down. Additionally, take a level of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed, chosen at random. A second night of failed sleep inflicts two conditions at random, and a third night, along with every night thereafter, inflicts one condition at random.

### Sleep Bonuses/Penalties x2

[[GM Note
The pacing of Heart Rush tends to be a bit slower than other games; letting players take long rests does not let them heal all that much, so don’t feel pressured to pack multiple combats into only a single day. A long trip through the wilderness where good rest is uncertain and combat is intermittent is plenty grueling for most parties. Thereafter, inflicts one level of each condition. A successful long rest removes all conditions gained this way.]]

## Healing Potions

Not every world setting will play with healing potions, but if your game does, these rules work well. One hour after drinking a healing potion, reduce the rank of each of your wounds by one and regain 20 hit points.

# Healing

Besides rests, other effects and abilities may cause you to heal hit points. When you heal hit points, you cannot increase your hit points greater than any restricted maximum due to wounds you might have.
