# Enterprises

An **Enterprise** is any large-scale player ambition beyond individual adventuring - thieves guild, kingdom, merchant empire, religious movement, magical research institute, etc.

## Creating an Enterprise

Work with your GM to establish:

- **What it is**: Brief description of your organization/pursuit
- **What you want**: Your ultimate goals
- **Assets**: List of specific capabilities, resources, people, territories, etc.

## Core Mechanics

The enterprise system uses streamlined mechanics to handle large-scale endeavors without getting bogged down in complex management rules.

### Enterprise Die

Every enterprise has a **d20 Enterprise Die**. This represents your overall organizational capability and influence.

### Taking Actions

1. **Player declares goal**: "We want to steal the tax collection"
2. **GM sets base difficulty**: Based on enterprise assets - Easy (CN 8), Medium (CN 12), Hard (CN 16), Nearly Impossible (CN 20)
3. **Player can ask**: "What's the difficulty?" GM tells them.
4. **Player intervention**: Players can take personal actions to modify the difficulty up or down before the enterprise roll
5. **Enterprise roll**: Roll d20 Enterprise Die vs. final challenge number

### Player Intervention

By default, the enterprise acts on its own with the base difficulty. But players can get personally involved:

- **Help**: Take actions that might make the enterprise goal easier (lower CN)
- **Complicate**: Sometimes player actions accidentally make things harder (higher CN)
- **Enable**: Some goals might be impossible until players acquire necessary resources/allies

Players must decide for themselves whether and how to intervene based on the situation and their enterprise's assets.

### Assets

Assets are freeform descriptors that help the GM set difficulty:

**Examples:**

- "Network of informants in three cities"
- "Well-trained private army (200 soldiers)"
- "Exclusive trading rights to silver mines"
- "Powerful political ally: Duke Blackwood"
- "Hidden fortress in the mountains"
- "Ancient magical artifact: The Crown of Storms"
- "Fanatically loyal inner circle"
- "Control of the docks district"

**Using Assets:**

- Relevant assets make actions easier (lower CN)
- Lacking necessary assets makes actions harder (higher CN)
- Some actions might be impossible without specific assets

## Examples in Play

These examples demonstrate how the enterprise system works in actual gameplay scenarios.

### Scenario: Thieves Guild

**Assets:** "Underground tunnels network," "Corrupt city guards," "Master forger: Marcus the Inkwell"

**Player:** "We want to steal the noble's tax collection."
**GM:** "Base difficulty is Easy (CN 8)."
**Player:** "I want to personally scout the route first."
**GM:** "Alright." [Player makes skill check, succeeds]
**GM:** "Now roll your enterprise die against CN 6."

### Scenario: Merchant Empire

**Assets:** "Fleet of 12 trading ships," "Warehouse in every major port," "Exclusive spice trade contracts"

**Player:** "We want to corner the weapons market."
**GM:** "Hard (CN 16)."
**Player:** "I'm going to try to recruit that disbanded mercenary captain first."
**GM:** "Okay." [Roleplay scene, partial success]
**GM:** "Roll your enterprise die against CN 12."

## Growing Your Enterprise

Enterprises evolve over time through their successes and failures, gaining new capabilities while sometimes losing others.

### Gaining Assets

Successful actions can result in new assets:

- "Recruit the disbanded mercenary company" → "Veteran mercenary company (50 fighters)"
- "Blackmail the minister" → "Political leverage over Minister Williams"
- "Discover the lost vault" → "Ancient treasure hoard worth 100,000 ducats"

### Losing Assets

Failed actions or complications can cost assets:

- Botched heist → lose "Safe house in merchant quarter"
- Political scandal → lose "Good standing with the church"
- Military defeat → "Private army" becomes "Remnants of private army (30 survivors)"

### Natural Growth

As enterprises succeed, they naturally accumulate assets and attract new opportunities - and new problems.

## GM Guidelines

These guidelines help GMs run enterprise scenes smoothly and create engaging large-scale conflicts.

### Setting Difficulty

Consider the enterprise's relevant assets:

- **Many relevant assets**: Easy (CN 8)
- **Some relevant assets**: Medium (CN 12)
- **Few/weak relevant assets**: Hard (CN 16)
- **No relevant assets**: Nearly Impossible (CN 20) or just impossible

### Consequences

- **Success**: Achieve goal, possibly gain new assets
- **Failure**: Setback, possibly lose assets, but always creates new opportunities
- **Complications**: Even successes can create new problems

### Creating Opposition

- Give major rivals their own assets
- Successful player actions threaten rival assets
- Rivals respond by targeting player assets
- Use rival actions to drive adventure hooks

### Adventure Integration

- Enterprise complications create personal adventure opportunities
- Individual adventures can serve enterprise goals
- Let players use personal abilities to benefit their enterprise
- Enterprise resources can support character goals

### Keep It Simple

- Don't track numbers unless necessary
- Assets are just narrative descriptors
- Focus on what makes sense in the story
- Let players suggest what they think their enterprise should be capable of
