# Strongholds

Strongholds represent loci of power for players. Although not necessarily literally strongholds, they act as recurring bases of operations for the activities of the players. They can provide income, followers, influence in exchange for maintenance and care.
Examples of strongholds include palaces, forges, colleges, and inns, though many more exist. Strongholds can be owned by multiple players.

## Building your stronghold

In order to gain a stronghold, the owner must pay an amount of ducat equal to the square footage of the stronghold they wish to construct. If there are special features of the stronghold, such as those listed in the price modifiers table, then those price modifiers are multiplied by the base price for the final cost. Different types of strongholds have different minimum levels, which you must also meet in order to build them. It is up to the GM to determine how long building any particular stronghold takes, though it is suggested that building it takes between six months and two years, and upgrades take about half as much time.

| Option              | Price Modifier |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Island              | x2             |
| Mountain-top        | x3             |
| Underground         | x3             |
| Underwater          | x5             |
| Floating in the air | x10            |
| Wondrous materials  | x15            |

| Level | Building Area  | Sq. Feet (approx.) |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1     | 25x25 feet     | 625                |
| 2     | 50x50 feet     | 2,500              |
| 3     | 85x85 feet     | 7,250              |
| 4     | 130x130 feet   | 17,000             |
| 5     | 195x195 feet   | 38,000             |
| 6     | 275x275\* feet | 77,000             |
| 7     | 420x420 feet   | 175,000            |
| 8     | 500x500+ feet  | 250,000            |

During construction, and upon completion, it is assumed that your stronghold becomes populated with whatever folks are typical of the type of residence. Shopkeepers, stable masters, craftsmen, servants--these people and more will arrive and begin working in your stronghold. Some of these people would typically require payment to work here, while others would typically pay taxes; don’t bother keeping track of the specifics--all of this flow of money is wrapped up in the initial cost of construction and income generated by your stronghold thereafter.

## Miscellaneous Rules

These additional rules govern various aspects of stronghold ownership and management.

### Upgrading your stronghold

Upgrading your strong hold is as easy as paying the difference in prices between the current value of your stronghold and the new value of your stronghold.

### Multiple Strongholds

If you wish to own multiple strongholds, they must share physical proximity. This could mean building a large library stronghold in your castle stronghold, or it could mean attaching a wizard tower stronghold to your laboratory stronghold. What’s important is that your presence and identity is closely tied to each of them, and they share a close connection to each other, which is not possible if they are hundreds or thousands of miles apart.

## Types of Strongholds

In exchange for their enormous costs, strongholds have substantial benefits unique to each type of stronghold. Regardless of what type of stronghold you choose, you and the stronghold’s inhabitants and owners all have advantage on rolls made to defend your stronghold.

Once per month, you may throw large social events at your house. When you throw the event, in addition to regular friends and folk, X people of influence 1 higher than your current influence show up, where X is the level of your house. During these events, stronghold owners may treat their influence as though it was one level greater than it is for the purpose of making connections and socializing with any guests.
Additionally, your house contains one attendant per level of the house. They live at the house and will not come with you on your travels.
