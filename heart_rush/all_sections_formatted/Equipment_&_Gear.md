# Equipment & Gear

## Encumbrance

Your capacity for carrying stuff is tracked using slots. Your maximum slots is equal to 6 plus half of your might die. For example, if you have a d4, your maximum slots is 8. This doesn't mean you can't carry more than that, it just means that you can't carry more than that for hours at a time without becoming exhausted and having to make endurance checks on a case by case basis, as determined by the GM.

Different adventuring gear has different slot values. You can see the slot values and prices of all gear in the table below. Regardless of if you're wearing the gear or carrying it, if it's on you, the slots count against your maximum slots.

## Pack Animals & Vehicles

By using a pack animal or vehicle, you can carry substantially more gear.

- Animal/Vehicle | Maximum Slots
- Donkey | 30
- Horse | 60
- Horse-drawn wagon | 300
