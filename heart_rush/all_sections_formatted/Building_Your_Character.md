# Building Your Character

As you make a character in Heart Rush, remember that at the center of every Heart Rush character is their heart. It is the foundation on which you build your life, your soul; it is the chassis and essence of your decisions and their consequences; and it is what drives you forward. You are building an entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.

## Your Dream

With this in mind, build a character that has a vision towards what they want to achieve. You should have a dream of what you want to do in the world, one that is complex and difficult and worthy of the caliber of legend you wish to become. Remember—you determine the direction the story takes. There's no goal to this game besides the one you set for yourself.

So speak with your GM about the world in which the game takes place, and figure out how you want to be remembered. It's your story, and the stakes are low, so it's okay to set your sights high.

Once you have come up with something, write this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit or add to it later.

## Your Vitals

These are the core-most stats of your character. They represent the raw capabilities and limits of your mind and body.

### Experience

When the game begins, you will start with some experience (XP). During the game and between sessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills, abilities, and more. See the Spending Experience section to learn more. After making your character, you may begin spending your XP.

### Ability Dice

Players have four important stats—might, agility, cunning, and presence. These traits define your physical and mental abilities, and are used to determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task you attempt to do.

- Might  
  Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude. High might allows you to push through locked doors, lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles without rest.

- Agility  
  Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and reflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a summersault on a tightrope.

- Cunning  
  Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses. High cunning allows you to recall information you've learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and discern fact from fiction.

- Presence  
  Presence is your charm, charisma, and social influence. High presence allows you to persuade guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone about it.

### Assigning Dice to your core stats

Your prowess in each of these abilities is represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the ability's corresponding die and add it to the result.

The first step in creating your character is determining which dice you will use for which stat. Typical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability, reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When you create your character, assign a d6 to two of your abilities, and a d4 to the remaining two.

## Movement

By default, you have a 60 feet move speed. That means that when you take the dash action (see the Combat section), you can cover that distance. Note that your move speed is negatively affected by equipment penalties (like armor).

When swimming, you have a swim speed of 15 feet. This is also negatively affected by equipment penalties: don't swim with heavy armor on.

When climbing, your move speed is 5 feet. This is not affected by equipment penalties.

## Health

The health of your character is represented by a combination of your hit points, heart die, and wounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take wounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will fall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and taking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too many wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of these systems will be explained further in the following sections.

### Hit Points

Hit points represent your physical health. Damage causes your hit points to fall by a corresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer to death. When you create a character, you start at 40 hit points. If your hit points ever reach 0, you can choose to immediately go unconscious. If you don't, you go unconscious after 10 minutes if your hit points are still at 0.

Your hit points can go negative as well. If your hit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of your maximum hit points, you die.

When you take a long rest, your hit points return to their maximum.

### Heart Die

Your heart die represents your stamina. It manifests itself when you roll dice to perform challenging actions. With very few exceptions, this die will be part of every roll you make. When you create a character, it starts at a maximum of a d8.

Other creatures can have larger or smaller heart dice. A rat, for example, will only have a d4 heart die, while an adult dragon would use a d20. It is possible to increase your own heart die beyond a d8, but it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.

Sometimes, there will be effects that cause your heart die to increase or decrease. This means replacing your heart die with a die of a larger or smaller size. For example, decreasing your heart die from a d8 would mean replacing it with a d6.

### Wounds

When you take damage in Heart Rush, it can mean different things depending on how much damage you take. If it's less than 10 damage, this represents minor injuries—nothing that poses a real threat. However, if you take 10 or more damage, this represents something serious—a wound. The exact details of taking wounds and healing them will be described later in the Combat section.

## Your Niche

### Kin & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and has a different upbringing. When you create a character, choose a race from the Kin & Culture section. You gain the aspects and abilities that come from choosing that race.

Many races have multiple heritages within that race. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities of the race, as well as those of a chosen heritage.

### Talents

Talents are specialized abilities that you know and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing your play style and differentiating you from anyone else in the world. Although you do not start with any talents, they can be purchased with XP, with which you start the game and can immediately use to buy talents.

### Background

Your background describes your past life and skills. Choose up to three professions and distribute 4 ranks between them. They can all be in one, or they can be spread between them. Whenever you make a skill check that one or more of your professions would apply to, add your rank in the relevant professions to that roll.

#### Example

Let's say you choose “Diplomat” and “Tutor for Nobility” as your professions, and distribute 3 ranks to the first, and 1 rank to the latter. If you were making a skill check to persuade someone of something, you could add 3 to that roll due to your background as a diplomat.

### Aspects

[[Example  
Let's say you choose “Diplomat” and “Tutor for Nobility” as your professions, and distribute 3 ranks to the first, and 1 rank to the latter. If you were making a skill check to persuade someone of something, you could add 3 to that roll due to your background as a diplomat.]]

For every facet of your character that cannot be described with abilities and skills, they can be described with aspects. Your aspects describe the features and traits from your personality, background, and experiences that make you distinct—both positive and negative.

When you first create your character, you gain three destiny points (DP). You will gain and lose DP each session as you spend them to benefit from your positive aspects and gain them by letting your negative ones shine through. If you ever start a session with fewer than three DP, you instead start with three DP. You cannot have more than 10 DP.

As you play your character, you will gather more aspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has two parts: its description, and its rank.

#### Description

The description describes the aspect as a whole, and should be a phrase or a few words to describe your character. It should be a significant personality trait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed title, or some sort of reputation. For example, “Bullheaded,” “Record everything,” “Chronic headaches,” “Kleptomaniac,” “Fortune teller,” “Leave no one behind,” “I fear nothing,” “I can see straight into your soul” and “I want revenge for my father” can all be aspect descriptions. Do not choose generic things, like “good at most thing” or “lucky”, since they will apply to everything, or be too vague to decide if they should apply to a situation. If the GM says your aspect description is too generic, you need to choose a new one, or make it more specific.

#### Rank

Next, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an aspect represents how influential that aspect is over who you are, and will determine the modifier to your rolls. The rank will be a number between one and five, though in some cases it can be increased even further.

[[Example  
Let's say you have the aspects “Diplomat” at rank 2, and “I need revenge for my family” at rank 3. You have just met the queen and are trying to convince her that civil war is imminent. When you make the skill check to convince her of this truth, you spend 3 DP to increase your roll by 3, successfully convincing her. However, moments later you find out that the queen herself was complicit in your family's murders. The GM invokes your aspect for revenge—you gain 2 DP, but must now exact revenge, or else be forced to pay 2 DP instead.]]

### Using your Aspect For Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an aspect's rank, you may add that much to any skill check. In order to use this, whatever roll you are making must align with the meaning of your aspect, as approved by the GM.

For example, if you had the aspect “Leave no one behind” at rank two, and you were trying to save a friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and add 2 to a die roll made to break open the bars of the cell.

Or, for example, if you had the aspect “I want revenge for my father” at rank four, you could spend four DP and add 4 to any skill check that was related to getting revenge for your father.

If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll, use only the highest ranking aspect that applies.

### Using your Aspect For Destiny points

In contrast, if an aspect would complicate a situation or indicate you were bad at something, you may choose to do whatever your aspect would suggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect's rank.

“Bum leg,” “Kleptomaniac,” and “Quick to draw my sword” are examples of negative aspects. If you role-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the GM will award DP.

For example, if a bookstore owner insults you, and you have the aspect “Quick to draw my sword” at rank three, you would gain three DP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-owner.

Likewise, if you were chasing after a fleeing thief, rather than making a skill check to keep up with them, you could choose to fail the roll, citing your bum leg and taking DP corresponding to the rank of the aspect.

### Creating your Aspects

When you create your character, create two aspects. You will gain two more from your race and culture and you may gain more throughout the game. All aspects start at rank one when they are created, unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater than rank five.

When creating an aspect, it is generally a good idea to have aspects with both positive and negative sides to them. Without any negative aspects, you have no way of gaining more destiny points, and therefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Also look out for aspects that can be both positive and negative aspects. For example, “Kleptomaniac" could be used

[[Burn through those DP  
To get the most out of your character, you should be invoking your aspects frequently. DP are not meant to be a precious resource—spend them, and then make more by invoking your negative ones. When creating your character, make sure to create aspects that you're going to enjoy using; you'll be using them a lot.]]

[[Advanced Character Creation  
Sometimes, you want an even more in-depth character creation process. If this is something that interests everyone in the group, check out the advanced character creation rules in the Advanced Character Creation section.]]

## Wounds

When you take wounds, they will have a description and a rank, just like an aspect. You may use wounds as aspects as well, though you cannot gain more than 5 DP from invoking the wound, even if the rank of the wound is higher.

For example, if you have the rank 12 wound, "Guts spilling out,” you could gain 5 DP by taking a minus 12 penalty to nearly any athletics check, since it'd be logical that having that type of wound would make it very difficult to do almost anything physical.

## Progress

There are six different ranks of combat power you can start at in Heart Rush. With each rank, you have access to more combat abilities. When you first start to play, everyone should agree which rank to begin the game at.

At rank 1, players are barely more than commoners with a desire for excitement; at rank 4, players are incredible combatants, likely known throughout their community; and at rank 6 and beyond, players are at low heroic levels; with everything else falling somewhere in between.

At each rank, you gain new abilities. If you are starting at a rank higher than rank 1, gain all the abilities from each previous rank, and start with XP equal to the corresponding value in the row.

## Combat Ranks, Classes, Subclasses, & Paragon Levels

While you will gain XP every session, you progress in combat ranks at the GM's discretion. In general, you should expect to graduate to the next combat rank around when you have an amount of total XP corresponding to the respective rank, as outlined in the table above. However, it is ultimately up to the GM.

### Rank 0

At this rank, you have no special abilities beyond those that you purchase with your XP.

[[GM Note  
When determining when to grant players the next combat rank, it's generally a good idea to wait until a suitably impressive fight has been won by the party. These combat ranks are major upgrades in player combat power, so they act as a great reward for players accepting and defeating more dangerous fights.]]

### Rank 1

When you reach rank 1, you will have to choose a class, as listed in the Classes section. Your class will determine what role you have in combat—tanking heavy blows, dealing damage, or supporting your teammates.

You are welcome to do whatever you want in combat, but your class will give you an edge in its respective role. Mark down all of the abilities for that class that are at or below rank 1.

### Rank 2

Upon reaching rank 2, you will have to choose a subclass. Each class has a few subclasses, which are specializations of your class. You must choose one of them. Mark down all of the abilities for your class and subclass that are at or below rank 2.

Additionally, at this stage you must decide if you wish to become spelltouched. Spelltouched are a universal subclass specializing in using elements to deal damage. You can read more about them in the Spelltouched section.

### Rank 3

When you reach rank 3, you unlock more abilities in your subclass. Mark down all of the abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 3.

### Rank 4

At rank 4, you unlock the last abilities from your subclass. Mark down all of the abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 4.

### Rank 5 and above

Finally, upon reaching rank 5, and for each rank thereafter, you gain a paragon level. When you gain a paragon level, you may choose and gain an ability from the Paragon Abilities section. These abilities represent heroic level capstones to various combat archetypes.

## Advice For New Groups

If everyone in your group is brand new to Heart Rush, rank 0 is a good place to start. There are many rules that only kick into play once you have a class, and Heart Rush combat can take some time to wrap your head around, so it can be nice to start small.
