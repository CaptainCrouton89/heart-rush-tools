# Building Your Character

As you make a character in Heart Rush, remember that at the center of every Heart Rush character is their heart. It is the foundation on which you build your life, your soul; it is the chassis and essence of your decisions and their consequences; and it is what drives you forward. You are building an entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.

## Your Dream

With this in mind, build a character that has a vision towards what they want to achieve. You should have a dream of what you want to do in the world, one that is complex and difficult and worthy of the caliber of legend you wish to become. Remember—you determine the direction the story takes. There's no goal to this game besides the one you set for yourself.

So speak with your GM about the world in which the game takes place, and figure out how you want to be remembered. It's your story, and the stakes are low, so it's okay to set your sights high.

Once you have come up with something, write this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit or add to it later.

## Kin & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and has a different upbringing. When you create a character, choose a race from the Kin & Culture section. You gain the aspects and abilities that come from choosing that race (aspects and abilities will be explained later—for now, just pick a race that sounds cool).

Many races have multiple heritages or subraces within that race. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities of the race, as well as those of a chosen heritage. For example, the race Dwarf has a base ability, but then you may choose the subrace "Aureum" which includes two aspects and another ability.

## Your Vitals

These are the core-most stats of your character. They represent the raw capabilities and limits of your mind and body.

### Experience

When the game begins, you will start with some experience (XP). During the game and between sessions, you may spend XP to upgrade your vitals, gain new abilities, and more. See the Spending Experience section to learn more. After making your character, you may begin spending your XP.

### Ability Dice

Players have four important stats—might, agility, cunning, and presence. These traits define your physical and mental abilities, and are used to determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task you attempt to do.

#### Might

Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude. High might allows you to push through locked doors, lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles without rest.

#### Agility

Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and reflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a summersault on a tightrope.

#### Cunning

Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses. High cunning allows you to recall information you've learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and discern fact from fiction.

#### Presence

Presence is your charm, charisma, and social influence. High presence allows you to persuade guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone about it.

### Assigning Dice to your core stats

Your prowess in each of these abilities is represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the ability's corresponding die and add it to the result.

The first step in creating your character is determining which dice you will use for which stat. Typical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability, reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When you create your character, assign a d6 to two of your abilities, and a d4 to the remaining two.

### Movement

By default, you have a 60 feet move speed. That means that when you take the dash action (see the Combat section), you can cover that distance. Note that your move speed is negatively affected by equipment penalties (like armor).

When swimming, you have a swim speed of 15 feet. This is also negatively affected by equipment penalties: don't swim with heavy armor on.

When climbing, your move speed is 5 feet. This is not affected by equipment penalties.

### Health

The health of your character is represented by a combination of your hit points, heart die, and wounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take wounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will fall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and taking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too many wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of these systems will be explained further in the following sections.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent your physical health. Damage causes your hit points to fall by a corresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer to death. When you create a character, you start at 40 hit points. If your hit points ever reach 0, you can choose to immediately go unconscious. If you don't, you go unconscious after 10 minutes if your hit points are still at 0.

Your hit points can go negative as well. If your hit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of your maximum hit points, you die.

When you take a long rest, your hit points return to their maximum.

#### Heart Die

Your heart die represents your stamina. It manifests itself when you roll dice to perform challenging actions. With very few exceptions, this die will be part of every roll you make. When you create a character, it starts at a maximum of a d8.

Other creatures can have larger or smaller heart dice. A rat, for example, will only have a d4 heart die, while an adult dragon would use a d20. It is possible to increase your own heart die beyond a d8, but it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.

Sometimes, there will be effects that cause your heart die to increase or decrease. This means replacing your heart die with a die of a larger or smaller size. For example, decreasing your heart die from a d8 would mean replacing it with a d6.

#### Wounds

When you take damage in Heart Rush, it can mean different things depending on how much damage you take. If it's less than 10 damage, this represents minor injuries—nothing that poses a real threat. However, if you take 10 or more damage, this represents something serious—a wound. The exact details of taking wounds and healing them will be described later in the Combat section.

## Your Age and Experience

[[Note
These rules are optional. They add a little further granularity to character creation for groups that enjoy high degrees of customization. If you are new to Heart Rush, feel free to ignore these rules.]]

Your character's age shapes their capabilities and approach to life. When creating your character, choose an age category that fits your concept: young, adult, or elderly. Each age brings its own advantages and challenges.

### Age Categories

Three age categories exist—young, adult, and elderly—each reflecting different life stages and experiences.

#### Young

Young characters are full of potential and recover quickly from setbacks. Their bodies heal fast and their minds eagerly absorb new skills. What qualifies as "young" varies by culture and species—for humans this might be late teens to mid-twenties, but adapt as appropriate for your character concept.

- **Profession Ranks**: Start with 2 ranks to distribute among your professions
- **Choose TWO benefits**:
  - **Natural Learner**: Profession advancement requires 1 fewer challenge to complete (minimum 1)
  - **Fast Healer**: Wounds heal at twice the normal rate. A wound that would normally take 4 days to reduce by one rank instead takes 2 days
  - **Young and Foolish**: When you accept a complication or negative aspect invocation, gain 1 extra DP beyond the normal amount

#### Adult

Adults represent the baseline of capability—experienced enough to be competent, young enough to be vigorous. This represents the prime years of most characters' lives, when they've established themselves but still have their full physical capabilities.

- **Profession Ranks**: Start with the standard 4 ranks to distribute among your professions. You cannot distribute more than 3 ranks to a single profession.
- **No special benefits or penalties**: Adults are the balanced default

#### Elderly

Elderly characters have accumulated significant life experience, though their bodies have slowed with age. The definition of "elderly" depends on your character's background—a hard life might age someone prematurely, while a comfortable existence might see them maintaining vitality into their later years.

- **Profession Ranks**: Start with 4 ranks to distribute among your professions. You cannot distribute more than 3 ranks to a single profession.
- **Physical Limitation**: Your movement speed is reduced by 20 feet
- **Choose ONE benefit**:
  - **Wisdom of Experience**: Choose one of your starting professions. When making skill checks with this profession, you may reroll any 1s on your dice (this does not trigger complications)
  - **Deep Knowledge**: You've studied one subject extensively. Start with a rank 3 aspect related to accumulated knowledge, such as "Living Encyclopedia of Ancient History" or "Knows Every Herb in the Forest"
  - **Frail Body, Sharp Mind**: Start with the aspect "Frail" at rank 3. This aspect can only be invoked negatively (representing physical weakness) but provides the normal DP when you do so

### Choosing Your Age

Consider how your character's age intersects with their profession ranks:

- A young character with 2 ranks might be talented in one field or dabbling in several
- An adult with 4 ranks has had time to establish themselves professionally
- An elderly character's 5 ranks represent a lifetime of accumulated expertise

Remember that these mechanics reinforce narrative choices. A young character should feel energetic but inexperienced. An elderly character should feel wise but physically limited. Adults sit comfortably in between—competent without being exceptional in any particular way.

## Profession

Your character's professional background defines their expertise and capabilities. Professions represent broad life paths—like Blacksmith, Diplomat, or Sea Captain—that encompass related skills and knowledge. They advance through practical use: completing challenging tasks and undertaking significant missions that push your expertise to new levels. This usage-based system ensures your character grows through meaningful accomplishments rather than abstract point spending.

### Core Concepts

**Professions as Background**: Each profession represents your character's life path and accumulated expertise. These are broad backgrounds that encompass many related skills and knowledge.

**Profession Ranks**:

- **Rank 1**: +1 (Novice)
- **Rank 2**: +2 (Apprentice)
- **Rank 3**: +3 (Journeyman)
- **Rank 4**: +4 (Expert)
- **Rank 5**: +5 (Master)
- **Rank 6+**: +6, +7, etc. (Legendary)

When making a skill check (as described in Gameplay Basics), add your profession rank to the roll if the profession applies.

### Usage-Based Advancement

Professions advance through **practical application** in two ways:

#### 1. Challenges

Use your profession to overcome a difficult task:

- Must have a CN ≥ (heart die max + current profession rank)
  - Example: With d8 heart die and rank 2, challenges must be CN 10+
- Must have meaningful consequences for failure
- Cannot be immediately retried if failed

Mark one challenge completed when you succeed. Challenges completed during missions count toward your advancement—many missions naturally include several challenges along the way.

#### 2. Missions

Complete a significant professional undertaking that pushes your expertise:

A mission is a substantial use of your profession that goes beyond routine work. Before starting, the player and GM should agree on:

- **The Goal**: What specific achievement are you trying to accomplish?
- **Why It's a Mission**: Does this represent a significant professional milestone?

The mission succeeds when you achieve the agreed-upon goal, regardless of how you get there. You might:

- Make multiple profession checks over the course of the mission
- Make a single crucial check at a key moment
- Accomplish it without any rolls through clever preparation
- Use completely different professions than expected to achieve your goal

Missions often include multiple challenges within them—a heist might require picking locks (challenge), forging documents (challenge), and evading guards (challenge). Each of these counts as a separate challenge for advancement purposes.

The key is achieving something significant to your profession, not following a specific mechanical path.

**Guidelines for Missions**:

- **Scope**: Usually weeks or months of effort (but can be shorter if sufficiently significant)
- **Significance**: Would other professionals in your field be impressed?
- **Expertise**: Does this push what someone at your rank can achieve?
- **Stakes**: What's at risk - reputation, resources, relationships, or lives?

### Advancement Requirements

| Current → Next | Rank Names              | Challenges | Mission Required | Practice Time |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 0 → 1          | → Novice                | 2          | No               | 1 week        |
| 1 → 2          | Novice → Apprentice     | 3          | No               | 4 weeks       |
| 2 → 3          | Apprentice → Journeyman | 4          | Yes              | 9 weeks       |
| 3 → 4          | Journeyman → Expert     | 5          | Yes              | 16 weeks      |
| 4 → 5          | Expert → Master         | 6          | Yes              | 25 weeks      |
| 5 → 6          | Master → Legendary      | 7          | Yes              | 36 weeks      |
| 6 → 7          | Legendary →             | 8          | Yes              | 49 weeks      |

**Practice Time**: Represents dedicated downtime training. You can reduce this by 1 week for each challenge completed beyond the minimum (including challenges completed during missions).

### Starting Professions

Choose up to three professions and distribute ranks between them based on your age category:

- **Young**: 2 ranks to distribute (e.g., one profession at rank 2)
- **Adult**: 4 ranks to distribute (e.g., one profession at rank 3 and one at rank 1)
- **Elderly**: 5 ranks to distribute (e.g., one profession at rank 3 and two at rank 1)

These initial ranks are free and reflect your life before adventuring. You cannot distribute more than 3 ranks to a single profession.

**Maritime Professions**: Sailor, Sea Captain, Navigator, Marine, Shipwright

**Performance Professions**: Bard, Actor, Acrobat, Storyteller, Jester

Professions should be broad enough to cover multiple related activities. A "Thief" can pick locks, move stealthily, fence goods, and forge documents. A "Merchant" can appraise goods, negotiate deals, manage logistics, and understand markets.

Work with your GM to ensure your profession reflects a realistic life path from the game world.

### Creating Missions

Missions are defined by their goals, not their methods. When a player proposes a mission:

1. **Define the Goal**: What specific, measurable achievement are you pursuing?
2. **Confirm Significance**: Does this feel like a real professional milestone?
3. **Play It Out**: The mission unfolds through regular gameplay
4. **Recognize Success**: When the goal is achieved, the mission is complete

**Missions and Challenges**: Remember that missions naturally generate challenges. A Sea Captain navigating through a supernatural storm might face challenges like "Navigate by dead reckoning when compasses fail" and "Keep the crew from panicking." These all count as challenges for advancement while also contributing to the mission's success.

**Examples of Types of Missions**:

- **Create Something Extraordinary**: "Forge armor from moonsilver that actually works"
- **Establish Something Lasting**: "Build trade route that survives without me"
- **Achieve the Impossible**: "Steal from the Archmage without him ever knowing"
- **Solve a Mystery**: "Decipher the lost theorem of the ancients"
- **Save Lives at Scale**: "Get medicine through the blockade to save the city"

**What Makes a Good Mission**:

- Has a clear end condition that everyone can recognize
- Represents genuine professional achievement
- Could be accomplished multiple ways
- Matters to the character's story

**Common Mission Pitfalls**:

- Too vague: "Become a better thief" (What does success look like?)
- Too simple: "Pick a hard lock" (That's a challenge, not a mission)
- Too mechanical: "Make a CN 20 check" (Missions are about goals, not rolls)

Remember: A clever thief who accomplishes their heist without picking a single lock has still completed their mission. The achievement matters, not the method.

### Using Professions in Play

**Direct Application (Full Bonus)**:

- Blacksmith forging a sword
- Thief picking a lock
- Diplomat negotiating a treaty

## Talents

Talents are specialized abilities that you know and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing your play style and differentiating you from anyone else in the world. Although you do not start with any talents, they can be purchased with XP, with which you start the game and can immediately use to buy talents.

## Aspects

For every facet of your character that cannot be described with abilities and skills, they can be described with aspects. Your aspects describe the features and traits from your personality, relationships, and experiences that make you distinct—both positive and negative.

When you first create your character, you gain three destiny points (DP). You will gain and lose DP each session as you spend them to benefit from your positive aspects and gain them by letting your negative ones shine through. If you ever start a session with fewer than three DP, you instead start with three DP. You cannot have more than 10 DP.

As you play your character, you will gather more aspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has two parts: its description, and its rank.

### Description

The description describes the aspect as a whole, and should be a phrase or a few words to describe your character. It should be a significant personality trait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, physical characteristic, reputation, or relationship—but not your profession or background, which are represented separately.

**Good aspect examples include:**

- **Personality traits:** "Never met a stranger," "Perfectionist to a fault," "Speaks before thinking"
- **Physical characteristics:** "Distinctive red hair," "Scarred hands tell stories," "Always cold"
- **Beliefs and values:** "The truth must be preserved," "Children are the future," "Magic corrupts everything"
- **Relationships:** "Owes the Thieves' Guild a favor," "Sworn enemy of House Blackwood," "My sister's keeper"
- **Reputations:** "Known for keeping promises," "The one who got away," "Cursed by the old gods"

Do not choose generic things, like "good at most things" or "lucky", since they will apply to everything, or be too vague to decide if they should apply to a situation. If the GM says your aspect description is too generic, you need to choose a new one, or make it more specific.

### Rank

Next, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an aspect represents how influential that aspect is over who you are, and will determine the modifier to your rolls. The rank will be a number between one and five, though in some cases it can be increased even further.

[[Example  
Let's say you have the aspects "Known for keeping promises" at rank 2, and "The truth must be preserved" at rank 3. You're trying to convince someone to trust you with sensitive information. You spend 2 DP to add +2 to your persuasion roll, as your reputation for reliability helps. Later, when negotiating with a corrupt official who's lying about evidence, you can't resist calling out their lies due to your truth-preserving nature—you gain 3 DP, but the negotiation becomes hostile.]]

### Using your Aspect For Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an aspect's rank, you may add that much to any skill check. In order to use this, whatever roll you are making must align with the meaning of your aspect, as approved by the GM.

For example, if you had the aspect "Leave no one behind" at rank two, and you were trying to save a friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and add 2 to a die roll made to break open the bars of the cell.

Or, if you had the aspect "Never met a stranger" at rank three, you could spend 3 DP and add 3 to a persuasion check when trying to get information from tavern patrons, as your friendly nature helps you connect with people.

If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll, use only the highest ranking aspect that applies.

### Using your Aspect For Destiny Points

In contrast, if an aspect would complicate a situation or indicate you were bad at something, you may choose to do whatever your aspect would suggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect's rank.

Aspects like "Scarred hands tell stories," "Kleptomaniac," and "Quick to draw my sword" can work against you in certain situations. If you role-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the GM will award DP.

For example, if a bookstore owner insults you, and you have the aspect "Quick to draw my sword" at rank three, you would gain three DP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-owner.

Or, if you have "Never met a stranger" at rank 2, you might gain 2 DP by immediately approaching suspicious travelers in a friendly manner instead of being cautious, potentially walking into an ambush.

Likewise, if you were trying to sneak past guards, and you have "Distinctive red hair" at rank 2, you could choose to be spotted because your hair gives you away, gaining 2 DP but complicating the situation.

### Creating your Aspects

When you create your character, create two aspects. You will gain at least one more from your age category (Young characters get "Eager to Prove Myself," Elderly get "Wisdom of Years"), and two more from your race and culture. You may gain more throughout the game. All aspects start at rank one when they are created, unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater than rank five.

When creating an aspect, it is generally a good idea to have aspects with both positive and negative sides to them. Without any negative aspects, you have no way of gaining more destiny points, and therefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Look for aspects that can be both positive and negative. For example, "Kleptomaniac" could help you pocket useful items unnoticed, but also compel you to steal at inappropriate times.

#### What Makes a Good Aspect

**Effective aspects are:**

- **Double-edged:** Can help in some situations but cause problems in others
- **Specific enough to be interesting:** "Chronic insomniac" rather than "sometimes tired"
- **Personal and meaningful:** Connected to your character's story and goals
- **Actionable:** Clear when and how they might apply

**Avoid these common pitfalls:**

- **Too broad:** "Good at everything" or "Lucky" apply everywhere and become generic
- **Only positive:** "Brilliant tactician" with no downside gives you no way to earn DP
- **Too narrow:** "Afraid of blue flowers" rarely comes up in most adventures
- **Purely mechanical:** "Gets +2 to sword fighting" lacks narrative interest
- **Professional skills:** Your profession already covers your professional abilities

#### Interconnected Aspects

Consider how your aspects might work together to tell a cohesive story:

**Example character concept:** A disgraced noble seeking redemption

- **Aspect 1:** "Fallen from noble grace" (social connections but also shame)
- **Aspect 2:** "Gambling destroyed my family" (understands risk but acts compulsively)

These aspects create a character whose past mistakes drive their current motivations while providing both positive and negative mechanical effects that reinforce the character's narrative.

[[Burn through those DP  
To get the most out of your character, you should be invoking your aspects frequently. DP are not meant to be a precious resource—spend them, and then make more by invoking your negative ones. When creating your character, make sure to create aspects that you're going to enjoy using; you'll be using them a lot.]]

## Starting Gear

Begin play with whatever equipment makes sense for your character concept and background. Work with your GM to ensure your starting gear fits both the fiction of your character and the tone of the campaign. There are no restrictions based on age or background—a young noble might have fine clothes and a sword, while an elderly scholar might carry ancient tomes and exploration gear.

## Progress

Your combat prowess grows through **bloodmarks**—supernatural battle-scars earned by performing legendary feats in combat. Unlike experience points (which you spend on talents, aspects, and character upgrades), bloodmarks represent your evolution from warrior to legend.

See **Bloodmarks** for complete details on:
- How bloodmarks are earned through memorable combat achievements
- What abilities each bloodmark unlocks
- Battle-tested combat approaches that guide you toward coherent fighting styles

### Starting Bloodmarks

When creating your character, choose a starting bloodmark level that fits your campaign's power level. When you first start to play, everyone should agree which bloodmark level to begin the game at.

At 0 bloodmarks, you're barely more than a commoner with a dream; at 4 bloodmarks, you're an incredible combatant likely known throughout your community; and at 5+ bloodmarks, you're entering heroic tiers of power.

| Bloodmarks | Experience Level | Starting XP | Bloodmark Abilities |
|------------|------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **0** | Fresh adventurer | 5 | None yet |
| **1** | Emerging combatant | 15 | 1 Specialization |
| **2** | Specialized fighter | 30 | 2 Specializations + 1 Signature Ability |
| **3** | Advanced warrior | 50 | 2 Specializations + 3 Signature Abilities |
| **4** | Minor hero | 80 | 2 Specializations + 3 Signature Abilities + 1 Combat Mastery |
| **5+** | Legendary champion | 120 + 40/bloodmark | All previous + 1 Paragon Ability per bloodmark beyond 4th |

When starting at higher bloodmark levels, you choose your abilities from the pools in **Bloodmarks** (Specializations, Signature Abilities, Combat Masteries, and Paragon Abilities based on your bloodmark level). You also receive the listed starting XP to spend on talents, aspects, hit points, and ability dice.

### Bloodmarks vs Experience Points

These are two separate progression systems that work together:

- **Bloodmarks** unlock combat abilities and measure your combat prowess. The GM awards bloodmarks for legendary combat achievements (roughly one every 4-6 sessions). These are narrative milestones that mark your growth as a warrior.

- **Experience Points (XP)** are spent on talents, aspects, hit points, and ability dice. You gain XP regularly throughout play and spend it between sessions to customize your character.

See **Experience & Advancement** for how to spend XP on character development.

## Advice For New Groups

If everyone in your group is brand new to Heart Rush, starting at 0 bloodmarks is a good place to begin.
