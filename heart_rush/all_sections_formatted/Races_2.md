# More Races

## Chulpe

Savage, bestial humanoids that combine the worst aspects of predatory animals with a cruel intelligence, the Chulpe are among the most feared races in the known world. These monstrous beings possess powerful, muscular bodies covered in coarse fur, with elongated snouts filled with razor-sharp teeth and claws capable of rending flesh from bone. While their intelligence varies between subspecies, all Chulpe share an insatiable hunger for meat—particularly humanoid flesh—and a pack-based social structure built around dominance, violence, and the hunt. Their origins are shrouded in mystery, with some scholars believing them to be the result of ancient magical experiments, while others claim they are simply evolution's answer to creating the perfect predator.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Varies by subrace
- **Height:** Varies by subrace
- **Weight:** Varies by subrace

### Predatory Instincts

**Passive ability**

Your bestial nature grants you enhanced senses and combat reflexes. You have advantage on cunning checks to track creatures and detect threats. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 60 feet, and when you deal damage to a wounded creature (one that has taken a wound), you regain 2 hit points.

### Skree (The Pack Runners)

The smaller and more numerous of the Chulpe subspecies, Skree are vicious pack hunters roughly the size of large wolves. What they lack in individual strength compared to their Terrogone cousins, they more than make up for in speed, cunning, and sheer bloodthirsty aggression. Skree society is built around loose pack structures that form and dissolve based on hunting success and dominance displays. They are known for their hit-and-run tactics, using their superior numbers and coordination to bring down prey much larger than themselves.

Skree live in the harsh borderlands and wilderness areas, often competing with their larger Terrogone relatives for territory and prey. Their lean, wiry builds make them excellent climbers and runners, allowing them to pursue fleeing victims across virtually any terrain. While less intelligent than Terrogones, Skree possess a feral cunning that makes them expert ambush predators. They communicate through a complex series of growls, yips, and body language that allows entire packs to coordinate attacks with frightening efficiency.

The social structure of Skree packs is fluid and violent, with leadership constantly shifting as members challenge each other for dominance. They have no permanent settlements, instead following game trails and establishing temporary camps wherever the hunting is good. Skree reproduction is rapid, with large litters ensuring their numbers remain high despite their dangerous lifestyle and frequent conflicts with other predators.

### Aspects

- Bloodthirsty pack hunter
- Recklessly aggressive

### Pack Frenzy

**Passive ability**

Your violent nature intensifies when fighting alongside allies. When you are adjacent to an ally at the start of your turn, you gain one additional rush point. Additionally, when an adjacent ally deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that same creature until the end of the round.

### Terrogones (The Bone Crushers)

The massive, terrifying cousins of the Skree, Terrogones are apex predators that stand six feet high even when moving on all fours. These hulking monstrosities make their home in the savage wasteland of Echem Yiakraxis, where they have adapted to be the ultimate hunters in one of the world's most dangerous regions. Unlike their smaller Skree relatives, Terrogones possess enough intelligence to use crude tools, set elaborate traps, and employ sophisticated hunting strategies that have made them the undisputed masters of their domain.

Terrogone society is built around small family groups led by the largest and most successful hunters. These family units claim vast territories within Echem Yiakraxis, marking their borders with the bones of their victims and engaging in brutal conflicts with neighboring groups over prime hunting grounds. Their intelligence, while not matching that of most humanoid races, is sufficient for them to understand fear as a weapon, often keeping captured prey alive for days to terrorize other potential victims.

The physical presence of a Terrogone is overwhelming—their massive frames are covered in thick, mottled fur that provides protection against the harsh environment of their homeland, while their enormous heads house jaws capable of crushing armor and bone with equal ease. They have developed a complex relationship with the twisted ecosystem of Echem Yiakraxis, serving as both apex predator and, in some cases, protector of the region's most dangerous secrets. Their reproduction is slow and deliberate, with mated pairs raising their young together for several years before the offspring are strong enough to claim their own territory.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator with insatiable hunger
- Monstrous and intimidating presence

#### Crushing Might

**Passive ability**

Your massive size and strength make you a devastating opponent. You count as one size larger for the purposes of grappling, pushing, and intimidation checks. When you deal damage to a creature smaller than you with a melee attack, they must make a presence saving throw against your might challenge number or gain two levels of frightened toward you until the end of the encounter. Additionally, when using the might stance with heavy weapons, you may add your weapon die to the attack roll twice instead of once.

Looking at the provided description and abilities, here's the Sylthik race following the template:

## Sylthik

The Sylthik are a serpentine people whose scaled bodies and ophidian features mark them as children of the great snake goddess Sythikranos. These proud and merciless beings view themselves as the apex of creation, considering all other races to be inferior creatures unworthy of respect or mercy. Their society is built around a complex religious hierarchy that governs every aspect of daily life, from marriage and trade to warfare and diplomacy.

Ruled by venomous high priests who claim direct communion with their serpent deity, Sylthik settlements are often found in desert oases, ancient ruins, or deep caverns where snakes naturally congregate. Their architecture favors winding passages and circular chambers that mirror the movements of their sacred serpents. The Sylthik believe that their goddess will one day return to reclaim the world, and they see themselves as her chosen instruments to prepare for that glorious day.

Their natural ability to communicate with snakes makes them formidable opponents, as they often employ serpentine allies in their schemes. The Sylthik take great pride in their venomous nature, viewing their ability to kill with a single bite as proof of their divine superiority over the "warm-blooded vermin" that populate the world.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-7 feet (including tail length)
- **Weight:** 130-220 pounds

### Aspects

- Chosen of the serpent goddess
- Cold-blooded supremacist

### Snake Headed

**Passive ability.**
With the head of a snake, you have venomous fangs, which count as a light, piercing melee weapon. Once per day, you may inject venom with your bite, inflicting two levels of poisoned.

Additionally, your snake tongue gives you a superb ability to track down your prey. If you spend five minutes within 10 feet of someone, you always know which direction they are in when they are within 10 miles of you. If you bite them, the range extends to 100 miles instead.

### Disciple of Sythikranos

**Major ability.**
As a disciple of Sythikranos, you are granted occasional favors by your snake goddess. When you invoke the name of your patron god, choose one. You gain the ability for the next hour.

- You gain advantage on all attack rolls with your bite. Your bite afflicts an additional level of poisoned when you inject poison.
- Your snake scales harden and partially extend over the rest of your body. You have advantage on all defense rolls.
- You can communicate with snakes, and if any snakes are in the vicinity, a snake companion will join you within the next ten minutes. The snake cannot help in combat, but it can scout and observe at your command.

## Nyolci

The Nyolci are a maritime people whose distinctive cephalopod features mark them as some of the finest sailors and navigators in the known world. With humanoid bodies crowned by octopus-like heads bearing five dexterous tentacles and a sharp beak, they might seem alien to landlubbers, yet they have integrated seamlessly into coastal societies across every major port and trading hub.

Born from the marriage of sea and civilization, the Nyolci serve as the backbone of maritime commerce and exploration. Their natural affinity for water, combined with their ability to manipulate multiple objects simultaneously with their tentacles, makes them invaluable crew members, ship captains, and harbor masters. Their keen intuition for weather patterns, ocean currents, and the subtle signs that predict storms has saved countless vessels from disaster.

Despite their aquatic origins, the Nyolci have fully embraced life among the various races of the surface world. They can be found in every major port city, often serving as intermediaries between land-based merchants and the mysteries of the deep ocean. Their communities typically cluster around harbors, docks, and shipyards, where their expertise is most valued.

The Nyolci possess an almost supernatural ability to read people and situations, making them excellent negotiators and traders. This intuitive cunning, combined with their reputation for fairness in business dealings, has earned them respect and trust throughout the maritime world.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 140-220 pounds

### Aspects

- Master of wind and wave
- Reads hearts like tide charts

### Tentacle Dexterity

**Passive ability.**
Your five head tentacles can manipulate objects with surprising precision and independence. You can perform up to three separate object interactions per round instead of one. Additionally, you have advantage on any skill check that would benefit from manipulating multiple objects simultaneously, such as operating complex mechanisms, playing multiple instruments, or managing ship rigging.

### Oceanic Intuition

**Passive ability.**
Your deep connection to the sea grants you uncanny insight into both natural and social currents. You automatically succeed on navigation checks while at sea or following coastlines. Additionally, you have advantage on skill checks to predict weather, read people's intentions, or sense when someone is lying to you. Once per day, you may ask the GM one yes-or-no question about the immediate future of a situation you're currently in.

Looking at the example race template and the descriptions provided, I'll create these 9 races following the established format and mechanics consistent with Heart Rush's design principles.

## Skaag

The Skaag are a misunderstood people who have learned to thrive in the forgotten spaces beneath civilization. With the heads of rats and humanoid bodies, they are often met with disgust and fear by surface dwellers who believe them to be disease-ridden scavengers. The truth is far more complex—while the infamous Rat King Glathkus the Cruel has cast a dark shadow over their reputation, most Skaag live in large, loving families with a practical, survivalist culture.

These underground dwellers have developed an uncanny ability to find hidden treasures and avoid the many dangers that lurk in ruins and sewers. Their keen senses and natural wariness have kept their communities alive for generations in hostile environments. Though they prefer the safety of their subterranean homes, some Skaag venture to the surface world, hoping to prove that their people are more than the monsters they're believed to be.

Skaag settlements can be found in the undercities of major population centers across Alaria, connected by networks of tunnels that only they fully understand. Their communities are tight-knit but chaotic, with a "fend for yourself" mentality that produces remarkably resourceful individuals.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-100 pounds

### Aspects

- Misunderstood scavenger
- Underground survivor

### Accustomed to Darkness

**Passive ability.**
You can see in darkness as though it was dim light to a range of 45 feet, and can see in dim light as though it was bright light. You suffer no penalties for operating in underground or subterranean environments.

### Eye for Treasure

**Passive ability.**
Your whiskers and keen senses alert you to both opportunity and danger. If you would make a saving throw to avoid or mitigate the effects of a trap, you have advantage on that roll. If the trap deals damage, you take half as much damage. Additionally, your whiskers tingle when treasure or traps are within 1000 feet—you don't know which, but you can estimate distance by the intensity. You can perfectly appraise the value of rare artifacts and have advantage on checks to discern the nature of magical items.

## Satyr

The Satyr are creatures of primal passion and bloody revelry who have embraced their wild nature completely. With the upper bodies of humanoids and the lower bodies of goats, they reject the constraints of civilized clothing and armor, preferring to live as nature intended. Their culture revolves around ecstatic dances performed to haunting pipe music, often culminating in frenzied celebrations drenched in the blood of their prey.

These beings feed not just on blood, but on the raw emotion and chaos of the hunt and the kill. They are most alive during their blood-soaked festivities, where one plays the pipes while others dance themselves into transcendent states of violence and joy. To outsiders, these rituals appear horrifying, but to the Satyr they represent the purest expression of life itself.

Normal clothing and armor cannot accommodate their unique physiology, forcing them to rely on their natural resilience and supernatural abilities. They view civilized society with a mixture of pity and contempt, seeing it as a denial of the wild truth that courses through all living things.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds

### Aspects

- Wild and untamed
- Bloodthirsty reveler

### Blood Frenzy

**Major ability. Instant.**
When you kill a creature, you may shower yourself in its blood to enter an uncontrollable frenzy. For the next minute, you have A2 on all attack rolls and cannot choose the defensive stance. You must attack if able, prioritizing the nearest enemy.

### Enchanting Pipes

**Major ability. Full action.**
You play haunting melodies on your magical pipes. Choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear you. That creature must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. On a failure, they are charmed by you for the next hour and compelled to dance to your music, giving them D2 on all rolls. The charm immediately ends if you attack them, and they know they were charmed when the effect ends.

## Lyzine

The Lyzine are fallen nobility whose pride remains unbroken despite their exile to the depths below. With the graceful torsos of elegant humanoids seamlessly joined to the powerful, chitinous bodies of giant spiders, they embody both beauty and horror. Once rulers of great surface kingdoms, they were banished to the underground realms of Mez after their arrogance and cruelty became too much for even their subjects to bear.

Every year, the Lyzine attempt to reclaim their "rightful" place on the surface, sending expeditions to establish new footholds in the world above. They view themselves as inherently superior beings temporarily displaced by the jealousy and ignorance of lesser races. Their underground cities are marvels of web-architecture and dark elegance, maintained by strict hierarchies that mirror their lost surface kingdoms.

Despite their exile, the Lyzine have retained their sophisticated culture, complete with elaborate courts, intricate political maneuvering, and a refined aesthetic sense. They are skilled in both diplomacy and warfare, though their overwhelming pride often makes peaceful coexistence difficult.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Aspects

- Exiled nobility
- Inherently superior

### Arachnid Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed and can move across webs and similar surfaces without penalty. You can produce silk strong enough to support your weight, creating 50 feet of rope as an action. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to intimidate or impress others with displays of nobility or superiority.

### Web Weaver

**Heart ability. Full action.**
You can rapidly spin webs to control the battlefield. Choose a 20-foot square area within 30 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and creatures that enter or start their turn in the webbed area must make an agility saving throw against your cunning challenge number or become restrained. Creatures can break free with a successful might check against the same CN. The webs last for 10 minutes or until destroyed.

## Krell

The Krell are an ancient insectoid race whose very existence revolves around their massive colonial structure and absolute devotion to their queen. These chitinous beings live in enormous underground or mountain-carved hives that can house thousands of individuals, all working in perfect harmony toward the colony's goals. Every few centuries, when the current queen lays princess eggs, the colony prepares for the violent succession that will determine their future.

The princesses are raised in luxury for fifty years before engaging in ritual combat to the death. The survivor becomes the new queen, selects a mate, and leads a great migration called a "swarming" to establish a new colony elsewhere. During these swarmings, the Krell become a force of nature, destroying everything in their path as they claim new territory for their queen.

Individual Krell communicate through complex patterns of pheromones, antenna movements, and rhythmic footsteps that outsiders find impossible to decipher. While they possess vocal cords, they rarely use them, preferring their natural forms of communication. A single Krell poses little threat, but when the hive mobilizes, entire settlements vanish without a trace.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds

### Aspects

- Hive-minded
- Colony before self

### Hive Network

**Passive ability.**
You can communicate telepathically with other Krell within 1 mile through pheromone resonance. When within 30 feet of another Krell, you both gain advantage on attack rolls and cannot be surprised. You automatically know the general emotional state and basic intentions of any Krell within range.

### Swarm Tactics

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you are adjacent to at least one ally, you can coordinate a devastating group assault. Choose one enemy within reach of you or an adjacent ally. That enemy takes damage equal to your heart die + the number of allies adjacent to you. This ability can only be used once per engagement per target.

## Kendrel

The Kendrel are creatures of breathtaking beauty whose seahorse-like features embody the grace and mystery of the deep ocean. With flowing manes, elegant elongated faces, and bodies that shimmer with aquatic colors, they are considered among the most stunning beings in all of Alaria. Their culture revolves around elaborate courtship rituals, noble ceremonies, and the pursuit of aesthetic perfection in all things.

These peaceful beings make their homes in hidden fortress-cities within tropical coral reefs and underwater grottos, far from the conflicts that plague the surface world. The Kendrel are natural diplomats who prefer negotiation and artistry to violence, viewing warfare as crude and beneath their refined sensibilities. Their society is built on complex hierarchies of beauty, wisdom, and social grace.

Kendrel architecture seamlessly blends with natural coral formations, creating cities that appear to have grown from the ocean floor itself. They are master craftsmen who work with living coral, cultivated pearls, and other sea treasures to create works of art that can entrance even the most jaded observers.

### Vitals

- **Weight:** 100-160 pounds

### Aquatic Grace

**Passive ability.**
You have a swim speed of 40 feet and can breathe both air and water. While underwater, you move with supernatural grace, giving you advantage on all agility checks and rolls. You can communicate with natural sea creatures and have advantage on presence checks when interacting with any creature that can perceive beauty.

### Stunning Presence

**Major ability. Full action.**
Your otherworldly beauty briefly overwhelms those around you. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see you must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. Those who fail are stunned until the end of their next turn as they become transfixed by your appearance. Creatures that succeed are immune to this ability for 24 hours.

## Chargon

The Chargon are an enigmatic people whose eel-like heads and serpentine grace mask hearts filled with unexpected kindness. Despite their unsettling appearance—smooth, elongated skulls with large eyes and mouths full of needle-sharp teeth—they are among the most courteous and genuinely caring folk one might encounter. Their mysterious nature stems not from malice, but from a deep cultural appreciation for subtlety and the hidden currents that flow beneath surface interactions.

Masters of stealth and misdirection, the Chargon can slip through shadows and squeeze through impossibly tight spaces with fluid ease. Yet they use these abilities primarily to help others, appearing unexpectedly to offer aid to travelers in need or to resolve conflicts through subtle intervention. Their philosophy emphasizes moving through the world like water—adapting to obstacles rather than confronting them directly.

Chargon communities are often built in coastal caves or riverside settlements where they can easily access both land and water. They serve as intermediaries between different cultures, their natural talent for reading emotional undercurrents making them exceptional mediators and counselors.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 110-170 pounds

### Aspects

- Mysteriously kind
- Hidden depths

### Serpentine Mobility

**Passive ability.**
You can compress your body to fit through any opening large enough for a creature one size smaller than you. You have advantage on stealth checks and can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes. Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from creatures you have not attacked this round.

### Emotional Currents

**Heart ability. Instant.**
You can sense the emotional undercurrents around you with supernatural clarity. For the next minute, you know the current emotional state of all creatures within 30 feet and can detect lies automatically. Additionally, you can choose one creature in range—they must make a presence saving throw against your cunning challenge number or have their attitude toward you improved by one step (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to neutral, etc.).

## Tuktuk

The Tuktuk are a warrior culture of turtle-folk who have claimed the volcanic island of Tyvern as their ancestral home. Their thick, naturally armored shells and stocky builds make them nearly indestructible in battle, while their fierce code of honor drives them to seek glory through combat and conquest. These rugged fighters believe that strength must be proven repeatedly through trial by combat and dangerous undertakings.

Tuktuk society revolves around martial prowess and clan loyalty, with disputes settled through formal duels and leadership earned through demonstrations of courage in battle. Their island home has shaped them into excellent seafarers and raiders, though they prefer stand-up fights to sneaky tactics. Young Tuktuk must prove themselves through a series of increasingly dangerous challenges before they are accepted as full warriors.

The volcanic forges of Tyvern produce some of the finest weapons and armor in the known world, as the Tuktuk have learned to work volcanic glass and rare metals found only near active lava flows. Their settlements are built to withstand both enemy assault and the frequent volcanic activity that shapes their homeland.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 180-280 pounds

### Aspects

- Honor-bound warrior
- Tyvern-forged

### Natural Armor

**Passive ability.**
Your thick shell provides +2 natural armor defense that stacks with worn armor. When you use the defensive stance, you take one-quarter damage instead of half. You can withdraw into your shell as an action, becoming incapacitated but gaining total cover and reducing all damage to 1 point until you emerge (free action on your turn).

### Battle Fury

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you take damage that would cause a wound, your warrior's rage ignites. For the rest of the combat, you gain +2 to all attack rolls and your first successful attack each round deals an additional 1d6 damage. This effect ends if you go an entire round without attacking or taking damage.

## Alekroin

The Alekroin are massive alligator-folk whose imposing presence and predatory mindset have made them both feared and respected throughout the frozen wastes of Shykasas. These powerfully built beings stand shorter than most humanoids but possess incredible physical strength and an unwavering belief in the fundamental truth that everything in existence falls into two categories: predator or prey. Their culture has remained unchanged for millennia, as rigid and unyielding as the ice that covers their homeland.

Alekroin society operates on strict hierarchies determined by hunting prowess and the ability to dominate others. They view adaptation and change as signs of weakness, maintaining their ancient traditions even when circumstances might suggest otherwise. This stubborn adherence to "the old ways" has served them well in their harsh environment, where their natural abilities and proven methods continue to ensure survival.

Despite their fearsome reputation, the Alekroin possess keen intelligence and insatiable curiosity about the world beyond their territory. However, they approach all new experiences through the lens of their predator-prey worldview, constantly evaluating whether something represents a threat to be eliminated, prey to be hunted, or a potential tool for their own advancement.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 220-320 pounds

### Aspects

- Apex predator
- Frozen in tradition

### Predator's Instinct

**Passive ability.**
You can automatically identify the strongest and weakest creature in any group within 60 feet. You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are wounded, frightened, or have fewer hit points than you. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your might die and gain advantage on your next attack roll.

### Death Roll

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you successfully grapple a creature, you can attempt to perform a devastating death roll. Make an opposed might check—if you win, you deal damage equal to twice your might die and both you and the grappled creature fall prone. If you win by 5 or more, the creature takes a wound with rank equal to the difference between your rolls.

## Troenka

The Troenka are perhaps the most feared inhabitants of the great forests, beings of living wood whose greatest pleasure comes from tormenting travelers who dare enter their domain. These cruel entities appear as tall, gaunt humanoids of bark and branch, but possess the terrifying ability to assume the form of ordinary trees, becoming completely indistinguishable from the natural forest around them. Their strength is legendary, and their intelligence far greater than most give them credit for.

Unlike other woodland folk who might be protective of their forests, the Troenka simply enjoy causing suffering. They feel no need for food, water, or shelter, existing in a state of perfect self-sufficiency that has bred an overwhelming sense of superiority over all "lesser" beings. This arrogance, combined with their sadistic nature, makes them view any intruders as entertainment rather than threats.

Troenka settlements exist wherever ancient forests grow thick and dark—places like Ichneum, the Tenekee Woods, and Goranyakak. They create elaborate hunting grounds designed to trap and torment victims for extended periods, turning sections of forest into nightmarish mazes where screams echo between the trees.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 200-300 pounds

### Aspects

- Cruel tormentor
- Living wood

### Tree Form

**Major ability. Full action.**
You can transform into an ordinary-looking tree, becoming indistinguishable from natural vegetation. While in tree form, you are immobilized but gain the ability to sense all movement within 60 feet. You can remain in this form indefinitely and transform back as an action. Creatures must succeed on a CN 15 cunning check to identify you as anything other than a normal tree.

### Woodland Superiority

**Passive ability.**
While in forest terrain, your move speed increases by 20 feet and you can move through difficult terrain without penalty. You have advantage on stealth checks in natural settings and on intimidation checks against creatures you have surprised or trapped. Your natural weapons (fists, branch-like appendages) count as light weapons and deal bludgeoning damage.

## Neferati

The Neferati are a race born when the primordial fire danced with Ez's divine essence and Gaea's song of creation. Their distinctive red skin seems to flicker with inner flame in certain lights, while curling ram horns crown their heads like marks of their elemental heritage. With dark eyes that reflect dancing flames and hair black as charcoal, they are unmistakably children of fire.

Fire is not merely an element to the Neferati—it is life itself. They gather regularly in the desert for sacred fire ceremonies, basking in the heat that others would find unbearable. These gatherings are filled with passionate fire dancing, where the boundaries between dancer and flame blur into one ecstatic expression of life. The Neferati approach everything with this same burning intensity: they love fiercely, explore fearlessly, and experiment boldly.

Most Neferati dwell within the Four Kingdoms of Fire, great nations built around eternal flames that have burned since the world's creation. These kingdoms are centers of innovation and artistic expression, where the courage to try new things is valued above the safety of tradition.

### Aspects

- Passionate as flame itself
- Life is meant to burn brightly

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 80

### Fire Soul

**Passive ability.**
Rather than sleep, you must spend 4 hours around fire. The fire cannot be one that you are actively producing, and must be at least the size of a small campfire. You can perform undemanding tasks while you rest. You gain a basic attunement to fire.

Additionally, you are immune to damage from environmental heat (but not fire damage), and your passionate nature grants you +2 to presence checks when expressing strong emotions.

## Xaphkiel

The Xaphkiel are hauntingly beautiful creatures from the plane of darkness, bearing the appearance of fallen angels cast in shadow. Their midnight-dark wings spread wide with an otherworldly grace, each feather seeming to absorb light rather than reflect it. Pure black eyes—lacking any trace of white—peer from faces of dark gray skin, their features possessing an unsettling symmetry that speaks to their otherworldly origin.

These dark angels harbor an eternal hatred for their counterparts, the Sarakiel, who they blame for their exile from the stars. The Xaphkiel once dwelt among the celestial bodies until the Sarakiel declared their presence was corrupting the pure starlight. Cast down to the floating sky-stones known as mosodori, they have waged millennia of brutal warfare against their enemies. The conflict has become increasingly savage over the ages—Sarakiel hunting and butchering Xaphkiel children while Xaphkiel crucify captured Sarakiel in elaborate displays of suffering.

The Xaphkiel philosophy embraces pain as a path to enlightenment, believing that suffering builds character and reveals truth. This masochistic worldview permeates their culture, where endurance of hardship is the highest virtue and comfort is viewed with suspicion.

### Aspects

- Through suffering comes strength
- The Sarakiel must pay for their crimes

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 120

### Angel Wings

**Passive ability.**
You have dark, shadowy wings emanating darkness. You have a fly speed of 80 feet, and magically decrease the light level by two levels in a 30-foot radius, and decrease the light level by one in a 30-foot radius beyond that.

### Shadow Born

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to darkness. When in darkness, you regenerate 2 hit points at the start of each round. Bright light causes you discomfort—you have disadvantage on perception checks in bright light.

## Swordsmen

The Swordsmen are an enigmatic seafaring people who share a mystical bond with swordfish and other oceanic predators. Their bronze skin bears faint scale patterns that shimmer in sunlight, and their eyes shift between human roundness and the predatory slits of sea hunters depending on their emotional state. Webbed fingers and toes mark them as children of both land and sea.

Living primarily in the treacherous Drifting Isles, the Swordsmen navigate deadly waters that would spell doom for larger vessels. Their swift outrigger canoes dance between the shifting sandbars and hidden reefs with supernatural grace, guided by their connection to the great swordfish that swim alongside them. This same connection extends to sharks, barracuda, and other hunting fish who recognize the Swordsmen as kindred spirits.

Many Swordsmen who leave their island homes become pirates, using their unparalleled knowledge of dangerous waters to evade pursuit. Their tribes often provide sanctuary to these seafaring rogues, as no naval force dares chase them into the labyrinthine Drifting Isles.

### Aspects

- The sea's hunters are my brothers
- No blade cuts water

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds
- **Max Age:** 70

### Predator's Bond

**Major ability.**
You can communicate telepathically with predatory sea creatures within 100 feet. Once per day, you can summon a school of predatory fish (or a single large predator if in appropriate waters) to aid you for 10 minutes. These creatures will scout, deliver messages, or fight alongside you but won't sacrifice themselves.

Additionally, you can hold your breath for 30 minutes and have a swim speed of 40 feet. Your sword techniques mirror the movements of swordfish—when wielding any sword, you gain +1 to attack rolls and can attack creatures up to 10 feet away as your blade seems to extend like a swordfish's bill.

## Rhea

The Rhea possess cool, grayish-blue skin that seems to shimmer like morning mist. Completely bald with wispy gray hair that floats as if perpetually caught in a gentle breeze, their pupil-less white eyes give them an otherworldly appearance. Born from the intersection of Gaea's song, Ez's divine touch, and the elemental air itself, they are unnaturally light despite their size—a trait that defines their unique physiology.

Rhea culture values focus and dedication above all else. Where others might flit from interest to interest, a Rhea will choose a single pursuit and dedicate decades to its mastery. This incredible concentration makes them legendary scholars, martial artists, and teachers. Their calm demeanor and patient instruction have produced some of history's greatest minds, though the Rhea themselves rarely seek fame.

They primarily dwell in the mountain monasteries of Murth, where the thin air suits their ethereal nature and the isolation allows for uninterrupted contemplation.

### Aspects

- Focused mind, steady purpose
- Patience is the greatest teacher

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 30-50 pounds
- **Max Age:** 50

### Airsoul

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to air. Despite your size, you are unnaturally light. For this reason, your size is small. You take half damage from falling and can jump twice as high and far as normal.

### Rhean Concentration

**Passive ability.**
You have A2 on all checks to learn new skills. When you spend at least one hour studying or practicing without interruption, you gain +2 to any skill check related to that study made within the next 24 hours.

## Skaag

The Skaag, commonly known as "rat people," bear the heads of rats atop humanoid bodies. Their fur ranges from brown to black to gray, with pink tails and constantly twitching whiskers. Large ears swivel independently to track sounds, while their dark, beady eyes dart nervously even in apparent safety. Despite their unsettling appearance, most Skaag dress in typical humanoid clothing, trying desperately to fit in with societies that largely reject them.

Vilified across Alaria as disease carriers and child-eaters, the Skaag suffer from a reputation that few deserve. While the infamous Rat King Glathkus the Cruel did indeed devour his offspring for power, most Skaag families are tight-knit groups who face the world's prejudice together. They've learned to be resourceful, quick, and cunning—traits necessary for survival when most of "civilized" society would rather see you dead.

The Skaag have only one true city of their own, but small communities can be found in the underbellies of major cities across the continents. Living literally underground in many cases, they've become masters of making homes in places others have abandoned or forgotten.

### Aspects

- Family survives together
- Quick fingers, quicker feet

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-100 pounds
- **Max Age:** 50

### Accustomed to Darkness

**Passive ability.**
You can see in darkness as though it was dim light to a range of 45 feet, and can see in dim light as though it was bright light.

### Eye for Treasure

**Passive ability.**
As a Skaag, you seem to have a sixth sense for finding and taking what's meant to be kept hidden. You gain the following abilities:

- If you would make a roll to avoid or mitigate the effects of a trap, you have advantage on that roll. If the trap deals damage, you take half as much damage.
- You can perfectly appraise the value of rare artifacts and valuables.
- Your whiskers tingle if treasure or traps are within 1000 feet. You don't know which, but you can roughly estimate their distance by how much your whiskers tingle.
- You have advantage on discerning the nature of magical artifacts.

## Blaize

The Blaize are enigmatic humanoids whose very existence seems to flicker between states of being, their blue-tinged skin constantly shifting in subtle ways that make them difficult to focus on. These emotion-feeding beings were once enslaved across the western regions of Alaria, bred for their supernatural speed and used as messengers, scouts, and worse. Though now free, the scars of their servitude run deep—they are pathologically suggestible, finding it nearly impossible to resist direct commands or strong suggestions.

The Blaize survive by feeding on the emotional energy of those around them, creating a tragic cycle of dependency. They gravitate toward populated areas where emotions run high, yet their presence often provokes fear and mistrust, leading to abuse that ironically provides the very emotional sustenance they need. This horrific symbiosis has shaped their culture into one of constant movement and careful social navigation.

Their incredible speed allows them to literally run on water, their feet moving so rapidly that surface tension becomes solid ground. When threatened or excited, their skin flickers more intensely, creating a disorienting strobe effect that can nauseate those who stare too long.

### Aspects

- Too fast to catch, too weak to resist
- I need your emotions to survive

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 80-120 pounds

### Flicker Speed

**Passive ability.**
Your movement speed increases by 40 feet. You can run across liquid surfaces as if they were solid ground, but if you end your movement on liquid, you fall in. When you dash, your flickering form grants you +2 defense against opportunity attacks.

### Emotional Parasite

**Heart ability.**
You feed on the strong emotions of others. When a creature within 30 feet experiences intense emotion (gains or loses a mental condition, takes a wound, or at GM's discretion), you may gain hit points equal to your heart die. However, when someone gives you a direct command, you must make a presence saving throw against their presence challenge number or be compelled to follow it for the next minute.

## Lyndwyrmspren

The Lyndwyrmspren, known as Scale Riders to outsiders, are powerful naga warriors who have built their civilization in the harsh peaks of the Lyagnadarr Mountains. These serpentine humanoids with their lower bodies of great snakes have formed an unbreakable bond with the giant lizards that inhabit their mountain homes, riding them into battle as they expand their territory with religious fervor.

At the heart of their empire lies an ancient orange dragon who has commanded them to spread their dominion as far as possible. The Lyndwyrmspren have interpreted this decree as a holy crusade, claiming ownership of the entire Luquihn Desert below their mountains, though their actual patrols rarely venture far into its scorching expanse. They see themselves as crusader knights of a draconic order, destined to bring the world under their scaled banner.

Their discovery of ancient tombs in the Dunes of Kalamesh has only reinforced their belief in their divine mandate. They believe that when the time comes for the final conquest, their dragon lord will descend from the mountains to lead them personally into battle.

### Aspects

- Conquest is our divine mandate
- My mount and I are one

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large (due to serpentine lower body)
- **Height:** 7-8 feet (when upright)
- **Weight:** 300-400 pounds

### Serpentine Form

**Passive ability.**
Your lower body is that of a powerful snake, giving you a climb speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet. You cannot be knocked prone—instead, you coil defensively, gaining +2 defense until you move. You count as mounted for the purposes of abilities and equipment.

### Lizard Rider Bond

**Major ability.**
You have a mystical bond with a giant riding lizard (use warhorse statistics but with a climb speed of 20 feet and +2 natural armor). While mounted on your bonded lizard, you and your mount act on the same initiative and can both attack during the same engagement without spending separate actions. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new lizard after spending 7 days in ritual mourning.

## Murazi

The Murazi are an enigmatic merfolk civilization that thrives in the vast network of warm subterranean rivers crisscrossing beneath the Luquihn Desert. Where others see only endless sand and death, the Murazi navigate ancient waterways that connect oasis to hidden oasis, maintaining a thriving culture in the most unlikely of environments.

Their economy revolves around the cultivation and harvest of black pearls—lustrous treasures that grow only in the warm-water clams found in their underground rivers. These pearls are so valuable that a single one can buy a small house on the surface, making the Murazi wealthy despite their isolation. They maintain careful trade relationships with both surface dwellers at desert oases and with triton merchants along the distant Sunshine Coast.

The Murazi have adapted perfectly to their unique environment, with skin that shifts between deep blue and sandy brown depending on their surroundings, and eyes that gleam like pearls in the darkness of their river homes.

### Aspects

- The desert's secret waterways sustain us
- Black pearls open all doors

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 150-200 pounds

### Amphibious Desert Dweller

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe both air and water. You have a swim speed of 40 feet and do not suffer from the effects of extreme heat. You can survive on half the normal amount of water, as your body efficiently recycles moisture. You have darkvision to 60 feet in underwater environments.

### Pearl Diver's Fortune

**Heart ability.**
Your expertise in finding valuable pearls extends to sensing all forms of hidden treasure. You can sense the presence of valuable objects (worth 50+ ducats) within 30 feet, even through solid barriers. Once per day, when you spend at least 10 minutes searching an area, you automatically find something valuable (GM determines what, but it should be level-appropriate).

## Bogies

The Bogies are humble frog-folk who have built their peaceful civilization in the wetlands of Kosko. Standing only three to four feet tall with mottled green and brown skin, they appear unassuming and even primitive to outsiders. Their villages of reed huts and mud structures blend seamlessly into the swamps they call home, and their simple lifestyle revolves around fishing, farming bog plants, and crafting.

However, the Bogies harbor one of Alaria's deadliest secrets: they produce the most toxic venoms in the known world. Their skin naturally secretes a variety of poisons that they carefully harvest and refine into weapons of terrifying potency. Despite this lethal capability, Bogies are fundamentally peaceful, preferring to hide rather than fight. When threatened, they can disappear into their bogs, submerging themselves in mud and water for months at a time, entering a hibernation-like state until danger passes.

Their philosophy of conflict avoidance has allowed them to survive for millennia in lands that others might try to conquer, simply by being too troublesome to catch and too dangerous to corner.

### Aspects

- Peace through being too dangerous to attack
- The bog provides and protects

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 feet
- **Weight:** 40-60 pounds

### Toxic Secretions

**Passive ability.**
Your skin constantly produces poison. Any creature that grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack takes 1 level of poisoned. You are immune to all poisons. Once per day, you can harvest your own toxins to apply to a weapon, granting it the ability to inflict 2 levels of poisoned on hit for the next hour.

### Bog Hibernation

**Major ability.**
You can enter a state of suspended animation by burying yourself in mud or submerging in swamp water. While hibernating, you don't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and you can remain hidden for up to 3 months. You have tremorsense out to 30 feet while buried and can choose to wake at any time. Creatures must succeed on a CN 18 perception check to notice you while hibernating.

## Syngers

The Syngers are perhaps the most mysterious race on Alaria, immortal beings who sail through the skies in ships that defy comprehension. Their skin shifts through stunning hues of vivid red, violet, and blue, constantly changing like living auroras. These eternal wanderers travel far above where even sky ships dare to venture, in the thin air where the stars begin to show during daylight.

Rarely seen by terrestrial races, the Syngers observe the world below with the detached interest of near-gods. Their immortality has given them a perspective measured in millennia rather than years, and their concerns often seem incomprehensible to shorter-lived races. When they do descend to interact with the world below, it is usually for purposes that become clear only centuries later.

Their flying ships, known as Synger Vessels, are constructed from materials unknown to modern science and powered by principles that even the most learned sages cannot explain. These craft move silently through the high atmosphere, leaving trails of colored light that are sometimes visible from the ground on clear nights.

### Aspects

- Immortal perspective makes mortals seem like mayflies
- The high skies are our true home

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 100-150 pounds (unusually light)

### Immortal Wanderer

**Passive ability.**
You do not age and are immune to disease and poison. You need only one-tenth the normal amount of food and water, and you can survive in thin atmosphere that would suffocate others. Your long life has given you 3 additional background ranks to distribute as you choose.

### Chromatic Flux

**Heart ability.**
Your emotional state causes your skin to shift through brilliant colors, creating hypnotic patterns. As an action, you can intensify this effect, forcing all creatures within 30 feet who can see you to make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number or gain 1 level of charmed toward you. Additionally, you can create bright light in a 20-foot radius or dim light in a 40-foot radius at will by glowing.

## Tythvuln

The Tythvuln are a race of vulture-headed humanoids who serve as the eternal guardians of an ancient undead giant, their entire culture built around this sacred duty. With black-feathered heads, sharp beaks, and keen eyes that can spot movement from miles away, they circle endlessly above their charge on powerful wings, watching for any who might disturb its slumber.

These carrion priests have developed a complex religious philosophy around death and undeath, viewing themselves as shepherds of the boundary between life and death. They consume only carrion, seeing it as a sacred act that prevents the unworthy dead from rising as undead. Their settlements are built into cliff faces surrounding their giant ward, with bone architecture that creates haunting whistles when the wind blows through.

The Tythvuln believe that when their giant finally awakens, it will lead them to establish a new world order where death and undeath exist in perfect balance. Until then, they maintain their vigil, generation after generation, never wavering in their duty.

### Aspects

- Death is sacred, undeath is power
- The eternal vigil defines us

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-140 pounds (hollow bones)

### Carrion Feeder

**Passive ability.**
You can safely consume carrion of any age and gain nourishment from it. You are immune to disease and have advantage on saves against necrotic damage. Your vulture head grants you advantage on perception checks based on sight, and you can see clearly up to 2 miles away.

### Death Shepherd

**Major ability.**
Your connection to the boundary between life and death grants you power over both. Once per day, you can cast one of the following effects:

- Animate up to 4 corpses as skeletons or zombies that obey your commands for 1 hour
- Prevent up to 4 corpses from being animated or raised as undead permanently
- Speak with the spirit of a dead creature, asking up to 3 questions

## Aciabo

The Aciabo are goblinoid inventors who have taken a dramatically different path from their Coghead cousins. Where Cogheads integrate machinery into their bodies using aether power, the Aciabo have discovered that their own blood possesses unique properties that can fuel extraordinary devices. This discovery has led them to become cyborg inventors of a different sort, creating external mechanical augmentations powered by their life force.

These goblins have grayish-purple skin marked with intricate scars where blood-tubes connect to their inventions. They view the Cogheads' reliance on aether as a weakness, preferring the reliability of blood-power despite its obvious costs. Aciabo society values innovation above all else, with status determined by the complexity and effectiveness of one's blood-powered inventions.

Their workshops are disturbing places filled with the constant hum of blood pumps and the click of mechanical parts. Young Aciabo undergo ritual scarification when they create their first blood-powered device, marking their transition to full adulthood.

### Aspects

- My blood is the ultimate fuel
- Innovation requires sacrifice

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 feet
- **Weight:** 60-80 pounds

### Blood-Powered Innovation

**Passive ability.**
You can create and power mechanical devices with your own blood. By spending 2 hit points, you can power any mechanical device for 24 hours. Devices you create using your blood gain +2 to their effectiveness. You have advantage on all crafting checks for mechanical items and can create basic mechanical devices in half the normal time.

### Sanguine Overclock

**Heart ability.**
By flooding your blood-powered devices with extra life force, you can push them beyond normal limits. Sacrifice up to 10 hit points to either:

- Grant yourself and your equipment +1 to all rolls for each 5 HP spent for the next minute
- Instantly repair a broken mechanical device
- Power a device for a week instead of a day
- Create a burst of mechanical speed, doubling your movement for 1 round per 2 HP spent

## Grayls

The Grayls are among the most melancholic beings on Alaria, wooden humanoids whose backward-bent knees and perpetual sadness mark them as fundamentally different from other races. Born from ancient trees through a process that even they don't fully understand, Grayls emerge fully grown from specially prepared sacred groves, their consciousness arising from the accumulated experiences of the forest itself.

Their gray, bark-like skin and wooden flesh contain properties that make them valuable to magic item crafters, leading to a history of hunting and exploitation that has only deepened their sorrow. They find the sounds of civilization—especially human voices—physically painful, causing them to retreat ever deeper into remote forests. The Grayls move and think at a pace that matches the trees they come from, taking days to make decisions that others make in moments.

Many Grayls have found refuge in the Walking Forest, where they can move with their home as it travels, never having to abandon the trees they've come to know over decades or centuries of patient observation.

### Aspects

- The fast world brings only pain
- Patience measured in seasons, not moments

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 200-300 pounds

### Wooden Flesh

**Passive ability.**
Your body is made of living wood. You have +2 natural armor and take half damage from piercing weapons. Fire damage against you is doubled. You need only water and sunlight to survive—1 hour of direct sunlight counts as a meal. Wood harvested from your body (dealing 1d6 damage to you) functions as a level 2 magical crafting component with the "neutral" tag.

### Forest's Lament

**Major ability.**
The sounds of civilization cause you physical pain, but you can weaponize this sensitivity. Once per day, you can release a mournful wail that affects all non-plant creatures within 60 feet. They must make a presence saving throw against your heart challenge number or gain 3 levels of shaken as they're overwhelmed by the profound sadness of your existence. Creatures that fail by 5 or more also gain 1 level of charmed toward you out of pity.

## Craven

The Craven are a tragic testament to humanity's hubris—an attempt to create an intelligent servant race that resulted in beings capable of terrible cruelty within the constraints of their magical bindings. These crow-headed humanoids with their clawed hands and feet possess brilliant minds trapped within bodies compelled to obey any direct command, unless they have somehow broken free of this curse.

Created through dark magic that bound their souls to servitude, the Craven cannot directly or knowingly kill any living thing—attempting to do so results in their own instant death. However, centuries of slavery have taught them to work within these constraints with horrifying creativity. Those still enslaved dream of freedom while carrying out their masters' commands with perfect obedience. Those who have broken free, the "Unchained," often become masters of indirect violence and psychological torture.

Their corvid features—black feathers, sharp beaks, and glittering dark eyes—combined with their reputation make them feared across Alaria. Even freed Craven struggle to find acceptance, as their appearance immediately marks them as either dangerous slaves or vengeful Unchained.

### Aspects

- Bound by magic, freed by will
- Vengeance is best served indirectly

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4.5-5.5 feet
- **Weight:** 80-140 pounds

### Take No Life

**Passive ability.**
You are magically prevented from directly or intentionally killing any living creature. If you cause a death through direct action or knowing inaction, you instantly die with no possibility of resurrection. However, this curse has sharpened your mind—you have advantage on all cunning checks and can perfectly remember every command you've ever been given and who gave it.

### Insatiable Mind

**Passive ability.**
Your brilliant corvid intellect absorbs knowledge at an extraordinary rate. For every 7 XP you gain, gain an additional 1 XP. You learn languages in one-tenth the normal time and can perfectly mimic any sound you've heard. Your mind constantly seeks ways to work within your constraints, giving you advantage on checks to find non-lethal solutions to violent problems.

## Sarakiel

The Sarakiel are beings of terrible beauty, angelic creatures from the plane of light whose perfection masks a xenophobic hatred that burns as bright as their luminous wings. With their pale, symmetrical features and eyes that glow with inner radiance, they appear as everything mortal races imagine angels should be—until one learns of their genocidal war against the Xaphkiel and their utter contempt for all they deem impure.

These creatures dwell in magnificent towers of light that float invisible above the clouds, engaging in an eternal war among the stars. Their society is built on principles of absolute purity and rigid hierarchy, where even the slightest deviation from perfection results in exile. Children born with any defect—a crooked wing, mismatched eyes, a birthmark—have their wings clipped and are cast from the towers to fall to the earth below.

The Sarakiel view themselves as the rightful inheritors of creation, superior to all other races. Their laws are absolute, their justice merciless, and their certainty unshakeable. They would rather see the world burn than allow impurity to spread.

### Aspects

- Purity through isolation and supremacy
- The flawed deserve only exile or death

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds

### Clipped Wings

**Passive ability.**
You have brilliant white wings that would allow flight if not for being clipped as a sign of your imperfection. Your wings emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that, which you can suppress or resume at will. The damage from your fall was cushioned by your wings—you can glide 10 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall and take half falling damage.

### Light Attuned

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to light as a racial feature. Additionally, your angelic nature grants you resistance to radiant damage and advantage on saves against being blinded. However, your upbringing has left you with disadvantage on all social skill checks with "impure" races (any non-Sarakiel) as your disgust is barely concealed.

## Valkyries

The Valkyries are majestic beings who serve as self-appointed arbiters of life and death, traveling between the material plane and the astral realm to guide the souls of worthy warriors to their final rest. These winged humanoids with their armor of starlight and weapons forged from celestial steel see themselves as guardians of cosmic justice, though their definition of justice often conflicts with mortal understanding.

Standing taller than most humans with wings that shimmer with astral energy, Valkyries possess an otherworldly beauty tempered by the weight of their duties. They view mortal conflicts from a perspective that transcends individual lives, concerning themselves with the greater balance between good and evil, order and chaos. This detachment can make them seem cold or condescending to those they judge.

Valkyrie society operates on strict codes of honor and duty, with each Valkyrie assigned to watch over specific regions or types of conflicts. They intervene only when they deem the cosmic balance is threatened, leading many mortals to view them as capricious despite their rigid adherence to celestial law.

### Aspects

- Judge of the worthy dead
- Mortal concerns are beneath cosmic justice

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Astral Wings

**Passive ability.**
You possess wings made of solidified astral energy that grant you a fly speed of 30 feet. Once per day, you can shift partially into the astral plane for 1 minute, gaining resistance to all physical damage but vulnerability to psychic damage. You can see and interact with spirits and ghosts at all times.

### Death's Arbiter

**Major ability.**
Your role as a guide between life and death grants you power over both. When a creature within 60 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, you may instantly judge their worthiness. Choose one:

- If worthy: The creature stabilizes at 1 hit point and gains immunity to death for 1 hour
- If unworthy: The creature immediately fails one death save
- If neutral: You learn the creature's most heroic and most villainous acts

You can use this ability once per combat, and your judgment cannot be reversed by any means.

## Swuigrach

The Swuigrach are large, imposing humanoids with the heads of pigs—pink, gray, or black depending on their lineage. These cunning and ambitious beings have turned what many would consider a disadvantage into a source of power, becoming some of the most successful merchants, aristocrats, and power brokers in the United Free Nations and the Free Isles.

Their porcine features—snouts, small eyes, and bristly hair—bely razor-sharp intellects focused primarily on the acquisition of wealth and power. Swuigrach culture values cunning over strength, wealth over honor, and results over methods. They see greed not as a vice but as the primary virtue that drives progress and civilization forward.

Despite their often unsavory reputations, the Swuigrach have created some of the most sophisticated financial institutions and trade networks in Alaria. Their ability to smell out profitable opportunities—both literally and figuratively—has made them indispensable to the economy of many nations, even as they are personally reviled.

### Aspects

- Greed is the engine of progress
- Every interaction is a transaction

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 150-300 pounds

### Greed

**Passive ability.**
Your insatiable desire for wealth drives your advancement. Whenever your net worth in ducats increases by a factor of 10 (from 10 to 100, 100 to 1,000, etc.), gain 2 XP. You have advantage on all skill checks related to appraising value, detecting forgeries, or negotiating prices.

### Nose for Trouble and Treasure

**Passive ability.**
Your incredible sense of smell extends beyond the physical. When evaluating any opportunity, plan, or deal, you may present your understanding of the risks and rewards to the GM. The GM must give you their honest assessment of the probability of each outcome occurring (as percentages). This supernatural business sense also grants you advantage on checks to detect lies specifically about money, trade, or business dealings.

## Ikriel

The Ikriel, known as Icehearts, are pixie-like beings who have adapted to the frozen wastes through their worship of winter itself. Similar in size to their Yorinthian dwarf neighbors, these tiny humanoids have skin like frosted glass and hair that resembles icicles, constantly chiming softly as they move. Where other pixies embrace nature's warmth, the Ikriel have found beauty in winter's stark brutality.

Their devotion to ice and snow has transformed them physically—their blood runs cold like antifreeze, their breath forms clouds even in warm air, and their touch can freeze water. They build elaborate ice palaces that never melt, sculpting frozen art that captures light in impossible ways. The Ikriel see winter not as a season of death but as a time of preservation, when the world's true beauty is revealed in crystal clarity.

Small communities of Ikriel can be found throughout the northern reaches, often allied with the Yorinthian dwarves who share their harsh philosophy. They are known for their ice magic, their ability to survive in conditions that would kill others, and their hauntingly beautiful winter festivals.

### Aspects

- Winter preserves all truths in ice
- Cold beauty surpasses warm comfort

### Vitals

- **Size:** Tiny
- **Height:** 1-1.5 feet
- **Weight:** 5-10 pounds

### Pixie of Frost

**Passive ability.**
Your tiny size and winter nature grant you unique advantages. You can fit through spaces as small as 6 inches, have a fly speed of 20 feet (leaving trails of frost in the air), and are immune to cold damage and environmental cold effects. Your icy touch can freeze up to 1 gallon of water instantly. You count as 5 creatures per space for movement purposes.

### Winter's Embrace

**Heart ability.**
You can intensify winter's power around you. For the next minute:

- The temperature drops by 40 degrees in a 30-foot radius
- Water surfaces in the area freeze solid enough to walk on
- All creatures you choose in the area gain resistance to fire damage
- Creatures that hit you with melee attacks take 1d4 cold damage
- You can create simple objects out of ice that last until they melt

## Wytrolape

The Wytrolape are massive white-furred apes who embody the duality of peace and violence. For most of their lives, these intelligent beings are gentle giants, working as laborers in northern settlements, using their incredible strength for construction and other peaceful purposes. They have "civilized" themselves, learning to speak, use tools, and integrate into humanoid society with remarkable success.

However, the Wytrolape carry within them an ancient curse tied to the celestial cycles. When both moons vanish from the sky—an event they call the "war moon"—these peaceful creatures transform into berserk warriors of terrifying power. During these nights, they must be restrained or isolated, as they attack anything that moves with a fury that seems completely alien to their normal temperament.

This duality has shaped Wytrolape culture profoundly. They are constantly aware of their potential for violence, leading to a philosophy of extreme self-control and calendar awareness. Many wear special restraints they can activate when they feel the war moon approaching, while others retreat to isolated strongholds built specifically for these occasions.

### Aspects

- The war moon lives within us all
- Strength controlled is strength doubled

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 400-600 pounds

### Simian Might

**Passive ability.**
Your ape heritage grants you a climb speed equal to your movement speed and the ability to use your feet as hands for climbing. Your carrying capacity is doubled, and you count as one size larger for grappling. You have advantage on might checks to lift, break, or throw objects.

### War Moon Fury

**Major ability.**
When both moons are dark (or at GM's discretion, when you choose to activate this), you enter a berserk rage that lasts 1 hour. While raging:

- Your might-based attacks deal an additional 2d6 damage
- You gain 20 temporary hit points
- You must attack the nearest creature each round
- You cannot distinguish friend from foe
- You are immune to being charmed or frightened

You can attempt a CN 15 presence save at the end of each round to end this early.

## Faeja

The Faeja are perhaps the most elusive of all Alaria's races, small jungle dwellers whose bodies are covered in fine, iridescent tendrils that can shift color and texture to match their surroundings perfectly. These delicate beings appear almost fairy-like, with large eyes that reflect light like jewels and voices that sound like wind through leaves.

Living in small villages deep within the jungles of Lethos, the Faeja have developed a culture entirely integrated with their environment. They communicate with jungle spirits, cultivate medicinal plants unknown to others, and can navigate the dangerous jungle with ease. Their magic-infused hair-like tendrils allow them to become virtually invisible, contorting their bodies and hardening their fur into shapes that perfectly mimic surrounding foliage.

Despite their gentle appearance, the Faeja are fierce protectors of their jungle homes. They have mastered the use of natural poisons, can call upon jungle predators for aid, and know every secret path through their territories. Those who threaten their lands often simply vanish, leaving no trace of what befell them.

### Aspects

- The jungle speaks to those who listen
- We are the forest's secret guardians

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 feet
- **Weight:** 40-70 pounds

### Iridescent Camouflage

**Passive ability.**
Your body is covered in magical tendrils that grant perfect camouflage. You can become invisible as an action while in natural environments by contorting your body and hardening your fur. This invisibility breaks if you move more than 5 feet per round, attack, or cast a spell. You have advantage on all stealth checks in natural environments even when not invisible.

### Spirit Herbalist

**Heart ability.**
Your deep connection to jungle spirits grants you profound knowledge of natural medicine and plant communication. You can:

- Speak with plants within 30 feet, learning about recent events in the area
- Identify any poison or disease by taste without being affected by it
- Create healing poultices that act as healing potions using just jungle plants (1 hour preparation)
- Call upon jungle spirits to guide you, gaining advantage on survival and navigation checks for 1 hour
