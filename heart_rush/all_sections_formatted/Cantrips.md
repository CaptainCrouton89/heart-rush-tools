# Cantrips

Cantrips are magical weapons that function identically to physical weapons in combat. Unlike spells (more major effects, used during the action phase), cantrips are used within engagements and follow all normal weapon attack rules.

However, unlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you have an attunement to the corresponding element.  
Also, since elemental attacks are not always physical, they don't always deal damage, and the bonus granted by the might stance is sometimes different.

**Cantrips Are NOT Spells**

- Cantrips have no cooldowns, casting restrictions, or action requirements
- They're used exactly like weapons during engagements
- They don't count toward your "one spell per round" limit
- Movement restrictions for spellcasting don't apply to cantrips

**Concept:**  
Cantrips and weapons are conceptually different. However, the rules for spells are similar to ranged weapons. Unlike spells, they are used during engagements in the same way as weapons.  
People with attunements can use them like “utility” arrows, where each type of bolt and blast has some convenient effect, possibly in addition to damage.

## Types of Cantrips

There are two types of cantrips—bolts, and blasts.  
Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line from your hand, while blasts are short bursts of energy emitted from the caster themselves.  
Each have more specific rules outlined in their sections.

### Bolts

Bolts are individual streaks of elemental energy or matter that are fired from a single hand.  
They behave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though they do not get a bonus from damage type.  
All bolt cantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement to that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and 120 feet at paragon attunement.

**Lightning Bolt**  
Air.  
You shoot a crackling bolt of lightning from your hand.  
This attack deals damage as an ultralight, ranged, spell-weapon attack.  
If the target is wearing metal armor or is wet, double the result of your attack roll.

**Fire Bolt**  
Fire.  
You shoot a bolt of fire from your hand.  
This attack does no damage, but ignites the target, dealing 2 levels of burning.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of burning.

**Water Bolt**  
Water.  
You may shoot a heavy jet of water from your hand.  
This attack deals damage as a light, ranged, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.  
On a hit, the target is drenched in water, and takes a level of off-balanced.

You may launch a massive stone from your hand.  
This attack deals damage as a heavy, ranged, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.

**Force Bolt**  
Force.  
You shoot a roiling bolt of force from your hand.  
This attack does no damage, but the target is pushed back 20 feet.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** They are pushed 30 feet instead.

**Void Bolt**  
Void.  
You shoot a bolt of pure void from your hand.  
The faint sound of faesong can be heard in the air as the bolt travels.  
This attack does no damage, but the target takes a level of confused as faesong rips through their body.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add a level of confused.

**Dark Bolt**

You shoot a bolt of darkness from your hand.

**Time Bolt**  
Time.  
You shoot a bolt of time from your hand.  
This attack does no damage but the target takes a level of stunned as time temporarily freezes for the creature.  
Once a creature has been stunned from a time effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.  
**Might Stance Bonus:** Add two levels of dazed.

### Blasts

Blasts are outbursts of an element centered on one's self, generally taking the form of a rapidly expanding circle of elemental matter or energy.  
They behave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that you must choose a stance, can only attack those whom your stance beats, and gain the benefits associated with each stance—though not all blasts deal damage, and not all blasts are attacks.  
You must have both hands free to use blast cantrips.

After choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up to two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of you.  
At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any number of valid targets in range.  
At paragon attunement, the range of your blast increases by 5 feet.

**Blast of Lightning**
