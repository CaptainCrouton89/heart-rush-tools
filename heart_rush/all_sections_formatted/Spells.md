# Spellcasting

Spells are powerful elemental abilities that require mastery over the fundamental forces of nature. While anyone with elemental attunements can learn basic cantrips, true spellcasting demands deeper understanding and comes with significant restrictions. Spelltouched warriors have developed techniques to blend magic with martial combat, but even they must respect the fundamental limitations of channeling elemental forces.

**Important: Spells vs. Cantrips**

Spells and cantrips are fundamentally different magical abilities:

- **Cantrips** are magical "weapons" used within engagements, following all normal combat rules, usable indefinitely
- **Spells** are powerful strategic abilities that use your action outside of engagements, limited by cooldowns and restrictions

Think of cantrips as your magical sword, and spells as your once-per-battle special abilities.

## Learning Spells

Learning a spell represents mastery over some aspect of your connection with an element, allowing you to perform fantastical feats beyond simple elemental manipulation.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic attunement to every element listed in the spell's tags
- Sufficient XP (see Character Advancement section)

**Experience Cost:**

- Standard characters: 2 + 2X XP (where X = spells already known)
- Spelltouched characters: 1 + X XP (reduced cost due to specialized training)

## Casting Requirements

Every spell casting must meet these fundamental requirements:

### Basic Casting Checklist

□ **Action available** (uses your action if not Spelltouched Warcaster)
□ **Your turn** (unless the spell is instant)
□ **One spell per round** (requires intense focus)
□ **At least one free hand** (to channel elemental forces)  
□ **Required attunements** (basic minimum for all elements in spell tags)  
□ **Movement restrictions observed** (see table below)  
□ **Spell off cooldown** (you can't cast the same spell multiple times per combat)

**Note:** These casting requirements apply ONLY to spells, never to cantrips. Cantrips follow weapon attack rules instead.

### Movement and Spellcasting

| Restriction               | Rule                                                       | Applies to  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Pre-casting movement**  | Cannot cast if you moved >½ speed this round               | All casters |
| **Post-casting movement** | Cannot move >½ speed after casting                         | All casters |
| **Reason**                | Physical exertion and magical strain disrupt concentration | All casters |

_Movement speed calculated after armor penalties and other modifiers_

## Cooldown System

Casting spells places tremendous strain on your connection to elemental forces. Whenever you cast a spell, you cannot cast it again until you take a short rest.

## Standard vs. Spelltouched Casting

| Aspect                 | Standard Caster            | Spelltouched (Warcaster)            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Action Economy**     | Uses your action           | Uses minor ability (1+ rush points) |
| **Spells per Round**   | One maximum                | One maximum                         |
| **Combat Integration** | Cannot attack same round   | Can cast + attack same round        |
| **Free Spells**        | None                       | 3 spells matching your attunements  |
| **Movement Limits**    | ½ speed restrictions apply | ½ speed restrictions apply          |

## Spell Types and Effects

**Spell Tags:**

- **Element tags** (Fire, Earth, etc.): Required attunements
- **Immediate**: Effect happens once when cast, then ends
- **Ongoing**: Lasts up to 1 minute or until you end it
- **Instant**: Can be cast at any time, even interrupting other actions

**Spell Saves:** When creatures resist your spells, they roll against your spellcasting Challenge Number.

**Spellcasting CN = Maximum of your heart die + (2 × paragon level)**

_Example: d8 heart die + paragon level 2 = CN 12_

The spells that follow represent the fundamental magical techniques available to those who have mastered elemental attunements. Each spell description includes its elemental requirements, duration type, and complete mechanical effects.

## When to Use Spells vs. Cantrips

**Use Cantrips When:**

- You're in an engagement and need to attack
- You want consistent, repeatable magical damage
- You need to conserve your limited spell uses

**Use Spells When:**

- You need to control the battlefield (walls, area effects)
- You want to affect multiple enemies outside engagement range
- You need powerful, game-changing effects
- You're not currently in an engagement

## Spells

Spells are listed by their name, along with two tags—their required attunements, and if they are ongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a single attunement as prerequisite for casting the spell, but some have two or more. If the spell is immediate, the spell effect occurs once when the spell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell's effects continue for up to one minute, or when the spell caster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.

Also note, some spells are instant. These spells are useless to non-spelltouched classes, since spelltouched are the only ones able to cast spells

### Aura of Ignition

_Fire. Ongoing. Instant._
You snap your fingers, agitating the air around you into a hyper-flammable state, allowing you to easily ignite moments of already high-energy, such as the impact of a blade.

_Fire and Light. Ongoing._
You rub your fingers together, heating nearby areas of light. All spaces within 45 feet in bright light ignite into white, brilliant flames.

_Light. Ongoing._
You rub a sphere of pure, brilliant light into your fingers before casting it into the air. Choose a point within 45 feet.

For every 5 feet further you are from the point, creatures gain one level fewer of blindness.

_Water and Force._
You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away. Choose a 20-foot by 40-foot section of the map.

### Eclipse

_Dark._
You turn your cupped hand in the air, briefly causing a shadow to pass before the sun. The sun provides no light to any space in a 90 foot radius until the spell ends or you choose to end the effect during a subsequent action phase. This has no effect on other sources of light.

### Erosion

_Force and Time._
You rub your fingers together, grinding time against force, accelerating the natural desiccation and erosion of a nearby object. Choose an inanimate object no greater than a 10-foot cube. If it is softer than wood, it erodes away immediately. If it is softer than stone, it erodes away in the next minute. If it is as hard as stone or harder, it crumbles over the course of the next hour.

### Ether Chains

_Force. Ongoing._
You link your thumb and forefinger, causing visible, ethereal chains to form between two creatures' souls, linking them together. Choose two creatures within 45 feet of you and within 10 feet of each other.

By clenching your hand into a fist, you can engulf your surroundings in shadows. The space in a 45-foot radius around you becomes dark if the space was previously dim, and dim if it was previously bright. Nonmagical light cannot penetrate through this darkness. See the Other Factors section for details on the effects of dim light.

You snap your fingers, agitating the air into a crackling cloud of energy, electrifying and energizing those inside. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 1d6 damage when they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.  
If a player takes damage from this effect, they gain a rush point. If this would cause them to exceed their maximum, they may immediately spend their points. Creatures standing in water take three times as much damage from this spell.

### Liquify

_Earth. Ongoing._
You flutter your hand such that it resonates at the exact frequency to turn the surrounding rock into an unstable slew of loose stone. The ground within 10 feet of you immediately becomes difficult terrain, and creatures of your choice that enter or start the round in that space begin sinking into the ground and gain one level of restrained.  
Creatures stuck in the ground may take the dash action to remove all levels of the restrained condition from themselves.

### Magma Rain

_Earth and Fire._
You pull your hand down into a fist, causing magma to begin falling from the sky. Choose a point within 90 feet. There must be a large area of open sky above the point. Magma appears in the sky and begins falling towards that point.

### Oil Slick

_Water and Earth. Ongoing._
You cause a pool of slippery oil to expand over an area, making it impossible to safely walk on. Choose a point within 45 feet. All space within 15 feet of that point is slippery, and any creature that moves more than five feet through the space or makes an A/D roll in that space must make an agility saving throw contested by your spellcasting ability.  
If the creature fails, it falls prone. If it was making an A/D roll, treat the result of their roll as a zero.

### One With the Shadows

Fire within 90 feet of you spreads unnaturally fast. At the end of each round, it spreads to all adjacent spaces with flammable materials. Anyone who enters or ends the round in the fire takes two levels of burning. Creatures of your choice within 90 feet that use their action to reduce their levels of burning only decrease their levels by one, rather than half.

You may stop the unnaturally fast spread of the fire as an instant ability, but the fire does not cease to exist. The fire can still be put out by normal means.

### Ravine

_Earth. Ongoing._
You bring your hand in a chopping motion towards the ground, causing it to split open in a deep ravine. Choose four connected, spaces on the ground within 45 feet.

### Searing Shadows

_Fire and Dark. Ongoing._
You rub your fingers together, heating nearby areas of darkness. All spaces within 45 feet in dim light or darkness ignite into pulsing, dark flames.  
So long as those spaces remain in dim light or in darkness, the flame remains. Whenever a creature enters or begins the round in one of these spaces, it takes one level of burning, and then one additional level of burning if the space was in darkness, no more than once per round.

### Shadowy Double

_Dark. Ongoing._
You drag darkness from around you to your form. If you are in dim light, you may create shadowy duplicates of yourself. The next two times you are attacked, you instead take no damage, as they attack a shadowy double. The duplicates disappear if you exit dim light.

### Shield of Air

_Force and Air. Instant._
You raise your hand in the air, causing the air to harden, right before a weapon lands. Roll your heart die and double it, and add it to a creature's defense roll, before they take damage.

### Stasis Sphere

_Void. Ongoing._
You pull in the void, cocooning the space around you. All incoming and outgoing sources of damage (e.g. attack rolls) have their initial damage reduced by half, before accounting for defense rolls. Round up the remaining damage.

### Static Cloud

_Air. Ongoing._
You snap your fingers, charging the air around you, creating a cloud of highly static energy suspended in the air. Whenever a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you may have that creature take three levels of dazed as electricity crackles through them.

### Steam Fissure

You turn your skin to stone. You have +6 on defense rolls against slashing and piercing attacks, and your move speed decreases by 20 feet.

### Sunbeams

_Light. Ongoing._
You drag a pointed finger from the sky to your target, sending beams of sunlight down from the heavens, blinding and burning those caught within. Choose a point within 45 feet. A pillar of light beams down, and bright light illuminates everything in a 5-foot radius around that point. Whenever a creature enters or starts the round in one of these spaces, you may choose for them to take 2 levels of blinded and 1d6 damage.

### Telekinesis

_Force. Ongoing._
During engagements, you may use nearby objects as heavy, ranged, bludgeoning weapons, by hurling them at your opponents. Objects must be between 5 and 20 pounds, within 45 feet, and cannot be attached to anything else that would prevent it from moving (likely, valid options include loose rocks, chairs, etc). You have advantage on these attack rolls.

### Temporal Hiccup

_Time. Instant._
With the clap of your hands, a flicker in the normal continuum of time ripples out from you. All creatures of your choice within 45 feet have D3 on the next roll they make, or until the end of the round, whichever comes first.

### Temporal Scramble

_Time. Instant._
After everyone who wants to join the engagement has done so, but before stances are chosen, you may use this ability. Each creature in the engagement should roll a d100. In order from lowest to highest result, each creature should announce their stance. Creatures of your choice may roll the d100 with advantage (roll twice and take the higher result).

### Thunder Blast

_Air._
You clap your hands, or snap your fingers, releasing a concussive blast of thunder, blowing creatures away from you. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you are blown back 10 feet directly away from you.

### Time Cube

_Time. Instant._
By twisting the threads of your own timeline between the fingers of your hand, you bind it into a cube within which you can act. This round, you can take three additional actions.

### Time Twister

_Time._
By yanking loose the threads of time, you revert time to an earlier state. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet of you are teleported to wherever they started this round. Creatures of your choice who have not moved yet this round may immediately move a distance up to their move speed.

### Tremor Stomp

_Earth._
You stomp the ground, causing it to shutter and quake. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet immediately take 3 levels of off-balanced and fall prone. If you are underground, those creatures take 5 levels instead.

### Twister

_Air. Ongoing._
By spinning your finger in the air, you stir the air into a twister. A coiling tornado touches down, throwing people aside as it travels across the ground. Choose a 10-foot square within 45 feet. All area there is affected.  
Projectiles are thrown aside if they pass through, and anyone who enters is thrown 10 feet in a direction of your choice and lands prone, taking 1d6 damage.  
At the beginning of each round, you may choose to move the twister 15 feet in a direction of your choice.

### Undying Flame

_Fire and Time. Ongoing._
Choose a creature within 45 feet. It takes one level of burning. Levels of burning do not fade from this creature.

### Wall of Fire

_Fire. Ongoing._
By drawing a line with your finger, you cause immense flames to grow up where you point. Choose a point within 45 feet and draw a straight line up 20 feet in length starting from that point. A wall of fire grows up there.

Anyone who passes through the fire takes 3 levels of burning. The fire does not spread, and disappears when the spell ends.

### Wall of Stone

_Earth. Ongoing._
By drawing a line with your finger, you cause stone walls to shoot up from the ground where you point. Choose a point within 45 feet and draw a straight line up to 20 feet in length starting from that point. A wall of rock grows up there, 10 feet high.

Each wall segment can take 30 damage before disintegrating, and has 15 defense (treat is as rolling a 15 on defense rolls when attacked).

### Warpspace

_Void. Ongoing._
By dragging at the seams separating the void from the material world, you allow some of it to spill over. Certain spaces become areas of warped space. Choose six unoccupied spaces within 45 feet. Each space ceases to exist.  
It costs no movement speed to cross that space, and all spaces adjacent to a warped space are considered adjacent to all other spaces adjacent to that and any other contiguous warped spaces.
