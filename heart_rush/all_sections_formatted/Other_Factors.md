# Environmental Rules

These additional rules cover various situations that can arise during gameplay.

The world presents many challenges beyond hostile creatures. These rules help adjudicate how characters interact with their environment.

## Terrain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous environments that all pose their own unique challenges.

### Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy foliage.

While in difficult terrain, after accounting for other movement penalties, your remaining movement speed is halved.

### Water

Doing anything while in or under water comes with severe limitations.

While shallow water counts only as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that you move at your swim speed.

Unless you explicitly have a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.

If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement.

If you cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have D5 on all of those rolls instead.

Ranged weapons travel half their distance when fired underwater.

### Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a might check to determine if you can climb at all.

On a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which unless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.

## Lighting

There are three different states of lighting that can occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and dark.

Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern, and intense fire all produce bright light.

There are no penalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit area.

Dim light can be found in alleyways, twilight, and in all the spaces between bright light and darkness.

Perception and observation skill checks are made with disadvantage for creatures that require light to see. Additionally, attacks against creatures in dim light have disadvantage, and defense rolls against obscured creatures have disadvantage.

Darkness is anywhere there is no light.

Unless you have darkvision, you cannot see anything.

## Darkvision

Some creatures have darkvision.

A creature with darkvision can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and can see in darkness as though it were dim light.

## Hiding

If the environment provides suitable places to hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may choose to hide.

This requires more than a single action, and cannot be performed during combat.

When you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill check.

On a success you are hidden, and count as unseen for the purposes of attacking.

While hidden, you may use your action to make an opportunity attack against a creature you are hidden from.

You may still be obscured after you attack, but you do not count as hidden and you cannot make opportunity attacks.

All hidden creatures that wish to make opportunity attacks may use their action to attack before combat begins.

## Size

Creatures range from minuscule to colossal, with significant mechanical differences.

### Size Categories

| Size      | Spaces Occupied | Per Space | Examples         |
| --------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Minuscule | 0               | 1,000     | Fairy, Sprite    |
| Tiny      | 0               | 10        | Cat, Raven       |
| Small     | 0               | 5         | Halfling, Goblin |
| Medium    | 1               | 1         | Human, Elf       |
| Large     | 1               | 1         | Horse, Owlbear   |
| L2        | 4 (2×2)         | 1         | Young Dragon     |
| L3        | 9 (3×3)         | 1         | Adult Dragon     |
| L4+       | Level²          | 1         | Ancient Dragon   |

### Size Combat Effects

**Movement Through Spaces:**
One creature can occupy and move through the space of another creature if it is at least two sizes smaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain. While in the same space as a non-hostile creature, you also have one level of cover.

**Weapon Restrictions:**

- Creatures of size small or tiny cannot wield heavy weapons
- Creatures of size tiny cannot wield heavy or light weapons

**Might Stance Push Modifiers:**
Whenever an attacking creature uses the might stance to push a defending creature of a different size, the defending creature may move more or less than the default of 10 feet:

- If the defending creature is smaller than the attacker, the defending creature moves an additional 5 feet for each level of size difference
- If the defending creature is larger than the attacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet for each level of size difference
- This could mean that the defending creature is not pushed at all

**Grappling Size Effects:**
When making grappling checks: If either creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference.

While grappling a creature, rather than pushing the creature when you use the might stance, you may choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every size greater you are than the grappled creature.

**Climb On Requirements:**
Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check contested by the creature's might or agility ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature.

**Prone/Knockdown Limits:**
Many combat abilities that knock creatures prone specify "no more than one size larger than you" - creatures significantly larger are too massive to knock down.

**Carrying Capacity**
By default, you can carry slots equal to 6 + half of your might die. If you are size large, it is 6 + your might die instead, and if you are small, then it is 6 + a quarter your might die, rounded down.

### Forced Movement

If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and this movement is interrupted by a wall, another creature that is within two sizes of your own, or a heavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for every 5 feet remaining in your movement.

If this movement is stopped by a creature that is not wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and the total damage is split evenly between the two creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to move.
