# A Brief Intro

Heart Rush is a crunchy fantasy TTRPG that does one thing exceptionally well: dangerous, tactical combat that actually moves fast. But here's the kicker—it scales seamlessly from gritty street fights to conquering kingdoms.

## What Makes Heart Rush Different

Let's cut to the chase. Here's what you're getting:

**Combat That Terrifies (In the Best Way)**

- **Gritty and simulationist.** Healing is slow, wounds matter, and every fight feels consequential.
- **You probably won't die—but it'll feel like you will.** The system creates genuine fear without constant character death.
- **Each round is unique.** The mechanics actively promote varying tactics—no spamming the same combo.
- **Fast, tactical combat.** Everyone decides simultaneously, so complex fights flow while demanding crucial decisions.
- **Highly cooperative.** Classes aren't balanced—they're designed to make each other shine through devastating combos.

**Crunchy Without the Crunch**

- **Crunchy, not rules-lite.** There's mechanical depth here, but without drowning in tables or brutal math.
- **Fail-forward mechanics.** Failed rolls create complications, not dead ends—the story keeps moving.
- **Fiction-forward design.** If you can imagine it, there's probably a way to do it within the system.

**Scale Without the Spreadsheets**

- **Zoom in for tactics, zoom out for strategy.** One flexible system handles everything from bar brawls to kingdom management.
- **Start desperate, end legendary.** Begin counting copper as struggling mercenaries, end as rulers shaping nations.
- **You'll feel heroic eventually—but you'll earn it.** Power comes from surviving impossible odds, not from prescribed build paths.

**Character Building Without Limits**

- **Wild character design.** Barbarian wizard? Ninja detective? Fire-bending assassin? All completely viable.
- **Constant leveling.** Spend XP whenever you want on whatever you want—no waiting for arbitrary milestones.
- **Extremely flexible trait system.** Plain English descriptions become actual mechanics—"terrible gambler" isn't just flavor.
- **Hyper-flexible elemental magic.** Air-benders can do all the air-bender things—no restrictions on who can learn it.

## For GMs: Why Run This?

Heart Rush respects your time and sanity:

**Combat That Forgives**: The system's inherent danger creates tension even when players have advantages. Mess up the encounter balance? Still feels epic.

**One System, Infinite Uses**: Criminal empires, naval battles, dungeon delves—you've got mechanics that scale to any ambition without hunting through supplements.

**Players Do the Heavy Lifting**:

- **Aspects**: Players write their character flaws, then actively seek ways to trigger them for benefits
- **Complications**: Failed skill checks become opportunities for creative disasters

Bottom line: The mechanics help players help you tell better stories.

## For Players: Is This Your Game?

You'll love Heart Rush if you:

- Want tactical combat that respects your time
- Like systems that grow with your character's ambitions
- Enjoy theory-crafting builds that actually work in play
- Prefer your fantasy with teeth and consequences

You'll hate it if you:

- Want to feel like superheroes from session one
- Prefer purely narrative or rules-lite systems
- Need consistent crunch levels for everything
- Don't enjoy tactical decision-making

[[The Real Reason You Might Love Heart Rush
Like with many people, my first TTRPG was D&D. I loved the idea—fantasy, epic combat, conquer the world, get loot, grow powerful. Unfortunately, as I gained experience with the system (and others), I realized that the image that D&D is frequently sold on is not well represented in its actual mechanics. D&D is _sorta good_ at a lot of things, but their emphasis on making it approachable to new players, supporting every single fantasy trope ever, and (dare I say) occasionally lazy game design means that it suffers in other areas.

That's when I began working on Heart Rush. It's 6 years old, seen thousands of hours of playtesting, and it does tactical, sandboxy, generic fantasy _extremely well_. It's the game that I always wished D&D had been, but isn't. A dangerously hot take, but I'll say it: Heart Rush is awesome.]]
