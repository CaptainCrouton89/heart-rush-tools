# Heart Rush TTRPG Overview

Heart Rush is a crunchy, fantasy TTRPG ruleset. And it does combat really well.

## Comparison to Average Fantasy TTRPG

Here's how Heart Rush compares to the average fantasy TTRPG:

- Crunchy. There aren't tons of tables, and the math isn't too bad, but this is far from “rules-lite”.
- It's grittier and more simulationist. Healing is slow, and fighting is dangerous. You probably won't die, but it'll feel like you're going to.
- Each round of combat is unique. The core mechanics of combat discourage being predictable. This is a cornerstone of the Heart Rush rules.
- Fast, tactical combat. Seriously. You've got lots of important decisions to make each round, and it doesn't slow down the game since everyone's making decisions in parallel.
- Highly cooperative. Each class is designed to be played with the other classes, and will be best at allowing the other classes to shine. Everyone feels special.
- You'll feel heroic eventually, but not for a while. And when you do, it's mainly because you've done really difficult things, not because you have heroic abilities.
- Constant leveling. You don't have to wait for the level up—spend XP on a variety of stuff at different costs to improve your character.
- Wild character design. A barbarian wizard, ninja detective, or fire-bender assassin are all totally viable builds.
- Extremely flexible trait system. Plain English descriptions of your character result in mechanical bonuses and concrete hooks that drive the story forward.
- Hyper-flexible elemental magic. For example, you can be an air-bender and do all the things you should be able to do as an air-bender. And it's not tied to any class, so you can tack that onto whatever type of build you want.
- Fail-forward mechanics. The story won't always grind to a halt on failures.

## Why Should I Run This as a GM?

Heart Rush is probably not going to feel that different to run compared to most crunchy fantasy TTRPGs. However, it does try to balance the crunch with more narrative-forward elements. The two I want to highlight are the aspect system, and the skill check complications.

### Aspect System

With aspects, players will describe their character in plain English. The mechanics will incentivize them to have both positive and negative descriptions, and then to actually RP them out in play.

As the GM, you don't have to keep track of your players and their flaws and reward them when they're good; they'll let you know exactly when, and they will go out of their way to complicate the story in a way appropriate to their character, because doing so is the only way they can use the positive sides of their aspects.

The system is self-balancing, and places the vast majority of the work on the players themselves. The end result is players helping you tell a more interesting story.

### Skill Check Complications

Complications are a mechanic that come into play when players are making skill checks. When they roll, they sometimes have the chance to replace a bad roll with a better roll that has negative, unrelated side effects.

Those negative, unrelated side effects are up to you to decide, but in my experience they're quite easy to come up with. When the players have voluntarily chosen to take a complication, it's a golden ticket for you to make the situation worse in the most narratively satisfying way, without players feeling like it's unfair.

## Why Should I Play as a Player?

This game is for people who like combat and mechanics and getting into the weeds of character design and optimization. Heart Rush has other stuff going on too, but if you actively don't like those things, you'll be missing out on a lot of what Heart Rush has to offer.

As a quick list, you will like Heart Rush if:

- You like making a smart tactical play, but hate having to wait five minutes every round to do so.
- You like spending hours theory crafting strange character concepts that actually work.
- You like coordinating with your allies and dunking on enemies through the power of synergy.
- You like roleplaying flaws in your character, but want to get mechanically rewarded for it in gameplay.
- You want to mix and match fantasy character tropes to make your own, creative archetypes.
- You like grittier settings with crunch.

Heart Rush isn't the perfect solution for every desire in a TTRPG. But it's a damn good one for some of them.
