# Weapons, Cantrips & Armor

Equipment encompasses all of the gear you might use while adventuring. When you first create your character, you will likely start out with a weapon and some armor, though it is up to the GM.  
Also in this section are the rules for cantrips. Cantrips are very similar to weapons; you choose stances, and on a hit you usually get to make an attack roll with your chosen stance. Cantrips differ from weapons in that there is no physical weapon used to strike the opponent, and only those with magical attunements can use them.

## Weapons

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and damage type, which together describe the weapon and its properties. You may choose one weapon to be your primary weapon. This weapon does not use up equipment slots.  
You can only wield one weapon at a time. If wielding a weapon does not require being held in your hands, it does not count towards this restriction.

### Size

The size of weapon refers to how big and powerful the weapon is. Three sizes exist: heavy, light, and ultralight or improvised. It is up to the GM to determine the size of any given weapon.

#### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons require two hands, can only be wielded by creatures of size medium or larger, and cannot be easily hidden upon your body.  
Longbows, long swords, pikes, mauls, and heavy crossbows are examples of heavy weapons.  
Whenever you use a heavy weapon, add 1d12 to your attack rolls.  
Your move speed decreases by 5 feet if this weapon is not part of your body.  
Heavy weapons use 10 gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or part of your body.

#### Light Weapons

Light weapons are, as their name suggests, light, and are easy to handle.  
Crossbows, shortswords, and shortbows are all examples of light weapons.  
Whenever you use a light weapon, add 1d8 to your attack rolls.  
Light weapons use 5 gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or part of your body.

#### Ultralight Weapons

Ultralight weapons are small and easy to handle.  
Knives, shurikens, and claws count as ultralight weapons.  
Whenever you use an ultralight weapon, add 1d4 to your attack roll.  
Ultralight weapons use 2 gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or are part of your body.

#### Improvised Weapons

Chairs, your teeth, and your falling body can all be weapons in the right context.  
Improvised weapons count as ultralight weapons unless indicated otherwise.

### Attack Type

Two types of weapons exist: melee and ranged. Each come with different benefits.

#### Melee

Melee weapons are weapons that do not involve any part of the weapon leaving your hand.  
They are generally more powerful than ranged weapons, due to the fact that they have a lot of weight attached to them.  
Heavy melee weapons require two hands, and light and ultralight melee weapons require only one.  
Melee weapons have a range of 5 feet.

**Might Stance Bonus:** You may push the defending creature 10 feet away from you after everyone in the engagement has made their might attack roll.  
You may enter any of the free spaces they left or passed through because of your attack. Moving into that space does not provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Ranged

Ranged weapons trade damage for being able to inflict injuries from a safer distance.  
Light ranged weapons have a range of 30 ft, and heavy ranged weapons have a range of 60 ft.  
You can attack targets outside of that range, but have disadvantage to the attack for every 10 feet beyond the range listed, to a maximum of double the weapon’s range.

Ranged weapons come with drawbacks, however.  
All ranged weapons require two hands unless specifically noted otherwise, and you cannot choose anything but the defensive stance if you move more than half of your move speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties) during a round, and cannot move more than half your move speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties) if you already took a non-defensive stance in an engagement.

**Might Stance Bonus:** Creatures defending against this attack cannot add their defense bonus from armor to their defense roll.

#### Thrown

Thrown weapons are a special category of weapons that combine elements of both melee and ranged combat.  
They behave similarly to melee weapons in terms of handling but are used up as they are thrown.  
Thrown weapons have a range of 20 feet.  
You can attack targets outside of that range, but have disadvantage on the attack for every 5 feet beyond the range listed, to a maximum of double the weapon’s range.

Unless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons can be thrown.  
Weapons cannot be thrown in water.

**Might Stance Bonus:** The first time you hit with a thrown weapon attack in an engagement, you may make an immediate follow-up attack with another thrown weapon against a different valid target in the engagement.

#### Whip

Whips have a range of 20 feet.  
Unless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons can be whips.  
Whips cannot be used in water.

**Might Stance Bonus:** Add another weapon die to your attack roll.

### Damage Type

#### Bludgeoning

Bludgeoning weapons use raw force to inflict damage, and therefore are best used with high might.  
Examples include war hammers and clubs.  
Whenever you wield a bludgeoning weapon and use the might stance, add an additional weapon die to your roll.

#### Slashing

Slashing weapons use accuracy and dexterity to inflict damage, and therefore are best used with high agility.  
Examples include swords and scythes.  
Whenever you wield a slashing weapon and use the agility stance, add an additional weapon die to your roll.

#### Piercing

Piercing weapons use knowledge of your opponents’ maneuvering to inflict damage, and therefore are best used with high cunning.  
Examples include rapiers and weapons that use arrows.  
Whenever you wield a piercing weapon and use the cunning stance, add an additional weapon die to your roll.

## Other Weapon Tags

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and damage type. However, weapons can also have tags, making them further distinct.

### Reach

Melee weapons can have this tag.  
If you haven’t dashed this round, the range of this weapon is 10 feet instead of 5.  
If you attack a creature at this extended range, you cannot dash this round.

## Cantrips

Cantrips are very similar to normal weapons. They can be melee or ranged, and heavy, light, or ultralight, and they can be cast any time you would normally make an attack with a weapon.  
However, unlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you have an attunement to the corresponding element.  
Also, since elemental attacks are not always physical, they don't always deal damage, and the bonus granted by the might stance is sometimes different.

**Concept:**  
Cantrips and weapons are conceptually different. However, the rules for spells are similar to ranged weapons. Unlike spells, they are used during engagements in the same way as weapons.  
People with attunements can use them like “utility” arrows, where each type of bolt and blast has some convenient effect, possibly in addition to damage.

### Types of Cantrips

There are two types of cantrips—bolts, and blasts.  
Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line from your hand, while blasts are short bursts of energy emitted from the caster themselves.  
Each have more specific rules outlined in their sections.

#### Bolts

Bolts are individual streaks of elemental energy or matter that are fired from a single hand.  
They behave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though they do not get a bonus from damage type.  
All bolt cantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement to that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and 120 feet at paragon attunement.

**Lightning Bolt**

**Might Stance Bonus:** Add two levels of dazed.

#### Blasts

Blasts are outbursts of an element centered on one’s self, generally taking the form of a rapidly expanding circle of elemental matter or energy.  
They behave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that you must choose a stance, can only attack those whom your stance beats, and gain the benefits associated with each stance—though not all blasts deal damage, and not all blasts are attacks.  
You must have both hands free to use blast cantrips.

After choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up to two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of you.  
At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any number of valid targets in range.  
At paragon attunement, the range of your blast increases by 5 feet.

## Armor

Armor works by increasing your defense rolls, making it harder for damage to get through.  
Armor, as with other clothing, does not require equipment slots while being worn.

Your move speed decreases by 15 feet.  
Heavy armor uses 30 slots unless it is being worn.

### No Armor

There is no bonus or penalty for having no armor.

### Natural Armor

Some creatures have natural armor.  
Natural armor can provide any amount of bonus to one’s defense rolls, and applies no movement speed penalty.  
You cannot choose to have natural armor.

## Shields

Like armor, shields help you stay alive.  
You must have a free hand available to wield a shield (e.g., wielding a light melee weapon in the other hand).

### Heavy Shields

Add 2 to your defense rolls.  
Your move speed decreases by 5 feet.
