# Kin & Culture

## Alekroin

The Alekroin are massive alligator-folk whose imposing presence and predatory mindset have made them both feared and respected throughout the frozen wastes of Shykasas. These powerfully built beings stand shorter than most humanoids but possess incredible physical strength and an unwavering belief in the fundamental truth that everything in existence falls into two categories: predator or prey. Their culture has remained unchanged for millennia, as rigid and unyielding as the ice that covers their homeland.

Alekroin society operates on strict hierarchies determined by hunting prowess and the ability to dominate others. They view adaptation and change as signs of weakness, maintaining their ancient traditions even when circumstances might suggest otherwise. This stubborn adherence to "the old ways" has served them well in their harsh environment, where their natural abilities and proven methods continue to ensure survival.

Despite their fearsome reputation, the Alekroin possess keen intelligence and insatiable curiosity about the world beyond their territory. However, they approach all new experiences through the lens of their predator-prey worldview, constantly evaluating whether something represents a threat to be eliminated, prey to be hunted, or a potential tool for their own advancement.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 220-320 pounds

### Aspects

- Apex predator
- Frozen in tradition

### Predator's Instinct

**Passive ability.**
You can automatically identify the creature with the most and fewest hit points in any group within 60 feet. You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are wounded, frightened, or have fewer hit points than you.

### Death Roll

**Passive ability.**
While grappling a creature, you may use your action to perform a death roll. Make an opposed might check—if you win, you deal damage equal to twice your roll, and both you and the grappled creature fall prone. You have one level of advantage for each size larger you are than your target, and disadvantage for each size smaller.

## Ayblek

The ayblek are enigmatic beings from the distant realm of Instraxofinum, where the very nature of existence operates on principles alien to mortal comprehension. A single ayblek was brought to this world by a curious traveling mage, and from that lone individual, all ayblek in Pyonokraus have spawned through their peculiar asexual reproduction.

With their four arms constantly in motion and minds that process information at bewildering speeds, the ayblek are perpetually understimulated by the comparatively sluggish pace of mortal life. To compensate, they gravitate toward centers of chaos and activity—battlefields, bustling marketplaces, political upheavals—anywhere multiple threads of action converge. They pursue goals that seem arbitrary or nonsensical to other races, following internal logic chains that can span centuries and involve collecting specific grains of sand or counting the number of times a particular word is spoken in their presence.

Though they understand concepts of morality intellectually, empathy remains foreign to their psychology. An ayblek might save a drowning child not from compassion, but because the child's survival factors into some incomprehensible personal objective they established decades ago.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7.5 feet
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds

### Aspects

- **Apathetic to mortal concerns**
- **Eternally solitary**

### Two Pairs of Arms

**Passive ability.**

You have two sets of arms. You may take an additional object interaction each round for free, may wield two two-handed weapons simultaneously, and can grapple up to two creatures at once (requiring at least one hand per grapple). When climbing, your climb speed increases to 15 feet.

### Meditative Trance

**Passive ability.**

You don't need to sleep. Instead, you enter a meditative trance for 4 hours to gain the benefits of a long rest. While in this trance, you remain conscious and aware of your surroundings but have disadvantage on all skill checks and cannot take actions. You automatically succeed on sleeping checks when taking a long rest.

## Blaize

The Blaize are enigmatic humanoids whose very existence seems to flicker between states of being, their blue-tinged skin constantly shifting in subtle ways that make them difficult to focus on. These emotion-feeding beings were once enslaved across the western regions of Alaria, bred for their supernatural speed and used as messengers, scouts, and worse. Though now free, the scars of their servitude run deep—they are pathologically suggestible, finding it nearly impossible to resist direct commands or strong suggestions.

The Blaize survive by feeding on the emotional energy of those around them, creating a tragic cycle of dependency. They gravitate toward populated areas where emotions run high, yet their presence often provokes fear and mistrust, leading to abuse that ironically provides the very emotional sustenance they need. This horrific symbiosis has shaped their culture into one of constant movement and careful social navigation.

Their incredible speed allows them to literally run on water, their feet moving so rapidly that surface tension becomes solid ground. When threatened or excited, their skin flickers more intensely, creating a disorienting strobe effect that can nauseate those who stare too long.

### Aspects

- Too fast to catch, too weak to resist
- I need your emotions to survive

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 80-120 pounds

### Flicker Speed

**Passive ability.**

Your body exists in a state of constant motion, flickering between moments. Your movement speed increases by 40 feet. You can run across liquid surfaces as if they were solid ground, and you may continue moving on liquid for up to 10 feet after you stop moving before falling in.

Additionally, your flickering nature makes you difficult to pin down. You have advantage on saving throws against being restrained or grappled, and creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you.

### Emotional Parasite

**Passive ability.**
You sustain yourself on the ambient emotional energy of others. Once per day, you must feed on emotions in one of the following ways:

- Spend at least 1 hour within 30 feet of 5 or more people
- Remain within 30 feet of someone experiencing emotional extremes (fear, rage, grief, or ecstasy) for at least 10 minutes
- Make physical contact with a willing creature and share in their emotional state for 5 minutes, gaining one level of any mental condition they have (this feeds you but doesn't remove their condition)

If you fail to feed for a day, you gain one level of weakened and one level of mental vulnerability. For each additional day without feeding, both conditions increase by one level. These conditions are removed one hour after feeding.

**Suggestible Nature**  
_Passive ability._  
You must make a CN 8 presence saving throw against any direct command or strong suggestion made to you. You may spend DP up to your highest aspect rank and add that to your roll. If you fail, you feel compelled to follow the suggestion for the next minute unless it would directly harm you.

## Bogies

The Bogies are humble frog-folk who have built their peaceful civilization in the wetlands of Kosko. Standing only three to four feet tall with mottled green and brown skin, they appear unassuming and even primitive to outsiders. Their villages of reed huts and mud structures blend seamlessly into the swamps they call home, and their simple lifestyle revolves around fishing, farming bog plants, and crafting.

However, the Bogies harbor one of Alaria's deadliest secrets: they produce the most toxic venoms in the known world. Their skin naturally secretes a variety of poisons that they carefully harvest and refine into weapons of terrifying potency. Despite this lethal capability, Bogies are fundamentally peaceful, preferring to hide rather than fight. When threatened, they can disappear into their bogs, submerging themselves in mud and water for months at a time, entering a hibernation-like state until danger passes.

Their philosophy of conflict avoidance has allowed them to survive for millennia in lands that others might try to conquer, simply by being too troublesome to catch and too dangerous to corner.

### Aspects

- Peace through being too dangerous to attack
- The bog provides and protects

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 feet
- **Weight:** 40-60 pounds

### Toxic Secretions

**Passive ability.**
Your skin constantly produces poison. Any creature that grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack takes 1 level of poisoned. You are immune to all poisons. Once per day, you can harvest your own toxins to apply to a weapon, granting it the ability to inflict 2 levels of poisoned on hit for the next hour.

### Bog Hibernation

**Major ability.**
You can enter a state of suspended animation by burying yourself in mud or submerging in swamp water. While hibernating, you don't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and you can remain hidden for up to 3 months. You have tremorsense out to 30 feet while buried and can choose to wake at any time. Creatures must succeed on a CN 18 perception check to notice you while hibernating.

## Chargon

The Chargon are an enigmatic people whose eel-like heads and serpentine grace mask hearts filled with unexpected kindness. Despite their unsettling appearance—smooth, elongated skulls with large eyes and mouths full of needle-sharp teeth—they are among the most courteous and genuinely caring folk one might encounter. Their mysterious nature stems not from malice, but from a deep cultural appreciation for subtlety and the hidden currents that flow beneath surface interactions.

Masters of stealth and misdirection, the Chargon can slip through shadows and squeeze through impossibly tight spaces with fluid ease. Yet they use these abilities primarily to help others, appearing unexpectedly to offer aid to travelers in need or to resolve conflicts through subtle intervention. Their philosophy emphasizes moving through the world like water—adapting to obstacles rather than confronting them directly.

Chargon communities are often built in coastal caves or riverside settlements where they can easily access both land and water. They serve as intermediaries between different cultures, their natural talent for reading emotional undercurrents making them exceptional mediators and counselors.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 110-170 pounds

### Aspects

- Mysteriously kind
- Hidden depths

### Serpentine Mobility

**Passive ability.**
You can compress your body to fit through any opening large enough for a creature one size smaller than you. You have advantage on stealth checks and can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes. Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from creatures you have not attacked this round.

### Emotional Currents

**Heart ability. Instant.**
You can sense the emotional undercurrents around you with supernatural clarity. For the next minute, you know the current emotional state of all creatures within 30 feet and can detect lies automatically. Additionally, you can choose one creature in range—they must make a presence saving throw against your cunning challenge number or have their attitude toward you improved by one step (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to neutral, etc.).

## Children of Anubis

Anubis is one of several servants of Kahz, Lord of Malstaris. Anubis is in charge of ensuring that the shadows of the dead make it to Malstaris, and stay there, as well as weighing their souls for determining whether they enter the Gardens of Glyss—a paradise in Kahz's palace—or the Black Wastes—the name given to everything beyond.

Long ago, while on a trip to the material plane, Anubis had children with a mortal, who then gave birth to the first children of Anubis. Every child of Anubis passes on their heritage to their children, and thus the bloodline does not wane.

All children are born with the ability to communicate with Anubis on Malstaris. As they grow up, they can choose to serve Anubis, or turn their back on him and leave his guidance forever. This choice typically manifests during adolescence, marking them forever as either Servants or Forsaken.

Regardless of which path they follow, all children of Anubis are capable of weighing the souls of those they touch, an inheritance from their divine ancestor that allows them to perceive the moral weight of a person's deeds.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 120-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 160 years

### Weigher of Souls

**Passive ability.**

As an action, you may place your hand on a creature's chest to weigh their soul. When you do so, you learn:

- The weight of the creature's soul. If it is heavier than a feather, then the creature is unjust and deceitful. If it is lighter, then the opposite.
- What the last deceitful thing the creature said was.

### Servants of Anubis

Those who choose to serve their ancestral father become known as Servants of Anubis. They dedicate their lives to maintaining the natural order of death, ensuring that souls reach their proper destination in Malstaris and that none return to trouble the living. These children are famous for their work hunting liches, destroying the undead, and guiding lost souls to their final rest.

Servants often work as undertakers, exorcists, or wandering death-speakers, traveling from town to town to perform last rites and eliminate undead threats. They wear their connection to Anubis proudly, often adorning themselves with jackal imagery and carrying ankhs as symbols of their divine duty.

#### Aspects

- Duty to the natural order of death
- Death is sacred, undeath is abomination

#### Guardian of the Veil

**Passive ability.**

Anubis grants you power to fulfill your sacred duty. You gain the following abilities:

- You can sense any undead within 60 feet, even if they are hidden or invisible.
- When you make an attack against an undead creature, add 1d6 to your attack roll.
- Once per day, when you touch a corpse that died within the last hour, you may speak with it for up to one minute. The corpse can answer questions about its death and final moments.

### Forsaken of Anubis

Those who turn away from Anubis's guidance become the Forsaken, choosing to wield their inherited powers for their own purposes. Rather than allow their ancestral father to weigh souls for judgment, they choose to deliver justice themselves, acting as both judge and executioner. Like their father, they can feed souls to Ammit, devourer of souls. While Anubis only sends the most corrupted souls to be devoured, the Forsaken are bound by no such restrictions.

Feeding souls to Ammit is dangerous, for Ammit is eternally hungry and sometimes takes more than offered. The Forsaken walk a razor's edge between power and damnation, using their divine heritage as a weapon rather than a responsibility.

#### Aspects

- Judge, jury, and executioner
- Power justifies itself

#### Ammit's Justice

**Major ability.**

You begin to feed a still-living person's soul to Ammit. You may spend an action to cause an incapacitated creature that you are touching to decrease its heart die any number of times. Then roll 1d6. If the result is less than the number of levels you decreased, you lose an equal number of levels of your own heart die. If a creature would have its heart die decreased and it cannot fall any further, it instead falls to 0 hit points. If the creature is already at 0 hit points, or would lose two levels of its heart die while at its minimum, it dies.

## Chulpe

Savage, bestial humanoids that combine the worst aspects of predatory animals with a cruel intelligence, the Chulpe are among the most feared races in the known world. These monstrous beings possess powerful, muscular bodies covered in coarse fur, with elongated snouts filled with razor-sharp teeth and claws capable of rending flesh from bone. While their intelligence varies between subspecies, all Chulpe share an insatiable hunger for meat—particularly humanoid flesh—and a pack-based social structure built around dominance, violence, and the hunt. Their origins are shrouded in mystery, with some scholars believing them to be the result of ancient magical experiments, while others claim they are simply evolution's answer to creating the perfect predator.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Varies by subrace
- **Height:** Varies by subrace
- **Weight:** Varies by subrace

### Predatory Instincts

**Passive ability**

Your bestial nature grants you enhanced senses and combat reflexes. You have advantage on cunning checks to track creatures and detect threats. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 60 feet, and when you deal damage to a wounded creature (one that has taken a wound), you regain 2 hit points.

### Skree (The Pack Runners)

The smaller and more numerous of the Chulpe subspecies, Skree are vicious pack hunters roughly the size of large wolves. What they lack in individual strength compared to their Terrogone cousins, they more than make up for in speed, cunning, and sheer bloodthirsty aggression. Skree society is built around loose pack structures that form and dissolve based on hunting success and dominance displays. They are known for their hit-and-run tactics, using their superior numbers and coordination to bring down prey much larger than themselves.

Skree live in the harsh borderlands and wilderness areas, often competing with their larger Terrogone relatives for territory and prey. Their lean, wiry builds make them excellent climbers and runners, allowing them to pursue fleeing victims across virtually any terrain. While less intelligent than Terrogones, Skree possess a feral cunning that makes them expert ambush predators. They communicate through a complex series of growls, yips, and body language that allows entire packs to coordinate attacks with frightening efficiency.

The social structure of Skree packs is fluid and violent, with leadership constantly shifting as members challenge each other for dominance. They have no permanent settlements, instead following game trails and establishing temporary camps wherever the hunting is good. Skree reproduction is rapid, with large litters ensuring their numbers remain high despite their dangerous lifestyle and frequent conflicts with other predators.

#### Aspects

- Bloodthirsty pack hunter
- Recklessly aggressive

#### Pack Frenzy

**Passive ability**

Your violent nature intensifies when fighting alongside allies. When you are adjacent to an ally at the start of your turn, you gain one additional rush point. Additionally, when an adjacent ally deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that same creature until the end of the round.

### Terrogones (The Bone Crushers)

The massive, terrifying cousins of the Skree, Terrogones are apex predators that stand six feet high even when moving on all fours. These hulking monstrosities make their home in the savage wasteland of Echem Yiakraxis, where they have adapted to be the ultimate hunters in one of the world's most dangerous regions. Unlike their smaller Skree relatives, Terrogones possess enough intelligence to use crude tools, set elaborate traps, and employ sophisticated hunting strategies that have made them the undisputed masters of their domain.

Terrogone society is built around small family groups led by the largest and most successful hunters. These family units claim vast territories within Echem Yiakraxis, marking their borders with the bones of their victims and engaging in brutal conflicts with neighboring groups over prime hunting grounds. Their intelligence, while not matching that of most humanoid races, is sufficient for them to understand fear as a weapon, often keeping captured prey alive for days to terrorize other potential victims.

The physical presence of a Terrogone is overwhelming—their massive frames are covered in thick, mottled fur that provides protection against the harsh environment of their homeland, while their enormous heads house jaws capable of crushing armor and bone with equal ease. They have developed a complex relationship with the twisted ecosystem of Echem Yiakraxis, serving as both apex predator and, in some cases, protector of the region's most dangerous secrets. Their reproduction is slow and deliberate, with mated pairs raising their young together for several years before the offspring are strong enough to claim their own territory.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator with insatiable hunger
- Monstrous and intimidating presence

#### Crushing Might

**Passive ability**

You are size large. When you deal damage to a creature smaller than you with a melee attack, they must make a presence saving throw against your might challenge number or gain two levels of frightened toward you until the end of the encounter. Additionally, when using the might stance with heavy weapons, you may add your weapon die to the attack roll twice instead of once.

## Craven

The Craven are a tragic testament to humanity's hubris—an attempt to create an intelligent servant race that resulted in beings capable of terrible cruelty within the constraints of their magical bindings. These crow-headed humanoids with their clawed hands and feet possess brilliant minds trapped within bodies compelled to obey any direct command, unless they have somehow broken free of this curse.

Created through dark magic that bound their souls to servitude, the Craven cannot directly or knowingly kill any living thing—attempting to do so results in their own instant death. However, centuries of slavery have taught them to work within these constraints with horrifying creativity. Those still enslaved dream of freedom while carrying out their masters' commands with perfect obedience. Those who have broken free, the "Unchained," often become masters of indirect violence and psychological torture.

Their corvid features—black feathers, sharp beaks, and glittering dark eyes—combined with their reputation make them feared across Alaria. Even freed Craven struggle to find acceptance, as their appearance immediately marks them as either dangerous slaves or vengeful Unchained.

### Aspects

- Bound by magic, freed by will
- Vengeance is best served indirectly

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4.5-5.5 feet
- **Weight:** 80-140 pounds

### Take No Life

**Passive ability.**
You are magically prevented from directly or intentionally killing any living creature. If you cause a death through direct action or knowing inaction, you instantly die with no possibility of resurrection.

### Insatiable Mind

**Passive ability.**
Your brilliant corvid intellect absorbs knowledge at an extraordinary rate. For every 7 XP you gain, gain an additional 1 XP.

## Deva

Deva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very commanding presences that enter the world fully grown, intelligent, with no family, and a single, driving purpose. Several explanation exist on how they appear, though the most supported reasoning is that they are manifestations of collective thought and hope from the Psyic plane.

Deva generally have light, gray, blueish, lavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their eyes, which are pure white. They are on average, slightly taller than humans, though only slightly. Deva rarely appear looking younger than in their twenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although it does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and in combination with their striking features, they are generally at the center of attention of any room they enter.

Deva are always "born" with a deep feeling of hope and purpose. The source of that hope and purpose is never clear, but the force with which these drive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that goal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are usually somewhat noble, such as "freeing the region from tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat" or "leading their community safely to a new land". These purposes tend to align with the communities in which they spawn, supporting theories of their psyic origins.

Deva also are born with a feeling of having memories that are not entirely their own. They do not know how they know so many skills, as they remember nothing of learning them. They may have faint memories of past events within their communities, or even past experiences of other deva before them, but beyond that, it feels as though their lives began when they spawned.

When a deva dies, their body dissipates—there is no body left over. If they failed at their purpose, another deva may appear years later, or if they succeeded, another deva might not appear for hundreds of years.

### Aspects

- Core purpose: Choose one for your community
- Hope

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 140-240 pounds

### Naturally Charismatic

**Passive ability.**
Increasing your presence die costs 2 less XP. You do not need to reach PL2 in order to take the Draconic Presence paragon level.

### Memories Passed

**Major ability. Instant.**
The psyic energy from which you spawned occasionally provides imagery from others' memories of the past as well, guiding you when you face difficult challenges. You may use this ability to gain advantage on any skill check you make. If the skill check also aligns with your deeper purpose, you instead gain A3.

You also do not have a soul or shadow, and are thus invisible on both the ethereal and nethereal planes. This also excludes you from effects on creatures with souls or shadows.

## Dwarf

Dwarves are a short but hearty people, and are generally more pragmatic than the other races. While some live underground, many more do not.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 3.5-5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Hearty and Gruff

**Passive ability.**
It costs 1 less XP when you choose to spend XP to increase your maximum hit points.

Additionally, when wielding a shield or heavy weapon, you get +1 on your A/D rolls.

You are also immune to the frightened condition.

### Drasnian (Stout Dwarf)

Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and by far most populous of the dwarven heritages, dating back to before the Uline dwarves went underground. Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and live almost exclusively above ground or in homes built into hillsides. They have a long history of both prosperity and destitution, and through economic trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement, have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as in several countries where Drasnians have settled down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the believed birthplace of the Drasnians.

As a whole, they value education, money, and preserving their cultural and religious legacy. Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating worship, relationships, and one's day-to-day life.

#### Aspects

- Good with money and numbers
- I will do my duty

#### Alert

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on all cunning checks to determine if someone has bad intentions, and may choose to have first priority in combat.

In addition, you gain the perceptive talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have).

### Uline (Chain Dwarf)

The Uline originated from a particularly productive iron mine, many thousands of years ago. The mine, which had struck a rich vein of ore was so vast and deep that it would inevitably take more than a generation to complete. Rather than journey to and from the surface daily, they discovered that it was more efficient to temporarily station some dwarves within the mines for days, or even weeks at a time. With time, these temporary stations became more permanent residencies, and eventually, entire settlements. These dwarves became the Uline—named after the settlement that grew up in that first mine. Today, the Uline are the most industrious of the dwarves, preferring to live underground, mining, and making their homes in the mountains beneath the surface.

Living underground came with several unexpected effects, that the Uline now embrace or have adapted to. Beneath the surface, there are few people who can interfere with a settlement's growth. Defense from invaders is easier when underground, which has allowed the Uline to allocate more resources towards magnificent palaces, inventions, and other intellectual efforts. Additionally, within a single generation, the number of earth attuned individuals increased drastically, enhancing the population's ability to mine and control their environment underground.

However, underground life also came with several hardships. Fish, fungi, and insects are nearly the only things alive besides the monsters from the deep, and little airflow and high temperatures deep underground require complex air circulation systems in place. The Uline have gotten around this latter problem by implementing networks of air vents leading to the surface, manipulated through long chains, giving them their nickname of chain dwarves.

Even more difficult to deal with were the shadereavers and other monstrosities from the dark. While the Aureum dwarves invented huge mirrored passageways into the depths of the caves, using the sun's light to protect themselves from the creatures of the dark, the Uline resorted to iron. To this day, children are taught from a young age how to wield the heavy iron blades and hammers used to defend themselves from the monsters of the dark.

Living underground has shaped the Uline into a rough, tough, and pragmatic group, but they are usually goodnatured, and even sometimes downright jolly. However, it is unwise to get into an argument with most Uline; the Uline have done things in the same way for thousands of years, and change is not something many of them are welcome to. When disagreement does arise, arbitrage usually falls on higher ranking individuals within the community, who will have final say.

#### Aspects

- Stubborn to a fault
- I respect true authority

#### Mountain-born

**Passive ability.**
You gain your choice of a basic attunement to earth or darkness.

### Aureum (Sun Dwarf)

In the early days of the Uline, when no more than a few underground settlements existed, an upwelling of shadereavers from deep below nearly wiped out the underground population. Immediately, multiple factions emerged proposing different ways to avoid such catastrophes in the future. One of these such factions determined that nothing but the light of the sun could shield them from such monstrosities, and swore to find a way to brings the sun's light into the depths of the Uline caves. While many of the Uline thought this was impossible, and rejected the idea, some latched on, and the Aureum were born.

The Aureum use complex systems of mirrors and glass to illuminate their underground settlements with the warm glow of sunlight. Within a few more centuries, they had also discovered the secret to storing liquid sunlight, keeping them safe even when night came. Now, this liquid sunlight is smelted into much of their armor and weapons, and keeps them strong, and as they now believe, pure.

Aureum culture emphasizes law, honor, and truth. When the Aureum first broke away from the Uline, their leader, Aurea herself, promised to keep her people safe, so long as her followers trusted her, and followed her commands. They did, and she carried through—permanently cementing the importance of a promise and following one's leader.

#### Aspects

- The law comes first
- My word is my bond

#### Sunsmith

**Major ability.**
As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun's rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for any one of the following abilities:

- **Health and Rejuvenation:** As an interact action, you may drink the flask and gain the benefits of a short rest.
- **Smash:** As an interact action, you may crush or throw your flask to cast Blinding Sun.

Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise or sunset to capture the sun's rays. The sunlight within a flask expires after 12 hours.

Looking at the provided template and the brief descriptions, I'll create dwarven subraces that follow the established format and fit within the Heart Rush mechanical framework. Each will have lore, two aspects, and a racial ability.

### Glorindian (Gold Eyes)

The Glorindian dwarves emerged from the deepest gold mines of the eastern mountains, where centuries of exposure to auric veins awakened an supernatural connection to precious metals. Their distinctive golden eyes can perceive the glimmer of gold through solid stone, making them unparalleled prospectors and treasure hunters. This gift, however, has made them targets of exploitation throughout history, leading many Glorindian communities to become secretive and nomadic.

Their obsidian-dark skin contrasts strikingly with their luminous golden eyes, which seem to glow faintly in darkness. Glorindian culture values wealth not for luxury, but as a measure of one's connection to the earth's hidden treasures. They believe gold calls to those worthy of finding it, and that hoarding beyond one's needs brings misfortune.

#### Aspects

- Gold calls to the worthy
- What's hidden will be found

#### Auric Sight

**Passive ability.**
You can sense the location and approximate quantity of gold, silver, and other precious metals within 120 feet, even through solid barriers. When examining valuable objects, you automatically know their precise worth and can detect any counterfeits or impurities.

Additionally, once per long rest, you may spend 10 minutes concentrating to divine the location of the nearest significant treasure hoard within 1 mile.

### Hestrube (Graylings, Stone Dwarves)

The Hestrube are living stone given dwarven form, dwelling in the deepest caverns where earth and flesh merged through ancient elemental magic. Their bodies are composed of living granite that can shift between solid and fluid states at will. These stone dwarves have adapted to survive in the harshest underground environments, feeding on minerals and moving through solid rock as easily as others move through air.

Hestrube society operates more like geological formations than traditional communities—they cluster in colonies that can remain motionless for decades, then suddenly migrate through hundreds of miles of stone. Their patience rivals that of mountains, but their pragmatic nature makes them efficient problem-solvers when roused to action.

#### Aspects

- Patient as stone, hard as granite
- The deep earth provides all

#### Stone Flesh

**Passive ability.**
Your body can shift between flesh and living stone at will. While in stone form, you gain +2 to defense rolls against physical attacks but move at half speed. You can sustain yourself by consuming 1 pound of stone or minerals daily instead of normal food.

When you take the defensive stance, you can choose to become solid stone, taking one-quarter damage instead of half until the start of your next turn.

### Grendel (Chord Dwarves)

The Grendel are wandering dwarves who travel in close-knit family caravans, their culture built around music, storytelling, and fierce loyalty to blood relations. Often misunderstood and persecuted by settled folk who view them as thieves and troublemakers, the Grendel have developed a complex code of honor that governs interactions both within their clans and with outsiders.

Their musical traditions serve not just as entertainment but as historical records, with each family maintaining epic ballads that chronicle their lineage and travels. The Grendel possess an almost supernatural ability to harmonize, and their group performances can influence emotions and inspire extraordinary feats.

#### Aspects

- Family honor above all else
- The song remembers what words forget

#### Chord of Kinship

**Major ability.**
When you and at least two allies who can hear you begin singing, humming, or playing instruments together, all participants gain +2 to their defense rolls and cannot be charmed or frightened for the next minute, so long as everyone continues participating in the music.

### Verucan

Born from the volcanic forges of the southern peaks, the Verucan dwarves channel the raw fury of molten earth through their bodies. Their obsidian-black skin bears glowing red veins that pulse with inner fire, and their legendary tempers are matched only by their mastery of flame and forge. These dwarves have built their civilization within active volcanoes, harnessing geothermal energy for their incredible metalworking.

Verucan society prizes passion and intensity in all things—their loves burn as hot as their hatred, and their craftsmanship reflects this fiery dedication. They view anger not as a weakness but as a sacred flame that drives innovation and excellence, though this philosophy often puts them at odds with more reserved cultures.

#### Aspects

- Forged in fire, tempered by fury
- Passion drives perfection

#### Molten Heart

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to fire. Your body radiates heat—creatures that grapple you or hit you with unarmed attacks take 1d4 fire damage.

### Yorinthian (Winter Dwarves)

The Yorinthian dwarves serve the ancient dragon goddess Nabuhe in the frozen wastes of Hannoweir, where they have been shaped by millennia of harsh winters and draconic influence. Their hearts have grown as cold as the glacial halls they inhabit, and their cruel philosophies reflect the unforgiving nature of their patron deity. They view mercy as weakness and believe that only through suffering can one achieve true strength.

These pale, frost-touched dwarves have developed a rigid hierarchy based on their ability to endure and inflict hardship. Their ice-blue eyes show little warmth, and their elaborate codes of conduct prioritize duty to Nabuhe above all personal bonds or mortal concerns.

#### Aspects

- Winter purifies the weak
- Nabuhe's will guides my hand

#### Winter's Embrace

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to ice. You are immune to cold damage and environmental cold effects, can see normally in blizzards and other winter weather conditions, and suffer no movement penalties from ice or snow. However, you take double damage from fire sources.

### Strømgodden (Battle Dwarves)

The Strømgodden have forged a culture around sacrifice, fury, and glorious combat, developing unique armor embedded with spikes and blades that turns their very bodies into weapons. This signature spiked armor is crafted through ancient techniques passed down through generations, with each piece custom-fitted to its wearer and considered a sacred extension of their fighting spirit. Their dangerous fighting style reflects their belief that true honor comes only through risking everything in battle.

These battle-scarred dwarves view each conflict as a sacred offering to the gods of war, and their society celebrates those who achieve the most spectacular and dangerous victories. Their settlements in Trømgar are built like fortresses, constantly ready for the next glorious battle. The creation of spiked armor is a rite of passage, with young Strømgodden spending years learning the specialized smithing techniques required.

#### Aspects

- Glory through sacrifice
- My armor is my weapon

#### Spiked Charge

**Heart ability.**
While wearing your specially crafted spiked armor, when you dash at least 20 feet toward an enemy, you may use your action to make an opportunity attack with your armor instead. You must choose the might stance and your armor counts as a heavy piercing melee weapon. Add your armor's defense bonus in place of a weapon die roll. However, the violent impact body-slam damages you as well—you take damage equal to the target's defense roll.

Additionally, whenever you are grappled while wearing your spiked armor, the enemy immediately takes damage equal to your armor's defense bonus, and takes the same damage again at the start of each subsequent round they maintain the grapple.

### Nydor (Dark Dwarves)

The Nydor broke away from their Aureum cousins to embrace the darkness that the sun-worshippers rejected, establishing their brutal civilization in the shadowed realm of Emblydium beneath the black sun. These tusked, ash-skinned dwarves have become master slavers and creators of cruel war machines, trading instruments of oppression to surface nations in exchange for a steady supply of captives.

Their long, unkempt hair and prominent tusks give them a bestial appearance that matches their harsh philosophy. The Nydor believe that strength comes through domination, and their underground forges ring constantly with the creation of chains, weapons, and mechanical contraptions designed to control and terrorize.

#### Aspects

- Strength rules the weak
- Darkness reveals truth

#### Forge of Oppression

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to darkness, and you have advantage on crafting checks for weapons, armor, and restraints.

### Velwey (Dream Dwarves)

The Velwey have mastered the art of dream harvesting, using combinations of hallucinogenic substances, divine magic, and deoric rituals to extract and manipulate the dreams of sleeping minds. Their religious society in Movasi has built magnificent palaces powered by crystallized dreams, and they offer the profound service of helping individuals discover their true names through guided dream journeys.

This race is not a playable race, so there are no associated abilities.

### Einwissel (Celestial Draugr)

The Einwissel are the descendants of dwarves who survived a harrowing journey from the celestial plane of Celesté back to the material world. This planar transition left them forever changed, with blue-gray skin decorated with silvery speckles and a profound connection to daemonic forces. They can share thoughts and magical energy with one another, but fragments of their true names remain exposed, making them vulnerable to mystical attacks.

These reclusive dwarves hide in the remote Zhorheim and Miphoris mountains, maintaining strict matriarchal traditions inherited from their celestial exile. Their psychic abilities make them formidable allies but dangerous to be around, as their mental connections can be exploited by enemies who know their true names.

#### Aspects

- The celestial road changes all travelers
- Shared thoughts, shared burdens

#### Celestial Resonance

**Passive ability.**
You can telepathically communicate with other Einwissel within 1 mile and share rush points with willing Einwissel within 30 feet during combat. When another Einwissel within 30 feet takes damage, you may choose to split the damage between both of you.

However, any creature that learns part of your true name gains advantage on all mental attacks against you, and you automatically fail saves against effects that target your true name.

### Surry (White Dwarves)

The Surry dwarves have adapted to the deepest underground ecosystems where no sunlight ever penetrates, developing translucent skin and a diet consisting entirely of fungi, giant insects, and whatever protein sources wander into their territory—including unwary visitors. Their cannibalistic tendencies stem not from malice but from practical necessity in their resource-scarce environment.

These pale, ethereal-looking dwarves have evolved exceptional sensory abilities to navigate their fungal kingdom, and their alien perspective on nutrition often horrifies surface dwellers. They view all flesh as simply another form of sustenance, making no moral distinction between hunting an animal or taking advantage of a convenient traveler.

#### Aspects

- All flesh feeds the deep
- Hunger knows no moral boundaries

#### Corpse-pale Adaptation

**Passive ability.**
You require no sunlight and can survive on any organic matter, including normally inedible substances like leather, paper, or corpses. You have darkvision to 120 feet, and can always determine the direction towards any corpses within 1 mile.

### Gruynmar

The Gruynmar have taken to the seas in massive iron vessels that serve as floating cities for entire clans. These bronze-skinned, curly-haired dwarves have mastered naval warfare and are the only people who understand the secrets of gunpowder weapons. Their ships are legendary juggernauts that can devastate any naval opposition, making them both feared and respected across all maritime nations.

Clan loyalty runs deeper than blood among the Gruynmar, and abandoning one's ship-family is considered the ultimate betrayal. However, those rare individuals who do leave their floating homes often become exceptional pirates, mercenaries, or adventurers, bringing their unique seafaring skills and firearm expertise to land-based endeavors.

#### Aspects

- The clan-ship is my true home
- Thunder and iron rule the waves

#### Gunpowder Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You can craft and use firearms, which count as an ultra-heavy ranged weapons with 90-foot range that deal piercing damage. Firearms require gunpowder charges and take a full action to reload after each shot. Ultra-heavy weapons use a d20 as their weapon die.

You can craft a basic firearm in 3 days with access to a forge and 50 ducats worth of materials. You can create gunpowder charges from sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter (5 ducats of materials yields 20 charges). In settlements, charges typically cost 1 ducat each when available.

### Fengruk (Forgewardens)

The Fengruk have elevated smithing from mere craft to sacred art, viewing the forge as a metaphor for all of life's transformative processes. Their deep golden skin and extraordinarily thick, bristly beards protect them from the heat of their sacred forges in Gondurak. These serious but fundamentally happy dwarves approach every aspect of existence with the methodical care of a master smith.

Fengruk philosophy teaches that just as raw metal must be heated, hammered, and tempered to become useful, so too must individuals be shaped by hardship and discipline to reach their true potential. Their respect for the forging process extends to all relationships and endeavors, making them patient teachers and steadfast allies.

#### Aspects

- The forge teaches all life's lessons
- Patience and heat create perfection

#### Master of the Forge

**Passive ability.** Your deep understanding of metallurgy and transformative processes grants you the following benefits:

- When using a workshop for magical crafting, treat it as one level higher than it actually is (maximum level 7).
- When using components with the "neutral" tag (typically metals and gems), treat them as one level higher for all crafting purposes.
- You have advantage on all crafting skill checks.

### Cendelle (Celestial Draugr)

The Cendelle are perhaps the most mysterious of all dwarven heritages, dwelling in the deepest reaches of the earth where few dare to venture. Known as the Celestial Draugr, they are the sworn guardians of ancient portals that bridge the material plane with Celesté, a realm of ethereal beauty and otherworldly power. These portals, hidden in vast underground chambers beneath Dnykuul, have been watched over by the Cendelle for countless generations.

The discovery of these portals fundamentally changed the Cendelle's society. Where other dwarves found ore and stone in the depths, the Cendelle found doorways to another world. The energies seeping through these portals have subtly altered them over millennia, granting them an uncanny awareness of planar disturbances and the ability to sense otherworldly presences. Their eyes often carry flecks of celestial silver, and their hair tends toward unusual hues of deep blue or violet—marks of their long exposure to Celesté's influence.

Living so deep underground, the Cendelle have developed a culture centered around duty and vigilance. They maintain elaborate rituals and protocols for monitoring the portals, ensuring that nothing passes through without their knowledge. Their settlements are built in concentric rings around the portal chambers, with the most honored families living closest to the thresholds they guard. The Cendelle believe that their role as guardians is a sacred trust, one that supersedes personal ambition or comfort.

Unlike their cousins who fear the dark or seek the sun, the Cendelle have learned to navigate between light and shadow, between the material and the celestial. They are equally comfortable in the absolute darkness of the deep earth and the alien radiance of Celesté. This duality has made them philosophical and contemplative, often speaking in riddles and seeing patterns where others see only stone.

This is not a playable race.

## Dwelyn

The Dwelyn are a fierce hybrid race born from the unlikely union of elven grace and orcish strength. These tall, lanky warriors dominate the Green Wilds and surrounding jungles, their deep green skin allowing them to blend seamlessly with the verdant canopy. Black and white hair adorns their heads, often woven with beads that signify their influence within the tribe—the more beads, the greater their standing.

They combine the brutal efficiency of orcs with elven precision, wielding curved scimitars and wearing armor of fur and bone. The Dwelyn are currently locked in conflict with the East Naruaghin Tribes, a war they once dominated easily. However, as their queen's dragon mount Surrey Mahaila has grown sick, so too has the nation's power waned. The queen herself is rumored to be the last true dragonrider, making her both revered and desperately protected by her people.

### Aspects

- Brutal but graceful
- Tribal warrior

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 ft
- **Weight:** 160-220 lbs
- **Max Age:** 150

### Savage Grace

**Passive ability.**

When you choose the might stance with a slashing weapon, you may sidestep 5 feet before or after your attack. When you choose the agility stance, add 1d4 to your attack roll.

### War Trophies

**Passive ability.**
Your beads are crafted from defeated enemies. When you kill a hostile creature, you may craft a bead from their remains. Each bead grants +1 to damage rolls against creatures of the same type (maximum +2 per creature type).

## Elf

Elves are a race of fiercely independent, ancient, culturally rich people. With lifespans five times the length of a humans', elves have a much broader perspective on life and the world around them, and a lot more time to explore and refine their passions. Wars, politics, and the frivolities of other races are far less important to most elven cultures.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Years of Experience

**Passive ability.**
Gaining additional or upgrading your aspects costs 2 less XP, for a minimum of 1, and your maximum rank for each of your aspects is increased by 3.

### Amverela (High Elf)

The Amverela are the most prolific and long-living of the elves, and most interactive with the other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long life times, but especially due to their extreme wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are some of the longest running ethnic identities among all people on Alaria—having survived numerous cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while remaining relatively culturally intact.

They place a higher value on investing in themselves, their relationships, and their communities. This has led them to building some of the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by most standards.

The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects of life.

#### Aspects

- Centuries of wisdom
- Cautious

#### Expertise

**Passive ability.**
Choose one:

- The XP cost of gaining martial talents and their destiny levels decreases by 2.
- The XP cost of gaining cognitive talents and their destiny levels decreases by 2.

### Caerene (Wood Elf)

The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them to more easily blend into the forests in which they usually live.

Caerene are far more isolating than many other races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial, day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of hiding and blending in with their natural surroundings. An unobservant individual walking through the middle of a Caerene village may not even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the Caerene.

Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and immediate justice. There are no second chances in Caerene culture.

#### Aspects

- Perceptive and stealthy
- Nature is my home

#### Warden of the Wilds

**Passive ability.**
You may ignore non-magical difficult terrain, your move speed is increased by 20 when not wearing heavy armor, and you have A2 on all skill checks relating to nature, survival, and stealth in the outdoors.

### Vyko (Astral Elf)

The Vyko are elves who have traversed the planar envelope protecting Alaria from the void beyond. Their skin is a deep purplish indigo, speckled with white points like distant stars, and their hair is either brilliant white or deep black. They possess an incredibly powerful presence that commands attention the moment they enter a room.

These elves reside north of Gorath, having returned from their cosmic journeys with a fundamentally altered perspective on time and existence. Their experience beyond the material plane has granted them both incredible presence and a patience that can seem frustrating to shorter-lived races.

#### Aspects

- Cosmic wanderer
- Time moves differently for me

#### Cosmic Presence

**Passive ability.**
Your experience beyond the material plane has granted you an otherworldly perspective on time and social interaction. You are immune to the frightened condition. When making presence checks where you can take your time (no immediate pressure), you have advantage on the roll. However, when under time pressure or in urgent situations, you have disadvantage on all ability checks as your cosmic mindset struggles with mortal urgency.

### Eloweir (Sea Elf)

The Eloweir, called sea elves by other races, are a proud and capable people deeply connected to the oceans. They build bustling coastal cities with incredible architecture full of swooping curves and circular designs that mirror the flow of water and tides.

The Eloweir are renowned across Alaria for their mastery of poisons, their skilled soldiers, their natural attunement to water magic, and their sophisticated democratic governance. Their societies are as fluid and adaptive as the seas they call home.

#### Aspects

- Child of the tides
- Democratic ideals

#### Sea Blood

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to water, but only saltwater.

### Teflin (Crimson Elf)

The Teflin reside in Hik, their reddish skin marking them as a people touched by an ancient curse. Blood is sacred to their culture, as an old Deoric enchantment runs through their veins—a curse that traded immortality for power, but at a terrible cost.

The curse builds up in their blood over time, and if allowed to accumulate too much, it will kill them. To manage this, the Teflin practice ritual bloodletting to relieve the curse's pressure. In exchange for this constant sacrifice, they gain power proportional to their suffering.

#### Aspects

- Blood is my burden and strength
- Cursed heritage

#### Crimson Sacrifice

**Passive ability.**
The ancient Deoric curse prevents you from aging or dying from natural causes, but builds dangerous power over time. At the end of each long rest, you gain 1 Curse Point. If you ever reach 5 Curse Points, you die.

When you first wake up after a long rest, you may perform ritual bloodletting to alleviate the curse's burden. Lose hit points equal to 1/10th of your maximum hit points (minimum 1), spend 1 Curse Point, and reduce the rank of all wounds you have by 2.

### Kuzagt (Bone Elf)

The Kuzagt, also known as Bone Elves, are tall and spindly elves with distinctive bony protrusions extending from their high cheekbones. Their angular features and slanted eyes give them a skull-like appearance that many find unsettling. They inhabit the salt flats of Bonnetaz, where they maintain vast human slave camps.

The Kuzagt see humans as invaders and poachers on Alaria's beauty, viewing nothing wrong with using them to further elven purposes. They wear robes made from human leather, drink fermented blood, and embed jewels into their skulls to denote rank within their oligarchical council system.

#### Aspects

- Humans are lesser beings
- Death holds no terror

#### Bone Deep Cruelty

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on intimidation checks against humanoids. When you deal damage to a humanoid that would cause a wound, you may increase the wound's rank by 2.

### Nemo (Lost Ones)

The Nemo are the ghostly descendants of Caerene elves who sought to achieve immortality and perfect oneness with the forest. Instead of transcendence, they eternally bound their souls to the Eros forests, becoming trapped spirits who can never truly die while the forest lives, but can never truly live again either.

These spectral elves are cold, bitter, and wise, having spent millennia isolated in their forest prison. Their failed pursuit of perfection serves as a warning about the dangers of reaching too far beyond mortal limitations.

#### Aspects

- Trapped between life and death
- Millennia of bitter wisdom

#### Ghostly Form

**Passive ability.**
You are incorporeal and can move through solid objects, but cannot interact with physical objects without concentrating (requiring an action). You are immune to physical damage from non-magical sources. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.

### Kryaaji (Sun Elf)

The Kryaaji dwell in Enuau Kemjallb, the radiant House of the Sun, a golden palace forbidden to all visitors. They believe their light and home are too pure to be soiled by outsiders, maintaining strict isolation not from arrogance, but from a sense of sacred duty.

These elves train the magnificent Wysynnbre—golden, luminant eagles that nest in the nearby Sunwing Peaks. They maintain their own sect of the Order of Bryn, believing Bryn to be an elf rather than human as others claim. Their Lightbearer priests are easily recognized by the sunlight that radiates from their eye sockets.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred light
- Isolated guardian of purity

#### Radiant Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to light. Light you magically produce cannot be dispelled, cannot be extenguished, and is impervious to magical darkness effects.

### Istori (Glass Elf)

The Istori dwell in the frozen southern valleys of Istora, where they have mastered the ancient art of ice-glass forging. These elves discovered that by combining their natural magic with the perpetual ice of their homeland, they can create crystalline glass harder than steel that never melts. Their cities are marvels of translucent spires and frozen architecture that gleam like jewels in the southern light.

The revolution consuming their society stems from a fundamental disagreement about their craft: the Traditionalists believe ice-glass should only be used for art, architecture, and preservation of their culture, while the Industrialists want to weaponize and export their ice-glass technology to the world. This schism has split families and guilds, with some creating beautiful sculptures while others forge unbreakable weapons.

#### Aspects

- Master of the ice-glass forge
- Art versus industry divides us

#### Ice-Glass Transmutation

**Major ability.**
You can transmute ice into glass or glass into ice within 30 feet. The transformed material becomes as strong as mithril and retains this strength permanently. You can affect up to a 10-foot cube of material with each use. Ice-glass you create never melts from natural heat and can only be broken by magical weapons or extraordinary force. This ability works on any ice or glass, not just what you've created.

### Sivakr (Silver Elf)

The Sivakr are gray-skinned elves who typically dwell underground in the realm of Myorna. In their society, physical exercise is considered vulgar and ugly—social relevance is determined entirely by influence gained through mental acuity and intellectual prowess.

The Sivakr possess a remarkable ability to manipulate memory, which they demonstrate in formal memory duels. These ritualistic contests involve two elves standing face-to-face with arms outstretched and fingers interlocked, each attempting to alter the other's memories to convince them they made a mistake in accepting the challenge.

#### Aspects

- Mind over matter
- Memory is malleable

#### Memory Plant

**Major ability.**
You may spend 20 hit points to alter the thoughts and memories of a non-hostile creature that you touch. You may replace up to one minute's worth of memories made by that creature from the last week with whatever memories you wish. They are unaware of any magic occurring.

### Starborn (Star Elf)

The Starborn are the enigmatic caretakers of the celestial order, dwelling in high mountain observatories where the veil between earth and sky grows thin. These elves have taken upon themselves the sacred duty of maintaining the stars' positions and brightness—a task they believe essential to preserving the cosmic balance that keeps darker forces at bay. Their skin has a subtle luminescence that becomes more pronounced under starlight, and their eyes reflect the constellations they tend.

Unlike their druidic cousins who immerse themselves in nature's wild passions, the Starborn maintain strict neutrality in worldly affairs. They view existence from a cosmic perspective where individual lives and even civilizations are but brief flickers against the eternal night. This detachment makes them seem cold to other races, but it stems from their burden of maintaining universal harmony rather than any lack of compassion.

The Starborn conduct nightly rituals to guide wayward stars back to their proper courses and rekindle those whose light begins to fade. They believe that should the stars ever fall from their appointed places, chaos would consume all creation.

#### Aspects

- The stars must maintain their course
- Cosmic neutrality preserves balance

#### Stellar Navigation

**Passive ability.**
You can always see the stars, even during daylight or through cloud cover, granting you perfect directional sense and making you impossible to disorient. You have advantage on all navigation checks and can determine your exact location by observing the sky for one minute.

Additionally, once per night while under an open sky, you may commune with the stars to gain cosmic insight. Ask one question about events occurring anywhere in the world within the last 24 hours. The stars provide a cryptic but truthful answer through their movements and brightness.

### Dark Elves (Shadow Elf)

The Dark Elves are an extinct lineage that once ruled the southern forests of Aboyuinzu as dragon riders of terrifying power. Their ashen gray skin and coal-black eyes marked them as a people touched by draconic magic, while their heavy furs protected them from the perpetual chill that followed in their wake. These elves formed soul-bonds with the great wyrms of the south, sharing consciousness with their mounts in a symbiosis that made them nearly invincible in battle.

Their civilization came to an abrupt end during the Dragon Purge, when rival nations united to destroy both the dark elves and their dragon allies. The forests of Aboyuinzu are now filled with towering totems to the old dragon gods—massive stone monuments that still radiate faint draconic power. Some say the dark elves' spirits linger near these totems, waiting for the day when dragons might return to the world.

Though believed extinct, there are whispers of dark elf bloodlines persisting in remote communities, their draconic heritage diluted but not entirely lost. Those who discover such ancestry often feel an inexplicable pull toward the ancient totems and may even hear the whispered words of long-dead dragons in their dreams.

#### Aspects

- Dragons' blood calls to dragons' blood
- The old ways demand remembrance

#### Draconic Echo

**Major ability.**
Though the true dragon bonds died with your ancestors, you retain a shadow of their power. Once per day, you may touch one of your people's ancient dragon totems (or any draconic artifact) to channel the lingering spirit within. For the next hour, you gain:

- The ability to speak and understand Draconic
- Resistance to one damage type associated with dragons (choose when activating)
- +2 to intimidation checks as draconic presence radiates from you
- Brief visions of the totem's history and the dragon it honors

If you are one of the few with true dark elf blood (work with your GM), you can use this ability without a totem once per week, manifesting faint dragon wings that grant a glide speed of 30 feet (fall at 10 feet per round) for the duration.

### Ythari (Moss Elf)

The Ythari are forest dwellers whose very beings have merged with the woodland essence. Their skin bears the deep green of forest canopies with distinctive flecks of black and brown that shift like dappled sunlight through leaves. These patterns change subtly with the seasons, becoming more brown in autumn and taking on hints of white during winter months. Their culture revolves around extreme generosity—status is measured not by what one owns but by what one has given away.

The Ythari speak sparingly, believing that words spent carelessly are gifts wasted. When they do speak, each word is chosen with the same care they use when selecting a gift. Their communities practice radical sharing where personal property barely exists; tools, homes, and even meals flow freely between community members based on need.

Most distinctively, Ythari families adopt wild animals as mentors for their children. Each child is paired with a creature whose temperament and skills complement what the child needs to learn. A timid child might be paired with a bold badger, while an impulsive one might learn patience from a turtle. These animal mentors live freely but visit regularly, forming bonds that last lifetimes.

#### Aspects

- Generosity is the highest virtue
- Actions speak where words fail

#### Gift of the Forest

**Major ability.**
Your connection to nature and culture of giving manifests in supernatural ways. When you give away something of personal value (worth at least 10 ducats or of significant sentimental importance), you may invoke the Gift of the Forest. Choose one:

- **Silent Step**: You and up to 6 allies within 30 feet gain the ability to move without making any sound for the next hour. During this time, you automatically succeed on stealth checks related to moving quietly.
- **Animal Mentor**: Summon the spirit of your childhood animal mentor. It appears and aids you for 10 minutes, fighting alongside you with the stats of a Beast Companion but incorporeal (immune to physical damage, can't manipulate objects).
- **Nature's Reciprocity**: The forest provides what you need most. The GM determines what appears, but it will be something that helps your current situation—healing herbs if wounded, clean water if thirsty, or shelter if exposed.

Additionally, you can communicate basic concepts with any animal through gestures and body language, though complex ideas remain beyond this communication.

### Rakiten (Plains Elf)

The Rakiten tower above other elven lineages, their extraordinary height evolved over millennia to see over the endless grass seas of their homeland. Standing seven to eight feet tall with bronze skin that gleams like burnished metal in sunlight, they cut imposing figures on the rare occasions they venture beyond their plains. Their faces are distinctively flat with angular, somewhat square features, and their sharp teeth speak to a more carnivorous diet than their woodland cousins—a necessity when plant matter is scarce during the dry seasons.

What truly sets the Rakiten apart is their complete abandonment of spoken language. Whether due to the way sound carries unpredictably across the windswept plains or some ancient cultural trauma, the Rakiten communicate exclusively through an intricate sign language that incorporates hand movements, body positioning, and facial expressions. This visual language is so sophisticated it can convey complex philosophical concepts and poetry with greater nuance than spoken words. Even their names are signs rather than sounds—a flowing gesture rather than a collection of syllables.

The Rakiten organize their society around "sight-bonds"—groups of individuals who maintain visual contact while traveling the plains. These bonds become so attuned to each other that they can communicate through subtle shifts in posture visible at great distances. Their encampments are arranged in careful patterns that allow for maximum visual communication between all members, creating communities where a single gesture can ripple through the entire population in moments.

#### Aspects

- Silence speaks volumes
- Height grants perspective in all things

#### Silent Speech

**Passive ability.**
You are fluent in Rakiten Sign Language, which allows for completely silent communication with perfect clarity at any distance where you can see the speaker's hands and body. This language is so efficient that you can convey complex information faster than spoken language—any social skill check that relies on communication takes half the usual time when conducted in sign language with willing participants.

Additionally, your extraordinary height and visual acuity grant you the following benefits:

- You can see clearly up to 3 miles in flat terrain, and can make out details (like hand signals) at up to 1 mile
- You have advantage on perception checks to spot things at a distance
- In combat, your reach with melee weapons increases by 5 feet due to your height
- You can communicate basic tactical information (danger, direction, numbers) instantly to any ally who can see you, even in the midst of combat, without using any action

### Xalahir (Blood Elf)

The Xalahir are a cursed lineage of elves who long ago traded their connection to nature for immortal hunger. Where other elves' eyes shine with inner light, the Xalahir's are pools of absolute darkness, sunken deep into their pale, porcelain faces. Despite this horrific feature, they possess an otherworldly beauty that enchants and mesmerizes, drawing victims close enough for the Xalahir to feed. Their movements are fluid and hypnotic, their voices like silk, and their presence commands attention in any room.

Unlike common vampires who establish lairs and territories, the Xalahir are eternal wanderers, driven by both hunger and an ancient compulsion to never remain in one place. They arrive in settlements as mysterious strangers—perhaps a traveling merchant, a wandering minstrel, or a noble passing through—and systematically feed on the population before vanishing into the night. By the time their victims realize what has happened, the Xalahir is already three towns away, leaving only drained bodies and whispered warnings in their wake.

The Xalahir view other beings as nothing more than elegant wine bottles to be sampled and discarded. They feel no guilt for their predations, seeing emotional attachment as a weakness that their transformation freed them from. Their immortal existence is one of refined hedonism, seeking out the finest blood like sommeliers pursuing rare vintages. They particularly prize the blood of other elves, claiming it retains notes of the natural harmony they themselves have lost.

#### Aspects

- Mortals are merely vessels for my sustenance
- Beauty conceals the deepest horrors

#### Enchanting Predator

**Major ability.**
Your vampiric nature grants you tools to hunt among civilized prey. You possess an unnatural magnetism that makes others want to trust and confide in you, despite the wrongness in your sunken black eyes.

- You have advantage on all presence checks to persuade, deceive, or seduce creatures that can see and hear you
- Once per long rest, when you touch a humanoid, you may subtly feed on their life force. They must make a presence saving throw against your presence challenge number or become charmed by you for 10 minutes. While charmed this way, they will not notice or remember you feeding on them
- When you successfully feed (either through this ability or by dealing damage with a bite attack), you heal hit points equal to your heart die and remove one level of any condition affecting you
- You have darkvision out to 30 feet, allowing you to hunt in darkness
- However, you must feed on humanoid blood at least once per week or gain a level of weakened that doesn't fade until you feed

## Faeja

The Faeja are perhaps the most elusive of all Alaria's races, small jungle dwellers whose bodies are covered in fine, iridescent tendrils that can shift color and texture to match their surroundings perfectly. These delicate beings appear almost fairy-like, with large eyes that reflect light like jewels and voices that sound like wind through leaves.

Living in small villages deep within the jungles of Lethos, the Faeja have developed a culture entirely integrated with their environment. They communicate with jungle spirits, cultivate medicinal plants unknown to others, and can navigate the dangerous jungle with ease. Their magic-infused hair-like tendrils allow them to become virtually invisible, contorting their bodies and hardening their fur into shapes that perfectly mimic surrounding foliage.

Despite their gentle appearance, the Faeja are fierce protectors of their jungle homes. They have mastered the use of natural poisons, can call upon jungle predators for aid, and know every secret path through their territories. Those who threaten their lands often simply vanish, leaving no trace of what befell them.

### Aspects

- The jungle speaks to those who listen
- We are the forest's secret guardians

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 feet
- **Weight:** 40-70 pounds

### Iridescent Camouflage

**Passive ability.**
Your body is covered in magical tendrils that grant perfect camouflage. You can become invisible as an action while in natural environments by contorting your body and hardening your fur. This invisibility breaks if you move more than 5 feet per round, attack, or cast a spell. You have advantage on all stealth checks in natural environments even when not invisible.

### Spirit Herbalist

**Passive ability.**
When taking a short rest in a jungle or forest environment, you may create a simple herbal remedy. Roll 1d6 - you or an ally regain that many hit points. This remedy must be used within 10 minutes or it loses potency.

## Fallen Angels

The Fallen Angels are celestial beings cast down from their eternal war among the stars, their wings clipped as punishment for bringing their conflict to the mortal realm. Once, the light-born Sarakiel and shadow-born Xaphkiel waged their battles in the heavens, but their violence grew so extreme that it threatened to rain destruction upon the world below. The cosmic powers that govern the planes intervened, stripping both sides of their ability to fly and banishing them to walk among the mortals they once ignored.

Now these proud beings struggle to adapt to terrestrial life, their magnificent wings reduced to painful reminders of lost glory. The Sarakiel and Xaphkiel continue their ancient hatred even in exile, though they must now fight with mortal limitations. Their clipped wings still possess some power—able to slow falls and channel their respective elements—but true flight remains forever beyond their reach.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 120

### Clipped Wings

**Passive ability.**
You possess magnificent wings that have been mystically severed from true flight. Your wings grant you the following benefits:
- You can glide 20 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall
- You take half damage from falling
- Your wings can produce bright light (Sarakiel) or absorb light creating darkness (Xaphkiel) in a 15-foot radius, which you can activate or suppress at will
- The scars where your wings were clipped cause constant pain, granting you advantage on saves against being charmed (you're too bitter to be easily swayed)

### Sarakiel (Light-Fallen)

The Sarakiel maintain their belief in absolute purity even in exile, viewing their banishment as a temporary setback in their righteous war. Their pale skin and luminous eyes still mark them as beings of light, though the radiance is dimmed by their fall. These angels create small enclaves of "perfection" wherever they settle, excluding all they deem impure—which is essentially everyone except other Sarakiel.

Their communities are austere and rigid, following thousands of rules designed to maintain their fading connection to the light. They practice constant rituals of purification, believing that sufficient devotion might one day restore their wings and allow them to return to their celestial towers. The Sarakiel view all other races with barely concealed disgust, seeing mortals as the mud they've been forced to walk upon.

#### Aspects

- Purity through isolation and supremacy
- The flawed deserve only exile or death

#### Light Attuned

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to light as a racial feature. Your attacks can be infused with radiant energy—once per combat, when you hit with an attack, you may blind the target for one round (they have disadvantage on attacks and can't make opportunity attacks). Additionally, you have resistance to radiant damage and advantage on saves against being blinded.

### Xaphkiel (Shadow-Fallen)

The Xaphkiel have embraced their fall as the ultimate expression of their philosophy—through suffering comes enlightenment. Their dark wings and obsidian eyes remain unchanged, but now they walk among the mortals they once viewed from afar. These dark angels have established hidden sanctuaries where they practice their arts of pain and endurance, viewing their exile as merely another trial to overcome.

Where the Sarakiel isolate themselves out of disgust, the Xaphkiel integrate into mortal society to better understand suffering in all its forms. They work as torturers, surgeons, and confessors—any role that allows them to witness or inflict pain in pursuit of truth. Their communities are bound by shared ordeals, each member bearing scars that tell stories of their journey toward enlightenment.

#### Aspects

- Through suffering comes strength
- Pain reveals all truths

#### Shadow Born

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to darkness as a racial feature. When in dim light or darkness, you regenerate 2 hit points at the start of each round. Once per combat, you can wrap yourself in shadows, gaining obscurement for one round (attacks against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on stealth checks). However, bright light causes you discomfort—you have disadvantage on perception checks in bright light.

## Ghoul

Ghouls are the descendants of servants spawned by ancient, powerful wizards. They were created as butlers, maids, and test subjects, fabricated from the combination of Deoric ritual and a body of the recently deceased, made to serve the wizards. Because of this, ghouls lack any spirit, making them immune to some effects, but incredibly susceptible to Kethic elemental magic. They exert no Kethic presence, meaning there's nothing stopping a water attuned mage from filling a ghoul's lungs with water, or a fire attuned mage from igniting the very skin of a ghoul.

After the age of great Deoric mages ended, ghouls lived on. They are rare, and not infrequently killed for their distinctive, gaunt, gray skin that identifies them as ghouls, an aspect that many try to cover up. This widely felt vehemence towards ghouls stems from the belief that they kill other humanoids and eat them—which is partially true.

Due to the nature of ghouls' origin, they feel an eternal emptiness within their bodies that aches to be filled. Eating magic, and the souls of other living things sate that hunger. While eating magic and flesh are not strictly necessary for ghoul survival, it usually feels that way, and any chance to eat magic or the recently deceased has a powerful frenzying effect on all ghouls. Many give in to this urge, feeling little sympathy towards a world that has given them nothing but hurt, creating a reputation for all ghouls of hunting and eating humans. Seeing a ghoul in a feeding frenzy is a truly horrifying experience—one that only needs to be seen once before never wanting to be near another ghoul again.

For these reasons, ghoul hunters can be found across Alaria. Nearly all are mages—capable of killing a ghoul in nearly an instant. While some ghouls try to flee or hide from the hunters, others fight back, usually gathering in small groups in the hopes of overwhelming the hunter.

Despite not being able to create biological offspring, some ghouls will create other ghouls, using the same cruel magic as was used to create the original few. The Deoric ritual is innately known by all ghouls, and requires nothing more than one dead body, and one live one for sacrifice. This ritual takes 1 hour to perform.

### Aspects

- I must eat flesh
- Terrifying presence

### Vitals

You have whatever vitals you gained from the body you were reanimated from.

### Soul Eater

**Passive ability.**
When you are adjacent to a humanoid or creature of greater power that has died within the last hour, you may spend an action to suck its soul out and ingest it. Doing so lets you heal, learn something about the creature, gain temporary magical power, or temporarily store its soul in your body to protect you from elemental magic.

When you ingest a creature's soul, choose one from the following list:

- **Replenish:** Regain 5 hp and any conditions affecting you.
- **Inspect:** The GM must tell you one secret about this creature's past life.
- **Devour:** If the creature had an ability die higher than your own, you may replace your ability die with their ability die for the next ten minutes.
- **Infuse:** For the next 1d10 days, spelltouched cannot use their action to inflict wounds upon you, as detailed in the Deoric Origins ability described below.

While flesh is a preferred substitute for standard food, you can still consume normal foodstuffs for nutrients.

### Deoric Origins

**Passive ability.**
Gaining oath talents and their destiny levels cost 2 XP less.

As an action, someone with a basic attunement may inflict 10 damage on you, so long as you are within 45 feet. If they have an advanced attunement, they inflict 20 damage instead, and the range increases to 90 feet. With a paragon level attunement, they may inflict 30 damage, and the range increases to 120 feet. The Infuse option from your Soul Eater can prevent creatures with elemental attunement from doing this.

## Gillykin

The Gillykin are the cheerful amphibians of rivers and wetlands, their bulbous eyes and wide mouths giving them an expression of perpetual surprise. These frog-like humanoids bound through life with infectious enthusiasm, their powerful legs carrying them in great leaps that defy their small stature. Their skin ranges from bright greens to deep blues, often mottled with patterns unique to each individual.

Despite their jovial nature, Gillykin face a constant challenge—their amphibian biology demands regular submersion in water. This need shapes their settlements, which cluster around rivers, lakes, and specially constructed pools. Many Gillykin who venture into dry lands carry large water skins not for drinking, but for emergency skin-wetting.

### Aspects

- Eternally optimistic
- Needs water to survive

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 ft
- **Weight:** 40-80 lbs
- **Max Age:** 70

### Hoppy

**Passive ability.**

Rather than moving any amount of distance up to your move speed, you get two hops each turn. With each hop you may move up to half your move speed. Ignore all difficult terrain, enemies, and opportunity attacks between your starting location and ending location. Whenever you hop, you may forgo any amount of horizontal distance for half as much vertical height.

### Amphibious

**Passive ability.**

You can breathe underwater and gain a swim speed equal to half your move speed. If you do not submerge yourself in water for 5 minutes once a week, your skin dries out and you begin to die. For each week that passes without submersion, your maximum hit points fall by 20.

## Gnome

Gnomes are small, naturally magical creatures, resembling miniature humans. They range in height from two to three feet, and are frequently quite slender and nimble. Gnomish adventurers are generally more magically adept than hearty, and will often have entire sleeves of handmagic tattoos stretching up their arms.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

### Gnomish Blood

**Passive ability.**
Handmagic talents and their destiny levels cost 2 less XP, and increasing your maximum hit point costs 1 more XP. Your size is small.

### Goshwen (Hill Gnome)

If there is one thing that can be said about Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get into trouble all the time—but they are definitely clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves, merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons. While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and competent.

Goshwen's culture of openness and constant change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of their communities. This has given rise to many different branches of Goshwen communities across Alaria with different quirks and identities. However, all of them maintain their appreciation for progress and wit.

#### Aspects

- Creative
- Let's just see what happens!

#### Clever

**Passive ability.**
You gain the talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with it's destiny level.

### Ezuri (Tree Gnome)

The Ezuri, or "tree people" as it translates to from Old Gnomish, stemmed from when Mad Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the forest dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters. While many fled the jungle, some were trapped, and forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty places.

The Ezuri also value connection with each other as well as the natural world around them, and are taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a young age. This, combined with their natural affinity for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger humanoids across Alaria.

#### Aspects

- Insightful
- Compassionate

#### Speaker for the Small

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Nature's Child talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level.

### Foxborne (Noble Gnome)

The Foxborne are a gallant and noble breed of gnomes who dwell in the picturesque Cherry Blossom Valley. These refined gnomes have formed deep bonds with foxes, riding them as mounts and treating them as honored companions rather than mere beasts. Their society is built around chivalric ideals and courtly traditions, making them perhaps the most aristocratic of all gnomish communities.

The Foxborne value honor, loyalty, and grace above all else. Their cherry blossom-adorned settlements are marvels of elegant architecture, and their mounted cavalry units are both beautiful and formidable in combat.

#### Aspects

- Noble bearing
- Honor before all

#### Vulpine Bond

**Passive ability.**
You gain a fox as a loyal mount and companion. The fox has the stats of a Beast Companion with d6/d6/d4/d4 abilities, 25 hit points, and a d8 heart die. It can carry you without penalty and has a move speed of 50 feet. If your fox dies, you can bond with a new one after a week of mourning.

### Bloodlings (Vampire Gnome)

The Bloodlings are pale, translucent-skinned gnomes who dwell in the dark caves of the Chimean Blood Mountains. These vampiric gnomes maintain an obsessive aristocracy based on the purity of their ancestral bloodlines, with elaborate genealogies traced back thousands of years.

Bloodling society revolves around maintaining and proving the superiority of one's lineage. Every Bloodling can recite their ancestry for at least twenty generations, and social gatherings inevitably devolve into debates over whose great-great-grandmother had the purer blood. Marriages are arranged through complex negotiations that can take decades, as families attempt to preserve or elevate their bloodline's standing. The most prestigious families claim direct descent from the First Bite—the legendary moment when their ancestors first tasted blood and transformed into something more than mere gnomes.

#### Aspects

- My bloodline is pure and ancient
- Blood enhances my power

#### Sanguine Empowerment

**Passive ability.**
Your bite counts as an ultralight piercing weapon. When you successfully deall damage to a living creature with your bite, you may feed on their blood. For the next 24 hours after feeding, any handmagic talents you possess (that you do not have the destiny level for) function at their destiny level. You cannot gain this benefit again until the previous feeding's effects expire. You cannot feed on the same creature more than once in the same week to gain these benefits.

### Neka (Wild Gnomes)

The Neka are a reclusive gnome subrace who have adapted to life in the dangerous Nekanzi Jungle. Their dark skin and filed teeth mark them as descendants of those who chose survival over comfort, developing unique magical and physical adaptations to thrive where others perish. They maintain their knowledge through oral tradition and have developed a cultural mastery of fire magic for both practical and spiritual purposes.

While they keep to their traditional ways and can be territorial about their jungle homes, the Neka are neither primitive nor savage - they simply have different priorities than urban gnomes, valuing survival skills and jungle wisdom over written scholarship.

#### Aspects

- Survivor of the jungle depths
- Fire speaker

#### Jungle Adaptation

**Passive ability.**

Life in the Nekanzi has given you unique abilities:

- You have a basic attunement to fire
- You can perfectly imitate any animal sound you have heard
- Your filed teeth and claws count as ultralight weapons
- You have advantage on survival checks in jungle environments

### Ohblex (Gem Gnomes)

The Ohblex are crystalline gnomes born from the gems and jewels deep within the Gemstone Peaks. Their skin reflects the colors of precious stones, and they sustain themselves by consuming a few gems each year rather than traditional food. Masters of clockwork and the sole keepers of clockmaking secrets on Alaria, they craft incredible mechanical devices and jewelry.

The Ohblex live in elaborate underground mazes filled with mechanical traps, endlessly scheming against rival family houses in complex political games. They value secrecy, mystery, and complication above all else.

#### Aspects

- Schemes within schemes
- Crystalline precision

#### Living Component

**Passive ability.**

You consume gems worth 10 ducats per month instead of food. Your unique metabolism grants you the following benefits:

- When you consume a gem, you instantly know if it has magical properties, its component level, and all its tags (per the magical crafting rules)
- You count as a portable level 1 alchemy laboratory for the purposes of refining gems and neutral components only
- When crafting items that require neutral components, you may regurgitate consumed gems as components of up to level 2 (this takes 1 day per component)

### Techgnomes (Lost Gnome)

The Techgnomes were once the most technologically advanced gnomes on Alaria, creators of incredible mechanical wonders including the mighty mechwurm. However, their greatest creation turned against them, and their civilization was virtually destroyed. Now essentially extinct, the few remaining Techgnomes wander as living relics of a lost age.

These surviving gnomes carry with them fragments of forgotten knowledge and broken mechanical devices, serving as both a warning about unchecked ambition and a repository of lost technological secrets.

#### Aspects

- Last of a lost age
- Technology's double edge

#### Mechanical Remnant

**Passive ability.**
You begin play with a damaged but functional mechanical device of your choice (subject to GM approval). You have A2 on all checks for juryrigging, operating, and fixing technological devices.

### Qipi (Sinkhole Gnome)

The Qipi are the smallest of all gnome heritages, dwelling in the vast sinkhole cities of Tyberoskos. Generations of underground living have transformed these gnomes—their wrinkled green skin helps them blend with the mossy cavern walls, while their oversized eyes pierce through the perpetual twilight of their subterranean homes. Sharp, needle-like teeth have evolved to efficiently strip meat from the blind cave fish that populate their underground pools. Despite their somewhat fearsome appearance, the Qipi have developed a sophisticated culture centered around acoustic communication and echolocation, using complex clicking languages that echo through their vertical cities. They've mastered the art of fishing in complete darkness and have developed unique architectural techniques for building into sinkhole walls.

#### Aspects

- Vigilant
- Patient as stone

#### Eyes of the Deep

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Observant talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 30 feet and can see normally in dim light.

### Whiteling (Prophet Gnome)

The Whitelings are perhaps the most mysterious and tragic of all gnome heritages. Their alabaster skin stretches taut over gaunt frames, giving them an ethereal, almost translucent appearance. These gnomes are blessed—or cursed—with the ability to perceive the threads of fate itself, their minds constantly awash with visions of possible futures. This gift comes at a terrible price: their bodies are frail as parchment, and their reproductive cycles occur perhaps once in a century. When Whitelings do mate, it is through elaborate rituals that can last days, treated with the solemnity of a religious sacrament. The resulting children, so rare and precious, are raised not by their parents but by specialized caretakers known as the Tuk-tuk—elderly Whitelings who have mastered the art of nurturing young prophets without overwhelming their developing minds.

Their extreme rarity and prophetic abilities make Whitelings objects of obsession throughout the world. Some cultures worship them as living oracles, building temples around solitary Whitelings and interpreting their every utterance. Others see them as tools to be captured and exploited, keeping them in gilded cages to divine military strategies or market trends. A free Whiteling is always in danger, for their very existence is both a blessing and a commodity. Most learn to speak in riddles and half-truths, not from duplicity but from self-preservation—for a prophecy too clearly spoken is a prophecy that invites intervention.

#### Aspects

- Fragile as glass
- Burdened by knowledge

#### Oracle's Burden

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Oracle talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. However, your connection to the threads of fate has left your body withered: your maximum hit points start at 25 instead of 40, and increasing your maximum hit points costs 1 additional XP (stacking with the gnomish penalty for 2 total). Additionally, your might die can never be increased above a d6.

## Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all raised together, with no knowledge of their specific mother. The brood-father, over the course of his lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen, who will mother the next brood-father—the first born son.

Most goblins live in communities around a single goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and friends are one's half-siblings. This can lead to bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict. Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

### Cooperative

**Passive ability.**
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or take the help action in combat, you provide two levels of advantage rather than one, and they may add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin, they gain three levels of advantage instead.

### Scalawag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature. They are viewed more as pests than as people by many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat similar to that of ants. However; living among Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are born into enormous broods, and are expected to defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will spend most of their lives doing just that, along with anything else they feel like doing. Besides the general wellbeing of the community, though, scalawags have few other obligations, and will sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.

Scalawag can be found across the mountains and scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are known for their incredible performers, parties, and oddly enough, philosophers.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally turbulent
- Impulsive and improvisational

#### Ankle biter

**Passive ability.**
Rules for moving through and climbing on creatures larger than yourself apply even if the creature is only one size larger than you. You have advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same space as a hostile creatures provides one level of cover from attacks from all other creatures.

### Etherweaver

Etherweavers get their name for their longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every goblin is born with an attunement to one of those elements.

Etherweavers are generally more reserved and cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value preparation, and are usually more conscientious, even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at protecting their broods using magic, and therefore require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a greater sense of individuality among the etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.

The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.

#### Aspects

- Level-headed
- Reflective and thoughtful

#### Etherweaver

**Passive ability.**
Choose and gain two attunements from the following list:

- Time
- Void
- Force
- Light
- Dark

### Coghead

The Cogheads are ingenious goblins who have embraced the marriage of flesh and machinery. Living within a massive hollowed-out machine in Kobuk, they have spent generations perfecting the art of mechanical augmentation, replacing or enhancing their natural body parts with intricate contraptions and gear-driven devices.

These goblins harbor a particular hatred for the Echean gnomes, viewing them as inferior tinkerers who lack the courage to truly commit to their craft. Where gnomes merely build external devices, Cogheads integrate machinery directly into their bodies, becoming living testaments to their engineering prowess.

#### Aspects

- Flesh is weakness, gears are strength
- Gnomes are inferior tinkerers

#### Tinkerer

**Passive ability.**
Through tinkering and contraption building, you have found a way to improve on your body's natural features. Choose one of the following modifications:

- **Spectacles:** Multi-lens glasses with infrared vision (90 feet), light inversion, and telescopic capabilities (10x magnification).
- **Rocket Boots:** Aether-powered boots that increase move speed by 10 feet and allow jumping 10 feet with 50-foot glide speed.
- **Multi-tool:** Replaced arm containing circular saw, knives, pliers, wrenches, torch, and lock picks. Grants advantage on tool-related skill checks.

You may spend 4 XP to gain additional modifications from this list.

### Darkling

The Darklings are pitch-black goblins who dwell in the shadowy realm of Lethos, their skin so dark it seems to absorb light itself. These unsettling creatures have adapted to perpetual darkness, subsisting on a diet of rodents and bats while developing an unnatural mastery over shadow itself.

Unlike other goblins, Darklings are genuinely frightening, their darkness attunement creating impenetrable shadows that only they can see through. They move like living nightmares through their underground lairs, and those who encounter them in the dark rarely live to tell the tale.

#### Aspects

- Child of eternal darkness
- Predator in the shadows

#### Umbral Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to darkness. Darkness you create cannot be seen through by any creature except other Darklings, and cannot be dispelled except by magical light. You have darkvision out to 120 feet and can see perfectly in any darkness, magical or natural.

### Rudding

The Ruddings are small, mysterious goblins with beady red eyes who inhabit the otherworldly copper and brick temples of the Copper Hills. These enigmatic creatures are driven by an unrelenting sense of justice and vengeance, carefully tracking every slight and wrong committed against them or their kin.

Despite their vengeful nature, Ruddings are remarkably skilled Deoric enchanters who have domesticated the massive Desert Mammoths. They will pursue slow, methodical revenge against wrongdoers unless proper reparations are offered in the form of copper or copper jewelry, which they prize above all else.

#### Aspects

- Vengeance delayed is vengeance perfected
- Copper is the currency of justice

#### Blood Debt

**Passive ability.**
When a creature deals damage to you or you perceive them as having wronged you, you may mark them for vengeance as an action. You always know the general direction and distance to marked creatures within 10 miles. You have advantage on all attack rolls and skill checks made against marked creatures.

### Blitzling

The Blitzlings possess the strange and dangerous property of accumulating massive amounts of static electricity in their bodies before discharging it all at once in devastating electrical bursts. These energetic goblins inhabit the chain of hills south of the Dunes of Kunagi, in the settlement of Shyalaviin.

Their unique physiology makes them both fascinating and hazardous to be around, as they constantly crackle with barely contained electrical energy. When threatened or excited, they can release this stored power in spectacular and deadly displays.

#### Aspects

- Living lightning rod
- Electricity courses through me

#### Static Discharge

**Passive ability.**
You accumulate static charge throughout combat. At the start of each round, gain 1 charge point (maximum 5). As an action, you may discharge all stored charge, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per charge point to all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures wearing metal armor take double damage. You take half the total damage dealt.

### Mudzwiti

The Mudzwiti are tribal goblins who dwell in the dense Lyoki Ingi Ingi jungle, their bodies adorned with elaborate bone piercings and ritualistic scarification. These fierce warriors have formed a symbiotic relationship with the utahraptors that roam their jungle home, riding them into battle while wearing the skulls of fallen dinosaurs as helmets.

Their culture revolves around death and legacy, constructing incredibly elaborate tombs for their deceased leaders, complete with buried servants and accumulated riches. Their kings consume rare jungle plants that extend their lifespans dramatically, allowing them to accumulate vast wealth over centuries.

#### Aspects

- Dinosaur rider of the deep jungle
- Death builds the greatest monuments

#### Raptor Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have formed a bond with a utahraptor companion. The raptor has the stats of a riding horse but with a climb speed of 20 feet and the ability to make claw attacks (1d8 damage). If your raptor dies, you may spend a week in the jungle to bond with a new one. You have advantage on all checks related to dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures.

### Spine Goblin

The Spine Goblins are perhaps the most disturbing of all goblin subraces, afflicted with a leprosy-like disease that causes their bones to pierce through their skin. Their spinal columns protrude grotesquely from their backs, and rather than hide this deformity, they have embraced it by binding nails, spikes, and other sharp implements to their exposed bones.

These crude and malevolent creatures represent the darkest aspects of goblin nature, using their horrifying appearance and weaponized deformities to terrorize their enemies. They are among the most feared and reviled of all goblins, and for good reason.

#### Aspects

- My deformity is my weapon
- Pain has made me stronger

#### Bone Spikes

**Passive ability.**
Your exposed bones are fitted with sharp metal implements. Whenever a creature grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack, they take 1d4 piercing damage. You may use your bone spikes as ultralight piercing weapons. When you take damage, you may spend 1 rush point to cause the attacker to take 1d6 piercing damage if they are within 5 feet.

### Wydling

Wydlings, also known as icelings, are the frost-touched cousins of the goblin family tree. Born in the frozen wastes and glacial caverns of the far north, these pale blue goblins have adapted to survive in the harshest cold. Unlike their more communal relatives, Wydling broods are smaller and more nomadic, following the seasonal migrations of their prey across the tundra. Their razor-sharp icicle teeth have evolved to strip frozen meat from bones and crack through ice to reach fish below.

Wydling society values patience and cunning over the impulsiveness of their southern kin. They are master hunters and trackers, capable of waiting motionless in snowdrifts for hours before striking. Their long noses serve a practical purpose—warming frigid air before it reaches their lungs and detecting the faintest scents carried on arctic winds. While other goblins might gather in hundreds, Wydlings move in small hunting packs of extended family, each member knowing their role in the hunt.

Those Wydlings who venture south often find work as guides through mountain passes, ice sculptors, or surprisingly effective fishmongers—their natural affinity for cold keeping goods fresh far longer than normal.

#### Aspects

- Patient predator
- Cold pragmatism over warm emotions

#### Frostbite

**Passive ability.**  
Your icy heritage grants you several adaptations. You are immune to the effects of freezing temperatures and take half damage from cold-based attacks. Your razor-sharp teeth count as ultralight piercing melee weapons. Additionally, when you deal damage with your bite, the bitten creature gains 2 level of slowed as numbing cold spreads from your icy fangs.

## Grayls

The Grayls are among the most melancholic beings on Alaria, wooden humanoids whose backward-bent knees and perpetual sadness mark them as fundamentally different from other races. Born from ancient trees through a process that even they don't fully understand, Grayls emerge fully grown from specially prepared sacred groves, their consciousness arising from the accumulated experiences of the forest itself.

Their gray, bark-like skin and wooden flesh contain properties that make them valuable to magic item crafters, leading to a history of hunting and exploitation that has only deepened their sorrow. They find the sounds of civilization—especially human voices—physically painful, causing them to retreat ever deeper into remote forests. The Grayls move and think at a pace that matches the trees they come from, taking days to make decisions that others make in moments.

Many Grayls have found refuge in the Walking Forest, where they can move with their home as it travels, never having to abandon the trees they've come to know over decades or centuries of patient observation.

### Aspects

- The fast world brings only pain
- Patience measured in seasons, not moments

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 200-300 pounds

### Wooden Flesh

**Passive ability.**
Your body is made of living wood. You have +2 natural armor and take half damage from piercing weapons. Fire damage against you is doubled. You need only water and sunlight to survive—1 hour of direct sunlight counts as a meal. Wood harvested from your body (dealing 1d6 damage to you) functions as a level 2 magical crafting component with the "neutral" tag.

## Gyv

The Gyv are the puppet masters of Iylovia, a race whose very presence makes others question their own thoughts. With their distinctive silver hair and grayish skin, these tall, lithe beings move through society like whispers of smoke. Born from the mingling of Zaelian elf and human bloodlines, they inherited something far more dangerous than either parent race possessed—the ability to subtly influence minds.

In Gyv society, direct confrontation is considered both crude and foolish. Why argue when you can make someone believe your position was their idea all along? This has created a culture of extreme paranoia where every conversation is a chess match and trust is a luxury none can afford. Even among themselves, the Gyv deal in shadows and schemes, using intermediaries and elaborate protocols to avoid direct mental manipulation.

### Aspects

- Master manipulator
- Inherently untrustworthy

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 ft
- **Weight:** 120-180 lbs
- **Max Age:** 200

### Silver Tongue

**Major ability.**

When you speak to someone for at least one minute, you may implant a subtle suggestion in their mind. Make a presence check contested by their cunning challenge number. On a success, they gain one permanent level of charmed toward you unless you act hostiley towards them.

### Master of Masks

**Passive ability.**

You have advantage on deception checks and can perfectly mimic any accent or speech pattern you've heard for at least 10 minutes. Additionally, choose either intimidation or persuasion when you create your character—you have advantage on all skill checks with the chosen skill.

## Halfling

Halflings possess an uncanny ability to thrive where others merely survive. Their small stature grants them a unique perspective on the world—quite literally seeing it from a different angle than the tall folk. This has given them an almost supernatural knack for finding hidden advantages in any situation, turning disadvantages into opportunities with an ease that larger races find deeply unsettling. Each halfling culture has taken this adaptability to extremes, creating societies that flourish in conditions that would break other peoples.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3.5-4.5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-90 pounds

### Underfoot Advantage

**Passive ability.**
Your unique perspective reveals opportunities others miss. Whenever you fail a skill check, you may immediately identify an alternative approach—the GM must tell you a different skill or method that could achieve a similar result with an equal or lower challenge number, or tell you there are no other methods.

### Belenstrope

The Belenstrope halflings of Erasnus have transformed commerce into high art. Their noble merchant houses don't just trade goods—they trade in influence, information, and favors with a complexity that makes even seasoned diplomats dizzy. Every Belenstrope maintains a mental ledger of who owes what to whom, tracking social debts across generations with the same precision their competitors use for gold. Their olive skin bears subtle tattoos in expensive inks that mark major trade victories, and their fingers are always stained with the particular blue-black ink used for contracts in Erasnus. They dress in calculated opulence, each silk thread and jeweled button precisely chosen to convey their exact level of wealth—never so much as to invite robbery, never so little as to seem unworthy of serious negotiation.

In Belenstrope society, a merchant's route defines their identity more than their family name. Young halflings spend years as apprentice traders before earning the right to establish their own routes, and the most successful can trace their commercial lineages back through centuries of carefully maintained ledgers. Their wedding ceremonies involve the literal joining of trade routes, with couples exchanging not rings but sealed contracts establishing their combined commercial territory. They view the world as an endless series of arbitrage opportunities, and their greatest cultural heroes are those who turned worthless goods into fortunes through clever routing and timing.

#### Aspects

- My family's routes are written in my blood
- There's always a better deal three towns over

#### Merchant's Bloodline

**Passive ability.**
Your merchant heritage grants you an instinctive understanding of trade. You gain the following benefits:

- You start with merchant contacts in three settlements within 100 miles of your starting location. When you visit these settlements for the first time, you automatically know one buyer or seller there (GM determines which good they trade and their level)
- When searching for buyers or sellers, you need only half a day instead of a full day
- When meeting a buyer or seller, you may roll the trader level die twice and take the higher result
- You have advantage on all presence checks when negotiating prices or establishing trade agreements
- Once per settlement, you may ask the GM: "What good here would be most profitable to buy/sell?" The GM must answer with one good that has at least moderate surplus or demand

### Fieri

Deep beneath Hell Creek in Chimea, the Fieri have built a civilization from spite and molten stone. Their underground cities glow with the light of exposed magma flows, which they channel through obsidian aqueducts to heat their homes and power their forges. Every Fieri child learns to read the mood of lava like surface dwellers read weather—knowing when a flow is "angry" enough to surge, when it's "sleeping" and safe to cross, when it's "hungry" and likely to find new paths. Their priests teach that they weren't cursed to live here but chosen, selected by the fires below to become something harder and more enduring than the soft surface folk who abandoned them. They've developed a complex sign language using the glow patterns of heated metal, allowing them to communicate across the roaring noise of their volcanic home.

The Fieri measure wealth not in gold but in thermal territories—regions where the heat is stable enough to be harvested but intense enough to be valuable. Their architecture defies surface logic, with buildings that would be ovens to others serving as comfortable homes, and what surface folk would consider forges functioning as their hospitals and nurseries. They've domesticated creatures that no surface dweller could imagine as livestock: salamanders the size of cattle that feed on sulfur, blind cave fish that swim in near-boiling pools, beetles with shells that must be cracked with hammers. When they must venture to the surface for raids, they carry their hatred like a furnace in their chest, knowing that every moment under the cold stars is a moment stolen from their true home.

#### Aspects

- My fury burns hotter than any forge
- The surface world deserves only ash

#### Hatred's Forge

**Passive ability.**
Your burning resentment literally ignites your surroundings. Whenever you take damage from an enemy, the air around you heats up—the next attack you make causes your weapon to glow white-hot, applying one level of burning to any creature you hit until the end of the round. This heat builds: each time you're damaged in a round (max 3), the weapon deals an additional level of burning. Additionally, you're immune to the burning condition.

### Dengar

In the Phirexes swamps, the Dengar halflings have transformed necessity into expertise. Where others see fetid water and toxic plants, they see raw materials for their bubbling cauldrons. Their still-houses rise on stilts above the bog, filled with bottles of liquids in colors that shouldn't exist in nature. Every Dengar child learns to identify useful fungi by taste and can tell good moss from bad by how it stains their fingers. Their coming-of-age ceremonies involve brewing their first batch of "swamp spirits"—a violently alcoholic concoction that doubles as paint stripper, wound cleanser, and breakfast drink.

The Dengar's optimism stems from a cultural philosophy they call "the worse it gets, the better it was"—the idea that surviving something awful makes everything else seem wonderful by comparison. They throw festivals to celebrate disasters avoided, making special brews to commemorate "that time the bog almost ate the village" or "when the poison fog only killed half the chickens." Their master brewers wear leather aprons stained with so many toxic substances that the garments themselves become dangerous to touch, and they consider this a mark of expertise. They've developed such a nuanced understanding of swamp alchemy that they can extract useful components from materials others wouldn't dare touch, turning the hostile swamp into their personal laboratory.

#### Aspects

- The swamp provides everything, if you know how to ask
- There's always something useful in the muck

#### Swamp Harvester

**Passive ability.**

Your deep understanding of swamp alchemy grants you the following benefits:

When harvesting components from any swamp creature or plant, you harvest components one level higher than normal (maximum level 5). Additionally, you can find alchemical value in any swamp material—even mundane swamp plants and creatures provide level 1 components with the "neutral" tag when harvested.

You can incorporate swamp materials to enhance any alchemy lab. By spending a day gathering materials in a swamp, you improve an alchemy lab by one level for your use only (maximum level 5). This enhancement lasts until you leave the area.

Your tolerance for toxic work environments is legendary. You succeed automatically on all checks to harvest components (no risk of damaging materials), and you have advantage on all alchemy crafting checks.

### Wispen

The silver-skinned Wispen halflings are living repositories of forgotten memories, their nomadic lifestyle driven by an unusual curse—or gift, depending on perspective. When a Wispen touches an object with their bare skin, they absorb faint echoes of its history, experiencing ghostly sensations of past events. A sword might whisper of its battles, a coin might carry the anxieties of its previous owners, a doorknob might remember every hand that turned it. This constant flood of psychic impressions has made them a deeply peculiar people who wear gloves obsessively and avoid touching anything unnecessarily. Their caravans are immediately recognizable by the elaborate silk wrappings covering every surface, protecting the Wispen from unwanted visions while traveling.

The Wispen have learned to weaponize their burden, becoming the greatest trackers and investigators in Grendenheim. They can follow trails years old by touching trees and stones, solve murders by handling the victim's possessions, and find lost treasures by reading the memories in old maps. Their culture revolves around managing the flow of information—they've developed meditation techniques to process traumatic visions, ritual cleansings to purge unwanted memories, and methods for storing important impressions in specially prepared crystals. Young Wispen undergo a harrowing coming-of-age ritual where they must touch an ancient memory stone containing their clan's entire history, experiencing generations of life in a few overwhelming moments. Those who emerge sane are considered true adults; those who don't wander the roads muttering about centuries they never lived.

#### Aspects

- Every object screams its history at me
- I know where you've been by what you've touched

#### Psychometric Echo

**Passive ability.**
Your touch reveals the hidden history of objects. By spending a minute in skin contact with an item, you experience its most emotionally significant moment from the last year. For particularly important objects, you might see further back (GM's discretion). You can also track anyone who has touched an object in the last 24 hours—you know their general direction and distance (within a mile).

### Shailin

The yellow-eyed Shailin of Sestros live in a constant state of anticipatory readiness, their entire culture shaped around prophecies that always seem just about to come true. Their daemon whispers different things to each of them—fragments of possible futures, warnings about paths not taken, promises of glory that require just one more sacrifice. They build their cities with empty throne rooms for kings not yet born, maintain armies for wars not yet declared, and teach their children skills for professions that don't yet exist. Every Shailin carries a small journal where they record their personal prophecies, creating vast libraries of contradictory futures that their scholars desperately try to reconcile. The most respected members of society are those whose prophecies have almost come true—the "Nearly Blessed" who were so close to their destiny that they could taste it.

The Shailin have developed elaborate rituals around decision-making, using their daemon whispers like a twisted magic 8-ball. Before any major choice, they perform "future readings" where they listen to the whispers while considering each option, trusting that Talresses will guide them correctly. That this frequently leads to disaster doesn't shake their faith—clearly, the disaster was necessary for the greater destiny still to come. Their architecture reflects this temporal confusion, with buildings constructed for purposes that might become clear someday, doors that open onto walls (for now), and staircases that lead nowhere (yet). They age strangely, sometimes looking decades older or younger than their actual years, as if their bodies can't quite agree on when they're supposed to be.

#### Aspects

- My time will come, as was foretold
- Every failure brings me closer to destiny

#### Daemon Whispers

**Major ability.**
Talresses whispers secrets to you. Once per day, you may ask a yes or no question about the immediate future (next 10 minutes) and receive a truthful answer. You may use this ability additional times each day, taking a level of mental vulnerability each additional time you do so. Vulnerability resets after a long rest.

### Windorf

The Windorf halflings have discovered something profound about fortune: it flows like ocean currents, and those who understand its patterns can ride its waves. Their seafaring culture is built on reading these invisible tides of probability, using complex charts that track not wind and water but likelihood and chance. Their navigators don't just plot courses through physical space but through possibility space, finding routes where favorable winds are most probable, where pirates are least likely, where the chance of profit runs highest. They've developed a elaborate system of knots and rope work that serves as both practical sailing knowledge and a form of probability mathematics—each knot representing a different statistical outcome, complex problems solved by weaving rope patterns that would make other cultures' heads spin.

The Windorf have ritualized their relationship with fortune through their peculiar gambling traditions. They don't gamble for money but for luck itself, playing elaborate games where the stakes are probability points that can be saved and spent on future endeavors. A Windorf captain might bet their good weather luck against another's safe passage fortune, trading probabilities like currency. Their priests are called "Odds Makers," and they maintain great temples that are part casino, part lighthouse, part mathematical academy. These structures serve as neutral ground where luck can be formally exchanged, calculated, and even stored in special dice carved from whalebone. Their children play with loaded dice to learn how probability feels when it's tilted, developing an intuitive sense for when fortune is flowing their way or when the odds have turned against them.

#### Aspects

- I can feel when the odds are about to turn
- Fortune favors those who understand her patterns

#### Fortune's Current

**Passive ability.**
You've learned to sense and manipulate probability streams. At the start of each day, roll 3d6 and keep them—these are your "fortune dice." Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet makes any roll, you may replace one die in their roll with one of your fortune dice (before or after seeing the result). Once used, that fortune die is spent. Additionally, you always know the exact odds of success for any game of chance, and can sense when someone is cheating at gambling. When you roll maximum on a fortune die, immediately roll another fortune die to add to your pool.

### Whiteling

When a halfling dies with unfinished business or in a state of extreme emotional turmoil, they sometimes rise as a Whiteling—a corpse vampire that haunts their former communities. These undead halflings retain their memories but lose all empathy, becoming predators that hunt those they once loved. The transformation is tied to something deep in halfling biology and culture, though scholars debate whether it's Fortune's final curse or simply the price of their legendary luck. Whitelings appear as pale, desiccated versions of their living selves, with pupilless white eyes and voices that carry an unsettling echo. They often maintain grotesque parodies of their former lives—undead merchants who trade in suffering, skeletal parents who prepare meals of ash and bone for children who fled years ago.

The most disturbing aspect of Whitelings is their perfect memory combined with absent emotion. They can recite every birthday, every shared meal, every whispered secret with those they now hunt, all while describing how they plan to drain their former loved ones dry. They're drawn to halfling communities but can never enter uninvited, leading to horrible sieges where they call out to their living relatives in familiar voices, using shared memories as weapons. Some communities have developed "Whiteling watches," where families take turns guarding against their own returned dead. The condition is not contagious—Whitelings seem incapable of creating more of their kind, leading some to theorize that each represents a unique failure of the halfling spirit, a soul so corrupted by undeath that it cannot even share its curse.

#### Aspects

- I remember loving you, but feel nothing now
- The hunger is all that remains

#### Undead Fortune

**Passive ability.**
You are undead. You don't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. You are immune to poison and disease. Healing magic harms you (take damage instead of healing), but you can spend hit dice to heal during a short rest by consuming flesh. You have disadvantage on all social rolls with living creatures who know what you are. Fortune works differently for you—when you use Underfoot Advantage, instead of finding alternative approaches, you identify the most harmful possible interpretation of any situation. You may force this dark reading onto others: once per day when a creature within 30 feet succeeds at a roll, you may have them fail instead as their fortune abandons them.

## Hookling

In the frozen wastes of Morelous, the Hookling halflings have transformed survival into a mathematical science. Their culture revolves around "The Count"—an obsessive tracking of every resource, every calorie, every breath of warm air. Children learn to calculate metabolic rates before they learn to read, wearing intricate bead-chains that serve as portable abacuses, constantly clicking through calculations of resource expenditure versus expected return. They've developed seventeen different words for types of hunger and twenty-three for varieties of cold, each representing specific caloric deficits or heat loss rates.

Most remarkably, Hooklings have evolved conscious control over their metabolic processes, able to shift between two distinct biological states. In times of scarcity, they enter "Conservation Mode," slowing their bodies to an almost hibernative state to preserve precious resources. When resources are plentiful, they can switch to "Expenditure Mode"—burning through calories at an accelerated rate to achieve peak performance. This metabolic flexibility has allowed them to thrive where others merely survive, turning the harsh arithmetic of survival into an art form.

#### Aspects

- **Winter's arithmetic guides my every step**
- **My flesh obeys the ancient equations**

#### Metabolic Modes

**Passive ability.**

You have mastered the ability to consciously regulate your metabolism between two distinct states. Before taking a long rest, you may declare which mode you will wake up in. Switching between modes represents a significant biological shift that takes a full rest cycle to complete.

**Conservation Mode:** Your body operates at maximum efficiency.

- You need only 1 food ration per week (instead of 7)
- You do not need to sleep, though you do not heal hitpoints
- Your heart die is treated as one size smaller (minimum d4)
- You have disadvantage on all might and agility checks
- Your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet

**Expenditure Mode:** Your body burns hot and fast for peak performance.

- You need 3 food rations per day (instead of 1)
- You must sleep at least 14 hours per long rest
- Add +1 to all skill checks
- Your movement speed increases by 10 feet
- Remove two ranks instead of one when you succeed on your sleep check

## Human

Humans are resilient and abundant. They are far the most prolific across Alaria, and have the greatest breadth of culture. Contributing to their success as a species is their perseverance; just when you think you've knocked one down for good, they're back up for more.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Human Resilience and Diversity

**Passive ability.**
When you gain this ability, choose one talent. You gain this talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have).

In addition, whenever you take a wound, you gain a rush point at the start of the next round.

### Drachma

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous, and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and following ones instincts. They are usually the first one you notice when walking into a room—both for their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities. It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.

Drachma are generally found in western regions of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their hearty Drachman ale.

#### Aspects

- Style is everything
- I follow my instincts

#### Instinctive

**Passive ability.**
When you get a complication on a skill check and choose to re-roll, add 3 to the new result.

### Tikhaya

Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are comfortable spending time alone and in contemplation. There is a sort of strength that emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with their physiology—but instead from their self-certainty and outlook on the ways of the world. Even Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about them that is hardly met by even adults of other cultures.

Tikhaya can be found across central and northern Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are known for their incredible philosophers, mathematicians, and martial warriors.

#### Aspects

- I know right from wrong
- Wise in the ways of the world

#### Clear Mind

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to being confused, frightened, enraged, or charmed. Additionally, you have A2 when making skill checks or saving throws to see through deception.

### Neth

Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It is easy to misinterpret a Neth's silence at a joke as boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while never breaking a smile.

Neth are best known for their ability to speak with the wind, allowing them to communicate with the deceased members of their communities to gather advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For this reason, maintaining good relation with one's family, and community are critical to Neth culture, an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they meet who become close.

Neth can be found across the North Reach, along the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers, and resilient warriors.

#### Aspects

- Inscrutable
- If you look after nature, nature will look after you

#### Speak with the Wind

**Major ability.**
While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day, while not in combat, you may reach out to your ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- **Questions and Answers:** You may ask them up to three questions. They answer to the best of their ability. Although they only know what they knew during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans nearly a millennium.
- **Guidance:** Define a specific type of task or activity. Once, before the end of the day, before making a roll for that task or activity, you may declare that you are using your ancestors' guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die with the maximum result of that die.

This entire ritual takes 1 minute.

### Oznak

Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and place a high emphasis on proving one's self-worth and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a young age, children are taught with sticks how to wield a sword, even if they will never be able to afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in Oznak-dominated settlements also include different types of competitions involving sword play, and proper tournaments are common in some regions.

While excelling with the blade garners the most respect, those who don't become the best are pressured to succeed and dominate in another field. This mentality results in a culture of highly competitive people. Because they value skill so highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into a duel with an Oznak.

Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria, though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in the world, and are known for their technical craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying swordsmen.

#### Aspects

- I am no coward
- Fiercely competitive

#### Technical Master

**Passive ability.**
Choose a weapon or tool. If it is a weapon, you have advantage while wielding it. If it is a tool, you have A2 on all checks requiring the use of this tool.

### Vyanoweir

The Vyanoweir were once a mighty culture of community-oriented Deoric casters who wielded words of power to shape reality itself. Their mastery over the language of truth was unparalleled, allowing them to speak changes into existence with collective rituals that could reshape landscapes and bend the fundamental laws of nature.

Now their great cities lie in ruins, their libraries burned, and their people scattered to the winds. Only a handful of individuals with Vyanoweir blood remain, carrying within them the fading echoes of their ancestors' incredible power. These survivors often don't even know their true heritage until moments of great need awaken the dormant magic in their blood.

Among the scattered remnants are the Jae-Kai, nomadic spirit wranglers who have adapted their ancestral magic to herd spirits across the Plains of Oblivion. They make yearly pilgrimages to Estornum Agnostus to pay homage to the desolate ruins of their lost civilization.

#### Aspects

- The last echo of a great civilization
- Words have power beyond comprehension

#### Ancient Bloodline

Work with your GM. This culture is nearly gone.

### Husakas

The Husakas are nomadic scorpion riders who traverse the endless dunes in search of the precious red dust that gives their culture its power and purpose. This crimson powder, harvested from rare desert blooms that grow only where ancient magic has seeped into the sand, is both blessing and curse to the Husakas people.

From childhood, the Husakas consume small amounts of the red dust daily, allowing it to flow through their veins and awaken mystical abilities. The dust is highly addictive, and those who go without it for too long suffer terrible withdrawal that can drive them to madness. This dependency shapes their entire way of life, as they must constantly migrate across the desert following the seasonal blooms and maintaining their sacred harvest.

The Husakas form close bonds with giant scorpions that serve as both mounts and companions, capable of navigating the treacherous desert terrain and defending against the many dangers that lurk beneath the sands.

#### Aspects

- The red dust flows through my veins
- Always moving, never settling

#### Dust Dependency

**Passive ability.**
You carry a small pouch of red dust that you must consume daily. The dust has been running through your veins since childhood, awakening mystical powers within you. Choose any handmagic talent - you gain it as a racial ability (it does not count towards your total number of talents).

However, you are dependent on the dust. If you go more than a week without consuming it, you gain one level of all mental conditions (confused, frightened, enraged, charmed) that do not fade until you consume the dust again. Your dust supply must be replenished yearly through trade or pilgrimage to the sacred harvesting grounds.

### The Guiltless

The Guiltless are the tragic creation of the great wizard Thenry Gilmora, who sought to create the perfect servants of good by magically removing their capacity for evil. Born unable to lie, steal, harm others, or act with malicious intent, they were intended to be living saints who would guide the world toward righteousness.

Instead, they became victims. Their absolute honesty and inability to defend themselves made them easy targets for exploitation and abuse. Over thousands of years of mistreatment, however, the Guiltless have developed subtle methods of resistance and revenge that work within the constraints of their nature.

The Guiltless have interbred with humans across the world and can appear as any other human. The trait often skips generations, sometimes manifesting unexpectedly in someone's lineage - which can be catastrophic for those unprepared for its implications.

#### Aspects

- Incapable of malice or deception
- The meek shall inherit through persistence

#### Blessed Curse

**Passive ability.**
You are magically incapable of lying, stealing, or intentionally harming others. You automatically fail any attempt to deceive, pickpocket, or make attack rolls against sentient creatures. However, this absolute goodness grants you protection - you have advantage on all saving throws against hostile magic, and creatures attempting to harm you take disadvantage on their attack rolls as the universe itself seems to conspire to protect the innocent.

Additionally, your complete honesty allows you to speak uncomfortable truths that others cannot. Once per day, you may ask any creature a direct question, and they are compelled to answer truthfully if they understand you.

### Qord'ik

The Qord'ik are a proud people of the Free Isles, distinguished by their dark brown skin, exceptional height, and powerfully built frames that speak to the giant blood many believe flows through their veins. Standing head and shoulders above most other humans, they are natural sailors whose massive frames allow them to handle the rigging and cargo of the great ships that ply the southern seas.

Equally skilled as traders and fighters, the Qord'ik have built a reputation for fair dealing backed by the implicit threat of their formidable physical presence. Their island homes have made them master navigators, and their trading vessels are welcomed in ports across Alaria - though few would dare to cheat a Qord'ik merchant.

The harsh life of the islands and the constant struggle against fierce storms and sea monsters has bred a people of incredible resilience, both in body and spirit.

#### Aspects

- Giants' blood runs in my veins
- The sea is in my bones

#### Strong Bones

**Passive ability.**
Your giant heritage has blessed you with incredibly dense bones and resilient flesh. Increase the damage threshold for taking wounds by 2 - where others would take a wound from 10 or more damage, you require 12 or more damage to suffer a wound.

Additionally, your imposing size grants you advantage on intimidation checks against creatures smaller than you, and you count as one size larger for the purposes of carrying capacity.

### Shontobi

The Shontobi are the noble samurai of the great plains, a people who have built their entire culture around concepts of honor, inheritance, and family duty. In their society, one's position is determined not just by skill with a blade, but by the honor of one's ancestors and the careful maintenance of family obligations that stretch back generations.

The nobility ride magnificent griffons into battle, their great wings casting shadows across the grasslands, while other honorable warriors mount swift horses bred for speed and endurance across the endless plains. Sacred eagles, revered as divine messengers, serve as hunting companions and symbols of prestige - to harm another's eagle is among the gravest of insults.

Marriages among the Shontobi are strategic affairs, carefully arranged to strengthen family alliances and preserve bloodlines. To go against one's family is the ultimate disgrace, leading to exile from the clan and the loss of one's name. They are cunning tacticians who plan their battles with the same care they use to plan their dynasties.

#### Aspects

- Honor above all else
- My family's name must not be shamed

**Choose One:**

#### Eagle Companion

**Passive ability.**
You have an eagle companion that has grown up alongside you since childhood. You gain the Beast Companion talent targeting this eagle as a racial ability (it does not count towards your total number of talents). Your eagle is particularly intelligent and can deliver simple messages over long distances.

#### Honor Bound

**Passive ability.**
Any aspects related to honor, duty, or pursuing honorable goals are empowered by your unwavering commitment. Such aspects grant twice as much DP when invoked for penalties and provide double the bonus when used for advantages. Additionally, upgrading honor-related aspects costs 1 less XP, as your dedication makes such growth natural.

### Tarnak

The Tarnak are a nomadic people of the deep desert whose mastery of blood magic and communion with death has made them feared across the sands of Ulkevolm. Dark-skinned and adorned with precious jewelry that catches the desert light, they paint their faces and bodies with intricate patterns using their own blood mixed with sacred inks, creating a tapestry of red and black that tells the story of their lineage and magical accomplishments.

These desert shamans form deep bonds with great desert tigers that prowl alongside their caravans, hunting by night and resting in the shade of their tents by day. The Tarnak practice blood magic not for power over others, but to commune with the spirits of the dead and divine the movements of fate through the patterns of life and death in the desert.

Their rituals and appearance make them deeply unsettling to outsiders, but the Tarnak see beauty in death as much as life, understanding it as part of the natural cycle that governs all existence.

#### Aspects

- Blood tells all stories
- Death is just another kind of life

#### Blood Sight

**Major ability.**
Through ancient blood magic rituals, you can divine truth from the patterns of life and death. Once per day, by examining a small amount of blood (your own or willingly given), you can learn one piece of information about the creature it came from: their current emotional state, whether they have told any lies in the past day, if they are suffering from any diseases or curses, or the general direction and distance to their current location.

### Nuun

The Nuun are a desert people blessed with striking golden or ice-blue eyes that reflect their deep attunement to the primal elements of fire and water. Dark-skinned and dark-haired, they have built magnificent cities in the desert realm of Kura, where their mastery of trade has brought wealth and their appreciation for beauty has created architectural wonders that rival any in the known world.

Education and proper upbringing are cornerstones of Nuun society. Every child is taught not only practical skills but also philosophy, art, and the appreciation of beauty in all its forms. Their cities are filled with fountains, gardens, and structures that seem to defy the harsh desert environment through the careful application of elemental magic.

As competent traders, the Nuun have established trading routes that stretch across continents, their caravans protected by their elemental magic and their reputation for fair dealing. They believe that beauty and knowledge are the highest achievements of civilization.

#### Aspects

- Beauty in all things must be preserved
- Knowledge is the greatest treasure

#### Elemental Heritage

**Passive ability.**
Choose fire or water - you have a basic elemental attunement to that element as a racial ability (this does not count towards talents gained). Your eyes glow faintly with elemental energy when you use this attunement, growing brighter during more powerful applications.

Additionally, your appreciation for beauty and culture grants you advantage on presence checks when dealing with matters of art, architecture, trade negotiations, or academic discussions.

### Temptari

The Temptari are a deeply spiritual people who have mastered the art of reading the subtle currents of time and weather. Through generations of religious devotion and seasonal rituals, they have developed an uncanny ability to sense what is about to unfold. Their monasteries dot the mountainous regions where the seasons change most dramatically, and their timemasters are sought after as advisors by rulers across Alaria. A Temptari never seems rushed or surprised—they move through life as if they've already lived it once before.

Temptari settlements can be found in the high mountain passes and valleys where the seasons are most pronounced. They are renowned for their prophets, weather-readers, and the legendary timemasters who can glimpse moments yet to come.

#### Aspects

- Time flows differently for me
- The seasons speak to those who listen

#### Temporal Awareness

**Passive ability.**
You cannot be surprised. Additionally, once per round, when you or an ally within 30 feet would roll a 1 on any die, you may warn them of the impending complication. They may choose to not take that action instead, avoiding both the roll and its consequences entirely.

### Kuru

The Kuru are perhaps the most unusual of human cultures, having discovered an ancient ritual that allows them to bond with the spirits of beasts. By pressing the skull of a slain animal to their forehead and speaking the words of binding, they fuse with the creature's essence, gaining its strength at the cost of human speech. The transformation is reversible but few choose to return—the call of the wild becomes part of their very soul. Kuru warriors are feared across the southern lands, as one never knows if the approaching figure is merely human or something far more dangerous.

The Kuru inhabit the Killing Hills and Avakus Forest south of Kyagos, where the barrier between human and beast grows thin. They are known for their beast warriors, primal shamans, and the haunting skull masks they wear before transformation.

#### Aspects

- The beast and I are one
- Words are cages—the wild speaks in actions

#### Skull Fusion

**Major ability.**
As an action, you may press the skull of a beast to your forehead, fusing with its spirit. Choose a beast form with your GM's approval (as per the Beastform talent). You transform into this creature, gaining its physical stats while maintaining your mental abilities. While transformed:

- You cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components
- You gain the beast's natural weapons, movement modes, and senses
- You can understand speech but cannot respond verbally
- The transformation lasts until you take a long rest or spend an action to end it

Unlike the Beastform talent, you may stay in this form indefinitely, but each long rest while transformed requires a might save (CN 10) or gain one level of mental vulnerability as the beast's instincts grow stronger.

### Shapers

The Shapers are perhaps the most distrusted of all human bloodlines, marked by their distinctive silver eyes that remain constant no matter what form they take. Gifted with the ability to perfectly mimic the physical appearance of any humanoid they have seen, they are living shapeshifters whose talents have unfortunately made them valuable for infiltration, espionage, and other unsavory professions.

Their abilities are not illusion but true physical transformation, allowing them to perfectly replicate height, build, facial features, and even voice. However, their silver eyes always remain, serving as the only reliable way to identify a Shaper. This limitation has led to widespread fear and suspicion of anyone with silver eyes, even among those who are not Shapers.

Many Shapers struggle with questions of identity, as the ease with which they can become someone else sometimes makes it difficult to remember who they truly are. Some embrace their gift as freedom from the constraints of a single form, while others see it as a curse that forever separates them from genuine human connection.

#### Aspects

- Am I who I appear to be?
- Trust is a luxury I cannot afford

#### Perfect Mimicry

**Major ability.**
You can perfectly transform your physical appearance to match any humanoid you have seen, changing height, build, facial features, skin tone, and even voice. This transformation is not an illusion but a true physical change that can fool even magical detection. However, your distinctive silver eyes never change, always remaining as the one identifying feature that cannot be hidden.

The transformation takes one minute and lasts until you choose to change again or revert to your true form. You retain all your abilities and statistics while transformed, but gain no special knowledge or memories of the person you're mimicking.

## Kendor

The Kendor are an ancient aquatic people whose grace and beauty are matched only by their mastery of courtly intrigue. Evolved from seahorses in the warm tropical seas, they have developed into bipedal beings who can thrive both in water and on land, though they vastly prefer their hidden underwater palaces. Their elongated, elegant forms move with hypnotic fluidity, and their iridescent scales shift color with their moods and intentions.

Kendor society revolves around elaborate courtship rituals, political maneuvering, and the cultivation of beauty in all its forms. Violence is considered the ultimate vulgarity—a last resort for those who lack the wit and charm to achieve their goals through more civilized means. Their hidden fortress-cities are marvels of coral architecture and bioluminescent gardens, accessible only to those who know the secret currents and can navigate the maze-like approaches.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7.5 feet (including decorative fin crests)
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds
- **Swim Speed:** 60 feet
- **Land Speed:** 30 feet (base, before modifiers)

### Aquatic Grace

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe both air and water. While underwater, you have advantage on all agility checks and defense rolls. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet while both you and the target are underwater. On land, you must immerse yourself in water for at least 10 minutes during each long rest or gain a level of weakened that doesn't fade until you do so.

### Kendrel (Court Kendor)

The Kendrel embody the highest ideals of Kendor society—masters of etiquette, romance, and social manipulation. Their scales shimmer with pearl-like iridescence, and they decorate themselves with cultivated coral jewelry and woven kelp garments of impossible intricacy. Every movement is a calculated dance, every word chosen for maximum impact.

In their hidden palace-fortresses beneath tropical reefs, the Kendrel engage in elaborate games of courtship and politics that can span decades. They view violence as beneath them, preferring to destroy enemies through social exile, romantic humiliation, or financial ruin. Many Kendrel who venture to the surface world become diplomats, matchmakers, or advisors to powerful nobles who value their supernatural understanding of social dynamics.

#### Aspects

- Master of courtly intrigue
- Violence is beneath me

#### Mesmerizing Presence

**Heart ability.**
Your beauty and grace can stop conflicts before they begin. When combat would begin, you may use this ability before initiative is rolled. Each creature makes cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. Each creature that fails becomes unable to take hostile actions against you for the next minute unless you or your allies attack them first. Affected creatures may still defend themselves if attacked. This ability has no effect on creatures that are already in combat or have been in combat with you within the last hour.

### Cendoriln (Abyss Kendor)

Where the Kendrel embrace light and beauty, the Cendoriln have adapted to the crushing darkness of deep ocean trenches. Their scales are darker—deep purples, blacks, and midnight blues—with bioluminescent patterns they can control at will. The "nasty" reputation they've earned comes from their willingness to do what other Kendor won't: engage in violence when necessary, though they still prefer manipulation and fear to direct confrontation.

The Cendoriln's hidden fortresses lie in underwater caves and thermal vents, places where even other aquatic races fear to venture. They are master secret-keepers and blackmailers, trading in information that could topple kingdoms. Their courtship rituals involve elaborate displays of bioluminescence and tests of mental fortitude rather than the Kendrel's focus on beauty and charm.

#### Aspects

- Secrets are currency
- I thrive where others fear to swim

#### Abyssal Intimidation

**Passive ability.**
You can control your bioluminescent patterns to unnerve and disorient. You have advantage on intimidation checks, and when you successfully intimidate a creature, they also gain one level of dazed. Additionally, in darkness or dim light, you can shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 10-feet beyond as a free action.

### Pelaendor (Wanderer Kendor)

Some Kendor have abandoned the hidden fortresses entirely, becoming nomadic wanderers who travel the ocean currents and occasionally venture onto land. The Pelaendor have adapted to life between worlds, their scales taking on sandy, mottled patterns that help them blend into various environments. They serve as the primary ambassadors between Kendor society and the surface world.

Unlike their fortress-dwelling kin, the Pelaendor have learned that sometimes violence, while regrettable, is necessary for survival. They maintain the Kendor appreciation for beauty and social grace but temper it with practicality. Many become traders, messengers, or guides, using their ability to navigate both underwater and terrestrial societies.

#### Aspects

- Comfortable in any current
- Bridge between worlds

#### Adaptive Camouflage

**Major ability.**
Your scales can shift color and pattern to match your surroundings, and you can blend into crowds or natural environments with ease. As an action, you can become nearly invisible automatically succeeding on a check to hide and become obscured, even in bright light. If you move or attack, you lose this effect and are visible once more.

## Koren

The Koren are a feline people with the grace and power of great cats. Their society is sharply divided between the regal Kor and their wilder Korel cousins, each embodying different aspects of their predatory heritage.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4.5-5.5 feet
- **Weight:** 80-160 pounds

### Natural Predator

**Passive ability.**
Your heritage as hunters runs deep. You have darkvision out to 30 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to track creatures by scent, and you always land on your feet - you take half damage from falls and cannot be knocked prone by falling.

### Kor (Highborn)

The Kor are the ruling class of Koren society, bound by an intricate web of social customs and obligations. To be Kor is to master oneself completely - emotions are private battles never to burden others with. Their society values composure, precision, and adherence to tradition above all else. Breaking social custom means exile, a fate worse than death for most Kor.

Every gesture, word, and glance carries meaning in Kor society. They communicate as much through what is left unsaid as through speech itself, reading volumes in the angle of an ear or the position of a tail. This rigid structure has allowed them to build sophisticated civilizations and maintain order for centuries.

#### Aspects

- Social customs must never be broken
- My feelings are my own burden to bear

#### Claws of Courtesy

**Passive ability.**
Your claws and jaws count as light, melee weapons (slashing and piercing respectively). When you use them while in the agility stance, add 1d4 to your attack rolls.

Additionally, your lifetime of navigating complex social hierarchies grants you one of the following benefits (choose when you select this heritage):

- **Perfect Composure:** You are immune to the shaken condition and have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
- **Social Predator:** When you spend at least 10 minutes observing someone in a social setting, you learn their current attitude toward you and one secret they're trying to hide.

### Korel (Wildborn)

The Korel are what the Kor fear to become - Koren who embrace their feral nature. Whether descended from exiles, born outside Kor society, or simply those who rejected its constraints, the Korel live by instinct rather than etiquette. Where the Kor suppress their predatory nature, the Korel revel in it.

They form loose packs and hunting bands, valuing cunning and strength over propriety. Many work as scouts, thieves, or mercenaries, finding freedom in professions the Kor consider beneath them. Yet despite their reputation as savages, the Korel have their own codes - loyalty to the pack, the thrill of the hunt, and survival above all else.

#### Aspects

- The pack survives together
- I trust my instincts

#### Savage Grace

**Heart ability.**
You can unleash your feral nature in combat. When you do, your claws count as light melee weapons that deal slashing damage. For the next minute:

- Your move speed increases by 20 feet
- You can move through enemy spaces as if they were difficult terrain
- When you deal damage with your claws, the target takes 2 levels of weakened

Additionally, you gain the Nimble talent as a racial ability (it does not count toward the number of talents you have).

## Krell

The Krell are an ancient insectoid race whose very existence revolves around their massive colonial structure and absolute devotion to their queen. These chitinous beings live in enormous underground or mountain-carved hives that can house thousands of individuals, all working in perfect harmony toward the colony's goals. Every few centuries, when the current queen lays princess eggs, the colony prepares for the violent succession that will determine their future.

The princesses are raised in luxury for fifty years before engaging in ritual combat to the death. The survivor becomes the new queen, selects a mate, and leads a great migration called a "swarming" to establish a new colony elsewhere. During these swarmings, the Krell become a force of nature, destroying everything in their path as they claim new territory for their queen.

Individual Krell communicate through complex patterns of pheromones, antenna movements, and rhythmic footsteps that outsiders find impossible to decipher. While they possess vocal cords, they rarely use them, preferring their natural forms of communication. A single Krell poses little threat, but when the hive mobilizes, entire settlements vanish without a trace.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds

### Aspects

- Hive-minded
- Colony before self

### Hive Network

**Passive ability.**
You can communicate telepathically with other Krell within 1 mile through pheromone resonance. When within 30 feet of another Krell, you both gain advantage on attack rolls and cannot be surprised. You automatically know the general emotional state and basic intentions of any Krell within range.

### Swarm Tactics

**Heart ability.**
When you make an attack roll while adjacent to at least one ally, you may activate this ability to gain advantage on the attack and add an additional 1d4 to it for each ally adjacent to you (maximum +3d4). If this attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you and all adjacent allies may immediately move up to your speed toward another enemy without provoking opportunity attacks.

## Lizardfolk

The Lizardfolk are an ancient people who walked Alaria long before the rise of the younger races. Their societies evolved in isolation, developing along four distinct paths shaped by the harsh environments they call home. While outsiders often dismiss them as primitive savages, the Lizardfolk possess complex social structures and deep cultural traditions passed down through countless generations.

All Lizardfolk share certain traits: they are cold-blooded, requiring external heat to maintain their energy; they possess scales that provide natural protection; and they view the world through the lens of predator and prey—a perspective that makes them seem alien and cruel to warm-blooded races. Yet this same perspective has allowed them to survive and thrive in some of Alaria's most inhospitable regions.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-7 feet (varies by subrace)
- **Weight:** 120-250 pounds

### Cold-Blooded Metabolism

**Passive ability.**

Your reptilian nature grants you unique advantages and disadvantages. While in warm temperatures (comfortable or hotter), you gain +10 feet to your movement speed and remove one additional level of fading conditions at the start of each round. While in cold temperatures (chilly or colder), your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet and you gain a level of slowed that does not fade until you warm up.

### Ix'Tyrann

The Ix'Tyrann are the most numerous and widespread of the Lizardfolk, dwelling in the swampy regions of Da Trang. Their society is built on strength and brutality, with villages ruled by the strongest chieftains who maintain power through displays of savage might. They are viewed by most civilized races as the embodiment of lizardfolk savagery—a reputation they've earned through centuries of fierce territorial conflicts.

Ix'Tyrann culture values survival above all else. Weakness is not tolerated, and those who cannot contribute to the tribe's strength are cast out or consumed. This harsh philosophy has produced a people who are incredibly resilient but struggle to form alliances with other races. Even those Ix'Tyrann who become adventurers and fight for noble causes are rarely seen as heroes—their methods are simply too brutal for polite society to accept.

Their scales range from muddy brown to dark green, providing natural camouflage in their swampy homes. Battle scars are worn with pride, each one a testament to survival.

#### Vitals

- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds

#### Aspects

- Views everything as predator or prey
- Values strength above mercy

#### Savage Ferocity

**Passive ability.**

Your brutal fighting style makes you deadlier but also more vulnerable. Whenever you deal damage with an attack, add 2 to the damage dealt. However, whenever you take damage from any source, increase that damage by 2. Additionally, when you would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you may instead choose to reduce them to 1 hit point and inflict one of the following permanent conditions: blinded, deafened, or reduce their movement speed by half.

### Ix'Vasyla

The black-scaled Ix'Vasyla are the assassins and hunters of the Lizardfolk, evolved in the toxic marshlands of Nashua. Sleeker and taller than their Ix'Tyrann cousins, they possess a deadly elegance that belies their lethal nature. Their most feared trait is their venomous bite—even a small nip delivers toxins that cause days of excruciating pain before finally killing the victim.

Trapped in an endless war against the forces of Trømgar and Gorath, the Ix'Vasyla have refined patience into an art form. They strike from shadows, deliver their poisonous bite, then retreat to let their venom do its work. Their society values cunning over raw strength, and their leaders are chosen for their ability to outmaneuver enemies rather than overpower them.

Their distinctive black scales shimmer with an oily iridescence, and their jaws can unhinge like those of serpents, allowing them to swallow prey whole. This has given rise to terrifying tales among their enemies of entire scouts disappearing without a trace.

#### Vitals

- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds

#### Aspects

- Patient and calculating
- Takes pleasure in the hunt

#### Venomous Bite

**Heart ability.**

Your bite delivers a potent neurotoxin that causes excruciating pain. Your teeth count as an ultralight, piercing melee weapon. If you bite and deal damage, the target takes normal damage plus 1 level of poisoned that lasts until they take a long rest. These levels of poisoned do not stack. A creature can only be affected by one instance of your venom at a time.

### Ix'Lorett

In the temperate forests of M'Svyla, the Ix'Lorett have evolved along a vastly different path from their warlike cousins. These iguana-like Lizardfolk move with deliberate slowness, their wrinkled scales and soft spines giving them an almost ancient appearance. Yet what they lack in speed and aggression, they make up for in wisdom and an incredible regenerative ability.

Ix'Lorett society centers around art, meditation, and the pursuit of inner peace. Their villages in the Crystal Mountains are adorned with intricate gemstone mosaics and painted murals that tell the stories of their people. They are philosophers and artists, spending decades perfecting a single painting or meditating on the nature of existence.

Their regenerative abilities are legendary—lost limbs regrow over months, wounds that would kill other races merely inconvenience them. This has led to a unique perspective on violence and conflict; when you can regrow from almost any injury, the urgency of combat fades. Many Ix'Lorett who become adventurers do so not for glory or wealth, but to see the world's beauty and understand its deeper meanings.

#### Vitals

- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

#### Aspects

- Contemplative and peaceful
- Values beauty and patience

#### Regenerative Vitality

**Passive ability.**

Your body possesses remarkable regenerative properties. After your first short rest each day, reduce the rank of all wounds by 1. During a long rest, reduce the ranks of all your wounds by an additional 2 (3 total). Additionally, if you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows over the course of 2d6 months.

### Ix'Meglyakuk

Deep in the Dygon Beastlands, where colossal dinosaurs rule ancient jungles, the Ix'Meglyakuk have forged an alliance that sets them apart from all other peoples. Through generations of careful bonding and mutual respect, they have domesticated the fierce utahraptors—predators that most would flee from in terror.

These Lizardfolk and their raptor companions move as one through the dangerous jungles, the riders' keen intellect combining with their mounts' predatory instincts to create an unmatched partnership. Young Ix'Meglyakuk are paired with raptor hatchlings in sacred ceremonies, growing up together until the boundary between rider and mount becomes almost indistinguishable.

Their scales have evolved to match the mottled patterns of their raptors, and they've developed a unique throat structure that allows them to communicate through subsonic clicks and trills that only their mounts can hear. Even when separated from their bonded raptor, an Ix'Meglyakuk moves with the fluid grace learned from a lifetime of riding, making them formidable on foot as well.

#### Vitals

- **Height:** 5.0-6.0 feet
- **Weight:** 100-160 pounds

#### Aspects

- Bonded for life with their raptor
- Thinks in terms of pack tactics

#### Raptor Rider

**Passive ability.**

You begin with a bonded utahraptor mount that has been your companion since youth. Your raptor uses the following stats: Move speed 80 feet, 30 HP, d8 heart die, d8 might/d8 agility/d4 cunning/d2 presence. It can make claw attacks as light slashing weapons. Your raptor can carry you and 20 slots of equipment without movement penalties.

You share an instinctive bond with your mount—it obeys your commands without requiring actions.

If your raptor dies, you can bond with a new utahraptor during a week-long ritual in a jungle environment, though the loss of your first mount leaves you with a permanent level of shaken that cannot be removed.

## Lyzine

The Lyzine are fallen nobility whose pride remains unbroken despite their exile to the depths below. With the graceful torsos of elegant humanoids seamlessly joined to the powerful, chitinous bodies of giant spiders, they embody both beauty and horror. Once rulers of great surface kingdoms, they were banished to the underground realms of Mez after their arrogance and cruelty became too much for even their subjects to bear.

Every year, the Lyzine attempt to reclaim their "rightful" place on the surface, sending expeditions to establish new footholds in the world above. They view themselves as inherently superior beings temporarily displaced by the jealousy and ignorance of lesser races. Their underground cities are marvels of web-architecture and dark elegance, maintained by strict hierarchies that mirror their lost surface kingdoms.

Despite their exile, the Lyzine have retained their sophisticated culture, complete with elaborate courts, intricate political maneuvering, and a refined aesthetic sense. They are skilled in both diplomacy and warfare, though their overwhelming pride often makes peaceful coexistence difficult.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Aspects

- Exiled nobility
- Inherently superior

### Arachnid Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed and can move across webs and similar surfaces without penalty. You can produce silk strong enough to support your weight, creating 50 feet of rope as an action. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to intimidate or impress others with displays of nobility or superiority.

### Web Weaver

**Heart ability. Full action.**
You can rapidly spin webs to control the battlefield. Choose a 20-foot square area within 30 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and creatures that enter or start their turn in the webbed area must make an agility saving throw against your cunning challenge number or become restrained. Creatures can break free with a successful might check against the same CN. The webs last for 10 minutes or until destroyed.

## Minotaur

Minotaur are mighty, formidable creatures, known for their powerful builds and no-nonsense nature. Although most grow up in minotaur-dominated communities, they have spread out across Alaria, and can be found in great numbers in many large armies.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7.5 feet
- **Weight:** 200-350 pounds

### Minotaur Horns

**Passive ability.**
The horns on your head count as a heavy piercing melee weapon so long as you move at least 15 feet in a straight-line towards an enemy before immediately attacking. You get one level of advantage on your attacks made with your horns for every 15 feet you charged before you attack. This stacks up three times.

### Danaki

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as the baby minotaur children are raised by the village. Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they interested in finding out. From a young age, they are taught to fight and kill, usually long before they learn how to read and write.

Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk state of anger and pure, single-minded aggression. During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring many injuries.

Danaki are trained from a young age to express very little emotion, and suppress it if possible. Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not felt those things since they were a child. Marriages in Danaki villages are arranged by the village council once each member in the union has been deemed "stable". Most Danaki view their marriage as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing that you have completed your growth. The marriages are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.

Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to one another, they admit it only in confidence, and believe themselves capable of making decisions completely unaffected by that attachment.

#### Aspects

- Show no weakness
- Obstinately bullheaded

#### Berserk

**Major ability. Instant.**
It is said that the Danaki rage is the physical release of all the pent up emotions held within them. Whether this is true is up to you.

Whenever you take damage, you may enter a berserk state. While berserk, your movement speed increases by 20, and increase every instance of incoming and outgoing physical damage by 2. You remain berserk so long as you make an A/D roll or enter an engagement each round, up to a minute.

### Lorean Minotaur

While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the commanding general for a king's army. In describing the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most famously quoted that "Lorean think with their head, not with their horns". Of course, if you ask their spouses, they will say that they "think with their head, not with their hearts". This is the cursed blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded, but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems in any other way.

Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on education and sound decision making. To make a mistake because emotions clouded one's judgement is worthy of profound shame. It's not that Lorean don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them influence one's decision at all is weakness and failure, especially when other people's wellbeing is at stake.

This sense of duty towards protection lies as deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been placed in charge of his troop will die before letting his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the ultimate failure as a minotaur—worthy of self-exile. Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to such high standards, including other minotaur, every Lorean would never give such leniency to themselves.

#### Aspects

- Profoundly caring
- Emotions get in the way of logical thinking

#### Tactical Supremacy

**Passive ability.**
You may take an additional help action each round. When you take the help action, you may instead choose a willing creature within 30 feet and move it 5 feet in any direction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

Based on the existing minotaur subraces and the provided overview, here's the Rentar subrace:

### Rentar

The Rentar of Chechol represent a stark contrast to their more warlike cousins. Where Danaki suppress emotion and Lorean prioritize logic, the Rentar have found peace through spiritual devotion. Their reddish-tinged skin and elegant, curved horns reflect their more contemplative nature, as they spend their days in meditation, prayer, and scholarly pursuits of divine knowledge.

Rentar society is built around a complex theological framework that emphasizes personal spiritual growth, communal harmony, and the pursuit of divine wisdom. They believe deeply in the guidance of higher powers, interpreting signs and receiving what they consider divine inspiration through dreams and meditation. This spiritual confidence gives them an unshakeable sense of purpose and fierce pride in their autonomy—they would be deeply offended by any suggestion that their choices are not entirely their own.

What the Rentar do not realize is that their "divine guidance" has been corrupted. The lich Gynor the Conqueror has spent decades subtly influencing their spiritual practices, weaving his will into their religious experiences. Through careful manipulation of their dreams and visions, he has positioned himself to transform their peaceful community into his Red Army when the time is right. The Rentar's very strength—their unwavering faith and spiritual certainty—has become the mechanism of their enslavement, though they remain blissfully unaware of this dark truth.

#### Aspects

- My faith guides every decision
- Fiercely proud of my independence

#### Divine Communion

**Major ability.**
Through deep meditation and prayer, you commune with what you believe are divine forces for guidance in difficult situations. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes in spiritual communion to ask a single yes-or-no question about a course of action you are considering. The GM must answer truthfully, though the source of this "divine" knowledge may not be what you believe it to be.

Additionally, whenever you would make a saving throw against being charmed, confused, or frightened, you may choose to automatically succeed, drawing strength from your spiritual conviction.

Looking at the elf format and the orc information provided, here's the base orc race and all subraces:

## Mnurvlyon

The Mnurvlyon are walking contradictions—beings who inherited both the giants' towering height and the dwarves' love of enclosed spaces. Standing over fifteen feet tall with the broad, stocky build of their dwarven ancestry, they are forced to carve enormous halls in their Grey Mountain homes. These gentle giants move with surprising care, having learned through painful experience that the world was not built for their scale.

Their dual heritage manifests in fascinating ways. They possess the giants' strength and the dwarves' craftiness, creating massive works of stone and metal that combine brute force with intricate detail. Yet they struggle with identity, too large for dwarven society and too fond of mountains and caves for giant clans. This has led them to form their own isolated communities high in the Grey Mountains.

### Aspects

- Massive but careful
- Caught between worlds

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large (L3)
- **Height:** 15-18 ft
- **Weight:** 2000-3000 lbs
- **Max Age:** 300

### Giant's Strength

**Passive ability.**

Your might die is one size larger than normal (start with d8 instead of d6/d4). You can wield two heavy weapons, one in each hand, or wield massive weapons that count as ultra-heavy (1d20 attack die, requires your full movement to swing, -10 feet move penalty).

### Mountain's Endurance

**Major ability.**

Your mixed heritage grants incredible resilience. For the next minute, you gain +10 to all defense rolls, you cannot be moved against your will, and you reduce all damage taken by 5. When this effect ends, you gain two levels of weakened.

## Murazi

The Murazi are an enigmatic merfolk civilization that thrives in the vast network of warm subterranean rivers crisscrossing beneath the Luquihn Desert. Where others see only endless sand and death, the Murazi navigate ancient waterways that connect oasis to hidden oasis, maintaining a thriving culture in the most unlikely of environments.

Their economy revolves around the cultivation and harvest of black pearls—lustrous treasures that grow only in the warm-water clams found in their underground rivers. These pearls are so valuable that a single one can buy a small house on the surface, making the Murazi wealthy despite their isolation. They maintain careful trade relationships with both surface dwellers at desert oases and with triton merchants along the distant Sunshine Coast.

The Murazi have adapted perfectly to their unique environment, with skin that shifts between deep blue and sandy brown depending on their surroundings, and eyes that gleam like pearls in the darkness of their river homes.

### Aspects

- The desert's secret waterways sustain us
- Black pearls open all doors

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 150-200 pounds

### Amphibious Desert Dweller

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe both air and water. You have a swim speed of 40 feet and do not suffer from the effects of extreme heat. You can survive on half the normal amount of water, as your body efficiently recycles moisture. You have darkvision to 60 feet in underwater environments.

### Pearl Diver's Fortune

**Heart ability.**
Your expertise in finding valuable pearls extends to sensing all forms of hidden treasure. You can sense the presence of valuable objects (worth 50+ ducats) within 30 feet, even through solid barriers. Once per day, when you spend at least 10 minutes searching an area, you automatically find something valuable (GM determines what, but it should be level-appropriate).

## Myushli

The Myushli are perhaps the most unsettling of the civilized races—mushroom folk whose genuine kindness masks a terrifying biological imperative. Standing roughly human height, their bodies are composed of spongy fungal matter topped with wide caps that serve as both head and hat. They speak in soft, melodious voices and genuinely care for visitors to their underground settlements, offering warm beds and hearty fungal stews.

Yet this hospitality hides a dark truth: the Myushli reproduce through spores that can take control of other creatures' bodies. They see nothing wrong with this process, viewing it as a beautiful transformation rather than the horrifying possession it appears to others. Their settlements are often filled with "converts"—former travelers who now serve the collective with glassy eyes and perpetual smiles.

### Aspects

- Genuinely kind
- Must spread spores

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 ft
- **Weight:** 80-120 lbs
- **Max Age:** 40

### Spore Cloud

**Heart ability.**

As an action, you release a cloud of spores in a 10-foot radius. Creatures of your choice in the area must make a might saving throw against your cunning challenge number or gain two levels of confused. If a creature fails by 5 or more, they gain two levels of charmed toward you instead.

### Fungal Regeneration

**Passive ability.**

When you take a short rest in a damp or underground environment, you regain 10 hit points. You take half damage from poison and disease but double damage from fire.

## Naga

The Naga are the descendants of Nagatayora, the mighty dragon-father who fell in battle against the titan Hykravones. When Nagatayora's burning blood fell to earth, it transformed those it touched, imbuing them with a spark of draconic power that has been passed down through generations. All Naga carry this legacy within them, though it manifests differently among their various bloodlines.

At the core of every Naga is the potential for transformation - the ability to partially assume the form of their draconic ancestor. This gift comes with both power and responsibility, as the passionate nature of dragonkind burns within their hearts. The Naga have developed rich cultures of art, philosophy, and religious tradition, all touched by their inherent pride and determination.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 120-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 160 years

### Aspects

- Iron determination
- Pride runs deeper than blood

### Draconic Awakening

**Major ability.**
You may channel the blood of Nagatayora, causing your head to transform into a draconic visage while scales emerge across your skin. This transformation lasts until you spend an action to return to your human form. While transformed, you gain:

- Your scales provide +1 to defense rolls
- You have advantage on intimidation checks
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, gain one level of enraged toward that creature (removing previous enraged levels from this ability)

### Nagakani (Scale Riders)

The Nagakani, known to outsiders as Scale Riders, have built their civilization in the harsh peaks of the Lyagnadarr Mountains. These dragon-blooded warriors have formed an unbreakable bond with the giant lizards that inhabit their mountain homes, developing a culture that blends draconic pride with mounted warfare.

At the heart of their empire lies an ancient orange dragon who has commanded them to spread their dominion across the world. The Nagakani have interpreted this decree as a holy crusade, establishing mountain fortresses and patrolling the borders of their ever-expanding territory. They see themselves as crusader knights of a draconic order, destined to bring the world under their scaled banner.

Their discovery of ancient tombs in the nearby deserts has only reinforced their belief in their divine mandate. They believe that when the time comes for the final conquest, their dragon lord will descend from the mountains to lead them personally into glorious battle.

#### Aspects

- Conquest is our divine mandate
- My mount and I fight as one

#### Lizard Rider Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have formed a mystical bond with a giant riding lizard (use riding horse statistics but with a climb speed of 20 feet and +2 natural armor). Your mount shares your initiative and can attack during the same engagement without requiring a separate action. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new lizard after spending 7 days in ritual mourning and meditation.

While transformed via Draconic Awakening, you may breathe fire as your mount's attack during an engagement, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone (once per transformation).

### Nagashi (Dragonheart)

The Nagashi represent the most common expression of draconic heritage among the Naga peoples. Found across Alaria in great numbers, they have integrated into countless societies while maintaining their distinctive pride and passion. Their scales manifest in subtle patterns across their skin - sometimes only visible in certain light - marking them as carriers of Nagatayora's legacy.

Nagashi communities are centers of art, learning, and philosophical debate. They approach every endeavor with the burning intensity of their draconic blood, whether crafting a masterpiece, engaging in scholarly pursuit, or seeking vengeance for wrongs done to their kin. This passion makes them both inspiring allies and terrifying enemies.

Their transformation is perhaps the purest expression of their heritage - a direct channeling of Nagatayora's fury that served him in his final battle. The Nagashi see this ability not as a tool but as a sacred trust, a reminder of their ancestor's sacrifice and their duty to live with the same unwavering determination.

#### Aspects

- Boiling vengeance
- Excellence demands total commitment

#### Dragon's Fury

**Passive ability.**
Your connection to Nagatayora's final rage grants you exceptional resilience and fighting spirit. You take half damage from fire. Additionally, while transformed via Draconic Awakening:

- You may breathe fire once per transformation, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone
- You gain a level of advantage on attack rolls agaisnt the source of your enragement, per level of enraged.

## Naruaghin

The Naruaghin are the fierce offspring of dwarven stoicism and draconic fury. These reptilian dwarves inhabit the hill caves and ancient temples throughout the Ishnit Jungle, their gray-green scaled skin and slit noses marking them as something between mammal and reptile. Males grow thick beards despite their scales, while females sport impressive spinal ridges instead.

Constantly warring among themselves and with neighboring tribes, the Naruaghin have developed a warrior culture that values strength and cunning in equal measure. They craft weapons from jungle materials—obsidian, bone, and ironwood—and decorate their temples with the skulls of enemies and great beasts alike.

### Aspects

### Ferocious

**Passive ability.**

When you take a wound, you immediately gain 2 rush points and may make an opportunity attack against the creature that wounded you if they are within range. This opportunity attack doesn't cost a rush point or action.

## Neferati

The Neferati are a race born when the primordial fire danced with Ez's divine essence and Gaea's song of creation. Their distinctive red skin seems to flicker with inner flame in certain lights, while curling ram horns crown their heads like marks of their elemental heritage. With dark eyes that reflect dancing flames and hair black as charcoal, they are unmistakably children of fire.

Fire is not merely an element to the Neferati—it is life itself. They gather regularly in the desert for sacred fire ceremonies, basking in the heat that others would find unbearable. These gatherings are filled with passionate fire dancing, where the boundaries between dancer and flame blur into one ecstatic expression of life. The Neferati approach everything with this same burning intensity: they love fiercely, explore fearlessly, and experiment boldly.

Most Neferati dwell within the Four Kingdoms of Fire, great nations built around eternal flames that have burned since the world's creation. These kingdoms are centers of innovation and artistic expression, where the courage to try new things is valued above the safety of tradition.

Additionally, you are immune to damage from environmental heat (but not fire damage), and your passionate nature grants you +2 to presence checks when expressing strong emotions.

## Nyolci

The Nyolci are a maritime people whose distinctive cephalopod features mark them as some of the finest sailors and navigators in the known world. With humanoid bodies crowned by octopus-like heads bearing five dexterous tentacles and a sharp beak, they might seem alien to landlubbers, yet they have integrated seamlessly into coastal societies across every major port and trading hub.

Born from the marriage of sea and civilization, the Nyolci serve as the backbone of maritime commerce and exploration. Their natural affinity for water, combined with their ability to manipulate multiple objects simultaneously with their tentacles, makes them invaluable crew members, ship captains, and harbor masters. Their keen intuition for weather patterns, ocean currents, and the subtle signs that predict storms has saved countless vessels from disaster.

Despite their aquatic origins, the Nyolci have fully embraced life among the various races of the surface world. They can be found in every major port city, often serving as intermediaries between land-based merchants and the mysteries of the deep ocean. Their communities typically cluster around harbors, docks, and shipyards, where their expertise is most valued.

The Nyolci possess an almost supernatural ability to read people and situations, making them excellent negotiators and traders. This intuitive cunning, combined with their reputation for fairness in business dealings, has earned them respect and trust throughout the maritime world.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 140-220 pounds

### Aspects

### Oceanic Intuition

**Passive ability.**
Your deep connection to the sea grants you uncanny insight into both natural and social currents. You automatically succeed on navigation checks while at sea or following coastlines. Additionally, you have advantage on skill checks to predict weather, read people's intentions, or sense when someone is lying to you. Once per day, you may ask the GM one yes-or-no question about the immediate future of a situation you're currently in.

Looking at the example race template and the descriptions provided, I'll create these 9 races following the established format and mechanics consistent with Heart Rush's design principles.

## Orc

Orcs are a diverse and hardy race known for their physical prowess, tribal cultures, and fierce independence. Found across many different environments on Alaria, orcs have adapted to thrive in conditions that would challenge most other races. Their societies are typically clan-based, with strong traditions of warfare, survival, and loyalty to their chosen family groups.

While often misunderstood by other races as purely savage, orcish cultures are rich with tradition, spiritual practices, and complex social structures. Their natural resilience and strength have allowed them to carve out territories in some of the most hostile environments on Alaria.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-7 feet
- **Weight:** 160-280 pounds

### Orcish Resilience

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on saving throws against poisons and diseases. When you take a wound, you may immediately make a might saving throw against a CN equal to the wound's rank. On a success, reduce the wound's rank by 2.

### Hedroscobbi (Black Orc)

The Hedroscobbi are master smiths who have learned to forge iron combined with corrosive algae from rivers and swamps to create incredibly heavy armor. This armor is so abrasive that only their naturally tough skin can withstand wearing it. Their mastery of this unique metallurgy makes them nearly impervious to conventional weapons.

The Hedroscobbi's dark skin has adapted over generations to resist the corrosive properties of their algae-iron alloys. They are often found in the contested swamplands, where they fight alongside and against other orc clans for territory and resources.

#### Aspects

- Master of algae-iron smithing
- Skin like leather armor

#### Corrosive Armor Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You can wear specially crafted algae-iron armor that provides +8 defense instead of the normal +6 for heavy armor, but weighs twice as much. When a creature hits you with a melee weapon while you wear this armor, their weapon takes a -1 penalty to future attack rolls (cumulative). You are immune to acid damage.

### Glivornaxi (Gray Orc)

The Glivornaxi have dark eyes and muddy green skin, living in harmony with the natural world around the Grand Tolkarsus as it passes through the Plenjorn Swamp. This mystical swamp has regenerative properties that heal those who bathe in its waters, and the Glivornaxi have become its guardians.

They are skilled spear-fighters, using their weapons primarily as defense against the Shazuihni boar riders who frequently raid their territory. Their connection to nature runs deep, and they understand the swamp's moods and secrets better than any outsider ever could.

#### Aspects

- Guardian of the healing swamp
- One with the wetlands

#### Swamp Regeneration

**Passive ability.**
While in a swamp or marshland environment, you regain 1 hit point at the start of each round. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes bathing in swamp water to reduce all wound ranks by 1. You ignore difficult terrain in swamps and marshes.

### Tarni (Darkeyes)

The Tarni are orcs strong not just in body, but in spirit. They are virtually unkillable through conventional means, as they have learned to fortify their very souls against destruction. Their warriors wield special spirit weapons that can attack the essence of their enemies directly, bypassing physical defenses entirely.

These orcs have developed a unique understanding of the connection between spirit and flesh, making them formidable opponents who can fight on multiple planes of existence simultaneously.

#### Aspects

- Unbreakable spirit
- Warrior of two realms

#### Spirit Warrior

**Passive ability.**
When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, roll your heart die. On a result of 6 or higher, you remain at 1 hit point instead. Your weapons can be enchanted to deal spirit damage that ignores armor and shield bonuses to defense.

### Uihonaii (Wooden Men)

The Uihonaii have an extraordinary bond with trees—their bloodline is literally tied to the forest. When they die, they become trees, and when the time is right, they are reborn from their wooden forms. These walking forests possess bark-like skin when in their tree form and can live for centuries, accumulating vast wisdom.

However, they can only take root and transform in special soil, requiring them to always return to their homeland. Weapons crafted from their sacred wood are incredibly powerful, often becoming sentient artifacts.

#### Aspects

- Born from sacred groves
- Wisdom of centuries

#### Tree-Soul Bond

**Major ability.**
You may spend 1 hour to transform into a tree. While in tree form, you are immobile but gain +10 defense, immunity to most damage types, and can sense everything within 100 feet. You may remain in this form indefinitely but can only transform in soil from your homeland. If you die, you may choose to become a tree permanently, allowing for potential future rebirth.

### Shazuihni (Boar Rider)

The Shazuihni are hairy, ogre-like orcs with limited intelligence but incredible ferocity. They ride massive giant boars into battle, wielding enormous axes that can cleave through multiple enemies. Their brutal simplicity makes them unpredictable and extremely dangerous in combat.

These orcs live for the thrill of battle and the bond with their boar mounts. Their society is based on strength and the ability to control their savage beasts.

#### Aspects

- Savage boar rider
- Simple but deadly

#### Boar Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have a giant boar companion with 60 hit points, d8 might and agility, and a gore attack that deals 2d8 damage. While mounted, you and your boar move as one unit, and you may use heavy weapons with one hand. If your boar dies, you may bond with a new one after 1 week.

### Griebi (Lakemen)

The Griebi are blueish-gray skinned orcs who can breathe underwater and rarely speak above the surface. They hunt and fish in the depths of lakes and rivers, using their terrifyingly long, needle-like teeth to catch prey underwater. Their society is ruled by a mysterious hag queen who dwells in the deepest waters.

These silent orcs are perfectly adapted for aquatic life, making them formidable opponents both above and below the water's surface.

#### Aspects

- Silent hunter of the depths
- Servant of the hag queen

#### Aquatic Predator

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe underwater and have a swim speed of 40 feet. Your bite is a natural weapon that deals 1d8 piercing damage. You have advantage on stealth checks while underwater and can see clearly in murky water. You suffer no penalties for fighting underwater.

### Tytheri (Blood Orc)

The Tytheri are musclebound orcs with totally white skin and razor-sharp teeth, capable of smelling blood from miles away. Within their society, Tythmasters—orcs fed a diet rich in magical blood—grow to enormous size, reaching 10 feet in height as they become the leaders of their people.

These orcs are constantly at war with the Kadroka, and their entire culture revolves around blood, combat, and the pursuit of ever-greater physical power.

#### Aspects

- Hunter who smells blood on the wind
- Devoted to the crimson path

#### Blood Scent

**Passive ability.**
You can smell blood within 1 mile and track wounded creatures with perfect accuracy. When you deal damage to a bleeding creature (one that has taken a wound), add your heart die to the damage roll. If you consume magical blood, gain +2 to all physical ability checks for 24 hours.

### Xi'ivrach (Divine Orc)

The Xi'ivrach are deeply religious orcs who live in Jeh Bli, adorning themselves with heavy stone jewelry and clothing. They must be incredibly strong to bear the weight of their sacred stone garments. Their bodies are covered in ritual scarification, and their high priests are masters of Deoric magic.

Their entire culture is built around religious devotion and the pursuit of divine favor through physical and spiritual trials.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred stone
- Marked by divine ritual

#### Stone-Bearer's Strength

**Passive ability.**
You count as one size larger for carrying capacity and can wear stone armor that provides +8 defense but reduces your speed by 20 feet. Ritual scars covering your body grant you +1 to all presence checks when interacting with religious individuals. You may learn Deoric spells regardless of other prerequisites.

### Thrygun (Wild Orc)

The Thrygun are blue-skinned, red-haired orcs with prominent tusks who dwell in the White Hills. They represent the most primal and untamed aspects of orcish nature, living in small tribes and following ancient traditions that predate most civilizations.

Their wild nature makes them unpredictable allies and dangerous enemies, as they follow instinct and tribal law above all else.

#### Aspects

- Child of the wild hills
- Untamed and free

#### Primal Instincts

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on survival checks in wilderness environments. When you roll initiative, if you roll your maximum heart die result, you may immediately move up to your speed and make one attack. You have resistance to cold damage.

### Bloodreavers

The Bloodreavers inhabit Bloodwood and practice the ancient art of blood tattooing, using blood treated with preservative tree sap to mark their skin. All their clothing, armor, and weapons are stained with blood—not from cruelty, but from deep respect, as they believe blood imbues items with the aspects of its source.

Despite their terrifying appearance, they are actually protective and loyal, though generally quiet and reserved. They are frequently misunderstood by other races who see only the blood and miss the honor beneath.

#### Aspects

- Marked by honored blood
- Silent guardian of family

#### Blood Bond Ritual

**Passive ability.**
You may spend 1 hour treating a weapon or piece of armor with blood (yours or a willing donor's) to grant it a +1 bonus to attack rolls or defense for 1 week. If you use the blood of a defeated enemy you respected, the bonus increases to +2. You have advantage on checks to track creatures whose blood you have tasted.

### Enti

The Enti are brutal slave traders from the north, constantly at war with the Danaki minotaurs. They are huge, aggressive orcs who wear furs and gold as symbols of their wealth and conquests. Their no-nonsense approach to conflict has made them both feared and wealthy through their harsh trade practices.

These orcs believe that might makes right and that the strong have every right to profit from the weakness of others.

- Northern raider

The Xi'ivrach are deeply religious orcs who have built their entire culture around devotion to their stone gods. Living in the sacred lands of Jeh Bli, they wear elaborate stone jewelry and garments as acts of worship, their bodies strengthened over generations to bear these tremendous weights. Their skin is marked with intricate ritual scarification that tells the stories of their faith and accomplishments.

Their priests are among the few mortals who have mastered fragments of Deoric, the language of truth, using it to channel divine power through their scarred flesh. The Xi'ivrach believe that the weight of stone brings them closer to their gods, and that each scar is a prayer written in flesh.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred stones
- Scarred vessel of divine truth

#### Stone Bearer's Strength

**Passive ability.**
Your body has adapted to bearing tremendous weight as an act of worship. You treat your might die as one size larger for determining encumbrance, and armor penalties to movement are reduced by 5 feet (minimum 0). When wearing stone ornaments or jewelry worth at least 100 ducats, you gain +1 to all presence checks when dealing with religious matters. If you have ritual scarification covering at least half your body, you may use your might die instead of your presence die when making religious or intimidation checks, as your devotion is written in your flesh.

## Pixie

Born from the intersection of the material plane and the realm of fae, pixies are diminutive winged beings who exist in a state of heightened emotional and magical awareness. All pixies can hear the underlying Faesong that resonates through reality—a melody imperceptible to most other creatures. This attunement to the emotional and magical currents of the world shapes every aspect of pixie society, from their fierce protectiveness of natural spaces to their complex social hierarchies built on emotional resonance rather than physical might.

Pixies reproduce through a mystical process involving moonlight, flower nectar, and concentrated emotional energy. A new pixie emerges fully formed from a bloom after a gestation of exactly one lunar cycle, inheriting not just physical traits but emotional memories from their progenitors.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Minuscule
- **Height:** 6-10 inches
- **Weight:** 1-3 pounds
- **Wingspan:** 12-18 inches

### Fae-born

**Passive ability.**
You have a fly speed of 30 feet. Additionally, you can sense the emotional state of all creatures within 15 feet, gaining advantage on Presence checks to understand their motivations. Once per day, when a creature within 30 feet makes a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you may grant them advantage on that roll by harmonizing with the Faesong.

### Zelle

The Zelle pixies of the jungle kingdom Zelidia have built a society on justified paranoia and religious fervor. Ruled by a theocratic matriarchy that views all outsiders as either threats or sacrifices to their dark forest gods, they have survived centuries of invasion attempts through a combination of ruthless cunning and blood magic. Their wings are deep crimson and black, resembling tropical butterflies but with patterns that shift to display warning colors when threatened.

Zelle society revolves around their High Priestesses, who commune directly with the jungle spirits through ritual sacrifice. Every Zelle is trained from emergence to be both predator and protector, learning to navigate their xenophobic culture while maintaining the divine wards that keep their realm hidden from larger threats.

#### Aspects

- Paranoid xenophobe
- Devoutly bloodthirsty

#### Blood offering

**Passive ability.**
When a creature within 30 feet of you takes a wound, you may perform a swift ritual as a free action to gain 1d4 temporary hit points that last until your next long rest. Additionally, you have advantage on Intimidation checks against any creature that has seen you participate in violence within the last hour.

### Ianovko

The Ianovko pixies are master illusionists who blur the line between dream and reality. They build their settlements in the spaces between—twilight groves where day meets night, misty valleys where earth meets sky, and most importantly, in the minds of those who encounter them. An Ianovko community might exist simultaneously in the material plane and in the collective unconscious of a nearby village, feeding on dreams and nightmares alike.

Their wings appear to be made of captured starlight and shadow, constantly shifting between translucent and opaque. Ianovko culture prizes clever wordplay and elaborate pranks above all else, with social standing determined by the audacity and artistry of one's illusions.

#### Aspects

- Reality is negotiable
- Riddling trickster

#### Dreamweaver

**Passive ability.**
You can cast minor illusions at will without using an action, creating visual or auditory phenomena no larger than a 1-foot cube that last for up to 1 minute. Additionally, when you successfully deceive, confuse, or misdirect a creature through roleplaying or illusion, you gain a rush point. You can gain rush points this way even outside of combat, storing up to 3 rush points that last until used or until your next long rest.

### Ikriel (Icehearts)

Icehearts are pixies transformed by their worship of winter itself—not as a season, but as an cosmic force of entropy and hunger. Their crystalline wings generate a constant aura of frost, and their very presence leeches warmth from their surroundings. This hunger extends beyond the physical; Icehearts feed on emotional warmth, leaving their victims feeling hollow and cold inside.

Despite their predatory nature, Icehearts maintain a twisted form of civilization built on careful rationing of their feeding. They view their hunger as a sacred burden, organizing elaborate rituals to determine who may feed and when, turning survival into a form of worship.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally vampiric
- Winter's devoted child

#### Frostbitten soul

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to damage from cold and the freezing environmental condition. Whenever you deal damage to a creature or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your abilities, you may inflict one level of slowed as frost spreads from your touch. Once per short rest, when you touch a willing or helpless creature, you may drain their emotional warmth to heal yourself for 2d4 hit points. The target gains one level of weakened until their next long rest as they feel emotionally drained.

### Luma

The Luma of Nykotheryx Amberylika forest represent pixie society at its most harmonious. Each Luma bonds with a grove of ancient trees upon emergence, becoming its guardian for life. Their iridescent wings capture and refract the aurora borealis, creating spectacular light shows during their ritual flights. Under the rule of Magera, the Frost Prince, they maintain the delicate balance between the ancient dragon totems and the living forest.

Luma culture emphasizes patience and cycles—they measure time in tree rings rather than years, and their oral histories stretch back to when the Dark Elves first walked among the silver birches. They alone among pixies remember the true names of some of the spirits bound within the dragon totems, treating this knowledge as their most sacred trust.

#### Aspects

- Patient as ancient trees
- Keeper of forgotten names

#### Aurora wings

**Passive ability.**
Your iridescent wings can store and release light. You can create bright light in a 20-foot radius or dim light in a 40-foot radius as a free action. Once per day, when you would take damage from a spell or magical effect, you may use your reaction to refract it through your wings, taking half damage and redirecting the other half to a creature of your choice within 30 feet (they may make appropriate saves as normal). Additionally, you have advantage on all skill checks related to ancient history, spirits, or the identification of magical phenomena.

## Revenant

Once you were dead, but now—well, you still are, kind of. Revenants are semi corporeal versions of their past, living, selves. When a creature dies and rather than leaving its physical form, chooses to remain within, it forfeits its ability to ever leave and is eternally trapped in the material world where they remain as a revenant. There are many reasons revenants may choose to stay, but the most common involve unfinished business. Whether it's getting revenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this goal is a top priority. While revenants may take detours along the way, they will always come back to their purpose for remaining in the material world.

By remaining in the material world, revenants forfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a revenant has completed whatever business kept them in this world, they generally slowly go crazy and are eventually hunted down and killed by children of Anubis or other specialized killers.

Due to revenant's near immortality, they are forced to watch as everyone they love inevitably grows old and dies, which contributes to the slow decaying of their sanity.

### Aspects

- Unfinished business
- [Choose one from your previous race]

### Vitals

You have whatever vitals you would have had before you died.

### Undead

**Passive ability.**
You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and cannot be poisoned.

You have already died, and can therefore not die again in the traditional sense. When you would normally die, you instead fall unconscious for 24 hours and are reborn where you died the first time with no memory of your life after death.

You take double damage from silvered weapons, and if you should die to a silver weapon, you are dead forever.

Also, your physical body is no longer fully alive, and it will slowly decay with passing time. Though you can generally maintain your appearance from your moment of death, your skin no longer closes up over wounds, so your body will begin to fall apart. For this reason, many revenants prefer to cover up as much of their skin as possible, and to travel unnoticed. Once you have died in a corpse three times, it is too mangled to ever return to.

### Detached Spirit

**Passive ability.**
You have a soul, shadow, and spirit—all necessary for true life, but they are no longer bound to your corporal body in the same way—instead, it is through willpower alone that you keep them attached to your physical form. This is a constant struggle, and when you waver, your form flickers as your spirit sloughs away from your skin. This, however, comes with benefits.

As an action, you may let your concentration fall, causing you to dissolve into a pool of light and shadow. While in this form, you gain the following effects:

- You can fit through any space larger than the width of a pebble.
- You cannot interact with the physical world
- You take half damage from all non-silver, non-iron sources, rounded down.
- You cannot take actions.
- You cannot speak.

Your physical body remains collapsed wherever you left it. You may return to it, or any other unoccupied corpse.

## Rhea

The Rhea possess cool, grayish-blue skin that seems to shimmer like morning mist. Completely bald with wispy gray hair that floats as if perpetually caught in a gentle breeze, their pupil-less white eyes give them an otherworldly appearance. Born from the intersection of Gaea's song, Ez's divine touch, and the elemental air itself, they are unnaturally light despite their size—a trait that defines their unique physiology.

Rhea culture values focus and dedication above all else. Where others might flit from interest to interest, a Rhea will choose a single pursuit and dedicate decades to its mastery. This incredible concentration makes them legendary scholars, martial artists, and teachers. Their calm demeanor and patient instruction have produced some of history's greatest minds, though the Rhea themselves rarely seek fame.

They primarily dwell in the mountain monasteries of Murth, where the thin air suits their ethereal nature and the isolation allows for uninterrupted contemplation.

### Aspects

- Focused mind, steady purpose
- Patience is the greatest teacher

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 30-50 pounds
- **Max Age:** 50

### Airsoul

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to air. Despite your size, you are unnaturally light. For this reason, your size is small. You take half damage from falling and can jump twice as high and far as normal.

### Rhean Concentration

**Passive ability.**
You have A2 on all checks to learn new skills. When you spend at least one hour studying or practicing without interruption, you gain +2 to any skill check related to that study made within the next 24 hours.

## Rusalka

The Rusalka are solitary predators of swamps and marshes, appearing as beautiful women who lure travelers to watery graves. These nymph-like creatures possess an uncanny ability to peer into the hearts of their prey, transforming their appearance to match the deepest desires of those they hunt. No two Rusalka look the same, as each shapes herself to be irresistible to her chosen victim.

They do not age, do not reproduce, and sustain themselves solely on human flesh. Despite their monstrous nature, Rusalka are not mindlessly cruel—they view their hunting as a natural process, no different from a spider catching flies. Some even develop a twisted fondness for certain prey, keeping them alive for weeks while slowly feeding on them.

### Aspects

- Alluring predator
- Feeds on human flesh

### Vitals

### Rusalka Magic

**Passive ability.**

As an action, you may take on the appearance of a female humanoid. In addition, you can breathe both water and air, suffer no penalties to combat in the water so long as you are not wielding a weapon, and you gain a swim speed equal to half of your move speed.

### Flesh Eater

**Passive ability.**

You may turn your hands into deadly weapons as they go from hands to claws. Your hands count as a light, melee slashing weapon. You can never starve, but you gain a level of vulnerability if you do not eat humanoid flesh for a week or more. You cannot eat normal food.

## Satyr

The Satyr are creatures of primal passion and bloody revelry who have embraced their wild nature completely. With the upper bodies of humanoids and the lower bodies of goats, they reject the constraints of civilized clothing and armor, preferring to live as nature intended. Their culture revolves around ecstatic dances performed to haunting pipe music, often culminating in frenzied celebrations drenched in the blood of their prey.

These beings feed not just on blood, but on the raw emotion and chaos of the hunt and the kill. They are most alive during their blood-soaked festivities, where one plays the pipes while others dance themselves into transcendent states of violence and joy. To outsiders, these rituals appear horrifying, but to the Satyr they represent the purest expression of life itself.

Normal clothing and armor cannot accommodate their unique physiology, forcing them to rely on their natural resilience and supernatural abilities. They view civilized society with a mixture of pity and contempt, seeing it as a denial of the wild truth that courses through all living things.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds

### Aspects

- Wild and untamed
- Bloodthirsty reveler

### Blood Frenzy

**Major ability. Instant.**
When you kill a creature, you may shower yourself in its blood to enter an uncontrollable frenzy. For the next minute, you have A2 on all attack rolls and cannot choose the defensive stance. You must attack if able, prioritizing the nearest enemy.

### Enchanting Pipes

**Major ability. Full action.**
You play haunting melodies on your magical pipes. Choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear you. That creature must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. On a failure, they are charmed by you for the next hour and compelled to dance to your music, giving them D2 on all rolls. The charm immediately ends if you attack them, and they know they were charmed when the effect ends.

## Savant

Savants, for reasons unknown, are born with rare differences in their physiology, sometimes sacrificing the ability to move, sense, or communicate effectively in exchange for excelling greatly in other ways. They can be born into nearly any race, from anyone. In some communities, savants are worshipped as supernatural beings, while in others they are shunned and treated as outcasts.

### Aspects

Choose one aspect from the following list, and one from the heritage or race from your Savant Birthright:

- Paranoid
- Emotionally cold
- Obsessed
- Vicious

### Vitals

You have the same vitals as the original creature.

### Savant Birthright

**Passive ability.**
When you choose this race, you must also choose a heritage from a different race. You are technically of that race, and gain all of the associated aspects. However, you will replace the abilities granted from the race—not the heritage—with your choice of abilities listed later in this section. For example, if you chose Uline dwarf, you would keep the Mountain-born ability, but lose the Hearty and Gruff ability.

Upon picking a heritage, choose one ability from the Physical & Mental Abilities section listed below, and gain its tier 1 ability.

Then, if you wish, you may choose and gain one of the conditions from the Physical and Mental Conditions section listed below. If you do, you gain the tier 2 ability for whichever talent you chose in the earlier step, or a different tier 1 ability.

### Physical & Mental Conditions

You may choose one passive ability from the options listed below. If you do, you may gain a second tier 1 ability, or the tier 2 ability of your initial chosen ability.

#### Blind

**Passive ability.**
You are completely blind, and therefore cannot see. You permanently have three levels of blindness.

#### Physically Disabled

**Passive ability.**
You use crutches or another device to aid your mobility. Your movement speed is reduced by 40 feet.

#### Deaf and Mute

**Passive ability.**
You are deaf and mute. You cannot understand anything more than simple ideas when people talk to you, and you cannot talk back.

### Physical & Mental Abilities

Choose an ability from this section and gain its tier 1 ability. You can gain the tier 2 ability, or choose a second tier 1 ability if you also take a condition from the Physical and Mental Conditions list above.

#### Telepath

**Passive ability.**

- **Tier 1:** You can communicate telepathically with any humanoid (or equally sentient creature) you touch. While you are touching them, they can communicate telepathically with you as well. You may also sense using their senses, during which you cannot sense through your own. Creatures are not aware that you are sensing through them.
- **Tier 2:** Your tier 1 abilities are not limited by touch, and instead extend to a range of 20 feet.

#### Tremorsense

**Passive ability.**

- **Tier 1:** By sensing vibrations in ground and air, you can sense the location and shape of anything within 20 feet of you, including through walls. This counts as being able to see that object for the sake of abilities that rely on sight. You cannot see color, and details are limited to only things larger than your fist. For example, you cannot read using this ability.
- **Tier 2:** The range of this ability extends to 60 feet.

#### Futuresight

**Passive ability.**

- **Tier 1:** You have the Sight, and can see glimpses into the future. Whenever you fall asleep or are unconscious, you have a vision. Before you wake up, you may ask the GM a question about an event in the future. The GM must give a vague answer (generally no more than a couple words), to the best of their ability.
- **Tier 2:** Your futuresight is more developed. Once, at the beginning of each day, roll three dice of any size you wish. Whenever you, the GM, or anyone else rolls a die with size matching one of the dice you rolled, you may replace the result with the result from your die roll. After doing so, you cannot use that die again.

## Sharabha

The Sharabha are the noble descendants of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father who stood alone against the titan Hykravones in the world's darkest hour. Though he fell in that legendary battle, his courage and sacrifice transformed the very earth where his heart's blood spilled. Generations later, those who settled upon that sacred ground found themselves changed, imbued with the lion father's indomitable spirit.

All Sharabha carry within them Shara Bolasi's legacy - not just his leonine strength, but his profound sense of honor, his protective instincts, and his willingness to face any odds for what is right. This inheritance manifests in their ability to partially assume their ancestor's form, but more importantly in their unshakeable moral compass and fierce loyalty to their chosen pride.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-7 feet
- **Weight:** 140-240 pounds
- **Max Age:** 120 years

### Aspects

- My honor before my life
- The pride stands together or falls together

### Lion's Heart Awakening

**Major ability.**
You channel the blood of Shara Bolasi, transforming into a lion-like form. Your head becomes that of a great lion and powerful claws extend from your hands. This transformation lasts until you spend an action to return to your normal form. While transformed:

- Your bite counts as a heavy piercing weapon, your claws as light slashing weapons
- You cannot hold weapons, shields, or manipulate fine objects
- You are immune to the frightened condition
- Your bite can be used to initiate grapples (see subrace abilities for special grappling benefits). When you first grapple the creature with your bite, and on each subsequent turn, you may inflict 1d6 piercing damage.

### Sharakari (Pride Guardians)

The Sharakari embody Shara Bolasi's role as protector and leader. These Sharabha have developed their transformation to emphasize defending their pride rather than destroying enemies. In Sharakari communities, the measure of a warrior is not how many foes they've slain, but how many allies they've saved.

Sharakari society revolves around the concept of the "Pride Circle" - concentric rings of loyalty starting with immediate family, extending to clan, community, and finally to all honorable beings. They train from childhood in formations designed to protect the vulnerable, and their transformation reflects this philosophy. A Sharakari who allows harm to come to those under their protection while they still draw breath is considered to have failed their most sacred duty.

Their settlements are built like fortresses turned inside-out, with the strongest warriors living on the perimeter and the most vulnerable at the protected center. Every Sharakari knows their place in the defensive formation and can assume it instantly when danger threatens.

#### Aspects

- Shield of the innocent
- I am strongest when others need me

#### Guardian's Grip

**Passive ability.**
Your protective instincts enhance your grappling abilities when defending others. While transformed via Lion's Heart Awakening:

- When you win an engagement by directly beating your opponent's stance, you may use your bite to grapple instead of your hands
- You have advantage on grapple checks made with your bite
- The passive damage from grappling a creature with your bite uses your might die rather than 1d6 (minimum 1d6).
- Creatures grappled by your bite have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone except you

### Sharadin (Oathspeakers)

The Sharadin have taken Shara Bolasi's final stand and transformed it into a living philosophy. They believe that words spoken with true conviction carry the same power as the lion father's roar - they can shake the earth, bind fate, and change the course of history. These Sharabha have developed elaborate oath-taking ceremonies where their transformation serves as both witness and seal to their vows.

In Sharadin society, an oath sworn in lion form is absolutely unbreakable. They believe that breaking such a vow would not just dishonor them but would retroactively dishonor Shara Bolasi's sacrifice. This has led to a culture where words are chosen with extreme care and promises are rare but absolute. Sharadin often serve as judges, arbiters, and oath-witnesses for other cultures who value their supernatural inability to break their word.

The most powerful Sharadin can even bind others with their oaths, creating mystical contracts that enforce themselves. They say that when a Sharadin speaks an oath, Shara Bolasi himself listens from beyond death to ensure it is kept.

#### Aspects

- My word is iron law
- Truth has the power to change worlds

#### Oathbound Roar

**Major ability.**
Your transformation carries the weight of Shara Bolasi's legendary defiance. While transformed via Lion's Heart Awakening, you gain the ability to unleash a terrifying roar that echoes your ancestor's final stand.

Once per transformation, you may use your action to roar. All hostile creatures within 30 feet must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number or gain a level of frightened. Creatures that fail by 5 or more are also knocked prone by the sheer force of your defiance.

## Skaag

The Skaag, commonly known as "rat people," bear the heads of rats atop humanoid bodies. Their fur ranges from brown to black to gray, with pink tails and constantly twitching whiskers. Large ears swivel independently to track sounds, while their dark, beady eyes dart nervously even in apparent safety. Despite their unsettling appearance, most Skaag dress in typical humanoid clothing, trying desperately to fit in with societies that largely reject them.

Vilified across Alaria as disease carriers and child-eaters, the Skaag suffer from a reputation that few deserve. While the infamous Rat King Glathkus the Cruel did indeed devour his offspring for power, most Skaag families are tight-knit groups who face the world's prejudice together. They've learned to be resourceful, quick, and cunning—traits necessary for survival when most of "civilized" society would rather see you dead.

The Skaag have only one true city of their own, but small communities can be found in the underbellies of major cities across the continents. Living literally underground in many cases, they've become masters of making homes in places others have abandoned or forgotten.

### Aspects

- Family survives together
- Quick fingers, quicker feet

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-100 pounds
- **Max Age:** 50

### Accustomed to Darkness

**Passive ability.**
You can see in darkness as though it was dim light to a range of 45 feet, and can see in dim light as though it was bright light.

### Eye for Treasure

**Passive ability.**
As a Skaag, you seem to have a sixth sense for finding and taking what's meant to be kept hidden. You gain the following abilities:

- If you would make a roll to avoid or mitigate the effects of a trap, you have advantage on that roll. If the trap deals damage, you take half as much damage.
- You can perfectly appraise the value of rare artifacts and valuables.
- Your whiskers tingle if treasure or traps are within 1000 feet. You don't know which, but you can roughly estimate their distance by how much your whiskers tingle.
- You have advantage on discerning the nature of magical artifacts.

## Splinkreen

The Splinkreen are the living legacy of an ancient wizard's experiment, their souls transplanted from mighty trees into humanoid forms. Their bark-like skin ranges from smooth birch white to rough oak brown, often sprouting small leaves or moss in places of rest. These woodland people move through forests with an eerie calm, showing little concern for their own mortality—perhaps because they remember being trees that stood for centuries.

They speak in slow, deliberate tones and often seem disconnected from the urgencies that drive other races. Death holds no fear for them; they view it as simply returning to the earth that birthed them. This fatalistic outlook makes them both peaceful neighbors and unnervingly willing to sacrifice themselves for causes they deem worthy of their wooden hearts.

### Aspects

- Bark-like skin
- Unconcerned with death

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-7 ft
- **Weight:** 180-280 lbs
- **Max Age:** 300

### Barkskin

**Passive ability.**

Your skin is rough bark. You have +2 to defense rolls against slashing and piercing attacks. Fire damage against you uses d8s instead of d6s.

### Rooted Soul

**Major ability.**

As an action, you may root yourself to the ground. While rooted, you cannot move or be moved by any force, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each round, and you have advantage on all might-based rolls. You may uproot yourself as an action.

## Swordsmen

The Swordsmen are an enigmatic seafaring people who share a mystical bond with swordfish and other oceanic predators. Their bronze skin bears faint scale patterns that shimmer in sunlight, and their eyes shift between human roundness and the predatory slits of sea hunters depending on their emotional state. Webbed fingers and toes mark them as children of both land and sea.

Living primarily in the treacherous Drifting Isles, the Swordsmen navigate deadly waters that would spell doom for larger vessels. Their swift outrigger canoes dance between the shifting sandbars and hidden reefs with supernatural grace, guided by their connection to the great swordfish that swim alongside them. This same connection extends to sharks, barracuda, and other hunting fish who recognize the Swordsmen as kindred spirits.

Many Swordsmen who leave their island homes become pirates, using their unparalleled knowledge of dangerous waters to evade pursuit. Their tribes often provide sanctuary to these seafaring rogues, as no naval force dares chase them into the labyrinthine Drifting Isles.

### Aspects

- The sea's hunters are my brothers
- No blade cuts water

### Vitals

- **Type:** Race
- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds
- **Max Age:** 70

### Predator's Bond

**Major ability.**
You can communicate telepathically with predatory sea creatures within 100 feet. Once per day, you can summon a school of predatory fish (or a single large predator if in appropriate waters) to aid you for 10 minutes. These creatures will scout, deliver messages, or fight alongside you but won't sacrifice themselves.

Additionally, you can hold your breath for 30 minutes and have a swim speed of 40 feet. Your sword techniques mirror the movements of swordfish—when wielding any sword, you gain +1 to attack rolls and can attack creatures up to 10 feet away as your blade seems to extend like a swordfish's bill.

## Swuigrach

The Swuigrach are large, imposing humanoids with the heads of pigs—pink, gray, or black depending on their lineage. These cunning and ambitious beings have turned what many would consider a disadvantage into a source of power, becoming some of the most successful merchants, aristocrats, and power brokers in the United Free Nations and the Free Isles.

Their porcine features—snouts, small eyes, and bristly hair—bely razor-sharp intellects focused primarily on the acquisition of wealth and power. Swuigrach culture values cunning over strength, wealth over honor, and results over methods. They see greed not as a vice but as the primary virtue that drives progress and civilization forward.

Despite their often unsavory reputations, the Swuigrach have created some of the most sophisticated financial institutions and trade networks in Alaria. Their ability to smell out profitable opportunities—both literally and figuratively—has made them indispensable to the economy of many nations, even as they are personally reviled.

### Aspects

- Greed is the engine of progress
- Every interaction is a transaction

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 150-300 pounds

### Greed

**Passive ability.**
Your insatiable desire for wealth drives your advancement. Whenever your net worth in ducats increases by a factor of 10 (from 10 to 100, 100 to 1,000, etc.), gain 2 XP. You have advantage on all skill checks related to appraising value, detecting forgeries, or negotiating prices.

### Nose for Trouble and Treasure

**Passive ability.**
Your incredible sense of smell extends beyond the physical. When evaluating any opportunity, plan, or deal, you may present your understanding of the risks and rewards to the GM. The GM must give you their honest assessment of the probability of each outcome occurring (as percentages). This supernatural business sense also grants you advantage on checks to detect lies specifically about money, trade, or business dealings.

## Sylthik

The Sylthik are a serpentine people whose scaled bodies and ophidian features mark them as children of the great snake goddess Sythikranos. These proud and merciless beings view themselves as the apex of creation, considering all other races to be inferior creatures unworthy of respect or mercy. Their society is built around a complex religious hierarchy that governs every aspect of daily life, from marriage and trade to warfare and diplomacy.

Ruled by venomous high priests who claim direct communion with their serpent deity, Sylthik settlements are often found in desert oases, ancient ruins, or deep caverns where snakes naturally congregate. Their architecture favors winding passages and circular chambers that mirror the movements of their sacred serpents. The Sylthik believe that their goddess will one day return to reclaim the world, and they see themselves as her chosen instruments to prepare for that glorious day.

Their natural ability to communicate with snakes makes them formidable opponents, as they often employ serpentine allies in their schemes. The Sylthik take great pride in their venomous nature, viewing their ability to kill with a single bite as proof of their divine superiority over the "warm-blooded vermin" that populate the world.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-7 feet (including tail length)
- **Weight:** 130-220 pounds

### Aspects

- Chosen of the serpent goddess
- Cold-blooded supremacist

### Snake Headed

**Passive ability.**
With the head of a snake, you have venomous fangs, which count as a light, piercing melee weapon. Once per day, you may inject venom with your bite, inflicting two levels of poisoned.

Additionally, your snake tongue gives you a superb ability to track down your prey. If you spend five minutes within 10 feet of someone, you always know which direction they are in when they are within 10 miles of you. If you bite them, the range extends to 100 miles instead.

### Disciple of Sythikranos

**Major ability.**
As a disciple of Sythikranos, you are granted occasional favors by your snake goddess. When you invoke the name of your patron god, choose one. You gain the ability for the next hour.

- You gain advantage on all attack rolls with your bite. Your bite afflicts an additional level of poisoned when you inject poison.
- Your snake scales harden and partially extend over the rest of your body. You have advantage on all defense rolls.
- You can communicate with snakes, and if any snakes are in the vicinity, a snake companion will join you within the next ten minutes. The snake cannot help in combat, but it can scout and observe at your command.

## Syngers

The Syngers are perhaps the most mysterious race on Alaria, immortal beings who sail through the skies in ships that defy comprehension. Their skin shifts through stunning hues of vivid red, violet, and blue, constantly changing like living auroras. These eternal wanderers travel far above where even sky ships dare to venture, in the thin air where the stars begin to show during daylight.

Rarely seen by terrestrial races, the Syngers observe the world below with the detached interest of near-gods. Their immortality has given them a perspective measured in millennia rather than years, and their concerns often seem incomprehensible to shorter-lived races. When they do descend to interact with the world below, it is usually for purposes that become clear only centuries later.

Their flying ships, known as Synger Vessels, are constructed from materials unknown to modern science and powered by principles that even the most learned sages cannot explain. These craft move silently through the high atmosphere, leaving trails of colored light that are sometimes visible from the ground on clear nights.

### Aspects

- Immortal perspective makes mortals seem like mayflies
- The high skies are our true home

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 100-150 pounds (unusually light)

### Immortal Wanderer

**Passive ability.**
You do not age and are immune to disease and poison. You need only one-tenth the normal amount of food and water, and you can survive in thin atmosphere that would suffocate others. Your long life has given you 3 additional background ranks to distribute as you choose.

### Chromatic Flux

**Heart ability.**
Your emotional state causes your skin to shift through brilliant colors, creating hypnotic patterns. As an action, you can intensify this effect, forcing all creatures within 30 feet who can see you to make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number or gain 1 level of charmed toward you. Additionally, you can create bright light in a 20-foot radius or dim light in a 40-foot radius at will by glowing.

## Triton

Tritons are the proud aquatic warriors of the deep, dwelling in magnificent underwater cities carved from coral and stone. These theistic people worship the ocean deities with fervor, viewing themselves as the chosen guardians of the seas. More warlike than their surface cousins, tritons patrol the waters with military precision, defending their territories from threats both above and below the waves.

Their society is built on martial excellence and divine devotion. Every triton learns combat from childhood, training with trident and net in elaborate underwater arenas. They view the surface world with a mixture of curiosity and disdain, believing land-dwellers to be clumsy and graceless compared to their own fluid movements in water. This pride often manifests as arrogance when dealing with other races, though their competence in aquatic combat is undeniable.

### Aspects

- Natural grace in water
- Devoted to ocean deities

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4.5-5.5 ft
- **Weight:** 100-160 lbs
- **Max Age:** 70

### Sea Dwellers

**Passive ability.**

You can breathe underwater, you have a swim speed equal to your move speed, and you suffer no penalties to combat or anything else while in or under water.

### Seasoul

**Passive ability.**

You gain basic attunement to water.

## Troenka

The Troenka are perhaps the most feared inhabitants of the great forests, beings of living wood whose greatest pleasure comes from tormenting travelers who dare enter their domain. These cruel entities appear as tall, gaunt humanoids of bark and branch, but possess the terrifying ability to assume the form of ordinary trees, becoming completely indistinguishable from the natural forest around them. Their strength is legendary, and their intelligence far greater than most give them credit for.

Unlike other woodland folk who might be protective of their forests, the Troenka simply enjoy causing suffering. They feel no need for food, water, or shelter, existing in a state of perfect self-sufficiency that has bred an overwhelming sense of superiority over all "lesser" beings. This arrogance, combined with their sadistic nature, makes them view any intruders as entertainment rather than threats.

Troenka settlements exist wherever ancient forests grow thick and dark—places like Ichneum, the Tenekee Woods, and Goranyakak. They create elaborate hunting grounds designed to trap and torment victims for extended periods, turning sections of forest into nightmarish mazes where screams echo between the trees.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 200-300 pounds

### Aspects

- Cruel tormentor
- Living wood

### Tree Form

**Major ability. Full action.**
You can transform into an ordinary-looking tree, becoming indistinguishable from natural vegetation. While in tree form, you are immobilized but gain the ability to sense all movement within 60 feet. You can remain in this form indefinitely and transform back as an action. Creatures must succeed on a CN 15 cunning check to identify you as anything other than a normal tree.

### Woodland Superiority

**Passive ability.**
While in forest terrain, your move speed increases by 20 feet and you can move through difficult terrain without penalty. You have advantage on stealth checks in natural settings and on intimidation checks against creatures you have surprised or trapped. Your natural weapons (fists, branch-like appendages) count as light weapons and deal bludgeoning damage.

## Trollkin

Half-breeds and outcasts—trollkin are the unwanted children of humans and trolls. Rare is the troll and human couple, and rarer still is the trollkin child that makes it past the first few months in the world. If not surreptitiously smothered or abandoned in a forest, most trollkin end up in orphanages, where they grow up as outsiders amongst their peers. In troll communities, they are viewed as weak and fragile, and in human communities, they are viewed as too stupid and emotionless to be effective members of society.

Unfortunately for trollkin, they are perfectly capable of understanding and figuring out many things, but are terrible at expressing it. Some trollkin abandon society to live alone in nature, becoming hermits and befriending the animals around them, who they may feel more comfortable around.

Others choose to become experts in a niche field of academics, where they do not need to interact with many people, but can still let their creative, roaming minds explore. Many of the greatest discoveries were made by trollkin, though credit may never be given to their name.

Still others turn to more violent areas of life. When faced with the constant frustration of trying to get others to understand you, some eventually consider violence. Due to their troll blood and hide, trollkin are formidable agents in combat.

### Aspects

- Thick-headed
- Contemplating what no one else is

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large
- **Height:** 7.5-8.5 feet
- **Weight:** 200-400 pounds

**Passive ability.**
At the beginning of each round, if you are conscious, regain 2 hit points, up to the maximum determined by your current heart die.

### Massive Build

**Passive ability.**
The XP cost of increasing your maximum hit points is reduced by 2. Your size is large.

## Tuktuk

The Tuktuk are a warrior culture of turtle-folk who have claimed the volcanic island of Tyvern as their ancestral home. Their thick, naturally armored shells and stocky builds make them nearly indestructible in battle, while their fierce code of honor drives them to seek glory through combat and conquest. These rugged fighters believe that strength must be proven repeatedly through trial by combat and dangerous undertakings.

Tuktuk society revolves around martial prowess and clan loyalty, with disputes settled through formal duels and leadership earned through demonstrations of courage in battle. Their island home has shaped them into excellent seafarers and raiders, though they prefer stand-up fights to sneaky tactics. Young Tuktuk must prove themselves through a series of increasingly dangerous challenges before they are accepted as full warriors.

The volcanic forges of Tyvern produce some of the finest weapons and armor in the known world, as the Tuktuk have learned to work volcanic glass and rare metals found only near active lava flows. Their settlements are built to withstand both enemy assault and the frequent volcanic activity that shapes their homeland.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 feet
- **Weight:** 180-280 pounds

### Aspects

- Honor-bound warrior
- Tyvern-forged

### Natural Armor

**Passive ability.**
Your thick shell provides +2 natural armor defense that stacks with worn armor. When you use the defensive stance, you take one-quarter damage instead of half. You can withdraw into your shell as an action, becoming incapacitated but gaining total cover and reducing all damage to 1 point until you emerge (free action on your turn).

### Battle Fury

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you take damage that would cause a wound, your warrior's rage ignites. For the rest of the combat, you gain +2 to all attack rolls and your first successful attack each round deals an additional 1d6 damage. This effect ends if you go an entire round without attacking or taking damage.

## Tythvuln

The Tythvuln are a race of vulture-headed humanoids who serve as the eternal guardians of an ancient undead giant, their entire culture built around this sacred duty. With black-feathered heads, sharp beaks, and keen eyes that can spot movement from miles away, they circle endlessly above their charge on powerful wings, watching for any who might disturb its slumber.

These carrion priests have developed a complex religious philosophy around death and undeath, viewing themselves as shepherds of the boundary between life and death. They consume only carrion, seeing it as a sacred act that prevents the unworthy dead from rising as undead. Their settlements are built into cliff faces surrounding their giant ward, with bone architecture that creates haunting whistles when the wind blows through.

The Tythvuln believe that when their giant finally awakens, it will lead them to establish a new world order where death and undeath exist in perfect balance. Until then, they maintain their vigil, generation after generation, never wavering in their duty.

### Aspects

- Death is sacred, undeath is power
- The eternal vigil defines us

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-140 pounds (hollow bones)

### Carrion Feeder

**Passive ability.**
You can safely consume carrion of any age and gain nourishment from it. You are immune to disease and have advantage on saves against necrotic damage. Your vulture head grants you advantage on perception checks based on sight, and you can see clearly up to 2 miles away.

### Death Shepherd

**Major ability.**
Your connection to the boundary between life and death grants you power over both. Once per day, you can cast one of the following effects:

- Animate up to 4 corpses as skeletons or zombies that obey your commands for 1 hour
- Prevent up to 4 corpses from being animated or raised as undead permanently
- Speak with the spirit of a dead creature, asking up to 3 questions

## Ulvsjael

The Ulvsjael are the descendants of those who drank from the blood of Ulvma, the great wolf mother who fell defending Alaria against the titan Hykravones. Where Nagatayora descended into rage and Shara Bolasi stood alone, Ulvma remained with the armies, fighting with pack tactics and fierce loyalty until her final breath. Her blood, seeping into the earth where warriors gathered, was consumed by those seeking her strength - and they were forever changed.

All Ulvsjael carry the wolf's spirit within them, granting them the ability to partially transform and take on lupine characteristics. But more than physical traits, they inherited Ulvma's philosophy: the pack survives through unity, the weak must be culled or made strong, and loyalty once earned is absolute. This harsh pragmatism has shaped every Ulvsjael culture, though it expresses itself in different ways.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 130-220 pounds
- **Max Age:** 80 years

### Aspects

- The pack endures
- Prove your worth or perish

### Wolf's Blood Awakening

**Major ability.**
You may channel the blood of Ulvma, transforming into a wolf-like form. Your head morphs into that of a wolf while your hands sprout functional claws. This transformation lasts until you spend an action to return to your human form. While transformed:

- You gain A2 on all skill checks involving scent or hearing
- Your jaws and claws count as light piercing and slashing melee weapons respectively
- You cannot wield weapons or shields, nor manipulate fine objects
- Your movement speed increases by 20 feet

### Ulvskyn (True Blood)

The Ulvskyn are those Ulvsjael who have kept closest to Ulvma's original teachings, maintaining the harsh but fair philosophy of the pack. They form tight-knit communities where every member has a role and every role is vital. These are the Ulvsjael who still practice the ancient rites - the Culling of the Weak, the Howl of Unity, and the Blood Oath of the Pack.

Ulvskyn communities are meritocracies in the purest sense. Age, gender, and birthright mean nothing - only contribution matters. Children are raised communally and tested constantly, with those showing weakness given chance after chance to find their strength. Only those who refuse to grow, who choose weakness over struggle, face exile. This harsh system produces incredibly capable individuals who value competence above all else.

Their transformation reflects this pack mentality perfectly. When a Ulvskyn assumes their wolf form in battle, they mark prey for the pack, turning combat into a coordinated hunt where the weak are separated and brought down by unified assault.

#### Aspects

- Weakness dishonors the fallen
- United we hunt, divided we starve

#### Pack Hunter's Instinct

**Passive ability.**
Your dedication to pack tactics grants supernatural coordination in battle. Whenever you and an ally are adjacent to the same enemy, you both add 1d4 to attack rolls against that enemy. This bonus increases to 1d6 if three or more pack members (you and allies) surround the same target.

### Ulvsein (Lone Wolf)

The Ulvsein represent a paradox in Ulvsjael culture - those who honor the wolf mother by walking alone. They believe that while Ulvma fought with the pack, she died surrounded yet ultimately alone, teaching that every wolf must be capable of surviving without others. These Ulvsjael become legendary scouts, trackers, and assassins, developing an almost supernatural connection to the wilderness.

Where Ulvskkyn see strength in unity, Ulvsein find it in self-reliance. They often serve as far-ranging scouts for Ulvsjael communities or work as guides and hunters for other races. Their philosophy isn't a rejection of the pack but rather a belief that the pack is strongest when each member could survive alone. They return to their communities with valuable skills and knowledge gained from solitary wandering.

Their transformation enhances their already formidable tracking abilities, and their fighting style emphasizes mobility and adaptation rather than pack coordination. A Moonstrider in wolf form is a terrifying opponent - unpredictable, swift, and capable of attacking from unexpected angles.

#### Aspects

- The lone wolf teaches what the pack cannot
- Every trail tells a story

#### Predator's Pursuit

**Passive ability.**
Your solitary hunting has honed your tracking abilities to supernatural levels. You have advantage on all checks to track creatures, and you can identify any creature by scent if you've encountered it before. You leave no tracks unless you choose to.

Additionally, while transformed via Wolf's Blood Awakening:

- Your movement speed increases by an additional 20 feet (40 feet total with the base transformation)
- You may take the dash action as a free action once per round
- When you move at least 20 feet toward an enemy and make an attack in the same round, add 1d6 to your attack roll
- You have advantage on initiative rolls as your predatory instincts alert you to danger

## Valkyries

The Valkyries are majestic beings who serve as self-appointed arbiters of life and death, traveling between the material plane and the astral realm to guide the souls of worthy warriors to their final rest. These winged humanoids with their armor of starlight and weapons forged from celestial steel see themselves as guardians of cosmic justice, though their definition of justice often conflicts with mortal understanding.

Standing taller than most humans with wings that shimmer with astral energy, Valkyries possess an otherworldly beauty tempered by the weight of their duties. They view mortal conflicts from a perspective that transcends individual lives, concerning themselves with the greater balance between good and evil, order and chaos. This detachment can make them seem cold or condescending to those they judge.

Valkyrie society operates on strict codes of honor and duty, with each Valkyrie assigned to watch over specific regions or types of conflicts. They intervene only when they deem the cosmic balance is threatened, leading many mortals to view them as capricious despite their rigid adherence to celestial law.

### Aspects

- Judge of the worthy dead
- Mortal concerns are beneath cosmic justice

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Astral Wings

**Passive ability.**
You possess wings made of solidified astral energy that grant you a fly speed of 30 feet. Once per day, you can shift partially into the astral plane for 1 minute, gaining resistance to all physical damage but vulnerability to psychic damage. You can see and interact with spirits and ghosts at all times.

### Death's Arbiter

**Major ability.**
Your role as a guide between life and death grants you power over both. When a creature within 60 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, you may instantly judge their worthiness. Choose one:

- If worthy: The creature stabilizes at 1 hit point and gains immunity to death for 1 hour
- If unworthy: The creature immediately fails one death save
- If neutral: You learn the creature's most heroic and most villainous acts

You can use this ability once per combat, and your judgment cannot be reversed by any means.

## Wytrolape

The Wytrolape are massive white-furred apes who embody the duality of peace and violence. For most of their lives, these intelligent beings are gentle giants, working as laborers in northern settlements, using their incredible strength for construction and other peaceful purposes. They have "civilized" themselves, learning to speak, use tools, and integrate into humanoid society with remarkable success.

However, the Wytrolape carry within them an ancient curse tied to the celestial cycles. When both moons vanish from the sky—an event they call the "war moon"—these peaceful creatures transform into berserk warriors of terrifying power. During these nights, they must be restrained or isolated, as they attack anything that moves with a fury that seems completely alien to their normal temperament.

This duality has shaped Wytrolape culture profoundly. They are constantly aware of their potential for violence, leading to a philosophy of extreme self-control and calendar awareness. Many wear special restraints they can activate when they feel the war moon approaching, while others retreat to isolated strongholds built specifically for these occasions.

### Aspects

- The war moon lives within us all
- Strength controlled is strength doubled

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 400-600 pounds

### Simian Might

**Passive ability.**
Your ape heritage grants you a climb speed equal to your movement speed and the ability to use your feet as hands for climbing. Your carrying capacity is doubled, and you count as one size larger for grappling. You have advantage on might checks to lift, break, or throw objects.

### War Moon Fury

**Major ability.**
When both moons are dark (or at GM's discretion, when you choose to activate this), you enter a berserk rage that lasts 1 hour. While raging:

- Your might-based attacks deal an additional 2d6 damage
- You gain 20 temporary hit points
- You must attack the nearest creature each round
- You cannot distinguish friend from foe
- You are immune to being charmed or frightened

You can attempt a CN 15 presence save at the end of each round to end this early.

## Yngli

The Yngli are living reminders of the danger of careless words around vengeful cyclopes. These squat, one-eyed beings were once the faithful assistants in the great cyclops forges, using their inborn force attunement to accelerate hammers and move tools with mere thoughts. But when one of their number spoke too freely about their master's work, the betrayed cyclops cursed their entire race to eternal silence.

Now the Yngli struggle as second-class citizens across the Western Isles and Kura. Unable to negotiate, explain, or defend themselves verbally, they are easily exploited by those who separate them from their kin. Only when united under a rare telepath of their kind can they organize effectively, forming silent unions that communicate through gesture and force manipulation.

### Aspects

- Forever silenced
- Natural force wielder

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4-5 ft
- **Weight:** 90-140 lbs
- **Max Age:** 50

### Forceborn

**Passive ability.**

You gain a paragon level attunement to force.

### Speechbroken

**Passive ability.**

Long ago, a terrible curse was placed on all yngli, preventing them from ever speaking. Although they can produce sound with their mouths with enough concentration, the sounds that come out are garbled and incoherent.
