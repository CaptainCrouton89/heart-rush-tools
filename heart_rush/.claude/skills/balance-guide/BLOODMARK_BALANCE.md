# Bloodmark Balance Guide

Bloodmarks represent a character's evolution from a novice to a legendary warrior. They are earned via narrative milestones (approx. every 4-6 sessions), not XP.

## Progression Tier

| Bloodmark | Title | Reward |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Emerging | 1 Specialization |
| **2** | Specialized | 1 Specialization + 1 Signature Ability |
| **3** | Advanced | 2 Specializations + 3 Signature Abilities (Cumulative total?) *Check rules: usually cumulative adds* |
| **4** | Minor Hero | 1 Combat Mastery |
| **5+** | Legend | 1 Paragon Ability per mark |

*Note: The text in `Building_Your_Character.md` implies cumulative gains or a specific set at each level. Standard interpretation: You gain specific slots at each level.*

**Clarification from Rules**:
*   1st: Gain 1 Specialization.
*   2nd-3rd: Gain Signature Abilities.
*   4th: Gain 1 Combat Mastery.
*   5th+: Gain 1 Paragon Ability.

## Ability Types

### 1. Specializations (Passive)
*   **Effect**: Always active combat buffs.
*   **Power Level**: Define the character's "style" (e.g., tank, grappler, speedster).
*   *Examples*: "+1 Atk/Def per adjacent enemy", "Exploding dice on max roll", "Free object interaction".

### 2. Signature Abilities (Minor)
*   **Cost**: Rush Points (1 for 1st use, 2 for 2nd, etc.). Resets after fight.
*   **Effect**: Tactical active abilities or reactive defenses.
*   *Examples*: "Remove conditions", "Add weapon die to defense", "Double damage on max roll".

### 3. Combat Masteries (Major)
*   **Cost**: Once per day (Daily).
*   **Effect**: Ultimate moves. Can turn the tide of a boss fight.
*   *Examples*: "Halve incoming damage for team", "Free opportunity attacks + sidesteps", "Reroll defense dice from a pool".

### 4. Paragon Abilities (Legendary)
*   **Requirement**: 5th Bloodmark+.
*   **Effect**: God-tier passives or upgrades to Masteries. Breaks standard rules.
*   *Examples*: "Assassinate (double damage on hit)", "Ability Die becomes d20", "Act twice per round".
*   **Balance**: These are meant to be "broken" or end-game power levels.

## Design Philosophy
*   **Bloodmarks define "Class"**: Heart Rush doesn't have classes. Bloodmarks + Talents build the archetype.
*   **Synergy**: Bloodmark abilities often reference specific mechanics (Stances, Rush Points, Wounds).
