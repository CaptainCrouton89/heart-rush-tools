# Race & Culture Balance Guide

Races in Heart Rush provide the baseline for a character's physical and cultural identity.

## Core Components

Every race definition requires:

1.  **Flavor/Lore**: Description of their society, physical appearance, and psychology.
2.  **Vitals**:
    *   **Size**: Usually Medium or Small. Large is rare (balance implication: weapon sizing).
    *   **Height/Weight**: Ranges.
    *   **Max Age**: Optional but good for flavor.
3.  **Aspects**: Two suggested aspects that define the race's core themes (e.g., "Apex Predator", "Frozen in Tradition").
4.  **Abilities**: The mechanical meat.

## Racial Abilities

Races typically get **one** strong signature ability or a package of smaller ones.

### Types of Racial Abilities

Racial abilities should be equal in power leevl to talents (~2.5 damage for combat related ones, for example)

*   **Powerful Passive**: A constant benefit.
    *   *Example (Alekroin)*: Advantage on attacks vs wounded/fewer HP enemies.
    *   *Example (Blaize)*: +40 speed, run on water. (Balanced by fragility or social stigma).
*   **Active Ability (Major/Minor)**: A specific action they can take.
    *   *Example (Bogies)*: Hibernation (narrative). Toxic secretion (combat/utility).
*   **Free Talent**: The race gains a specific Talent for free.
    *   *Example (Gnome)*: "Gnomish Blood" reduces XP cost for handmagic.
    *   *Example (Human)*: "Resilience" grants 1 free talent of choice.
*   **Subrace Abilities**: If the race has subraces, the base race gets a weaker ability, and the subrace adds a second ability.

## Balancing Subraces

If a race has subraces:
*   **Base Race**: Core identity ability.
*   **Subrace**: Adds specific flavor and one additional ability or modification.
    *   *Example (Dwarf)*: Base = +HP/XP discount. Subrace = Specific attunement or specialized skill.

## Vitals Balance
*   **Small Size**: Often harder to hit or better at hiding, but may have weapon restrictions (can't use heavy weapons effectively without "Hulking" talent).
*   **Large Size**: Can wield heavy weapons in one hand, but bigger target.
