Spells are listed by their name, along with two tags—their required attunements, and if they are ongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a single attunement as prerequisite for casting the spell, but some have two or more. If the spell is immediate, the spell effect occurs once when the spell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell’s effects continue for up to one minute, or when the spell caster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.
