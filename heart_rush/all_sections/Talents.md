Talents

Talents represent specific abilities you have learned, been gifted, or know how to perform through religious or magical ritual.
Each talent will fall into one of three types of abilities: passive abilities, heart abilities, or major abilities. As with abilities gained from your class, passive abilities can be used whenever and at no cost, and major abilities can be used once per day. Heart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you take a wound.
Additionally, talents may also have the instant or full action tag. If it is instant, then you can use the ability at literally any time, even right before you roll. If it has the full action tag, it requires you to use your action.
Types of Talents
Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by their tags. Each require different conditions to be met in order to gain that talent.
Cognitive and Martial Talents
Martial talents are those that require physical

Gaeic melodies and handmagic are rooted in lore specific to “Alaria”, the world held in mind during the writing of the Heart Rush rulebook. Feel free to re-flavor these tags, remove them, or add new tags and categorizations. prowess and training. They represent the cumulation of extensive practice and training. There are no prerequisites for taking a martial talent.]]
Cognitive talents, like martial talents, come from vigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.
Gaeic Melodies
Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that reverberate throughout all living things—left over from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world into life.
Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to them have magical effects. However, they cannot be discovered innately, and require a teacher or a songbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or higher aspect in musical talents in order to play them.
When playing a gaeic melody, it requires your action to play the instrument. You can move up to half your move speed while playing, but cannot move more than that. You cannot play more than one gaeic melody at the same time.
Handmagic
Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create their effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where words spoken in it simply come true.
Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the back of one’s hand, inscribed in the blood of magical creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the tattooed hand in specific ways, one can then create those magical effects. The knowledge and necessary materials to inscribe hand runes is rare and expensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely require you to be in a city.
Combat Talents
The talents in this section are combat-related talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding talents, and has no other effect.
Adrenaline spike
Major ability. Handmagic.

Passive ability. Martial talent.
You have learned the art of debilitating your foes and killing them silently. When you enter an engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately make a might or agility check against their agility challenge number. On a success, you either gag them, garrote them, or in some other way remove their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.
