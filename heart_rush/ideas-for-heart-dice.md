1. "Shake It Off" (Survival/Utility)
   * The concept: You burn through your exhaustion to clear your head.
   * The Mechanic: Minor Ability. Decrease your heart die by one size to
     immediately remove one level of Dazed, Weakened, or Off-Balanced.
   * Why it fits: It prevents the "death spiral" of conditions by sacrificing
     long-term stamina.

  2. "Blood for Blood" (Offense)
   * The concept: You throw your full weight behind a blow, ignoring the strain on
     your body.
   * The Mechanic: Free Action (on hit). When you deal damage, decrease your heart
     die by one size. Add a roll of your current Heart Die (the size before the
     decrease) to the damage.
   * Why it fits: It allows for massive burst damage but leaves you extremely
     vulnerable to retaliation (since your mitigation die is now smaller).

  3. "Desperate Dash" (Mobility)
   * The concept: You push your lungs to the bursting point to reach cover or
     close the gap.
   * The Mechanic: Minor Ability. Decrease your heart die by one size to
     immediately move up to your speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity
     attacks.
   * Why it fits: Great for escaping bad positioning or diving the backline, but
     costs you the ability to tank hits once you get there.

  4. "Turn the Tide" (Defense/Support)
   * The concept: You intervene at the last second, straining your reflexes.
   * The Mechanic: Reaction. When an adjacent ally is hit by an attack, decrease
     your heart die by one size to take the hit instead. You cannot use Heart Die
     Mitigation on this damage.
   * Why it fits: The ultimate "tank" sacrifice.

1. "Soulfire" (Magic/Caster)
   * The concept: You fuel your spell with your own life essence to make it
     volatile.
   * The Mechanic: Free Action (when casting). Decrease your Heart Die by one size
     to maximize the damage dice of a spell or cantrip you just cast.
   * Why it fits: It gives casters a "nova" option that physically drains them.

  2. "Bulldoze" (Crowd Control)
   * The concept: You use your body as a battering ram, caring little for the
     bruises.
   * The Mechanic: Action. Move up to your speed in a straight line. You can move
     through enemy spaces. Decrease your Heart Die by one size to automatically
     knock Prone every enemy you pass through (no roll required).
   * Why it fits: It’s a cinematic, high-impact opener that leaves you surrounded
     and tired—perfect for a brute.

  3. "Iron Will" (Mental Defense)
   * The concept: You refuse to be controlled, even if the mental strain causes a
     nosebleed.
   * The Mechanic: Reaction. When you fail a defense roll against a mental effect
     (Charm, Fear, Sleep, Possession), decrease your Heart Die by one size to
     succeed instead.
   * Why it fits: It prevents "save or suck" moments by letting the player pay a
     heavy cost to stay in the fight.

  4. "Martyr’s Gift" (Support/Healer)
   * The concept: You physically transfer your vitality to a dying friend.
   * The Mechanic: Action. Touch an ally and decrease your Heart Die by one size.
     They Increase their Heart Die by one size (up to their maximum) and
     immediately heal hit points equal to a roll of your new Heart Die.
   * Why it fits: It creates a direct economy transfer between players. The tank
     can "recharge" the striker, or the healer can save the tank at personal cost.

  5. "Moment of Clarity" (Skill Utility)
   * The concept: You strain your mind to the breaking point to spot the clue or
     pick the lock.
   * The Mechanic: Free Action. When you fail a non-combat skill check, decrease
     your Heart Die by one size to reroll the check with Advantage (or perhaps add
     a flat +5).
   * Why it fits: Keeps the story moving. It allows players to say, "I really need
     to succeed at this," and pay the price for it.



1. Make it so that the options are remove all of one condition or one level of each

Minor abilities have replaced heart abilities. Maybe major abilities just use heart die (and multiple levels of it??)

Rushpoints, Heart die, hp, dp. Those should be only resources. Annoying to track other stuff. 

Option 1: Imposing Presence (Threat Generation)

  ## Imposing Presence

  _Passive ability. Martial talent._

  You command attention on the battlefield. When you enter an engagement, all
  enemies in that engagement have disadvantage on attack rolls against
  creatures other than you until the end of the engagement. This disadvantage
  does not apply if you chose the defensive stance.

  **Destiny Level:**
  Enemies that attack creatures other than you while affected by this ability
  provoke an opportunity attack from you. This opportunity attack costs 1 rush
   point instead of your action.

  Why this works:
  - Creates meaningful choice: enemies can still ignore you, but at a penalty
  - You sacrifice defensive stance to maintain threat (can't turtle and demand
   attention)
  - Destiny version creates resource drain (rush points) for enforcement
  - Works within engagement system without new mechanics
  - Doesn't force targeting (just incentivizes it)

  ---
  Option 2: Protective Positioning (Space Control)

  ## Protective Positioning

  _Passive ability. Martial talent._

  Adjacent allies gain +2 to their defense rolls. When an adjacent ally would
  be pushed, pulled, or forcibly moved, you may reduce that forced movement by
   up to 10 feet (minimum 0).

  **Destiny Level:**
  When an enemy enters an engagement with an adjacent ally, you may
  immediately enter that engagement as well (even if you've already used your
  action). If you do, you must choose the same stance as your ally.

  Why this works:
  - Passive defense boost for positioning near tank
  - Anti-displacement protects your formation
  - Destiny version lets you "bodyguard" reactively
  - Stance matching creates interesting coordination decisions
  - No forced targeting, just makes allies harder to kill when near you

  Option 3: Retribution (Punish Ignoring Tank)

  ## Retribution

  _Passive ability. Martial talent._

  When an enemy in the same engagement attacks a creature other than you, they
   take 1 level of off-balanced at the end of the engagement phase. An enemy
  can only be affected by this once per round.

  **Destiny Level:**
  You may immediately make a free attack roll against the enemy as they attack
   your ally. This attack resolves before their attack, using the same stance
  you chose for the engagement. If your attack deals damage, their attack has
  disadvantage.

  Why this works:
  - Punishes ignoring the tank with conditions
  - Destiny version is powerful but fits instant ability design
  - Your damage can reduce their effectiveness (disadvantage)
  - Scales with multiple protected targets
  - Uses existing condition system (off-balanced)


. Opportunity attacks that lock movement - Does not exist
  2. Tank-focused aggravation application - Very limited (only Taunting Blow,
  Improved Interference, Bag of Tricks)
  3. Passive aura that applies aggravated - Does not exist
  4. Reach weapon control mechanics - Does not exist (your Tether idea)
