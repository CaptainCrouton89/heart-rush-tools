# Pacing

One of the most critical skills for running Heart Rush is maintaining proper pacing. When the energy at the table drops, when players seem uncertain about their next move, or when the narrative momentum stalls, it's time for you to make a move. This section provides tools to keep your game dynamic and engaging.

## When to Make a Move

Make a move when:

- Players look to you expectantly, waiting for something to happen
- The pace of play slows noticeably
- A player fails a roll or triggers a complication
- The narrative reaches a natural pause
- You need to raise the stakes or tension

## GM Moves

These moves help maintain narrative momentum without drastically escalating the situation. Use them to complicate the characters' lives and create interesting choices.

### Soft Moves

**Separate Them**  
Create circumstances that divide the party. A collapsing floor, a closing door, or social obligations that pull characters in different directions.

**Put Someone in a Spot**  
Place a character in a difficult position requiring immediate decision. They're caught between two bad options or must choose quickly under pressure.

**Capture Someone**  
An NPC or enemy takes a character captive, but rescue remains feasible. This creates immediate objectives for the remaining party members.

**Tell Them the Possible Consequences and Ask**  
Clearly outline what might happen if they proceed with their current course of action. "If you charge through that door, you'll definitely alert the guards. What do you do?"

**Announce Future Badness**  
Foreshadow approaching danger. Storm clouds gathering, distant war drums, or an NPC mentioning that "the Duke's soldiers will arrive by dawn."

**Announce Off-Screen Badness**  
Reveal troubles happening elsewhere that may affect the characters later. Their home village is under attack, their patron has been arrested, or their ship is being searched.

**Take Away Their Stuff**  
Temporarily remove access to important gear or resources. Weapons get stuck, pouches tear open, or authorities confiscate equipment.

**Make Them Buy**  
Force characters to pay a price—literal or metaphorical—for what they want. Information requires a favor, passage demands coin, or help needs a promise.

**Activate Their Stuff's Downside**  
Equipment fails at inopportune moments, magical items reveal their curses, or that "reliable" contact proves less trustworthy than expected.

**Trade Harm for Harm**  
When characters deal damage or cause problems, they receive proportional consequences. A messy fight draws unwanted attention, or destroying the bridge means they can't retreat.

**Inflict Harm**  
Follow through on established threats. If you've shown the goblin archers taking aim, some arrows find their marks. Keep harm proportional to the threat level.

### Hard Moves

When the situation demands serious consequences—typically after failed rolls, ignored warnings, or when soft moves haven't created sufficient urgency—escalate to hard moves.

**Separate Them (Forcefully)**  
The party is split with no easy way to reunite. Cave-ins, magical teleportation, or arrest by different factions.

**Capture Someone (Severely)**  
A character is taken captive under serious circumstances—imprisoned in a fortress, enslaved by raiders, or trapped in another plane.

**Put Someone in a Spot (Dangerously)**  
Characters face immediate life-threatening danger with no easy escape. Surrounded by enemies, hanging from a cliff, or trapped in a burning building.

**Inflict Harm (Seriously)**  
Deal significant damage based on the established fiction. This should feel like a natural consequence of the danger they faced.

**Take Away Their Stuff (Permanently)**  
Items are destroyed, stolen with no clear way to recover them, or sacrificed. That ancestral sword shatters, the spell components burn up, or the map falls into the chasm.

**Activate Their Stuff's Downside (Severely)**  
Catastrophic failure or revelation of major drawbacks. The cursed armor won't come off, the "healing" potion was poison, or the magical weapon attracts dangerous attention.

**Make Them Buy (Expensively)**  
Demand significant sacrifices. Saving the village requires giving up their quest item, or escaping means leaving a companion behind.

**Announce Future Badness (Imminent)**  
The threatened danger arrives NOW. The assassins kick down the door, the dam bursts, or the ritual completes.

**Announce Off-Screen Badness (Major)**  
Reveal that something terrible has happened elsewhere with major ramifications. Their employer is dead, their homeland has fallen, or their rivals have claimed the prize.

**Make a Move from Your Fronts**  
Advance the broader threats and plots in your campaign. The villain's plan progresses, ancient evils stir, or political situations deteriorate.

## Using These Moves Effectively

- **Fiction First**: Every move should follow logically from the established narrative
- **Telegraph Danger**: Players should usually see hard moves coming through soft moves first
- **Maintain Trust**: Be fair and consistent in your move selection
- **Keep It Moving**: The goal is to maintain engagement, not punish players
- **Ask Questions**: After making a move, turn the spotlight back to the players: "What do you do?"

Remember, these moves are tools to create dynamic, engaging stories—not weapons to wield against players. Use them to build tension, create meaningful choices, and keep everyone invested in the unfolding narrative.
