# Monstrous Races

The following races are not playable without special GM permission.

## Troenka

The Troenka are perhaps the most feared inhabitants of the great forests, beings of living wood whose greatest pleasure comes from tormenting travelers who dare enter their domain. These cruel entities appear as tall, gaunt humanoids of bark and branch, but possess the terrifying ability to assume the form of ordinary trees, becoming completely indistinguishable from the natural forest around them. Their strength is legendary, and their intelligence far greater than most give them credit for.

Unlike other woodland folk who might be protective of their forests, the Troenka simply enjoy causing suffering. They feel no need for food, water, or shelter, existing in a state of perfect self-sufficiency that has bred an overwhelming sense of superiority over all "lesser" beings. This arrogance, combined with their sadistic nature, makes them view any intruders as entertainment rather than threats.

Troenka settlements exist wherever ancient forests grow thick and dark—places like Ichneum, the Tenekee Woods, and Goranyakak. They create elaborate hunting grounds designed to trap and torment victims for extended periods, turning sections of forest into nightmarish mazes where screams echo between the trees.

## Tythvuln

The Tythvuln are a race of vulture-headed humanoids who serve as the eternal guardians of an ancient undead giant, their entire culture built around this sacred duty. With black-feathered heads, sharp beaks, and keen eyes that can spot movement from miles away, they circle endlessly above their charge on powerful wings, watching for any who might disturb its slumber.

These carrion priests have developed a complex religious philosophy around death and undeath, viewing themselves as shepherds of the boundary between life and death. They consume only carrion, seeing it as a sacred act that prevents the unworthy dead from rising as undead. Their settlements are built into cliff faces surrounding their giant ward, with bone architecture that creates haunting whistles when the wind blows through.

The Tythvuln believe that when their giant finally awakens, it will lead them to establish a new world order where death and undeath exist in perfect balance. Until then, they maintain their vigil, generation after generation, never wavering in their duty.

### Aspects

- Death is sacred, undeath is power
- The eternal vigil defines us

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-140 pounds (hollow bones)

### Carrion Feeder

**Passive ability.**
You can safely consume carrion of any age and gain nourishment from it. You are immune to disease and have advantage on saves against necrotic damage. Your vulture head grants you advantage on perception checks based on sight, and you can see clearly up to 2 miles away.

### Death Shepherd

**Major ability.**
Your connection to the boundary between life and death grants you power over both. Once per day, you can cast one of the following effects:

- Animate up to 4 corpses as skeletons or zombies that obey your commands for 1 hour
- Prevent up to 4 corpses from being animated or raised as undead permanently
- Speak with the spirit of a dead creature, asking up to 3 questions

## Valkyries

The Valkyries are majestic beings who serve as self-appointed arbiters of life and death, traveling between the material plane and the astral realm to guide the souls of worthy warriors to their final rest. These winged humanoids with their armor of starlight and weapons forged from celestial steel see themselves as guardians of cosmic justice, though their definition of justice often conflicts with mortal understanding.

Standing taller than most humans with wings that shimmer with astral energy, Valkyries possess an otherworldly beauty tempered by the weight of their duties. They view mortal conflicts from a perspective that transcends individual lives, concerning themselves with the greater balance between good and evil, order and chaos. This detachment can make them seem cold or condescending to those they judge.

Valkyrie society operates on strict codes of honor and duty, with each Valkyrie assigned to watch over specific regions or types of conflicts. They intervene only when they deem the cosmic balance is threatened, leading many mortals to view them as capricious despite their rigid adherence to celestial law.

### Aspects

- Judge of the worthy dead
- Mortal concerns are beneath cosmic justice

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Astral Wings

**Passive ability.**
You possess wings made of solidified astral energy that grant you a fly speed of 30 feet. Once per day, you can shift partially into the astral plane for 1 minute, gaining resistance to all physical damage but vulnerability to psychic damage. You can see and interact with spirits and ghosts at all times.

### Death's Arbiter

**Major ability.**
Your role as a guide between life and death grants you power over both. When a creature within 60 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, you may instantly judge their worthiness. Choose one:

- If worthy: The creature stabilizes at 1 hit point and gains immunity to death for 1 hour
- If unworthy: The creature immediately fails one death save
- If neutral: You learn the creature's most heroic and most villainous acts

You can use this ability once per combat, and your judgment cannot be reversed by any means.

## Wytrolape

The Wytrolape are massive white-furred apes who embody the duality of peace and violence. For most of their lives, these intelligent beings are gentle giants, working as laborers in northern settlements, using their incredible strength for construction and other peaceful purposes. They have "civilized" themselves, learning to speak, use tools, and integrate into humanoid society with remarkable success.

However, the Wytrolape carry within them an ancient curse tied to the celestial cycles. When both moons vanish from the sky—an event they call the "war moon"—these peaceful creatures transform into berserk warriors of terrifying power. During these nights, they must be restrained or isolated, as they attack anything that moves with a fury that seems completely alien to their normal temperament.

This duality has shaped Wytrolape culture profoundly. They are constantly aware of their potential for violence, leading to a philosophy of extreme self-control and calendar awareness. Many wear special restraints they can activate when they feel the war moon approaching, while others retreat to isolated strongholds built specifically for these occasions.

### Aspects

- The war moon lives within us all
- Strength controlled is strength doubled

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 400-600 pounds

### Simian Might

**Passive ability.**
Your ape heritage grants you a climb speed equal to your movement speed and the ability to use your feet as hands for climbing. Your carrying capacity is doubled, and you count as one size larger for grappling. You have advantage on might checks to lift, break, or throw objects.

### War Moon Fury

**Major ability.**
When both moons are dark (or at GM's discretion, when you choose to activate this), you enter a berserk rage that lasts 1 hour. While raging:

- Your might-based attacks deal an additional 2d6 damage
- You gain 20 temporary hit points
- You must attack the nearest creature each round
- You cannot distinguish friend from foe
- You are immune to being charmed or frightened

You can attempt a CN 15 presence save at the end of each round to end this early.
