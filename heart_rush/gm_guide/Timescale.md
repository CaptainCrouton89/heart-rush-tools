# Timescale

Heart Rush operates at two distinct timescales of play, each serving different narrative purposes. Understanding when and how to shift between these scales is crucial for maintaining proper pacing and player engagement.

## The Two Scales

### Micro-Scale: Moment-to-Moment

Micro-scale covers immediate, detailed actions where every choice matters. Use this scale when:

- **Combat**: Each round, action, and movement is tracked
- **Tense negotiations**: Every word could shift the outcome
- **Delicate operations**: Picking locks, disarming traps, surgery
- **Dramatic moments**: Confrontations, revelations, critical decisions

At this scale, players describe specific actions, roll individual skill checks, and experience immediate consequences.

### Macro-Scale: Broad Strokes

Macro-scale abstracts longer periods into single rolls or narrative descriptions. Use this scale when:

- **Routine activities**: "I spend the evening mingling at the tavern"
- **Extended tasks**: "We search the library for three days"
- **Travel montages**: "The journey takes a week through peaceful farmland"
- **Downtime activities**: Crafting, training, research between adventures

## Choosing the Right Scale

### When to Use Micro-Scale

Default to micro-scale when:

- Stakes are immediate and personal
- Players want direct control over outcomes
- Individual actions could dramatically change the situation
- The scene is dramatically important to the story
- Combat or other structured subsystems apply

### When to Use Macro-Scale

Shift to macro-scale when:

- The outcome matters more than the process
- Time needs to pass without bogging down play
- Players express disinterest in details ("We just want to get there")
- Activities are routine or repetitive
- You need to summarize to reach important scenes

### Switching Between Scales

Smoothly transition by:

- **Zooming Out**: "As the battle ends, tell me how you spend the next few days recovering..."
- **Zooming In**: "Three days into your research, you discover something disturbing. Let's play out this moment..."
- **Player Choice**: "Do you want to roleplay the negotiation or summarize your approach?"

## Macro-Scale Resolution

When a macro-scale activity has uncertain outcomes that matter to the story, use this streamlined resolution system.

### 1. Define Success

Before rolling, establish:

- **The Goal**: What are the players trying to achieve?
- **Success Criteria**: What does complete success look like?
- **Failure Stakes**: What happens if they fail?
- **Time Frame**: How long does this activity take?

_Example: "You're spending three days recruiting defenders for the village. Success means gathering at least 20 willing fighters. Failure means the village remains largely undefended."_

### 2. Set Difficulty

Use standard Heart Rush CNs:

- **CN 6**: Routine tasks with complications
- **CN 9**: Challenging but reasonable goals
- **CN 12**: Difficult undertakings
- **CN 15**: Extremely challenging tasks
- **CN 18**: Nearly impossible achievements

Inform players of the CN before they roll.

### 3. Make the Roll

One player makes a skill check using the most relevant ability. Others may help if it makes narrative sense, granting advantage as normal.

### 4. Interpret Results

#### Full Success (Roll ≥ CN + 3)

The goal is achieved completely, plus a beneficial twist:

- Discover useful information or resources
- Make unexpected allies or connections
- Uncover hidden opportunities
- Exceed the original goal
- Complete the task faster than expected

**Example**: _Recruiting defenders (CN 9, rolled 14): "Not only do 30 villagers volunteer, but a retired mercenary captain emerges from the crowd, offering to train them in basic formations."_

#### Success (Roll ≥ CN)

The goal is achieved as intended. Describe the success without complications or additional benefits.

**Example**: _Recruiting defenders (CN 9, rolled 10): "After three days of persuasion, you gather 20 able-bodied villagers willing to defend their homes."_

#### Partial Success (CN - 1 to CN - 3)

Progress toward the goal, but with complications:

- Additional cost or requirement
- Unwanted attention or consequences
- Incomplete or compromised results
- New obstacles revealed
- Time pressure or delays

Present the complication and let players decide how to proceed.

**Example**: _Recruiting defenders (CN 9, rolled 7): "You gather 15 volunteers, but they'll only fight if you can provide weapons and armor—resources the village lacks."_

#### Failure (Roll < CN - 3)

The goal isn't achieved, but forward progress ensures the story continues:

- Reveal why the approach failed
- Provide alternative paths forward
- Introduce new information or allies
- Create unexpected opportunities
- Shift the situation dramatically

**Example**: _Recruiting defenders (CN 9, rolled 4): "The villagers refuse to fight, but an old woman pulls you aside. 'If you want defenders,' she whispers, 'seek the Woodland Kin in the eastern forest. They have their own grievances with these raiders.'"_

### Complications on 1s

Even during macro-scale rolls, rolled 1s trigger complications. These should:

- Relate to the broader activity, not individual moments
- Create ongoing problems rather than immediate ones
- Introduce elements that might require micro-scale resolution later

## Integrating with Other Systems

Heart Rush includes several systems that naturally operate at macro-scale:

### Journey Rolls

Already macro-scale by design. Each segment represents days of travel compressed into single rolls.

### Enterprise Actions

Enterprise rolls are inherently macro-scale, representing weeks or months of organizational activity.

### Downtime Activities

- **Crafting**: Each period between rolls represents days of work
- **Recovery**: Long rests abstract a full night's rest
- **Training**: Learning new skills happens "between adventures"

### Skill Challenges

For complex macro-scale undertakings requiring multiple rolls:

1. Define the overall goal and required successes (usually 3-5)
2. Each roll represents a different approach or phase
3. Track successes and failures separately
4. Three failures before achieving enough successes means overall failure

## Best Practices

### Maintain Narrative Flow

- Don't force macro-scale when players are engaged with details
- Don't bog down in micro-scale when players want to move forward
- Read the table's energy and adjust accordingly

### Player Agency

- Always offer the choice of scale when reasonable
- Respect when players want to "zoom in" on important moments
- Let players narrate macro-scale successes when appropriate

### Consistency

- Establish patterns for which activities use which scale
- Be consistent within similar situations
- Communicate clearly when shifting scales

### Drama Over Mechanics

- Use micro-scale for dramatic peaks
- Use macro-scale for rising action and transitions
- Never let scale choice diminish important moments

## Quick Reference

**Use Micro-Scale For:**

- Combat encounters
- Tense negotiations
- Stealth sequences
- Trap navigation
- Dramatic confrontations
- Any scene players want to play out

**Use Macro-Scale For:**

- Travel without incidents
- Research and investigation
- Social gatherings
- Crafting and downtime
- Routine preparations
- Any scene players want to summarize

**When Uncertain:**

- Ask the players
- Consider dramatic importance
- Default to player engagement
- Think about pacing needs
