# GM's Journey Guide

## Quick Reference: When to Use Journey Rules

**Skip entirely:** Safe roads, routine travel, jumping to destination for pacing
**Single roll:** Brief risky travel (under a day), time pressure without detail
**Full system:** Multi-day expeditions, journey as story focus, survival matters

## Planning Journeys

### Segment Guidelines

- **1 segment:** 4-12 hours of risky travel
- **2-3 segments:** 2-7 days
- **4-6 segments:** 1-4 weeks
- **7+ segments:** Epic expeditions (use sparingly)

**Segment breaks occur at:**

- Major terrain transitions
- Resupply opportunities
- Dramatic danger shifts
- Natural story beats

### Setting Difficulty

| CN  | Terrain/Conditions                             | Weather Modifiers      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 6   | Known paths, maps available, some shelter      | Clear: +0              |
| 9   | Wilderness, poor paths, limited resources      | Rain/Snow: +3          |
| 12  | Extreme terrain, no paths, hostile environment | Storm: +6              |
| 15  | Uncharted, actively dangerous, no shelter      | Blizzard/Hurricane: +9 |
| 18+ | Supernatural dangers, reality-warping effects  | Magical storms: +12    |

**Modify CN based on:**

- Party preparation (-3 for excellent supplies/guides)
- Time of year (+3 for winter/monsoon season)
- Local threats (+3 for war zones/monster territories)
- Magical influences (varies wildly)

## Running Journey Rolls

**Who rolls:** Best navigator/guide, or whoever's leading this segment
**What helps:** Only unique, relevant expertise grants advantage (not "I help look around")

### Interpreting Results

**Success:** Montage the journey—describe 2-3 memorable moments, then arrive safely at segment's end. Party finds good camps and auto-succeeds sleeping checks.

**Failure:** The party genuinely fails their goal. They don't just have a hard time—they get lost, can't progress, or face serious setbacks. Choose consequences that create new problems, not dead ends.

**Complications:** Whether success or failure, zoom in to a specific challenge requiring immediate player decisions. Run it as a mini-encounter.

## Failure Consequences (Choose One)

### Lost/Stalled

- **Completely Lost:** Repeat entire segment (no progress)
- **Wrong Direction:** Add extra segment to correct course
- **Impassable:** Must find alternate route (+1 segment) or abandon journey
- **Circles:** Return to segment start, supplies consumed

### No Safe Haven

- **Poor Shelter:** Disadvantage on all sleeping checks this segment
- **Exposure:** Everyone takes 1d6 wound ("exposure")
- **Forced March:** Everyone gains 2 levels of weakened
- **Harassment:** Constant minor attacks prevent rest

### Critical Delays (When Time Matters)

- **Missed Deadline:** Arrive after the ritual/meeting/season
- **Conditions Worsen:** +3 CN to all remaining segments
- **Pursued:** Whatever's chasing you catches up
- **Resources Depleted:** Consume double rations getting unstuck

## Complications Master Table

When a die shows 1, roll d20 or choose based on terrain:

| d20   | Universal Complications                                                                 |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2   | **Natural Disaster:** Avalanche, wildfire, flash flood, sandstorm approaching           |
| 3-4   | **Blocked Path:** Fallen trees, cave-in, washed out bridge, crevasse field              |
| 5-6   | **Resource Crisis:** Water contaminated, food spoiled, critical gear lost/broken        |
| 7-8   | **Navigation Confusion:** Landmarks changed, map errors, magical disorientation         |
| 9-10  | **Hostile Territory:** Predator stalking, territorial markings, active hunting grounds  |
| 11-12 | **Weather Turns:** Storm building, temperature extreme, fog/whiteout conditions         |
| 13-14 | **Discovery:** Ancient ruins, abandoned camp, mysterious monument, old battlefield      |
| 15-16 | **Locals:** Hostile tribe, suspicious villagers, territorial hermit, toll collectors    |
| 17-18 | **Pursuit/Stalking:** Something following, distant watchers, fresh tracks behind you    |
| 19-20 | **Weird/Magical:** Reality hiccup, time distortion, impossible geography, ancient curse |

### Terrain-Specific Twists

- **Mountains:** Altitude sickness, unstable paths, snow blindness
- **Forest:** Carnivorous plants, will-o-wisps, paths that shift
- **Desert:** Mirages, sand that swallows, glass storms
- **Ocean:** Sea monsters, ghost ships, doldrums
- **Underground:** Gas pockets, unstable ceilings, things that fear light

## Resource Management

### When to Track Daily

Switch from montage to daily tracking when:

- Supplies below 3 days per person
- Multiple wounded party members
- Failed roll result demands it
- Extreme conditions (magical storms, etc.)
- Players request detail
- Drama demands it

### Daily Tracking Checklist

- [ ] Consume 1 food + 1 water per person
- [ ] Make sleeping checks (apply modifiers)
- [ ] Check temperature/exposure effects
- [ ] Advance/heal conditions
- [ ] Random encounter check (if using)

### Supply Guidelines

**Well-supplied:** 1.5x expected journey length
**Adequate:** 1x expected journey length  
**Risky:** 0.75x expected journey length
**Desperate:** 0.5x or less

## Pacing Advice

### Keep It Moving

- Successful segments = 2-3 minute montage
- Failed segments = 5-10 minute problem-solving
- Complications = 10-20 minute mini-encounter
- Never more than 1 journey roll per 30 minutes of play

### Montage Elements

When narrating successful travel, include 2-3 from:

- Notable landmark or vista
- Weather/temperature shift
- Wildlife encounter (non-threatening)
- Trail conditions/challenges overcome
- Camp moment (story, meal, maintenance)
- Local color (ruins, old battles, regional quirks)

### Making Failure Interesting

Failures should create new adventures, not stop them:

- Lost? Discover something while wandering
- Delayed? What happens because you're late?
- No shelter? Who might help... for a price?
- Blocked path? What detour reveals new opportunities?

## Special Situations

### Competing Groups

When racing another group:

- Both roll each segment
- Track relative progress
- Failures might let rivals pull ahead
- Complications might affect both groups

### Exploration Journeys

When destination is unknown:

- Each segment explores new area
- Success = useful discovery
- Failure = dead end/danger
- Map builds through play

### Pursuit/Chase

- Segments are shorter (hours not days)
- Failure = pursuers gain ground
- Success = increase distance
- Complications often involve close calls

## Quick Scenario Setups

### "Reach the Tower Before Midnight"

- 3 segments (road/forest/mountain)
- CN 6/9/12, failure adds time
- Complications focus on delays
- Track hours not days

### "Cross the Frozen Wastes"

- 5 segments of arctic hell
- CN 15 throughout
- Failures = exposure/supplies
- Complications = ice breaks/predators

### "Find the Lost City"

- 4+ segments of exploration
- CN varies by route chosen
- Success reveals clues
- Each segment is different terrain

## Remember

Journey rules create dramatic travel, not realistic simulation. Focus on:

- Choices that matter
- Consequences that create story
- Resources as tension, not bookkeeping
- Getting to the fun quickly

When in doubt, make travel either matter or montage. Nothing in between.
