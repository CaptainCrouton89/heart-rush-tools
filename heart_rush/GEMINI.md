# Heart Rush: The Comprehensive Player Guide

Heart Rush is a fantasy TTRPG defined by gritty, tactical combat, seamless scaling from personal brawls to empire management, and a "fail-forward" narrative philosophy.

## 1. The Core Mechanics

The game is a conversation until the outcome of an action is uncertain and the consequences matter. Then, the dice decide.

### The Dice Roll
The standard formula for almost every check in the game is:
> **Heart Die + Ability Die + Modifiers vs. Challenge Number (CN)**

*   **Heart Die:** Represents your stamina, spirit, and fighting will. It typically starts at a **d8**. As you take damage or exert yourself to resist effects, you may choose to shrink this die (e.g., d8 → d6) to survive.
*   **Ability Die:** Represents your aptitude.
    *   **Might:** Strength, endurance (e.g., forcing doors, resisting poison).
    *   **Agility:** Dexterity, reflex (e.g., balancing, dodging).
    *   **Cunning:** Intellect, perception (e.g., noticing traps, recalling lore).
    *   **Presence:** Charm, willpower (e.g., lying, intimidating).

### Difficulty (Challenge Numbers)
The GM sets a Target Number (CN) based on difficulty:
*   **6:** Fairly Easy
*   **9:** Average
*   **12:** Hard
*   **15:** Very Hard
*   **18+:** Nearly Impossible

### Advantage & Disadvantage
*   **Advantage (A2, A3...):** Roll extra dice equal to your *lowest* die size involved in the roll. Drop the lowest results.
*   **Disadvantage (D2, D3...):** Roll extra dice equal to your *highest* die size involved in the roll. Drop the highest results.
*   *Note:* Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out.

### The Complication Rule (Rolling a 1)
If you roll a **1** on *any* die during a check:
1.  **Accept Failure:** The action fails simply.
2.  **Accept a Complication:** You may **reroll** the die. If the new total succeeds, you achieve your goal, but a narrative complication occurs (e.g., you pick the lock, but your lockpick snaps; you climb the wall, but a guard hears a pebble fall).

## 2. Character Creation

Your character is built from four pillars: Vitals, Kin, Profession, and Aspects.

### 1. Vitals (Stats)
Assign your Ability Dice to your four stats. Standard array:
*   **Two abilities at d6**
*   **Two abilities at d4**

### 2. Kin & Culture
Choose a race (e.g., Human, Elf, Dwarf, Alekroin, Goblin). This determines your size, physical traits, and gives you unique **Passive Abilities**.

### 3. Professions
Professions represent your background (e.g., Blacksmith, Soldier, Sailor). Instead of a skill list, you apply your **Profession Rank** to checks where your background is relevant.
*   **Direct Application:** Add full Rank (e.g., a Blacksmith forging a sword).
*   **Tangential Application:** Add half Rank (e.g., a Blacksmith identifying ore quality).

### 4. Aspects & Destiny Points
Aspects are short phrases describing your character's personality, flaws, or history (e.g., "Sucker for a Pretty Face", "Veteran of the Void War").
*   **Destiny Points (DP):** A currency used to influence the story. You start sessions with 3.
*   **Invoke Positive:** Spend DP equal to an Aspect's rank to add that rank to a roll.
*   **Invoke Negative:** Accept a penalty or narrative trouble caused by an Aspect to **gain** DP equal to its rank.

## 3. Combat

Combat in Heart Rush is simultaneous and fluid. There are no turns. Instead, rounds are split into the **Action Phase** and the **Engagement Phase**.

### Phase 1: The Action Phase
Players and enemies act freely in real-time logic.
*   **The One Action Limit:** You get **one** major Action per round (e.g., Dash, Attack outside engagement, Sidestep, Help).
*   **Free Abilities:** You can use as many Abilities as you want, provided they don't require an Action or have a cooldown (like "Once per round").
*   **Movement:**
    *   **Dash:** Uses your Action (exception: the first Dash of a round is usually free). Moves your speed.
    *   **Sidestep:** Uses your Action (or 1 Rush Point). Moves 5ft safely without provoking attacks.

### Phase 2: The Engagement
When combatants move into melee range or commit to an attack exchange, they enter an **Engagement**.
1.  **Secretly Choose Stance:** Everyone involved picks Might, Agility, Cunning, or Defensive.
2.  **Simultaneous Reveal:** Everyone reveals at once.
3.  **Resolution:** Stances resolve in a specific order (Rock-Paper-Scissors style).

#### The Stance Triangle
*   **Cunning (Beats Agility):** Resolves first. Precision strikes.
*   **Agility (Beats Might):** Resolves second. Speed and dodging.
*   **Might (Beats Cunning):** Resolves third. Heavy, crushing blows.
*   **Defensive:** You cannot attack. You halve all incoming damage.

**If you beat your opponent's stance:** You likely attack first or gain specific bonuses (e.g., Might stance gets bonus damage vs Cunning).
**If you pick the same stance:** It is a contested roll. Both roll; the winner deals the difference in damage.

### Damage, Wounds, and Death
*   **Hit Points (HP):** Your physical health.
*   **Heart Die Mitigation:** When you take damage, you can choose to decrease your Heart Die size (e.g., d8 -> d6) to **halve the damage**.
*   **Wounds:** If you take **10 or more damage** in a single hit, you take a **Wound**.
    *   Record the specific injury (e.g., "Broken Arm").
    *   **Rank = Damage Taken.**
    *   **Effect:** Your Maximum HP is reduced by the sum of your Wound Ranks. Wounds must be treated with Medicine checks to heal.
*   **Death:** You die if your HP reaches the **negative** equivalent of your max HP.

### Rush Points
You gain Rush Points for momentum in battle (usually by starting rounds engaged or using talents). Spend them to:
*   Use **Minor Abilities** (special moves from your Bloodmarks).
*   **Sidestep** instantly without using an Action.
*   Make **Opportunity Attacks** without using an Action.

## 4. Magic & Attunement

Magic is not a list of spells, but a bond with the nine elements: **Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Light, Dark, Force, Void, Time**.

### 1. Resonate Substances
Depending on your element and attunement level (Basic, Advanced, Paragon), you can shape, create, and destroy physical matter.
*   *Example:* An Earth-attuned mage can mold stone like clay or dig tunnels instantly.

### 2. Cantrips (Magical Weapons)
Cantrips are used in the **Engagement Phase** exactly like weapons. They have no cooldowns.
*   **Bolts:** Ranged attacks.
*   **Blasts:** Melee/Area attacks centered on you.
*   *Stance Bonuses:* Cantrips have unique bonuses for winning the Might stance (e.g., Force bolts push enemies back; Fire bolts inflict Burning).

### 3. Elemental Talents
These are "spells" in the traditional sense—powerful effects bought with XP.
*   *Example:* "Magma Rain" or "Time Stop". These often require an Action or have daily limits.

## 5. Advancement

### Experience Points (XP)
You don't wait for "Level Ups". You spend XP as you earn it to buy upgrades directly:
*   **Increase Stats:** Upgrade a d4 to a d6, etc.
*   **New Talents:** Buy Combat or Non-combat feats.
*   **More HP:** Buy +10 Max HP.
*   **Aspects:** Add new personality traits or upgrade existing ones.

### Bloodmarks
Earned by performing legendary feats in combat (awarded by GM). Bloodmarks are your "Warrior Level".
*   **1st Bloodmark:** Gain a **Specialization** (Passive buff).
*   **2nd-3rd:** Gain **Signature Abilities** (spend Rush Points to activate).
*   **4th:** Gain a **Combat Mastery** (Once-per-day ultimate).
*   **5th:** Gain a **Paragon Ability** (God-tier passive).

## 6. Adventures & Strategy

### Journeys
For dangerous travel, the trip is divided into **Segments**.
1.  **The Roll:** One player rolls **Heart + Ability** against the Terrain CN.
2.  **Success:** Progress is made safely.
3.  **Failure:** A consequence occurs (Lost, Forced March, Ambush).
4.  **Complication (Rolling a 1):** The game zooms in to a specific scene/encounter the players must resolve.

### Stratagems
Used for resolving massive tasks (battles, politics, business) with a single roll.
*   **The Roll:** **d8 + Ability + Profession vs CN.**
*   **Intervention:** Players can "Zoom In" to play out a specific scene (e.g., assassinating the enemy general). Success in the scene lowers the CN for the main Stratagem roll.

### Strongholds
Players can build and upgrade bases (Castles, Libraries, Taverns). Strongholds generate income, provide followers, and grant specific bonuses (e.g., Libraries grant advantage on Lore checks; Fortresses provide soldiers).

### Wealth
Wealth is tracked in tiers: **Iron < Obol < Lire < Ducat < Crown**.
*   **The Rule:** If you possess currency of a higher tier, you **stop tracking** expenses of currencies two tiers below.
*   *Example:* If you have a **Ducat** (Tier 4), you no longer track Iron (Tier 1) or Obol (Tier 2) expenses. They are effectively free.

## 7. Design Philosophy

Heart Rush is an opinionated game. It doesn't try to do everything; it tries to do specific things—dangerous combat, earned heroism, and tangible magic—extremely well. Understanding *why* the rules exist will help you master them.

### The Heart Die is a Bet, Not a Battery
In many games, Hit Points are just a gas tank—you drive until it's empty. In Heart Rush, your **Heart Die** represents your physical and mental limit. When you choose to shrink it to halve damage, you aren't just using a resource; you are making a desperate gamble. You are burning the candle at both ends to survive a lethal blow. The game is designed to make you feel that "terrifying cost." You should feel your character tiring, their options narrowing as the fight drags on.

### Combat is a Psychological Mind Game
If you can autopilot your turn, something has gone wrong. The **Stance System** exists to break the "I hit him, he hits me" cycle. Because resolution is simultaneous, you must read the GM and the narrative. Is the Orc desperate? He might pick *Might* to end it. Is the assassin cautious? She might pick *Cunning*. Every engagement is a split-second read of your opponent's intent.

### Magic is Physics, Not Buttons
Elementalism isn't a list of buttons you press to deal damage. It is a craft. An Earth-attuned mage doesn't "cast Stone Wall"—they physically manipulate the minerals in the ground to rise up. Magic follows rules of logic and physics. It is raw, tangible, and limited by your creativity and the environment, not just by spell slots.

### The Curve of Heroism
You do not start as a superhero. At Rank 0, the world is lethal. A single bandit can kill you. Basic survival (food, warmth) is a challenge. This is intentional.
As you earn **Bloodmarks** and XP, the game shifts genres. By Bloodmark 4 or 5, you are no longer worried about starving; you are worried about armies and dragons. You transition from gritty survival to epic fantasy, but because you lived through the mud and blood of the early levels, that power feels **earned**.

### This Game Has Teeth
Heart Rush is "fail-forward," but failure hurts. Wounds linger. Complications break tools. The world does not scale to your level; if you jump off a cliff, gravity will not be kind. The safety rails are off so that when you *do* succeed—when you slay the dragon or negotiate the peace treaty—you know it wasn't handed to you. You took it.
