## Lizardfolk

The Lizardfolk are an ancient people who walked Alaria long before the rise of the younger races. Their societies evolved in isolation, developing along four distinct paths shaped by the harsh environments they call home. While outsiders often dismiss them as primitive savages, the Lizardfolk possess complex social structures and deep cultural traditions passed down through countless generations.

All Lizardfolk share certain traits: they are cold-blooded, requiring external heat to maintain their energy; they possess scales that provide natural protection; and they view the world through the lens of predator and prey—a perspective that makes them seem alien and cruel to warm-blooded races. Yet this same perspective has allowed them to survive and thrive in some of Alaria's most inhospitable regions.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-7 feet (varies by subrace)
- **Weight:** 120-250 pounds

### Cold-Blooded Metabolism

**Passive ability.**

Your reptilian nature grants you unique advantages and disadvantages. While in warm temperatures (comfortable or hotter), you gain +10 feet to your movement speed and remove one additional level of fading conditions at the start of each round. While in cold temperatures (chilly or colder), your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet and you gain a level of slowed that does not fade until you warm up.

### Ix'Tyrann

The Ix'Tyrann are the most numerous and widespread of the Lizardfolk, dwelling in the swampy regions of Da Trang. Their society is built on strength and brutality, with villages ruled by the strongest chieftains who maintain power through displays of savage might. They are viewed by most civilized races as the embodiment of lizardfolk savagery—a reputation they've earned through centuries of fierce territorial conflicts.

Ix'Tyrann culture values survival above all else. Weakness is not tolerated, and those who cannot contribute to the tribe's strength are cast out or consumed. This harsh philosophy has produced a people who are incredibly resilient but struggle to form alliances with other races. Even those Ix'Tyrann who become adventurers and fight for noble causes are rarely seen as heroes—their methods are simply too brutal for polite society to accept.

Their scales range from muddy brown to dark green, providing natural camouflage in their swampy homes. Battle scars are worn with pride, each one a testament to survival.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds

### Aspects

- Views everything as predator or prey
- Values strength above mercy

### Savage Ferocity

**Passive ability.**

Your brutal fighting style makes you deadlier but also more vulnerable. Whenever you deal damage with an attack, add 2 to the damage dealt. However, whenever you take damage from any source, increase that damage by 2. Additionally, when you would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you may instead choose to reduce them to 1 hit point and inflict one of the following permanent conditions: blinded, deafened, or reduce their movement speed by half.

### Ix'Vasyla

The black-scaled Ix'Vasyla are the assassins and hunters of the Lizardfolk, evolved in the toxic marshlands of Nashua. Sleeker and taller than their Ix'Tyrann cousins, they possess a deadly elegance that belies their lethal nature. Their most feared trait is their venomous bite—even a small nip delivers toxins that cause days of excruciating pain before finally killing the victim.

Trapped in an endless war against the forces of Trømgar and Gorath, the Ix'Vasyla have refined patience into an art form. They strike from shadows, deliver their poisonous bite, then retreat to let their venom do its work. Their society values cunning over raw strength, and their leaders are chosen for their ability to outmaneuver enemies rather than overpower them.

Their distinctive black scales shimmer with an oily iridescence, and their jaws can unhinge like those of serpents, allowing them to swallow prey whole. This has given rise to terrifying tales among their enemies of entire scouts disappearing without a trace.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 6-7 feet
- **Weight:** 120-180 pounds

### Aspects

- Patient and calculating
- Takes pleasure in the hunt

### Venomous Bite

**Heart ability.**

Your bite delivers a potent neurotoxin that causes excruciating pain. When you make an unarmed attack against an adjacent creature, you may choose to bite instead. If your attack hits, the target takes normal damage plus 2 levels of poisoned. Additionally, at the start of each of their turns for the next minute, they take 1d4 damage from the lingering venom. A creature can only be affected by one instance of your venom at a time.

### Ix'Lorett

In the temperate forests of M'Svyla, the Ix'Lorett have evolved along a vastly different path from their warlike cousins. These iguana-like Lizardfolk move with deliberate slowness, their wrinkled scales and soft spines giving them an almost ancient appearance. Yet what they lack in speed and aggression, they make up for in wisdom and an incredible regenerative ability.

Ix'Lorett society centers around art, meditation, and the pursuit of inner peace. Their villages in the Crystal Mountains are adorned with intricate gemstone mosaics and painted murals that tell the stories of their people. They are philosophers and artists, spending decades perfecting a single painting or meditating on the nature of existence.

Their regenerative abilities are legendary—lost limbs regrow over months, wounds that would kill other races merely inconvenience them. This has led to a unique perspective on violence and conflict; when you can regrow from almost any injury, the urgency of combat fades. Many Ix'Lorett who become adventurers do so not for glory or wealth, but to see the world's beauty and understand its deeper meanings.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 150-250 pounds

### Aspects

- Contemplative and peaceful
- Values beauty and patience

### Regenerative Vitality

**Passive ability.**

Your body possesses remarkable regenerative properties. At the start of each round in combat, if you have taken any wounds, reduce the rank of one wound by 1. During a long rest, reduce the ranks of all your wounds by an additional 2 (3 total). Additionally, if you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows over the course of 2d6 months. You cannot die from bleeding out—if you would die from negative hit points, you instead stabilize at -1 hit point.

### Ix'Meglyakuk

Deep in the Dygon Beastlands, where massive dinosaurs thunder through ancient jungles and every shadow could hide a predator, the Ix'Meglyakuk have evolved to be the ultimate survivors. These Lizardfolk have developed heightened senses and an almost supernatural ability to navigate their dangerous homeland.

Living among creatures that dwarf them in size and strength, the Ix'Meglyakuk have learned that survival requires more than combat prowess—it demands an understanding of the jungle itself. They can read the slightest changes in bird calls, feel vibrations through the earth that warn of approaching titans, and move through the densest undergrowth without disturbing a single leaf.

Their scales shift between green and brown, providing active camouflage, and their eyes can track movement that others would miss. Ix'Meglyakuk who leave the Beastlands often become unparalleled scouts and guides, though they find the "tame" dangers of civilization almost laughably simple compared to their homeland.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 130-190 pounds

### Aspects

- Hyperaware of surroundings
- Respects nature's power

### Beastland Survivor

**Passive ability.**

Your life among titanic predators has honed your survival instincts to a supernatural degree. You have advantage on all perception checks and cannot be surprised. When you take the dodge action or choose the agility stance, you may move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks—this movement represents your instinctive repositioning. Additionally, you can perfectly mimic the sounds of any beast you've heard, and you always know which direction is north.
