## Valkyries

The Valkyries are majestic beings who serve as self-appointed arbiters of life and death, traveling between the material plane and the astral realm to guide the souls of worthy warriors to their final rest. These winged humanoids with their armor of starlight and weapons forged from celestial steel see themselves as guardians of cosmic justice, though their definition of justice often conflicts with mortal understanding.

Standing taller than most humans with wings that shimmer with astral energy, Valkyries possess an otherworldly beauty tempered by the weight of their duties. They view mortal conflicts from a perspective that transcends individual lives, concerning themselves with the greater balance between good and evil, order and chaos. This detachment can make them seem cold or condescending to those they judge.

Valkyrie society operates on strict codes of honor and duty, with each Valkyrie assigned to watch over specific regions or types of conflicts. They intervene only when they deem the cosmic balance is threatened, leading many mortals to view them as capricious despite their rigid adherence to celestial law.

### Astral Wings

**Passive ability.**
You possess wings made of solidified astral energy that grant you a fly speed of 30 feet. Once per day, you can shift partially into the astral plane for 1 minute, gaining resistance to all physical damage but vulnerability to psychic damage. You can see and interact with spirits and ghosts at all times.

### Death's Arbiter

**Major ability.**
Your role as a guide between life and death grants you power over both. When a creature within 60 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, you may instantly judge their worthiness. Choose one:

- If worthy: The creature stabilizes at 1 hit point and gains immunity to death for 1 hour
- If unworthy: The creature immediately fails one death save
- If neutral: You learn the creature's most heroic and most villainous acts

You can use this ability once per combat, and your judgment cannot be reversed by any means.
