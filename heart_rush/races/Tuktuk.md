## Tuktuk

The Tuktuk are a warrior culture of turtle-folk who have claimed the volcanic island of Tyvern as their ancestral home. Their thick, naturally armored shells and stocky builds make them nearly indestructible in battle, while their fierce code of honor drives them to seek glory through combat and conquest. These rugged fighters believe that strength must be proven repeatedly through trial by combat and dangerous undertakings.

Tuktuk society revolves around martial prowess and clan loyalty, with disputes settled through formal duels and leadership earned through demonstrations of courage in battle. Their island home has shaped them into excellent seafarers and raiders, though they prefer stand-up fights to sneaky tactics. Young Tuktuk must prove themselves through a series of increasingly dangerous challenges before they are accepted as full warriors.

The volcanic forges of Tyvern produce some of the finest weapons and armor in the known world, as the Tuktuk have learned to work volcanic glass and rare metals found only near active lava flows. Their settlements are built to withstand both enemy assault and the frequent volcanic activity that shapes their homeland.
