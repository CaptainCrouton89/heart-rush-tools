## Elf

Elves are a race of fiercely independent, ancient, culturally rich people. With lifespans five times the length of a humans', elves have a much broader perspective on life and the world around them, and a lot more time to explore and refine their passions. Wars, politics, and the frivolities of other races are far less important to most elven cultures.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Amverela (High Elf)

The Amverela are the most prolific and long-living of the elves, and most interactive with the other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long life times, but especially due to their extreme wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are some of the longest running ethnic identities among all people on Alaria—having survived numerous cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while remaining relatively culturally intact.

They place a higher value on investing in themselves, their relationships, and their communities. This has led them to building some of the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by most standards.

The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects of life.

#### Aspects

- Centuries of wisdom
- Cautious

#### Expertise

**Passive ability.**
Choose one:

- The XP cost of gaining martial talents and their destiny levels decreases by 2.
- The XP cost of gaining cognitive talents and their destiny levels decreases by 2.

### Caerene (Wood Elf)

The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them to more easily blend into the forests in which they usually live.

Caerene are far more isolating than many other races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial, day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of hiding and blending in with their natural surroundings. An unobservant individual walking through the middle of a Caerene village may not even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the Caerene.

Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and immediate justice. There are no second chances in Caerene culture.

#### Aspects

- Perceptive and stealthy
- Nature is my home

#### Warden of the Wilds

**Passive ability.**
You may ignore non-magical difficult terrain, your move speed is increased by 20 when not wearing heavy armor, and you have A2 on all skill checks relating to nature, survival, and stealth in the outdoors.

### Vyko (Astral Elf)

The Vyko are elves who have traversed the planar envelope protecting Alaria from the void beyond. Their skin is a deep purplish indigo, speckled with white points like distant stars, and their hair is either brilliant white or deep black. They possess an incredibly powerful presence that commands attention the moment they enter a room.

These elves reside north of Gorath, having returned from their cosmic journeys with a fundamentally altered perspective on time and existence. Their experience beyond the material plane has granted them both incredible presence and a patience that can seem frustrating to shorter-lived races.

#### Aspects

- Cosmic wanderer
- Time moves differently for me

#### Imperial Presence

**Passive ability.**
Whenever making a presence check, if you did not roll a failure or complication, you may choose to instead use your heart challenge number as the result. You are immune to the frightened condition.

#### Cosmic Mindset

**Passive ability.**
You are used to life traveling at a very slow rate. You have disadvantage on all ability checks made while under a time crunch, and advantage on all ability checks made with no time limitations.

### Eloweir (Sea Elf)

The Eloweir, called sea elves by other races, are a proud and capable people deeply connected to the oceans. They build bustling coastal cities with incredible architecture full of swooping curves and circular designs that mirror the flow of water and tides.

The Eloweir are renowned across Alaria for their mastery of poisons, their skilled soldiers, their natural attunement to water magic, and their sophisticated democratic governance. Their societies are as fluid and adaptive as the seas they call home.

#### Aspects

- Child of the tides
- Democratic ideals

#### Sea Blood

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to water, but only saltwater. You can breathe underwater and your swim speed is increased by 30 feet while in saltwater.

### Teflin (Blood Elf)

The Teflin reside in Hik, their reddish skin marking them as a people touched by an ancient curse. Blood is sacred to their culture, as an old Deoric enchantment runs through their veins—a curse that traded immortality for power, but at a terrible cost.

The curse builds up in their blood over time, and if allowed to accumulate too much, it will kill them. To manage this, the Teflin practice ritual bloodletting to relieve the curse's pressure. In exchange for this constant sacrifice, they gain power proportional to their suffering.

#### Aspects

- Blood is my burden and strength
- Cursed heritage

#### Crimson Sacrifice

**Passive ability.**
You may voluntarily reduce your current hit points by any amount as an action. For every 10 hit points you sacrifice this way, gain +1 to all attack rolls until your next long rest. These bonuses stack but are lost if you regain hit points above your pre-sacrifice total.

### Kuzagt (Bone Elf)

The Kuzagt, also known as Bone Elves, are tall and spindly elves with distinctive bony protrusions extending from their high cheekbones. Their angular features and slanted eyes give them a skull-like appearance that many find unsettling. They inhabit the salt flats of Bonnetaz, where they maintain vast human slave camps.

The Kuzagt see humans as invaders and poachers on Alaria's beauty, viewing nothing wrong with using them to further elven purposes. They wear robes made from human leather, drink fermented blood, and embed jewels into their skulls to denote rank within their oligarchical council system.

#### Aspects

- Humans are lesser beings
- Death holds no terror

#### Bone Deep Cruelty

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on intimidation checks against humanoids. When you deal damage to a humanoid that would cause a wound, you may increase the wound's rank by 2.

### Nemo (Lost Ones)

The Nemo are the ghostly descendants of Caerene elves who sought to achieve immortality and perfect oneness with the forest. Instead of transcendence, they eternally bound their souls to the Eros forests, becoming trapped spirits who can never truly die while the forest lives, but can never truly live again either.

These spectral elves are cold, bitter, and wise, having spent millennia isolated in their forest prison. Their failed pursuit of perfection serves as a warning about the dangers of reaching too far beyond mortal limitations.

#### Aspects

- Trapped between life and death
- Millennia of bitter wisdom

#### Ghostly Form

**Passive ability.**
You are incorporeal and can move through solid objects, but cannot interact with physical objects without concentrating (requiring an action). You are immune to physical damage but vulnerable to magical damage. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.

### Kryaaji (Sun Elf)

The Kryaaji dwell in Enuau Kemjallb, the radiant House of the Sun, a golden palace forbidden to all visitors. They believe their light and home are too pure to be soiled by outsiders, maintaining strict isolation not from arrogance, but from a sense of sacred duty.

These elves train the magnificent Wysynnbre—golden, luminant eagles that nest in the nearby Sunwing Peaks. They maintain their own sect of the Order of Bryn, believing Bryn to be an elf rather than human as others claim. Their Lightbearer priests are easily recognized by the sunlight that radiates from their eye sockets.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred light
- Isolated guardian of purity

#### Radiant Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to light. You can cause bright light to emanate from your body in a 15-foot radius and dim light 15 feet beyond that. This light dispels magical darkness and you can control it at will.

### Istori (Winter Elf)

The Istori are typically kind, benevolent, and regal elves who have traditionally secluded themselves in the northern reaches of Istora. They believed it more peaceful to remain alone than deal with the world's constant turmoil and conflicts.

However, their isolation has not protected them from strife, as they now find themselves locked in internal revolution. The very peace they sought to preserve has been shattered by ideological divisions within their own society.

#### Aspects

- Regal but embattled
- Seeker of lost peace

#### Winter's Resilience

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to cold damage and ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would slow you or reduce your movement speed.

### Sivakr (Silver Elf)

The Sivakr are gray-skinned elves who typically dwell underground in the realm of Myorna. In their society, physical exercise is considered vulgar and ugly—social relevance is determined entirely by influence gained through mental acuity and intellectual prowess.

The Sivakr possess a remarkable ability to manipulate memory, which they demonstrate in formal memory duels. These ritualistic contests involve two elves standing face-to-face with arms outstretched and fingers interlocked, each attempting to alter the other's memories to convince them they made a mistake in accepting the challenge.

#### Aspects

- Mind over matter
- Memory is malleable

#### Memory Plant

**Major ability.**
You may spend 20 hit points to alter the thoughts and memories of a non-hostile creature that you touch. You may replace up to one minute's worth of memories made by that creature from the last week with whatever memories you wish. They are unaware of any magic occurring.

### Starborn (Star Elf)

The Starborn are the enigmatic caretakers of the celestial order, dwelling in high mountain observatories where the veil between earth and sky grows thin. These elves have taken upon themselves the sacred duty of maintaining the stars' positions and brightness—a task they believe essential to preserving the cosmic balance that keeps darker forces at bay. Their skin has a subtle luminescence that becomes more pronounced under starlight, and their eyes reflect the constellations they tend.

Unlike their druidic cousins who immerse themselves in nature's wild passions, the Starborn maintain strict neutrality in worldly affairs. They view existence from a cosmic perspective where individual lives and even civilizations are but brief flickers against the eternal night. This detachment makes them seem cold to other races, but it stems from their burden of maintaining universal harmony rather than any lack of compassion.

The Starborn conduct nightly rituals to guide wayward stars back to their proper courses and rekindle those whose light begins to fade. They believe that should the stars ever fall from their appointed places, chaos would consume all creation.

#### Aspects

- The stars must maintain their course
- Cosmic neutrality preserves balance

#### Stellar Navigation

**Passive ability.**
You can always see the stars, even during daylight or through cloud cover, granting you perfect directional sense and making you impossible to disorient. You have advantage on all navigation checks and can determine your exact location by observing the sky for one minute.

Additionally, once per night while under an open sky, you may commune with the stars to gain cosmic insight. Ask one question about events occurring anywhere in the world within the last 24 hours. The stars provide a cryptic but truthful answer through their movements and brightness.

### Dark Elves (Shadow Elf)

The Dark Elves are an extinct lineage that once ruled the southern forests of Aboyuinzu as dragon riders of terrifying power. Their ashen gray skin and coal-black eyes marked them as a people touched by draconic magic, while their heavy furs protected them from the perpetual chill that followed in their wake. These elves formed soul-bonds with the great wyrms of the south, sharing consciousness with their mounts in a symbiosis that made them nearly invincible in battle.

Their civilization came to an abrupt end during the Dragon Purge, when rival nations united to destroy both the dark elves and their dragon allies. The forests of Aboyuinzu are now filled with towering totems to the old dragon gods—massive stone monuments that still radiate faint draconic power. Some say the dark elves' spirits linger near these totems, waiting for the day when dragons might return to the world.

Though believed extinct, there are whispers of dark elf bloodlines persisting in remote communities, their draconic heritage diluted but not entirely lost. Those who discover such ancestry often feel an inexplicable pull toward the ancient totems and may even hear the whispered words of long-dead dragons in their dreams.

#### Aspects

- Dragons' blood calls to dragons' blood
- The old ways demand remembrance

#### Draconic Echo

**Major ability.**
Though the true dragon bonds died with your ancestors, you retain a shadow of their power. Once per day, you may touch one of your people's ancient dragon totems (or any draconic artifact) to channel the lingering spirit within. For the next hour, you gain:

- The ability to speak and understand Draconic
- Resistance to one damage type associated with dragons (choose when activating)
- +2 to intimidation checks as draconic presence radiates from you
- Brief visions of the totem's history and the dragon it honors

If you are one of the few with true dark elf blood (work with your GM), you can use this ability without a totem once per week, manifesting faint dragon wings that grant a glide speed of 30 feet (fall at 10 feet per round) for the duration.

### Ythari (Moss Elf)

The Ythari are forest dwellers whose very beings have merged with the woodland essence. Their skin bears the deep green of forest canopies with distinctive flecks of black and brown that shift like dappled sunlight through leaves. These patterns change subtly with the seasons, becoming more brown in autumn and taking on hints of white during winter months. Their culture revolves around extreme generosity—status is measured not by what one owns but by what one has given away.

The Ythari speak sparingly, believing that words spent carelessly are gifts wasted. When they do speak, each word is chosen with the same care they use when selecting a gift. Their communities practice radical sharing where personal property barely exists; tools, homes, and even meals flow freely between community members based on need.

Most distinctively, Ythari families adopt wild animals as mentors for their children. Each child is paired with a creature whose temperament and skills complement what the child needs to learn. A timid child might be paired with a bold badger, while an impulsive one might learn patience from a turtle. These animal mentors live freely but visit regularly, forming bonds that last lifetimes.

#### Aspects

- Generosity is the highest virtue
- Actions speak where words fail

#### Gift of the Forest

**Heart ability.**
Your connection to nature and culture of giving manifests in supernatural ways. When you give away something of personal value (worth at least 10 ducats or of significant sentimental importance), you may invoke the Gift of the Forest. Choose one:

- **Silent Step**: You and up to 6 allies within 30 feet gain the ability to move without making any sound for the next hour. During this time, you automatically succeed on stealth checks related to moving quietly.
- **Animal Mentor**: Summon the spirit of your childhood animal mentor. It appears and aids you for 10 minutes, fighting alongside you with the stats of a Beast Companion but incorporeal (immune to physical damage, can't manipulate objects).
- **Nature's Reciprocity**: The forest provides what you need most. The GM determines what appears, but it will be something that helps your current situation—healing herbs if wounded, clean water if thirsty, or shelter if exposed.

Additionally, you can communicate basic concepts with any animal through gestures and body language, though complex ideas remain beyond this communication.

### Rakiten (Plains Elf)

The Rakiten tower above other elven lineages, their extraordinary height evolved over millennia to see over the endless grass seas of their homeland. Standing seven to eight feet tall with bronze skin that gleams like burnished metal in sunlight, they cut imposing figures on the rare occasions they venture beyond their plains. Their faces are distinctively flat with angular, somewhat square features, and their sharp teeth speak to a more carnivorous diet than their woodland cousins—a necessity when plant matter is scarce during the dry seasons.

What truly sets the Rakiten apart is their complete abandonment of spoken language. Whether due to the way sound carries unpredictably across the windswept plains or some ancient cultural trauma, the Rakiten communicate exclusively through an intricate sign language that incorporates hand movements, body positioning, and facial expressions. This visual language is so sophisticated it can convey complex philosophical concepts and poetry with greater nuance than spoken words. Even their names are signs rather than sounds—a flowing gesture rather than a collection of syllables.

The Rakiten organize their society around "sight-bonds"—groups of individuals who maintain visual contact while traveling the plains. These bonds become so attuned to each other that they can communicate through subtle shifts in posture visible at great distances. Their encampments are arranged in careful patterns that allow for maximum visual communication between all members, creating communities where a single gesture can ripple through the entire population in moments.

#### Aspects

- Silence speaks volumes
- Height grants perspective in all things

#### Silent Speech

**Passive ability.**
You are fluent in Rakiten Sign Language, which allows for completely silent communication with perfect clarity at any distance where you can see the speaker's hands and body. This language is so efficient that you can convey complex information faster than spoken language—any social skill check that relies on communication takes half the usual time when conducted in sign language with willing participants.

Additionally, your extraordinary height and visual acuity grant you the following benefits:

- You can see clearly up to 3 miles in flat terrain, and can make out details (like hand signals) at up to 1 mile
- You have advantage on perception checks to spot things at a distance
- In combat, your reach with melee weapons increases by 5 feet due to your height
- You can communicate basic tactical information (danger, direction, numbers) instantly to any ally who can see you, even in the midst of combat, without using any action

### Xalahir (Blood Elf)

The Xalahir are a cursed lineage of elves who long ago traded their connection to nature for immortal hunger. Where other elves' eyes shine with inner light, the Xalahir's are pools of absolute darkness, sunken deep into their pale, porcelain faces. Despite this horrific feature, they possess an otherworldly beauty that enchants and mesmerizes, drawing victims close enough for the Xalahir to feed. Their movements are fluid and hypnotic, their voices like silk, and their presence commands attention in any room.

Unlike common vampires who establish lairs and territories, the Xalahir are eternal wanderers, driven by both hunger and an ancient compulsion to never remain in one place. They arrive in settlements as mysterious strangers—perhaps a traveling merchant, a wandering minstrel, or a noble passing through—and systematically feed on the population before vanishing into the night. By the time their victims realize what has happened, the Xalahir is already three towns away, leaving only drained bodies and whispered warnings in their wake.

The Xalahir view other beings as nothing more than elegant wine bottles to be sampled and discarded. They feel no guilt for their predations, seeing emotional attachment as a weakness that their transformation freed them from. Their immortal existence is one of refined hedonism, seeking out the finest blood like sommeliers pursuing rare vintages. They particularly prize the blood of other elves, claiming it retains notes of the natural harmony they themselves have lost.

#### Aspects

- Mortals are merely vessels for my sustenance
- Beauty conceals the deepest horrors

#### Enchanting Predator

**Major ability.**
Your vampiric nature grants you tools to hunt among civilized prey. You possess an unnatural magnetism that makes others want to trust and confide in you, despite the wrongness in your sunken black eyes.

- You have advantage on all Presence checks to persuade, deceive, or seduce creatures that can see and hear you
- Once per long rest, when you touch a humanoid, you may subtly feed on their life force. They must make a presence saving throw against your presence challenge number or become charmed by you for 10 minutes. While charmed this way, they will not notice or remember you feeding on them
- When you successfully feed (either through this ability or by dealing damage with a bite attack), you heal hit points equal to your heart die and remove one level of any condition affecting you
- You have darkvision out to 30 feet, allowing you to hunt in darkness
- However, you must feed on humanoid blood at least once per week or gain a level of weakened that doesn't fade until you feed
