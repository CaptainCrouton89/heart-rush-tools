## Fallen Angels

The Fallen Angels are celestial beings cast down from their eternal war among the stars, their wings clipped as punishment for bringing their conflict to the mortal realm. Once, the light-born Sarakiel and shadow-born Xaphkiel waged their battles in the heavens, but their violence grew so extreme that it threatened to rain destruction upon the world below. The cosmic powers that govern the planes intervened, stripping both sides of their ability to fly and banishing them to walk among the mortals they once ignored.

Now these proud beings struggle to adapt to terrestrial life, their magnificent wings reduced to painful reminders of lost glory. The Sarakiel and Xaphkiel continue their ancient hatred even in exile, though they must now fight with mortal limitations. Their clipped wings still possess some power—able to slow falls and channel their respective elements—but true flight remains forever beyond their reach.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 120

### Clipped Wings

**Passive ability.**
You possess magnificent wings that have been mystically severed from true flight. Your wings grant you the following benefits:
- You can glide 20 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall
- You take half damage from falling
- Your wings can produce bright light (Sarakiel) or absorb light creating darkness (Xaphkiel) in a 15-foot radius, which you can activate or suppress at will
- The scars where your wings were clipped cause constant pain, granting you advantage on saves against being charmed (you're too bitter to be easily swayed)

### Sarakiel (Light-Fallen)

The Sarakiel maintain their belief in absolute purity even in exile, viewing their banishment as a temporary setback in their righteous war. Their pale skin and luminous eyes still mark them as beings of light, though the radiance is dimmed by their fall. These angels create small enclaves of "perfection" wherever they settle, excluding all they deem impure—which is essentially everyone except other Sarakiel.

Their communities are austere and rigid, following thousands of rules designed to maintain their fading connection to the light. They practice constant rituals of purification, believing that sufficient devotion might one day restore their wings and allow them to return to their celestial towers. The Sarakiel view all other races with barely concealed disgust, seeing mortals as the mud they've been forced to walk upon.

#### Aspects

- Purity through isolation and supremacy
- The flawed deserve only exile or death

#### Light Attuned

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to light as a racial feature. Your attacks can be infused with radiant energy—once per combat, when you hit with an attack, you may blind the target for one round (they have disadvantage on attacks and can't make opportunity attacks). Additionally, you have resistance to radiant damage and advantage on saves against being blinded.

### Xaphkiel (Shadow-Fallen)

The Xaphkiel have embraced their fall as the ultimate expression of their philosophy—through suffering comes enlightenment. Their dark wings and obsidian eyes remain unchanged, but now they walk among the mortals they once viewed from afar. These dark angels have established hidden sanctuaries where they practice their arts of pain and endurance, viewing their exile as merely another trial to overcome.

Where the Sarakiel isolate themselves out of disgust, the Xaphkiel integrate into mortal society to better understand suffering in all its forms. They work as torturers, surgeons, and confessors—any role that allows them to witness or inflict pain in pursuit of truth. Their communities are bound by shared ordeals, each member bearing scars that tell stories of their journey toward enlightenment.

#### Aspects

- Through suffering comes strength
- Pain reveals all truths

#### Shadow Born

**Passive ability.**
You have a basic attunement to darkness as a racial feature. When in dim light or darkness, you regenerate 2 hit points at the start of each round. Once per combat, you can wrap yourself in shadows, gaining obscurement for one round (attacks against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on stealth checks). However, bright light causes you discomfort—you have disadvantage on perception checks in bright light.
