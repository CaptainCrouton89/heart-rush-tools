## Naga

The Naga are the descendants of Nagatayora, the mighty dragon-father who fell in battle against the titan Hykravones. When Nagatayora's burning blood fell to earth, it transformed those it touched, imbuing them with a spark of draconic power that has been passed down through generations. All Naga carry this legacy within them, though it manifests differently among their various bloodlines.

At the core of every Naga is the potential for transformation - the ability to partially assume the form of their draconic ancestor. This gift comes with both power and responsibility, as the passionate nature of dragonkind burns within their hearts. The Naga have developed rich cultures of art, philosophy, and religious tradition, all touched by their inherent pride and determination.

### Nagakani (Scale Riders)

The Nagakani, known to outsiders as Scale Riders, have built their civilization in the harsh peaks of the Lyagnadarr Mountains. These dragon-blooded warriors have formed an unbreakable bond with the giant lizards that inhabit their mountain homes, developing a culture that blends draconic pride with mounted warfare.

At the heart of their empire lies an ancient orange dragon who has commanded them to spread their dominion across the world. The Nagakani have interpreted this decree as a holy crusade, establishing mountain fortresses and patrolling the borders of their ever-expanding territory. They see themselves as crusader knights of a draconic order, destined to bring the world under their scaled banner.

Their discovery of ancient tombs in the nearby deserts has only reinforced their belief in their divine mandate. They believe that when the time comes for the final conquest, their dragon lord will descend from the mountains to lead them personally into glorious battle.

#### Aspects

- Conquest is our divine mandate
- My mount and I fight as one

#### Lizard Rider Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have formed a mystical bond with a giant riding lizard (use riding horse statistics but with a climb speed of 20 feet and +2 natural armor). Your mount shares your initiative and can attack during the same engagement without requiring a separate action. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new lizard after spending 7 days in ritual mourning and meditation.

While transformed via Draconic Awakening, you may breathe fire as your mount's attack during an engagement, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone (once per transformation).

### Nagashi (Dragonheart)

The Nagashi represent the most common expression of draconic heritage among the Naga peoples. Found across Alaria in great numbers, they have integrated into countless societies while maintaining their distinctive pride and passion. Their scales manifest in subtle patterns across their skin - sometimes only visible in certain light - marking them as carriers of Nagatayora's legacy.

Nagashi communities are centers of art, learning, and philosophical debate. They approach every endeavor with the burning intensity of their draconic blood, whether crafting a masterpiece, engaging in scholarly pursuit, or seeking vengeance for wrongs done to their kin. This passion makes them both inspiring allies and terrifying enemies.

Their transformation is perhaps the purest expression of their heritage - a direct channeling of Nagatayora's fury that served him in his final battle. The Nagashi see this ability not as a tool but as a sacred trust, a reminder of their ancestor's sacrifice and their duty to live with the same unwavering determination.

#### Aspects

- Boiling vengeance
- Excellence demands total commitment

#### Dragon's Fury

**Passive ability.**
Your connection to Nagatayora's final rage grants you exceptional resilience and fighting spirit. You take half damage from fire. Additionally, while transformed via Draconic Awakening:

- You may breathe fire once per transformation, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone
- You gain a level of advantage on attack rolls agaisnt the source of your enragement, per level of enraged.
