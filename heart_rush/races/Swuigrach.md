## Swuigrach

The Swuigrach are large, imposing humanoids with the heads of pigs—pink, gray, or black depending on their lineage. These cunning and ambitious beings have turned what many would consider a disadvantage into a source of power, becoming some of the most successful merchants, aristocrats, and power brokers in the United Free Nations and the Free Isles.

Their porcine features—snouts, small eyes, and bristly hair—bely razor-sharp intellects focused primarily on the acquisition of wealth and power. Swuigrach culture values cunning over strength, wealth over honor, and results over methods. They see greed not as a vice but as the primary virtue that drives progress and civilization forward.

Despite their often unsavory reputations, the Swuigrach have created some of the most sophisticated financial institutions and trade networks in Alaria. Their ability to smell out profitable opportunities—both literally and figuratively—has made them indispensable to the economy of many nations, even as they are personally reviled.

### Nose for Trouble and Treasure

This supernatural business sense also grants you advantage on checks to detect lies specifically about money, trade, or business dealings.
