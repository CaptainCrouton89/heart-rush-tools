## Swordsmen

The Swordsmen are an enigmatic seafaring people who share a mystical bond with swordfish and other oceanic predators. Their bronze skin bears faint scale patterns that shimmer in sunlight, and their eyes shift between human roundness and the predatory slits of sea hunters depending on their emotional state. Webbed fingers and toes mark them as children of both land and sea.

Living primarily in the treacherous Drifting Isles, the Swordsmen navigate deadly waters that would spell doom for larger vessels. Their swift outrigger canoes dance between the shifting sandbars and hidden reefs with supernatural grace, guided by their connection to the great swordfish that swim alongside them. This same connection extends to sharks, barracuda, and other hunting fish who recognize the Swordsmen as kindred spirits.

Many Swordsmen who leave their island homes become pirates, using their unparalleled knowledge of dangerous waters to evade pursuit. Their tribes often provide sanctuary to these seafaring rogues, as no naval force dares chase them into the labyrinthine Drifting Isles.

### Predator's Bond

**Major ability.**
You can communicate telepathically with predatory sea creatures within 100 feet. Once per day, you can summon a school of predatory fish (or a single large predator if in appropriate waters) to aid you for 10 minutes. These creatures will scout, deliver messages, or fight alongside you but won't sacrifice themselves.

Additionally, you can hold your breath for 30 minutes and have a swim speed of 40 feet. Your sword techniques mirror the movements of swordfishâ€”when wielding any sword, you gain +1 to attack rolls and can attack creatures up to 10 feet away as your blade seems to extend like a swordfish's bill.
