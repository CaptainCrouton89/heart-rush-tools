### Drasnian (Stout Dwarf)

Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and by far most populous of the dwarven heritages, dating back to before the Uline dwarves went underground. Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and live almost exclusively above ground or in homes built into hillsides. They have a long history of both prosperity and destitution, and through economic trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement, have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as in several countries where Drasnians have settled down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the believed birthplace of the Drasnians.

As a whole, they value education, money, and preserving their cultural and religious legacy. Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating worship, relationships, and one's day-to-day life.

#### Aspects

- Good with money and numbers
- I will do my duty

#### Alert

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on all cunning checks to determine if someone has bad intentions. When combat begins, you may use treat your initiative roll as its maximum value.

In addition, you gain the perceptive talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have).

### Uline (Chain Dwarf)

The Uline originated from a particularly productive iron mine, many thousands of years ago. The mine, which had struck a rich vein of ore was so vast and deep that it would inevitably take more than a generation to complete. Rather than journey to and from the surface daily, they discovered that it was more efficient to temporarily station some dwarves within the mines for days, or even weeks at a time. With time, these temporary stations became more permanent residencies, and eventually, entire settlements. These dwarves became the Uline—named after the settlement that grew up in that first mine. Today, the Uline are the most industrious of the dwarves, preferring to live underground, mining, and making their homes in the mountains beneath the surface.

Living underground came with several unexpected effects, that the Uline now embrace or have adapted to. Beneath the surface, there are few people who can interfere with a settlement's growth. Defense from invaders is easier when underground, which has allowed the Uline to allocate more resources towards magnificent palaces, inventions, and other intellectual efforts. Additionally, within a single generation, the number of earth attuned individuals increased drastically, enhancing the population's ability to mine and control their environment underground.

However, underground life also came with several hardships. Fish, fungi, and insects are nearly the only things alive besides the monsters from the deep, and little airflow and high temperatures deep underground require complex air circulation systems in place. The Uline have gotten around this latter problem by implementing networks of air vents leading to the surface, manipulated through long chains, giving them their nickname of chain dwarves.

Even more difficult to deal with were the shadereavers and other monstrosities from the dark. While the Aureum dwarves invented huge mirrored passageways into the depths of the caves, using the sun's light to protect themselves from the creatures of the dark, the Uline resorted to iron. To this day, children are taught from a young age how to wield the heavy iron blades and hammers used to defend themselves from the monsters of the dark.

Living underground has shaped the Uline into a rough, tough, and pragmatic group, but they are usually goodnatured, and even sometimes downright jolly. However, it is unwise to get into an argument with most Uline; the Uline have done things in the same way for thousands of years, and change is not something many of them are welcome to. When disagreement does arise, arbitrage usually falls on higher ranking individuals within the community, who will have final say.

#### Aspects

- Stubborn to a fault
- I respect true authority

#### Mountain-born

**Passive ability.**
You gain your choice of a basic attunement to earth or darkness.

### Aureum (Sun Dwarf)

In the early days of the Uline, when no more than a few underground settlements existed, an upwelling of shadereavers from deep below nearly wiped out the underground population. Immediately, multiple factions emerged proposing different ways to avoid such catastrophes in the future. One of these such factions determined that nothing but the light of the sun could shield them from such monstrosities, and swore to find a way to brings the sun's light into the depths of the Uline caves. While many of the Uline thought this was impossible, and rejected the idea, some latched on, and the Aureum were born.

The Aureum use complex systems of mirrors and glass to illuminate their underground settlements with the warm glow of sunlight. Within a few more centuries, they had also discovered the secret to storing liquid sunlight, keeping them safe even when night came. Now, this liquid sunlight is smelted into much of their armor and weapons, and keeps them strong, and as they now believe, pure.

Aureum culture emphasizes law, honor, and truth. When the Aureum first broke away from the Uline, their leader, Aurea herself, promised to keep her people safe, so long as her followers trusted her, and followed her commands. They did, and she carried through—permanently cementing the importance of a promise and following one's leader.

#### Aspects

- The law comes first
- My word is my bond

#### Sunsmith

**Major ability.**
As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun's rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for any one of the following abilities:

- **Health and Rejuvenation:** As an interact action, you may drink the flask and gain the benefits of a short rest.
- **Smash:** As an interact action, you may crush or throw your flask to cast Blinding Sun.

Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise or sunset to capture the sun's rays. The sunlight within a flask expires after 12 hours.

Looking at the provided template and the brief descriptions, I'll create dwarven subraces that follow the established format and fit within the Heart Rush mechanical framework. Each will have lore, two aspects, and a racial ability.

### Glorindian (Gold Eyes)

The Glorindian dwarves emerged from the deepest gold mines of the eastern mountains, where centuries of exposure to auric veins awakened an supernatural connection to precious metals. Their distinctive golden eyes can perceive the glimmer of gold through solid stone, making them unparalleled prospectors and treasure hunters. This gift, however, has made them targets of exploitation throughout history, leading many Glorindian communities to become secretive and nomadic.

Their obsidian-dark skin contrasts strikingly with their luminous golden eyes, which seem to glow faintly in darkness. Glorindian culture values wealth not for luxury, but as a measure of one's connection to the earth's hidden treasures. They believe gold calls to those worthy of finding it, and that hoarding beyond one's needs brings misfortune.

#### Aspects

- Gold calls to the worthy
- What's hidden will be found

#### Auric Sight

**Passive ability.**
You can sense the location and approximate quantity of gold, silver, and other precious metals within 120 feet, even through solid barriers. When examining valuable objects, you automatically know their precise worth and can detect any counterfeits or impurities.

Additionally, once per long rest, you may spend 10 minutes concentrating to divine the location of the nearest significant treasure hoard within 1 mile.

### Hestrube (Graylings, Stone Dwarves)

The Hestrube are living stone given dwarven form, dwelling in the deepest caverns where earth and flesh merged through ancient elemental magic. Their bodies are composed of living granite that can shift between solid and fluid states at will. These stone dwarves have adapted to survive in the harshest underground environments, feeding on minerals and moving through solid rock as easily as others move through air.

Hestrube society operates more like geological formations than traditional communities—they cluster in colonies that can remain motionless for decades, then suddenly migrate through hundreds of miles of stone. Their patience rivals that of mountains, but their pragmatic nature makes them efficient problem-solvers when roused to action.

#### Aspects

- Patient as stone, hard as granite
- The deep earth provides all

#### Stone Flesh

**Passive ability.**
Your body can shift between flesh and living stone at will. While in stone form, you gain +2 to defense rolls against physical attacks but move at half speed. You can sustain yourself by consuming 1 pound of stone or minerals daily instead of normal food.

When you take the defensive stance, you can choose to become solid stone, taking one-quarter damage instead of half until the start of your next turn.

### Grendel (Chord Dwarves)

The Grendel are wandering dwarves who travel in close-knit family caravans, their culture built around music, storytelling, and fierce loyalty to blood relations. Often misunderstood and persecuted by settled folk who view them as thieves and troublemakers, the Grendel have developed a complex code of honor that governs interactions both within their clans and with outsiders.

Their musical traditions serve not just as entertainment but as historical records, with each family maintaining epic ballads that chronicle their lineage and travels. The Grendel possess an almost supernatural ability to harmonize, and their group performances can influence emotions and inspire extraordinary feats.

#### Aspects

- Family honor above all else
- The song remembers what words forget

#### Chord of Kinship

**Major ability.**
When you and at least two allies who can hear you begin singing, humming, or playing instruments together, all participants gain +2 to their defense rolls and cannot be charmed or frightened for the next minute, so long as everyone continues participating in the music.

### Verucan

Born from the volcanic forges of the southern peaks, the Verucan dwarves channel the raw fury of molten earth through their bodies. Their obsidian-black skin bears glowing red veins that pulse with inner fire, and their legendary tempers are matched only by their mastery of flame and forge. These dwarves have built their civilization within active volcanoes, harnessing geothermal energy for their incredible metalworking.

Verucan society prizes passion and intensity in all things—their loves burn as hot as their hatred, and their craftsmanship reflects this fiery dedication. They view anger not as a weakness but as a sacred flame that drives innovation and excellence, though this philosophy often puts them at odds with more reserved cultures.

#### Aspects

- Forged in fire, tempered by fury
- Passion drives perfection

#### Molten Heart

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to fire. Your body radiates heat—creatures that grapple you or hit you with unarmed attacks take 1d4 fire damage.

### Yorinthian (Winter Dwarves)

The Yorinthian dwarves serve the ancient dragon goddess Nabuhe in the frozen wastes of Hannoweir, where they have been shaped by millennia of harsh winters and draconic influence. Their hearts have grown as cold as the glacial halls they inhabit, and their cruel philosophies reflect the unforgiving nature of their patron deity. They view mercy as weakness and believe that only through suffering can one achieve true strength.

These pale, frost-touched dwarves have developed a rigid hierarchy based on their ability to endure and inflict hardship. Their ice-blue eyes show little warmth, and their elaborate codes of conduct prioritize duty to Nabuhe above all personal bonds or mortal concerns.

#### Aspects

- Winter purifies the weak
- Nabuhe's will guides my hand

#### Winter's Embrace

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to ice. You are immune to cold damage and environmental cold effects, can see normally in blizzards and other winter weather conditions, and suffer no movement penalties from ice or snow. However, you take double damage from fire sources.

### Strømgodden (Battle Dwarves)

The Strømgodden have forged a culture around sacrifice, fury, and glorious combat, developing unique armor embedded with spikes and blades that turns their very bodies into weapons. This signature spiked armor is crafted through ancient techniques passed down through generations, with each piece custom-fitted to its wearer and considered a sacred extension of their fighting spirit. Their dangerous fighting style reflects their belief that true honor comes only through risking everything in battle.

These battle-scarred dwarves view each conflict as a sacred offering to the gods of war, and their society celebrates those who achieve the most spectacular and dangerous victories. Their settlements in Trømgar are built like fortresses, constantly ready for the next glorious battle. The creation of spiked armor is a rite of passage, with young Strømgodden spending years learning the specialized smithing techniques required.

#### Aspects

- Glory through sacrifice
- My armor is my weapon

#### Spiked Charge

**Heart ability.**
While wearing your specially crafted spiked armor, when you dash at least 20 feet toward an enemy, you may use your action to make an opportunity attack with your armor instead. You must choose the might stance and your armor counts as a heavy piercing melee weapon. Add your armor's defense bonus in place of a weapon die roll. However, the violent impact body-slam damages you as well—you take damage equal to the target's defense roll.

Additionally, whenever you are grappled while wearing your spiked armor, the enemy immediately takes damage equal to your armor's defense bonus, and takes the same damage again at the start of each subsequent round they maintain the grapple.

### Nydor (Dark Dwarves)

The Nydor broke away from their Aureum cousins to embrace the darkness that the sun-worshippers rejected, establishing their brutal civilization in the shadowed realm of Emblydium beneath the black sun. These tusked, ash-skinned dwarves have become master slavers and creators of cruel war machines, trading instruments of oppression to surface nations in exchange for a steady supply of captives.

Their long, unkempt hair and prominent tusks give them a bestial appearance that matches their harsh philosophy. The Nydor believe that strength comes through domination, and their underground forges ring constantly with the creation of chains, weapons, and mechanical contraptions designed to control and terrorize.

#### Aspects

- Strength rules the weak
- Darkness reveals truth

#### Forge of Oppression

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to darkness, and you have advantage on crafting checks for weapons, armor, and restraints.

### Velwey (Dream Dwarves)

The Velwey have mastered the art of dream harvesting, using combinations of hallucinogenic substances, divine magic, and deoric rituals to extract and manipulate the dreams of sleeping minds. Their religious society in Movasi has built magnificent palaces powered by crystallized dreams, and they offer the profound service of helping individuals discover their true names through guided dream journeys.

This race is not a playable race, so there are no associated abilities.

### Einwissel (Celestial Draugr)

The Einwissel are the descendants of dwarves who survived a harrowing journey from the celestial plane of Celesté back to the material world. This planar transition left them forever changed, with blue-gray skin decorated with silvery speckles and a profound connection to daemonic forces. They can share thoughts and magical energy with one another, but fragments of their true names remain exposed, making them vulnerable to mystical attacks.

These reclusive dwarves hide in the remote Zhorheim and Miphoris mountains, maintaining strict matriarchal traditions inherited from their celestial exile. Their psychic abilities make them formidable allies but dangerous to be around, as their mental connections can be exploited by enemies who know their true names.

#### Aspects

- The celestial road changes all travelers
- Shared thoughts, shared burdens

#### Celestial Resonance

**Passive ability.**
You can telepathically communicate with other Einwissel within 1 mile and share rush points with willing Einwissel within 30 feet during combat. When another Einwissel within 30 feet takes damage, you may choose to split the damage between both of you.

However, any creature that learns part of your true name gains advantage on all mental attacks against you, and you automatically fail saves against effects that target your true name.

### Surry (White Dwarves)

The Surry dwarves have adapted to the deepest underground ecosystems where no sunlight ever penetrates, developing translucent skin and a diet consisting entirely of fungi, giant insects, and whatever protein sources wander into their territory—including unwary visitors. Their cannibalistic tendencies stem not from malice but from practical necessity in their resource-scarce environment.

These pale, ethereal-looking dwarves have evolved exceptional sensory abilities to navigate their fungal kingdom, and their alien perspective on nutrition often horrifies surface dwellers. They view all flesh as simply another form of sustenance, making no moral distinction between hunting an animal or taking advantage of a convenient traveler.

#### Aspects

- All flesh feeds the deep
- Hunger knows no moral boundaries

#### Corpse-pale Adaptation

**Passive ability.**
You require no sunlight and can survive on any organic matter, including normally inedible substances like leather, paper, or corpses. You have darkvision to 120 feet, and can always determine the direction towards any corpses within 1 mile.

### Gruynmar

The Gruynmar have taken to the seas in massive iron vessels that serve as floating cities for entire clans. These bronze-skinned, curly-haired dwarves have mastered naval warfare and are the only people who understand the secrets of gunpowder weapons. Their ships are legendary juggernauts that can devastate any naval opposition, making them both feared and respected across all maritime nations.

Clan loyalty runs deeper than blood among the Gruynmar, and abandoning one's ship-family is considered the ultimate betrayal. However, those rare individuals who do leave their floating homes often become exceptional pirates, mercenaries, or adventurers, bringing their unique seafaring skills and firearm expertise to land-based endeavors.

#### Aspects

- The clan-ship is my true home
- Thunder and iron rule the waves

#### Gunpowder Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You can craft and use firearms, which count as an ultra-heavy ranged weapons with 90-foot range that deal piercing damage. Firearms require gunpowder charges and take a full action to reload after each shot. Ultra-heavy weapons use a d20 as their weapon die.

You can craft a basic firearm in 3 days with access to a forge and 50 ducats worth of materials. You can create gunpowder charges from sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter (5 ducats of materials yields 20 charges). In settlements, charges typically cost 1 ducat each when available.

### Fengruk (Forgewardens)

The Fengruk have elevated smithing from mere craft to sacred art, viewing the forge as a metaphor for all of life's transformative processes. Their deep golden skin and extraordinarily thick, bristly beards protect them from the heat of their sacred forges in Gondurak. These serious but fundamentally happy dwarves approach every aspect of existence with the methodical care of a master smith.

Fengruk philosophy teaches that just as raw metal must be heated, hammered, and tempered to become useful, so too must individuals be shaped by hardship and discipline to reach their true potential. Their respect for the forging process extends to all relationships and endeavors, making them patient teachers and steadfast allies.

#### Aspects

- The forge teaches all life's lessons
- Patience and heat create perfection

#### Master of the Forge

**Passive ability.** Your deep understanding of metallurgy and transformative processes grants you the following benefits:

- When using a workshop for magical crafting, treat it as one level higher than it actually is (maximum level 7).
- When using components with the "neutral" tag (typically metals and gems), treat them as one level higher for all crafting purposes.
- You have advantage on all crafting skill checks.

### Cendelle (Celestial Draugr)

The Cendelle are perhaps the most mysterious of all dwarven heritages, dwelling in the deepest reaches of the earth where few dare to venture. Known as the Celestial Draugr, they are the sworn guardians of ancient portals that bridge the material plane with Celesté, a realm of ethereal beauty and otherworldly power. These portals, hidden in vast underground chambers beneath Dnykuul, have been watched over by the Cendelle for countless generations.

The discovery of these portals fundamentally changed the Cendelle's society. Where other dwarves found ore and stone in the depths, the Cendelle found doorways to another world. The energies seeping through these portals have subtly altered them over millennia, granting them an uncanny awareness of planar disturbances and the ability to sense otherworldly presences. Their eyes often carry flecks of celestial silver, and their hair tends toward unusual hues of deep blue or violet—marks of their long exposure to Celesté's influence.

Living so deep underground, the Cendelle have developed a culture centered around duty and vigilance. They maintain elaborate rituals and protocols for monitoring the portals, ensuring that nothing passes through without their knowledge. Their settlements are built in concentric rings around the portal chambers, with the most honored families living closest to the thresholds they guard. The Cendelle believe that their role as guardians is a sacred trust, one that supersedes personal ambition or comfort.

Unlike their cousins who fear the dark or seek the sun, the Cendelle have learned to navigate between light and shadow, between the material and the celestial. They are equally comfortable in the absolute darkness of the deep earth and the alien radiance of Celesté. This duality has made them philosophical and contemplative, often speaking in riddles and seeing patterns where others see only stone.

This is not a playable race.
