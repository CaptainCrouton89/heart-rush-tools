## Alekroin

The Alekroin are massive alligator-folk whose imposing presence and predatory mindset have made them both feared and respected throughout the frozen wastes of Shykasas. These powerfully built beings stand shorter than most humanoids but possess incredible physical strength and an unwavering belief in the fundamental truth that everything in existence falls into two categories: predator or prey. Their culture has remained unchanged for millennia, as rigid and unyielding as the ice that covers their homeland.

Alekroin society operates on strict hierarchies determined by hunting prowess and the ability to dominate others. They view adaptation and change as signs of weakness, maintaining their ancient traditions even when circumstances might suggest otherwise. This stubborn adherence to "the old ways" has served them well in their harsh environment, where their natural abilities and proven methods continue to ensure survival.

Despite their fearsome reputation, the Alekroin possess keen intelligence and insatiable curiosity about the world beyond their territory. However, they approach all new experiences through the lens of their predator-prey worldview, constantly evaluating whether something represents a threat to be eliminated, prey to be hunted, or a potential tool for their own advancement.

### Predator's Instinct

**Passive ability.**
You can automatically identify the strongest and weakest creature in any group within 60 feet. You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are wounded, frightened, or have fewer hit points than you. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your might die and gain advantage on your next attack roll.

### Death Roll

**Heart ability. Instant.**
When you successfully grapple a creature, you can attempt to perform a devastating death roll. Make an opposed might checkâ€”if you win, you deal damage equal to twice your might die and both you and the grappled creature fall prone. If you win by 5 or more, the creature takes a wound with rank equal to the difference between your rolls.
