## Sylthik

The Sylthik are a serpentine people whose scaled bodies and ophidian features mark them as children of the great snake goddess Sythikranos. These proud and merciless beings view themselves as the apex of creation, considering all other races to be inferior creatures unworthy of respect or mercy. Their society is built around a complex religious hierarchy that governs every aspect of daily life, from marriage and trade to warfare and diplomacy.

Ruled by venomous high priests who claim direct communion with their serpent deity, Sylthik settlements are often found in desert oases, ancient ruins, or deep caverns where snakes naturally congregate. Their architecture favors winding passages and circular chambers that mirror the movements of their sacred serpents. The Sylthik believe that their goddess will one day return to reclaim the world, and they see themselves as her chosen instruments to prepare for that glorious day.

Their natural ability to communicate with snakes makes them formidable opponents, as they often employ serpentine allies in their schemes. The Sylthik take great pride in their venomous nature, viewing their ability to kill with a single bite as proof of their divine superiority over the "warm-blooded vermin" that populate the world.
