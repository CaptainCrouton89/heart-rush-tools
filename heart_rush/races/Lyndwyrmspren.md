## Lyndwyrmspren

The Lyndwyrmspren, known as Scale Riders to outsiders, are powerful naga warriors who have built their civilization in the harsh peaks of the Lyagnadarr Mountains. These serpentine humanoids with their lower bodies of great snakes have formed an unbreakable bond with the giant lizards that inhabit their mountain homes, riding them into battle as they expand their territory with religious fervor.

At the heart of their empire lies an ancient orange dragon who has commanded them to spread their dominion as far as possible. The Lyndwyrmspren have interpreted this decree as a holy crusade, claiming ownership of the entire Luquihn Desert below their mountains, though their actual patrols rarely venture far into its scorching expanse. They see themselves as crusader knights of a draconic order, destined to bring the world under their scaled banner.

Their discovery of ancient tombs in the Dunes of Kalamesh has only reinforced their belief in their divine mandate. They believe that when the time comes for the final conquest, their dragon lord will descend from the mountains to lead them personally into battle.

### Aspects

- Conquest is our divine mandate
- My mount and I are one

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large (due to serpentine lower body)
- **Height:** 7-8 feet (when upright)
- **Weight:** 300-400 pounds

### Serpentine Form

**Passive ability.**
Your lower body is that of a powerful snake, giving you a climb speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet. You cannot be knocked proneâ€”instead, you coil defensively, gaining +2 defense until you move. You count as mounted for the purposes of abilities and equipment.

### Lizard Rider Bond

**Major ability.**
You have a mystical bond with a giant riding lizard (use warhorse statistics but with a climb speed of 20 feet and +2 natural armor). While mounted on your bonded lizard, you and your mount act on the same initiative and can both attack during the same engagement without spending separate actions. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new lizard after spending 7 days in ritual mourning.
