## Mnurvlyon

The Mnurvlyon are walking contradictionsâ€”beings who inherited both the giants' towering height and the dwarves' love of enclosed spaces. Standing over fifteen feet tall with the broad, stocky build of their dwarven ancestry, they are forced to carve enormous halls in their Grey Mountain homes. These gentle giants move with surprising care, having learned through painful experience that the world was not built for their scale.

Their dual heritage manifests in fascinating ways. They possess the giants' strength and the dwarves' craftiness, creating massive works of stone and metal that combine brute force with intricate detail. Yet they struggle with identity, too large for dwarven society and too fond of mountains and caves for giant clans. This has led them to form their own isolated communities high in the Grey Mountains.
