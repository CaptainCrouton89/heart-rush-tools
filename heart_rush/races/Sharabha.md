## Sharabha

The Sharabha are the noble descendants of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father who stood alone against the titan Hykravones in the world's darkest hour. Though he fell in that legendary battle, his courage and sacrifice transformed the very earth where his heart's blood spilled. Generations later, those who settled upon that sacred ground found themselves changed, imbued with the lion father's indomitable spirit.

All Sharabha carry within them Shara Bolasi's legacy - not just his leonine strength, but his profound sense of honor, his protective instincts, and his willingness to face any odds for what is right. This inheritance manifests in their ability to partially assume their ancestor's form, but more importantly in their unshakeable moral compass and fierce loyalty to their chosen pride.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-7 feet
- **Weight:** 140-240 pounds
- **Max Age:** 120 years

### Aspects

- My honor before my life
- The pride stands together or falls together

### Lion's Heart Awakening

**Major ability.**
You channel the blood of Shara Bolasi, transforming into a lion-like form. Your head becomes that of a great lion and powerful claws extend from your hands. This transformation lasts until you spend an action to return to your normal form. While transformed:

- Your bite counts as a heavy piercing weapon, your claws as light slashing weapons
- You cannot hold weapons, shields, or manipulate fine objects
- You are immune to the frightened condition
- Your bite can be used to initiate grapples (see subrace abilities for special grappling benefits). When you first grapple the creature with your bite, and on each subsequent turn, you may inflict 1d6 piercing damage.

### Sharakari (Pride Guardians)

The Sharakari embody Shara Bolasi's role as protector and leader. These Sharabha have developed their transformation to emphasize defending their pride rather than destroying enemies. In Sharakari communities, the measure of a warrior is not how many foes they've slain, but how many allies they've saved.

Sharakari society revolves around the concept of the "Pride Circle" - concentric rings of loyalty starting with immediate family, extending to clan, community, and finally to all honorable beings. They train from childhood in formations designed to protect the vulnerable, and their transformation reflects this philosophy. A Sharakari who allows harm to come to those under their protection while they still draw breath is considered to have failed their most sacred duty.

Their settlements are built like fortresses turned inside-out, with the strongest warriors living on the perimeter and the most vulnerable at the protected center. Every Sharakari knows their place in the defensive formation and can assume it instantly when danger threatens.

#### Aspects

- Shield of the innocent
- I am strongest when others need me

#### Guardian's Grip

**Passive ability.**
Your protective instincts enhance your grappling abilities when defending others. While transformed via Lion's Heart Awakening:

- When you win an engagement by directly beating your opponent's stance, you may use your bite to grapple instead of your hands
- You have advantage on grapple checks made with your bite
- The passive damage from grappling a creature with your bite uses your might die rather than 1d6 (minimum 1d6).
- Creatures grappled by your bite have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone except you

### Sharadin (Oathspeakers)

The Sharadin have taken Shara Bolasi's final stand and transformed it into a living philosophy. They believe that words spoken with true conviction carry the same power as the lion father's roar - they can shake the earth, bind fate, and change the course of history. These Sharabha have developed elaborate oath-taking ceremonies where their transformation serves as both witness and seal to their vows.

In Sharadin society, an oath sworn in lion form is absolutely unbreakable. They believe that breaking such a vow would not just dishonor them but would retroactively dishonor Shara Bolasi's sacrifice. This has led to a culture where words are chosen with extreme care and promises are rare but absolute. Sharadin often serve as judges, arbiters, and oath-witnesses for other cultures who value their supernatural inability to break their word.

The most powerful Sharadin can even bind others with their oaths, creating mystical contracts that enforce themselves. They say that when a Sharadin speaks an oath, Shara Bolasi himself listens from beyond death to ensure it is kept.

#### Aspects

- My word is iron law
- Truth has the power to change worlds

#### Oathbound Roar

**Major ability.**
Your transformation carries the weight of Shara Bolasi's legendary defiance. While transformed via Lion's Heart Awakening, you gain the ability to unleash a terrifying roar that echoes your ancestor's final stand.

Once per transformation, you may use your action to roar. All hostile creatures within 30 feet must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number or gain a level of frightened. Creatures that fail by 5 or more are also knocked prone by the sheer force of your defiance.
