## Neferati

The Neferati are a race born when the primordial fire danced with Ez's divine essence and Gaea's song of creation. Their distinctive red skin seems to flicker with inner flame in certain lights, while curling ram horns crown their heads like marks of their elemental heritage. With dark eyes that reflect dancing flames and hair black as charcoal, they are unmistakably children of fire.

Fire is not merely an element to the Neferatiâ€”it is life itself. They gather regularly in the desert for sacred fire ceremonies, basking in the heat that others would find unbearable. These gatherings are filled with passionate fire dancing, where the boundaries between dancer and flame blur into one ecstatic expression of life. The Neferati approach everything with this same burning intensity: they love fiercely, explore fearlessly, and experiment boldly.

Most Neferati dwell within the Four Kingdoms of Fire, great nations built around eternal flames that have burned since the world's creation. These kingdoms are centers of innovation and artistic expression, where the courage to try new things is valued above the safety of tradition.

### Fire Soul

**Passive ability.**
Rather than sleep, you must spend 4 hours around fire. The fire cannot be one that you are actively producing, and must be at least the size of a small campfire. You can perform undemanding tasks while you rest. You gain a basic attunement to fire.

Additionally, you are immune to damage from environmental heat (but not fire damage), and your passionate nature grants you +2 to presence checks when expressing strong emotions.
