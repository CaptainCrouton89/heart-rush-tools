## Pixie

Born from the intersection of the material plane and the realm of fae, pixies are diminutive winged beings who exist in a state of heightened emotional and magical awareness. All pixies can hear the underlying Faesong that resonates through reality—a melody imperceptible to most other creatures. This attunement to the emotional and magical currents of the world shapes every aspect of pixie society, from their fierce protectiveness of natural spaces to their complex social hierarchies built on emotional resonance rather than physical might.

Pixies reproduce through a mystical process involving moonlight, flower nectar, and concentrated emotional energy. A new pixie emerges fully formed from a bloom after a gestation of exactly one lunar cycle, inheriting not just physical traits but emotional memories from their progenitors.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Minuscule
- **Height:** 6-10 inches
- **Weight:** 1-3 pounds

### Pixie Anatomy

**Passive ability.**
You have a fly speed of 30 feet. You are size miniscule (three sizes less than medium). You cannot wield weapons.

### Zelle

The Zelle pixies of the jungle kingdom Zelidia have built a society on justified paranoia and religious fervor. Ruled by a theocratic matriarchy that views all outsiders as either threats or sacrifices to their dark forest gods, they have survived centuries of invasion attempts through a combination of ruthless cunning and blood magic. Their wings are deep crimson and black, resembling tropical butterflies but with patterns that shift to display warning colors when threatened.

Zelle society revolves around their High Priestesses, who commune directly with the jungle spirits through ritual sacrifice. Every Zelle is trained from emergence to be both predator and protector, learning to navigate their xenophobic culture while maintaining the divine wards that keep their realm hidden from larger threats.

#### Aspects

- Paranoid xenophobe
- Devoutly bloodthirsty

#### Blood offering

**Passive ability.**
When a creature within 30 feet of you takes a wound, you may perform a swift ritual as a free action to regain 10 hit points.

### Ianovko

The Ianovko pixies are master illusionists who blur the line between dream and reality. They build their settlements in the spaces between—twilight groves where day meets night, misty valleys where earth meets sky, and most importantly, in the minds of those who encounter them. An Ianovko community might exist simultaneously in the material plane and in the collective unconscious of a nearby village, feeding on dreams and nightmares alike.

Their wings appear to be made of captured starlight and shadow, constantly shifting between translucent and opaque. Ianovko culture prizes clever wordplay and elaborate pranks above all else, with social standing determined by the audacity and artistry of one's illusions.

#### Aspects

- Reality is negotiable
- Riddling trickster

#### Faeweaver

**Passive ability.**
You can cast minor illusions at will without using an action, creating visual phenomena no larger than a 1-foot cube, or or sounds up to the volume of soft talking voice that last for up to 1 minute. You can maintain up to 3 illusons at a time, so long as they are all within eyeshot.

### Ikriel (Icehearts)

Icehearts are pixies transformed by their worship of winter itself—not as a season, but as a cosmic force of entropy and hunger. Their crystalline wings generate a constant aura of frost, and their very presence leeches warmth from their surroundings. This hunger extends beyond the physical; Icehearts feed on emotional warmth, leaving their victims feeling hollow and cold inside.

Icehearts are master manipulators who view other creatures as sources of sustenance. They excel at gaining trust through false vulnerability or promises of aid, only to drain their victims when defenses are lowered. To an Iceheart, every relationship is ultimately transactional—a question of when, not if, they will feed.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally vampiric
- Winter's hungry child

#### Frostbitten Soul

**Passive ability.**

You are immune to the effects of the cold.

As an action, when you touch a willing or incapacitated creature with bare skin contact, you may drain their emotional warmth. The target immediately gains 5 levels of slowed, 5 levels of dazed, and 5 levels of shaken. These levels fade at a rate of one level per hour, rather than per round. You gain the benefits of a short rest.

### Luma (Grove Keepers)

The Luma of Nykotheryx Amberylika forest represent pixie society at its most harmonious. Each Luma bonds with a grove of ancient trees upon emergence, becoming its guardian and living memory for life. Their translucent wings shimmer with captured memories, displaying faint images of past events when they concentrate. Under the rule of Magera, the Frost Prince, they maintain the delicate balance between the ancient dragon totems and the living forest.

Luma culture emphasizes patience and cycles—they measure time in tree rings rather than years, and their oral histories stretch back to when the Dark Elves first walked among the silver birches. They serve as living libraries, their very being intertwined with the memories of their groves.

#### Aspects

- Patient as ancient trees
- Living memory of the forest

#### Grove Memory

**Passive ability.**
You have formed a mystical bond with the ancient trees of the world. By touching any tree that is at least 50 years old and concentrating for one minute, you can access the memories stored within its rings. You may ask up to three questions about events that occurred within two miles of the tree during its lifetime. The GM will provide you with accurate historical information, though events from the distant past may be presented as symbolic visions requiring interpretation.

You can use this ability once per day, but if you spend an hour in meditation with a grove of trees (rather than just one tree), you can ask an additional question and extend the range to five miles. Ancient trees (500+ years old) may hold especially detailed memories and can sometimes show you brief glimpses of magical phenomena or significant supernatural events.
