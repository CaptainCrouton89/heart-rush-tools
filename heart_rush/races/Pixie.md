## Pixie

Born from the intersection of the material plane and the realm of fae, pixies are diminutive winged beings who exist in a state of heightened emotional and magical awareness. All pixies can hear the underlying Faesong that resonates through reality—a melody imperceptible to most other creatures. This attunement to the emotional and magical currents of the world shapes every aspect of pixie society, from their fierce protectiveness of natural spaces to their complex social hierarchies built on emotional resonance rather than physical might.

Pixies reproduce through a mystical process involving moonlight, flower nectar, and concentrated emotional energy. A new pixie emerges fully formed from a bloom after a gestation of exactly one lunar cycle, inheriting not just physical traits but emotional memories from their progenitors.

### Fae-born

**Passive ability.**
You have a fly speed of 30 feet. Additionally, you can sense the emotional state of all creatures within 15 feet, gaining advantage on Presence checks to understand their motivations. Once per day, when a creature within 30 feet makes a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you may grant them advantage on that roll by harmonizing with the Faesong.

### Zelle

The Zelle pixies of the jungle kingdom Zelidia have built a society on justified paranoia and religious fervor. Ruled by a theocratic matriarchy that views all outsiders as either threats or sacrifices to their dark forest gods, they have survived centuries of invasion attempts through a combination of ruthless cunning and blood magic. Their wings are deep crimson and black, resembling tropical butterflies but with patterns that shift to display warning colors when threatened.

Zelle society revolves around their High Priestesses, who commune directly with the jungle spirits through ritual sacrifice. Every Zelle is trained from emergence to be both predator and protector, learning to navigate their xenophobic culture while maintaining the divine wards that keep their realm hidden from larger threats.

#### Aspects

- Paranoid xenophobe
- Devoutly bloodthirsty

#### Blood offering

**Passive ability.**
When a creature within 30 feet of you takes a wound, you may perform a swift ritual as a free action to gain 1d4 temporary hit points that last until your next long rest. Additionally, you have advantage on Intimidation checks against any creature that has seen you participate in violence within the last hour.

### Ianovko

The Ianovko pixies are master illusionists who blur the line between dream and reality. They build their settlements in the spaces between—twilight groves where day meets night, misty valleys where earth meets sky, and most importantly, in the minds of those who encounter them. An Ianovko community might exist simultaneously in the material plane and in the collective unconscious of a nearby village, feeding on dreams and nightmares alike.

Their wings appear to be made of captured starlight and shadow, constantly shifting between translucent and opaque. Ianovko culture prizes clever wordplay and elaborate pranks above all else, with social standing determined by the audacity and artistry of one's illusions.

#### Aspects

- Reality is negotiable
- Riddling trickster

#### Dreamweaver

**Passive ability.**
You can cast minor illusions at will without using an action, creating visual or auditory phenomena no larger than a 1-foot cube that last for up to 1 minute. Additionally, when you successfully deceive, confuse, or misdirect a creature through roleplaying or illusion, you gain a rush point. You can gain rush points this way even outside of combat, storing up to 3 rush points that last until used or until your next long rest.

### Ikriel (Icehearts)

Icehearts are pixies transformed by their worship of winter itself—not as a season, but as an cosmic force of entropy and hunger. Their crystalline wings generate a constant aura of frost, and their very presence leeches warmth from their surroundings. This hunger extends beyond the physical; Icehearts feed on emotional warmth, leaving their victims feeling hollow and cold inside.

Despite their predatory nature, Icehearts maintain a twisted form of civilization built on careful rationing of their feeding. They view their hunger as a sacred burden, organizing elaborate rituals to determine who may feed and when, turning survival into a form of worship.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally vampiric
- Winter's devoted child

#### Frostbitten soul

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to damage from cold and the freezing environmental condition. Whenever you deal damage to a creature or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your abilities, you may inflict one level of slowed as frost spreads from your touch. Once per short rest, when you touch a willing or helpless creature, you may drain their emotional warmth to heal yourself for 2d4 hit points. The target gains one level of weakened until their next long rest as they feel emotionally drained.

### Luma

The Luma of Nykotheryx Amberylika forest represent pixie society at its most harmonious. Each Luma bonds with a grove of ancient trees upon emergence, becoming its guardian for life. Their iridescent wings capture and refract the aurora borealis, creating spectacular light shows during their ritual flights. Under the rule of Magera, the Frost Prince, they maintain the delicate balance between the ancient dragon totems and the living forest.

Luma culture emphasizes patience and cycles—they measure time in tree rings rather than years, and their oral histories stretch back to when the Dark Elves first walked among the silver birches. They alone among pixies remember the true names of some of the spirits bound within the dragon totems, treating this knowledge as their most sacred trust.

#### Aspects

- Patient as ancient trees
- Keeper of forgotten names

#### Aurora wings

**Passive ability.**
Your iridescent wings can store and release light. You can create bright light in a 20-foot radius or dim light in a 40-foot radius as a free action. Once per day, when you would take damage from a spell or magical effect, you may use your reaction to refract it through your wings, taking half damage and redirecting the other half to a creature of your choice within 30 feet (they may make appropriate saves as normal). Additionally, you have advantage on all skill checks related to ancient history, spirits, or the identification of magical phenomena.
