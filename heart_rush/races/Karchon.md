## Karchon

The Karchon are shark-headed humanoids from the Shattered Sea. They possess the rough, sandpaper skin of sharks and rows of serrated teeth that regrow constantly. They are a people of steel will and resolute action—once a Karchon decides on a course, nothing short of death will stop them.

They are feared pirates and naval mercenaries, known for their bloodlust in battle and their cold, efficient demeanor. To a Karchon, hesitation is death. Their societies are built around strength and decisiveness, with leaders earning their positions through combat rather than inheritance. A Karchon who shows weakness is quickly replaced.

### Shark Bite

**Minor ability.**
Your jaws are your primary weapon—your bite counts as a light piercing weapon dealing 1d8 damage. When you deal damage with your bite, spend 1 Rush Point to cause the wound to bleed profusely.
