## Troenka

The Troenka are perhaps the most feared inhabitants of the great forests, beings of living wood whose greatest pleasure comes from tormenting travelers who dare enter their domain. These cruel entities appear as tall, gaunt humanoids of bark and branch, but possess the terrifying ability to assume the form of ordinary trees, becoming completely indistinguishable from the natural forest around them. Their strength is legendary, and their intelligence far greater than most give them credit for.

Unlike other woodland folk who might be protective of their forests, the Troenka simply enjoy causing suffering. They feel no need for food, water, or shelter, existing in a state of perfect self-sufficiency that has bred an overwhelming sense of superiority over all "lesser" beings. This arrogance, combined with their sadistic nature, makes them view any intruders as entertainment rather than threats.

Troenka settlements exist wherever ancient forests grow thick and darkâ€”places like Ichneum, the Tenekee Woods, and Goranyakak. They create elaborate hunting grounds designed to trap and torment victims for extended periods, turning sections of forest into nightmarish mazes where screams echo between the trees.

- **Weight:** 200-300 pounds

### Aspects

- Cruel tormentor
- Living wood

### Tree Form

**Major ability. Full action.**
You can transform into an ordinary-looking tree, becoming indistinguishable from natural vegetation. While in tree form, you are immobilized but gain the ability to sense all movement within 60 feet. You can remain in this form indefinitely and transform back as an action. Creatures must succeed on a CN 15 cunning check to identify you as anything other than a normal tree.

### Woodland Superiority

**Passive ability.**
While in forest terrain, your move speed increases by 20 feet and you can move through difficult terrain without penalty. You have advantage on stealth checks in natural settings and on intimidation checks against creatures you have surprised or trapped. Your natural weapons (fists, branch-like appendages) count as light weapons and deal bludgeoning damage.
