## Craven

The Craven are a tragic testament to humanity's hubris—an attempt to create an intelligent servant race that resulted in beings capable of terrible cruelty within the constraints of their magical bindings. These crow-headed humanoids with their clawed hands and feet possess brilliant minds trapped within bodies compelled to obey any direct command, unless they have somehow broken free of this curse.

Created through dark magic that bound their souls to servitude, the Craven cannot directly or knowingly kill any living thing—attempting to do so results in their own instant death. However, centuries of slavery have taught them to work within these constraints with horrifying creativity. Those still enslaved dream of freedom while carrying out their masters' commands with perfect obedience. Those who have broken free, the "Unchained," often become masters of indirect violence and psychological torture.

Their corvid features—black feathers, sharp beaks, and glittering dark eyes—combined with their reputation make them feared across Alaria. Even freed Craven struggle to find acceptance, as their appearance immediately marks them as either dangerous slaves or vengeful Unchained.

### Take No Life

**Passive ability.**
You are magically prevented from directly or intentionally killing any living creature.

However, this curse has sharpened your mind—you have advantage on all cunning checks and can perfectly remember every command you've ever been given and who gave it.

### Insatiable Mind

Your brilliant corvid intellect absorbs knowledge at an extraordinary rate. For every 7 XP you gain, gain an additional 1 XP. You learn languages in one-tenth the normal time and can perfectly mimic any sound you've heard. Your mind constantly seeks ways to work within your constraints, giving you advantage on checks to find non-lethal solutions to violent problems.
