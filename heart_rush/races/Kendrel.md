## Kendrel

The Kendrel are creatures of breathtaking beauty whose seahorse-like features embody the grace and mystery of the deep ocean. With flowing manes, elegant elongated faces, and bodies that shimmer with aquatic colors, they are considered among the most stunning beings in all of Alaria. Their culture revolves around elaborate courtship rituals, noble ceremonies, and the pursuit of aesthetic perfection in all things.

These peaceful beings make their homes in hidden fortress-cities within tropical coral reefs and underwater grottos, far from the conflicts that plague the surface world. The Kendrel are natural diplomats who prefer negotiation and artistry to violence, viewing warfare as crude and beneath their refined sensibilities. Their society is built on complex hierarchies of beauty, wisdom, and social grace.

Kendrel architecture seamlessly blends with natural coral formations, creating cities that appear to have grown from the ocean floor itself. They are master craftsmen who work with living coral, cultivated pearls, and other sea treasures to create works of art that can entrance even the most jaded observers.

**Passive ability.**

### Stunning Presence

**Major ability. Full action.**
Your otherworldly beauty briefly overwhelms those around you. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see you must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number.
