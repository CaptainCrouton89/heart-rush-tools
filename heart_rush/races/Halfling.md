## Halfling

Blessed by Lady Fortune herself, all halflings are naturally just lucky. Other than their diminutive stature and uncanny fortune, they are remarkably similar to humans—sharing their adaptability, ambition, and capacity for both great kindness and terrible cruelty. What halflings lack in size, they make up for in their ability to find themselves on the right side of fate's coin toss.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3.5-4.5 feet
- **Weight:** 60-90 pounds

### Fortune's Favor

**Major ability.**
Lady Fortune smiles upon you. Once per day, when you or an ally within 30 feet would fail a skill check, saving throw, or attack roll, you may have them succeed instead. The result becomes the exact challenge number or defense roll required.

### Belenstrope

The Belenstrope halflings of Erasnus are renowned as the finest merchants and traders in all the realm. Their sprawling noble families control vast trade networks, with lords and ladies in every major settlement connected through a byzantine web of second cousins, third uncles, and distant relations. With their olive skin, high cheekbones, and piercing intelligent eyes, they cut striking figures in the markets and courts where they ply their trade. Their slender builds and quick minds serve them well in negotiations, where a single misplaced word can mean the difference between profit and ruin.

#### Aspects

- Everything has a price, if you know how to find it
- Family connections open all doors

#### Golden Touch

**Passive ability.**
You have an innate sense for value and profit. You automatically know the approximate worth of any item you handle, and you have advantage on all checks related to trade, negotiation, and detecting forgeries. Additionally, increasing your cunning die costs 2 less XP.

### Fieri

Deep beneath Hell Creek in Chimea, where the ground itself burns with the heat of the plane of fire, dwell the Fieri—the hellborn halflings. Cursed generations ago to live in this infernal realm, they have adapted to their burning prison with bodies that channel earth and flame. Their hatred for the surface world burns as hot as their homeland, and they kill any outsider foolish enough to descend into their domain. Red-skinned with eyes like glowing coals, the Fieri have become as merciless as the environment that shaped them.

#### Aspects

- The surface world abandoned us to burn
- Rage is the only warmth that matters

#### Hellborn

**Passive ability.**
You gain a basic attunement to fire. The burning condition cannot reduce you below 1 hit point, and you take half damage from all fire sources. Your unarmed attacks deal fire damage and inflict one level of burning on a hit. You cannot venture into areas colder than temperate climate without taking one level of weakened that doesn't fade until you return to warmth.

### Dengar

In the fetid swamps of Phirexes, the Dengar halflings have made their peace with a life others would find unbearable. Ruled by the Gorgon Queen—whom they see as a benevolent protector rather than the tyrant she truly is—they've adapted to swamp life with remarkable optimism. Master brewers and foragers, they've turned the hostile swamp into a home, finding joy in fermented moss wine and mushroom stews. Their pragmatic cheerfulness in the face of constant danger from bog creatures and toxic fumes would be inspiring if it weren't so tragically misguided.

#### Aspects

- Every day you're not eaten is a good day
- The Queen protects us from worse things

#### Swamp Resilience

**Passive ability.**
The swamp has made you hardy. You are immune to all poisons, venoms, and diseases. You can identify edible plants and fungi automatically, and you know how to brew healing poultices from swamp materials (functions as a crude healing kit that replenishes daily). Additionally, you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your might die maximum.

### Wispen

The silver-skinned Wispen halflings are perhaps the strangest of their kind. Nomadic wanderers found throughout Grendenheim, they possess the unique ability to separate their souls from their shadows, animating objects with pieces of their own essence. Their encampments are unnerving places where tents walk on their own, tools work without hands, and furniture rearranges itself. To the Wispen, this is simply life—why carry your home when your home can carry itself?

#### Aspects

- My shadow and I don't always agree
- Everything is more alive than it appears

#### Soul Splinter

**Passive ability.**
You can detach a piece of your shadow to animate a single object no larger than a 5-foot cube. The object gains a move speed of 15 feet and can perform simple tasks. While an object is animated this way, you cast no shadow and have disadvantage on stealth checks in bright light. You can recall your shadow as an action. If the animated object is destroyed, your shadow returns after a long rest.

### Shailin

Yellow-eyed and patient as stone, the Shailin halflings of Sestros await their promised destiny. Every Shailin hears the whispers of Talresses, a daemon who has woven itself into their cultural consciousness so thoroughly that they mistake its voice for divine providence. They perform their daily lives with quiet certainty that they are the chosen people, destined for a greatness that always seems just beyond the horizon. Their squat frames and distinctive golden eyes mark them as blessed—or cursed, depending on one's perspective.

#### Aspects

- Our time will come, as was foretold
- The whispers guide us to our destiny

#### Daemon Whispers

**Passive ability.**
Talresses whispers secrets to you. Once per day, you may ask a yes or no question about the immediate future (next 10 minutes) and receive a truthful answer. However, whenever you roll a 1 on any die, you hear distracting whispers and must subtract 2 from your total roll as the daemon's voice overwhelms your thoughts. You have advantage on saves against being charmed by creatures other than daemons.

### Windorf

The seafaring Windorf halflings embody the best of halfling nature—kind, thoughtful, and possessed of a quiet courage that puts larger folk to shame. Making their homes in the coastal regions of Windor, they've taken to the sea with the same cheerful determination they bring to all endeavors. Their ships are marvels of halfling engineering, built low and sturdy to weather any storm. In the tradition of their ancient homeland, they value good food, comfortable homes, and the simple pleasure of helping a neighbor in need.

#### Aspects

- A good deed is its own reward
- The sea calls, but home calls louder

#### Stouthearted

**Passive ability.**
Your courage is legendary among halflings. You are immune to the frightened condition and have advantage on all saves against fear effects. When an ally within 30 feet would gain the frightened condition, you may use your reaction to shout encouragement, granting them advantage on their save. Additionally, you have a swim speed of 20 feet and can hold your breath for twice as long as normal.

### Whiteling

When a halfling dies with unfinished business or in a state of extreme emotional turmoil, they sometimes rise as a Whiteling—a corpse vampire that haunts their former communities. These undead halflings retain their memories but lose all empathy, becoming predators that hunt those they once loved. The transformation is tied to something deep in halfling biology and culture, though scholars debate whether it's Fortune's final curse or simply the price of their legendary luck.

#### Aspects

- I remember loving you, but feel nothing now
- The hunger is all that remains

#### Undead Fortune

**Passive ability.**
You are undead. You don't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. You are immune to poison and disease. Healing magic harms you (take damage instead of healing), but you can spend hit dice to heal during a short rest by consuming flesh. You have disadvantage on all social rolls with living creatures who know what you are. Fortune's Favor works differently for you—when you use it, the target fails critically instead of succeeding.

### Hookling

In the frozen wastes of Morelous, the Hookling halflings have adapted to an environment that would kill most others. Their gray-blue skin provides natural camouflage against the ice, while their characteristic hooked noses help warm the frigid air before it reaches their lungs. Severe and humorless by necessity, they've built a culture where waste is the greatest sin and frivolity is viewed as a dangerous weakness. Every calorie counts when winter never ends, and the Hooklings have learned that survival requires absolute discipline.

#### Aspects

- Waste nothing, want nothing
- Laughter is a luxury we cannot afford

#### Winter's Child

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to the effects of cold weather and take half damage from cold sources. You can survive on half the normal food and water requirements. You have advantage on survival checks in arctic environments and can naturally sense approaching blizzards 1 hour before they arrive. However, you have disadvantage on all rolls when in temperatures above comfortable, as the heat saps your strength.
