## Murazi

The Murazi are an enigmatic merfolk civilization that thrives in the vast network of warm subterranean rivers crisscrossing beneath the Luquihn Desert. Where others see only endless sand and death, the Murazi navigate ancient waterways that connect oasis to hidden oasis, maintaining a thriving culture in the most unlikely of environments.

Their economy revolves around the cultivation and harvest of black pearlsâ€”lustrous treasures that grow only in the warm-water clams found in their underground rivers. These pearls are so valuable that a single one can buy a small house on the surface, making the Murazi wealthy despite their isolation. They maintain careful trade relationships with both surface dwellers at desert oases and with triton merchants along the distant Sunshine Coast.

The Murazi have adapted perfectly to their unique environment, with skin that shifts between deep blue and sandy brown depending on their surroundings, and eyes that gleam like pearls in the darkness of their river homes.

### Pearl Diver's Fortune
