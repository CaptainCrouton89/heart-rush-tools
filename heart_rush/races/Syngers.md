## Syngers

The Syngers are perhaps the most mysterious race on Alaria, immortal beings who sail through the skies in ships that defy comprehension. Their skin shifts through stunning hues of vivid red, violet, and blue, constantly changing like living auroras. These eternal wanderers travel far above where even sky ships dare to venture, in the thin air where the stars begin to show during daylight.

Rarely seen by terrestrial races, the Syngers observe the world below with the detached interest of near-gods. Their immortality has given them a perspective measured in millennia rather than years, and their concerns often seem incomprehensible to shorter-lived races. When they do descend to interact with the world below, it is usually for purposes that become clear only centuries later.

Their flying ships, known as Synger Vessels, are constructed from materials unknown to modern science and powered by principles that even the most learned sages cannot explain. These craft move silently through the high atmosphere, leaving trails of colored light that are sometimes visible from the ground on clear nights.
