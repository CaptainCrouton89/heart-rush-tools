## Rhea

The Rhea possess cool, grayish-blue skin that seems to shimmer like morning mist. Completely bald with wispy gray hair that floats as if perpetually caught in a gentle breeze, their pupil-less white eyes give them an otherworldly appearance. Born from the intersection of Gaea's song, Ez's divine touch, and the elemental air itself, they are unnaturally light despite their sizeâ€”a trait that defines their unique physiology.

Rhea culture values focus and dedication above all else. Where others might flit from interest to interest, a Rhea will choose a single pursuit and dedicate decades to its mastery. This incredible concentration makes them legendary scholars, martial artists, and teachers. Their calm demeanor and patient instruction have produced some of history's greatest minds, though the Rhea themselves rarely seek fame.

They primarily dwell in the mountain monasteries of Murth, where the thin air suits their ethereal nature and the isolation allows for uninterrupted contemplation.
