## Faeja

The Faeja are perhaps the most elusive of all Alaria's races, small jungle dwellers whose bodies are covered in fine, iridescent tendrils that can shift color and texture to match their surroundings perfectly. These delicate beings appear almost fairy-like, with large eyes that reflect light like jewels and voices that sound like wind through leaves.

Living in small villages deep within the jungles of Lethos, the Faeja have developed a culture entirely integrated with their environment. They communicate with jungle spirits, cultivate medicinal plants unknown to others, and can navigate the dangerous jungle with ease. Their magic-infused hair-like tendrils allow them to become virtually invisible, contorting their bodies and hardening their fur into shapes that perfectly mimic surrounding foliage.

Despite their gentle appearance, the Faeja are fierce protectors of their jungle homes. They have mastered the use of natural poisons, can call upon jungle predators for aid, and know every secret path through their territories. Those who threaten their lands often simply vanish, leaving no trace of what befell them.
