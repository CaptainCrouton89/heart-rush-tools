## Nyolci

The Nyolci are a maritime people whose distinctive cephalopod features mark them as some of the finest sailors and navigators in the known world. With humanoid bodies crowned by octopus-like heads bearing five dexterous tentacles and a sharp beak, they might seem alien to landlubbers, yet they have integrated seamlessly into coastal societies across every major port and trading hub.

Born from the marriage of sea and civilization, the Nyolci serve as the backbone of maritime commerce and exploration. Their natural affinity for water, combined with their ability to manipulate multiple objects simultaneously with their tentacles, makes them invaluable crew members, ship captains, and harbor masters. Their keen intuition for weather patterns, ocean currents, and the subtle signs that predict storms has saved countless vessels from disaster.

Despite their aquatic origins, the Nyolci have fully embraced life among the various races of the surface world. They can be found in every major port city, often serving as intermediaries between land-based merchants and the mysteries of the deep ocean. Their communities typically cluster around harbors, docks, and shipyards, where their expertise is most valued.

The Nyolci possess an almost supernatural ability to read people and situations, making them excellent negotiators and traders. This intuitive cunning, combined with their reputation for fairness in business dealings, has earned them respect and trust throughout the maritime world.
