## Dwarblin

The Dwarblin are the unfortunate progeny of dwarves and goblins, residing primarily in Watar. Hated by both parent races, they are viewed as "mutt" creatures—too chaotic for dwarves, too sturdy for goblins. Yet, in their isolation, they have forged a culture of resilience and shrewd business.

Physically, they possess the green skin of goblins but the stout build and beards of dwarves. They are fantastic tradesmen, serving as the bridge between markets that would otherwise never interact. While they lack magical aptitude, their craftsmanship is practical and solid. A Dwarblin-made tool may not be beautiful, but it will never break.
