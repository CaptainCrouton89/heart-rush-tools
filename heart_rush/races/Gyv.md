## Gyv

The Gyv are the puppet masters of Iylovia, a race whose very presence makes others question their own thoughts. With their distinctive silver hair and grayish skin, these tall, lithe beings move through society like whispers of smoke. Born from the mingling of Zaelian elf and human bloodlines, they inherited something far more dangerous than either parent race possessed—the ability to subtly influence minds.

In Gyv society, direct confrontation is considered both crude and foolish. Why argue when you can make someone believe your position was their idea all along? This has created a culture of extreme paranoia where every conversation is a chess match and trust is a luxury none can afford. Even among themselves, the Gyv deal in shadows and schemes, using intermediaries and elaborate protocols to avoid direct mental manipulation.
