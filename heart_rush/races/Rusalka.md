## Rusalka

The Rusalka are solitary predators of swamps and marshes, appearing as beautiful women who lure travelers to watery graves. These nymph-like creatures possess an uncanny ability to peer into the hearts of their prey, transforming their appearance to match the deepest desires of those they hunt. No two Rusalka look the same, as each shapes herself to be irresistible to her chosen victim.

They do not age, do not reproduce, and sustain themselves solely on human flesh. Despite their monstrous nature, Rusalka are not mindlessly cruelâ€”they view their hunting as a natural process, no different from a spider catching flies. Some even develop a twisted fondness for certain prey, keeping them alive for weeks while slowly feeding on them.

### Flesh Eater

**Passive ability.**

You may turn your hands into deadly weapons as they go from hands to claws. Your hands count as a light, melee slashing weapon. You can never starve, but you gain a level of vulnerability if you do not eat humanoid flesh for a week or more. You cannot eat normal food.
