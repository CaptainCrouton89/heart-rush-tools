## Grayls

The Grayls are among the most melancholic beings on Alaria, wooden humanoids whose backward-bent knees and perpetual sadness mark them as fundamentally different from other races. Born from ancient trees through a process that even they don't fully understand, Grayls emerge fully grown from specially prepared sacred groves, their consciousness arising from the accumulated experiences of the forest itself.

Their gray, bark-like skin and wooden flesh contain properties that make them valuable to magic item crafters, leading to a history of hunting and exploitation that has only deepened their sorrow. They find the sounds of civilization—especially human voices—physically painful, causing them to retreat ever deeper into remote forests. The Grayls move and think at a pace that matches the trees they come from, taking days to make decisions that others make in moments.

Many Grayls have found refuge in the Walking Forest, where they can move with their home as it travels, never having to abandon the trees they've come to know over decades or centuries of patient observation.

### Wooden Flesh

**Passive ability.**
Your body is made of living wood. You have +2 natural armor and take half damage from piercing weapons. Fire damage against you is doubled. You need only water and sunlight to survive—1 hour of direct sunlight counts as a meal. Wood harvested from your body (dealing 1d6 damage to you) functions as a level 2 magical crafting component with the "neutral" tag.

### Forest's Lament

**Major ability.**
The sounds of civilization cause you physical pain, but you can weaponize this sensitivity. Once per day, you can release a mournful wail that affects all non-plant creatures within 60 feet. They must make a presence saving throw against your heart challenge number or gain 3 levels of shaken as they're overwhelmed by the profound sadness of your existence. Creatures that fail by 5 or more also gain 1 level of charmed toward you out of pity.
