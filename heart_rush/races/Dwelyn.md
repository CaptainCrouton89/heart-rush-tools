## Dwelyn

The Dwelyn are a fierce hybrid race born from the unlikely union of elven grace and orcish strength. These tall, lanky warriors dominate the Green Wilds and surrounding jungles, their deep green skin allowing them to blend seamlessly with the verdant canopy. Black and white hair adorns their heads, often woven with beads that signify their influence within the tribeâ€”the more beads, the greater their standing.

They combine the brutal efficiency of orcs with elven precision, wielding curved scimitars and wearing armor of fur and bone. The Dwelyn are currently locked in conflict with the East Naruaghin Tribes, a war they once dominated easily. However, as their queen's dragon mount Surrey Mahaila has grown sick, so too has the nation's power waned. The queen herself is rumored to be the last true dragonrider, making her both revered and desperately protected by her people.

### Beaded Influence
