## Splinkreen

The Splinkreen are the living legacy of an ancient wizard's experiment, their souls transplanted from mighty trees into humanoid forms. Their bark-like skin ranges from smooth birch white to rough oak brown, often sprouting small leaves or moss in places of rest. These woodland people move through forests with an eerie calm, showing little concern for their own mortalityâ€”perhaps because they remember being trees that stood for centuries.

They speak in slow, deliberate tones and often seem disconnected from the urgencies that drive other races. Death holds no fear for them; they view it as simply returning to the earth that birthed them. This fatalistic outlook makes them both peaceful neighbors and unnervingly willing to sacrifice themselves for causes they deem worthy of their wooden hearts.
