## Koren

The Koren are a feline people with the grace and power of great cats. Their society is sharply divided between the regal Kor and their wilder Korel cousins, each embodying different aspects of their predatory heritage.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 4.5-5.5 feet
- **Weight:** 80-160 pounds

### Natural Predator

**Passive ability.**
Your heritage as hunters runs deep. You have darkvision out to 30 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to track creatures by scent, and you always land on your feet - you take half damage from falls and cannot be knocked prone by falling.

### Kor (Highborn)

The Kor are the ruling class of Koren society, bound by an intricate web of social customs and obligations. To be Kor is to master oneself completely - emotions are private battles never to burden others with. Their society values composure, precision, and adherence to tradition above all else. Breaking social custom means exile, a fate worse than death for most Kor.

Every gesture, word, and glance carries meaning in Kor society. They communicate as much through what is left unsaid as through speech itself, reading volumes in the angle of an ear or the position of a tail. This rigid structure has allowed them to build sophisticated civilizations and maintain order for centuries.

#### Aspects

- Social customs must never be broken
- My feelings are my own burden to bear

#### Claws of Courtesy

**Passive ability.**
Your claws and jaws count as light, melee weapons (slashing and piercing respectively). When you use them while in the agility stance, add 1d4 to your attack rolls.

Additionally, your lifetime of navigating complex social hierarchies grants you one of the following benefits (choose when you select this heritage):

- **Perfect Composure:** You are immune to the shaken condition and have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
- **Social Predator:** When you spend at least 10 minutes observing someone in a social setting, you learn their current attitude toward you and one secret they're trying to hide.

### Korel (Wildborn)

The Korel are what the Kor fear to become - Koren who embrace their feral nature. Whether descended from exiles, born outside Kor society, or simply those who rejected its constraints, the Korel live by instinct rather than etiquette. Where the Kor suppress their predatory nature, the Korel revel in it.

They form loose packs and hunting bands, valuing cunning and strength over propriety. Many work as scouts, thieves, or mercenaries, finding freedom in professions the Kor consider beneath them. Yet despite their reputation as savages, the Korel have their own codes - loyalty to the pack, the thrill of the hunt, and survival above all else.

#### Aspects

- The pack survives together
- I trust my instincts

#### Savage Grace

**Heart ability.**
You can unleash your feral nature in combat. When you do, your claws count as light melee weapons that deal slashing damage. For the next minute:

- Your move speed increases by 20 feet
- You can move through enemy spaces as if they were difficult terrain
- When you deal damage with your claws, the target takes 2 levels of weakened

Additionally, you gain the Nimble talent as a racial ability (it does not count toward the number of talents you have).
