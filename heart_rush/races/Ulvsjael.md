## Ulvsjael

The Ulvsjael are the descendants of those who drank from the blood of Ulvma, the great wolf mother who fell defending Alaria against the titan Hykravones. Where Nagatayora descended into rage and Shara Bolasi stood alone, Ulvma remained with the armies, fighting with pack tactics and fierce loyalty until her final breath. Her blood, seeping into the earth where warriors gathered, was consumed by those seeking her strength - and they were forever changed.

All Ulvsjael carry the wolf's spirit within them, granting them the ability to partially transform and take on lupine characteristics. But more than physical traits, they inherited Ulvma's philosophy: the pack survives through unity, the weak must be culled or made strong, and loyalty once earned is absolute. This harsh pragmatism has shaped every Ulvsjael culture, though it expresses itself in different ways.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 130-220 pounds
- **Max Age:** 80 years

### Aspects

- The pack endures
- Prove your worth or perish

### Wolf's Blood Awakening

**Major ability.**
You may channel the blood of Ulvma, transforming into a wolf-like form. Your head morphs into that of a wolf while your hands sprout functional claws. This transformation lasts until you spend an action to return to your human form. While transformed:

- You gain A2 on all skill checks involving scent or hearing
- Your jaws and claws count as light piercing and slashing melee weapons respectively
- You cannot wield weapons or shields, nor manipulate fine objects
- Your movement speed increases by 20 feet

### Ulvskyn (True Blood)

The Ulvskyn are those Ulvsjael who have kept closest to Ulvma's original teachings, maintaining the harsh but fair philosophy of the pack. They form tight-knit communities where every member has a role and every role is vital. These are the Ulvsjael who still practice the ancient rites - the Culling of the Weak, the Howl of Unity, and the Blood Oath of the Pack.

Ulvskyn communities are meritocracies in the purest sense. Age, gender, and birthright mean nothing - only contribution matters. Children are raised communally and tested constantly, with those showing weakness given chance after chance to find their strength. Only those who refuse to grow, who choose weakness over struggle, face exile. This harsh system produces incredibly capable individuals who value competence above all else.

Their transformation reflects this pack mentality perfectly. When a Ulvskyn assumes their wolf form in battle, they mark prey for the pack, turning combat into a coordinated hunt where the weak are separated and brought down by unified assault.

#### Aspects

- Weakness dishonors the fallen
- United we hunt, divided we starve

#### Pack Hunter's Instinct

**Passive ability.**
Your dedication to pack tactics grants supernatural coordination in battle. Whenever you and an ally are adjacent to the same enemy, you both add 1d4 to attack rolls against that enemy. This bonus increases to 1d6 if three or more pack members (you and allies) surround the same target.

### Ulvsein (Lone Wolf)

The Ulvsein represent a paradox in Ulvsjael culture - those who honor the wolf mother by walking alone. They believe that while Ulvma fought with the pack, she died surrounded yet ultimately alone, teaching that every wolf must be capable of surviving without others. These Ulvsjael become legendary scouts, trackers, and assassins, developing an almost supernatural connection to the wilderness.

Where Ulvskkyn see strength in unity, Ulvsein find it in self-reliance. They often serve as far-ranging scouts for Ulvsjael communities or work as guides and hunters for other races. Their philosophy isn't a rejection of the pack but rather a belief that the pack is strongest when each member could survive alone. They return to their communities with valuable skills and knowledge gained from solitary wandering.

Their transformation enhances their already formidable tracking abilities, and their fighting style emphasizes mobility and adaptation rather than pack coordination. A Moonstrider in wolf form is a terrifying opponent - unpredictable, swift, and capable of attacking from unexpected angles.

#### Aspects

- The lone wolf teaches what the pack cannot
- Every trail tells a story

#### Predator's Pursuit

**Passive ability.**
Your solitary hunting has honed your tracking abilities to supernatural levels. You have advantage on all checks to track creatures, and you can identify any creature by scent if you've encountered it before. You leave no tracks unless you choose to.

Additionally, while transformed via Wolf's Blood Awakening:

- Your movement speed increases by an additional 20 feet (40 feet total with the base transformation)
- You may take the dash action as a free action once per round
- When you move at least 20 feet toward an enemy and make an attack in the same round, add 1d6 to your attack roll
- You have advantage on initiative rolls as your predatory instincts alert you to danger
