## Aciabo

The Aciabo are goblinoid inventors who have taken a dramatically different path from their Coghead cousins. Where Cogheads integrate machinery into their bodies using aether power, the Aciabo have discovered that their own blood possesses unique properties that can fuel extraordinary devices. This discovery has led them to become cyborg inventors of a different sort, creating external mechanical augmentations powered by their life force.

These goblins have grayish-purple skin marked with intricate scars where blood-tubes connect to their inventions. They view the Cogheads' reliance on aether as a weakness, preferring the reliability of blood-power despite its obvious costs. Aciabo society values innovation above all else, with status determined by the complexity and effectiveness of one's blood-powered inventions.

Their workshops are disturbing places filled with the constant hum of blood pumps and the click of mechanical parts. Young Aciabo undergo ritual scarification when they create their first blood-powered device, marking their transition to full adulthood.
