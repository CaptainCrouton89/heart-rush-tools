## Naruaghin

The Naruaghin are the fierce offspring of dwarven stoicism and draconic fury. These reptilian dwarves inhabit the hill caves and ancient temples throughout the Ishnit Jungle, their gray-green scaled skin and slit noses marking them as something between mammal and reptile. Males grow thick, scaley beards, while females sport impressive spinal ridges instead. Each scale is hard as stone.

Constantly warring among themselves and with neighboring tribes, the Naruaghin have developed a warrior culture that values strength and cunning in equal measure. They craft weapons from jungle materials—obsidian, bone, and ironwood—and decorate their temples with the skulls of enemies and great beasts alike.
