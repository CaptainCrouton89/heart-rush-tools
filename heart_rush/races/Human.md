## Human

Humans are resilient and abundant. They are far the most prolific across Alaria, and have the greatest breadth of culture. Contributing to their success as a species is their perseverance; just when you think you've knocked one down for good, they're back up for more.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 100-180 pounds

### Human Resilience and Diversity

**Passive ability.**
When you gain this ability, choose one talent. You gain this talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have).

In addition, whenever you take a wound, you gain a rush point at the start of the next round.

### Drachma

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous, and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and following ones instincts. They are usually the first one you notice when walking into a room—both for their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities. It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.

Drachma are generally found in western regions of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their hearty Drachman ale.

#### Aspects

- Style is everything
- I follow my instincts

#### Instinctive

**Passive ability.**
When you get a complication on a skill check and choose to re-roll, add 3 to the new result.

### Tikhaya

Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are comfortable spending time alone and in contemplation. There is a sort of strength that emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with their physiology—but instead from their self-certainty and outlook on the ways of the world. Even Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about them that is hardly met by even adults of other cultures.

Tikhaya can be found across central and northern Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are known for their incredible philosophers, mathematicians, and martial warriors.

#### Aspects

- I know right from wrong
- Wise in the ways of the world

#### Clear Mind

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to being confused, frightened, enraged, or charmed. Additionally, you have A2 when making skill checks or saving throws to see through deception.

### Neth

Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It is easy to misinterpret a Neth's silence at a joke as boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while never breaking a smile.

Neth are best known for their ability to speak with the wind, allowing them to communicate with the deceased members of their communities to gather advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For this reason, maintaining good relation with one's family, and community are critical to Neth culture, an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they meet who become close.

Neth can be found across the North Reach, along the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers, and resilient warriors.

#### Aspects

- Inscrutable
- If you look after nature, nature will look after you

#### Speak with the Wind

**Major ability.**
While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day, while not in combat, you may reach out to your ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- **Questions and Answers:** You may ask them up to three questions. They answer to the best of their ability. Although they only know what they knew during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans nearly a millennium.
- **Guidance:** Define a specific type of task or activity. Once, before the end of the day, before making a roll for that task or activity, you may declare that you are using your ancestors' guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die with the maximum result of that die.

This entire ritual takes 1 minute.

### Oznak

Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and place a high emphasis on proving one's self-worth and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a young age, children are taught with sticks how to wield a sword, even if they will never be able to afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in Oznak-dominated settlements also include different types of competitions involving sword play, and proper tournaments are common in some regions.

While excelling with the blade garners the most respect, those who don't become the best are pressured to succeed and dominate in another field. This mentality results in a culture of highly competitive people. Because they value skill so highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into a duel with an Oznak.

Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria, though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in the world, and are known for their technical craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying swordsmen.

#### Aspects

- I am no coward
- Fiercely competitive

#### Technical Master

**Passive ability.**
Choose a weapon or tool. If it is a weapon, you have advantage while wielding it. If it is a tool, you have A2 on all checks requiring the use of this tool.

### Naga (Dragon blooded)

Naga make up a long line of humans with dragon blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-father and first son of Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically, Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and heated the lands beneath it, the people below transformed and became the Naga that still exist today.

Naga are passionate and determined in all that they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy. They also have a profound sense of pride, both for themselves, their culture, and the things they care about. If they feel that any of those things have been wronged, then they will not back down until amends have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to behold.

#### Aspects

- Iron determination
- Boiling vengeance

#### Aspect of the Dragon

**Major ability.**
You may channel your blood of Naga, and transform into a dragon-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a dragon and your scales surface in patches over your skin. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- You take half damage from fire.
- You gain +1 to defense rolls from your natural, scaly armor.
- You may belch fire, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone. You may only use this ability once per transformation.
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you gain one level of enraged towards that creature. If another creature deals damage to you, remove all other levels of enraged gained from this ability.
- You have advantage on skill checks to intimidate others.

You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.

### Ulvsjael (Wolf children)

The ulvsjael are human descendants of Ulvma, the wolf mother and the second child of the Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died in his duel against Hykravones, Nagatayora had descended into madness, Ulvma stayed back with the armies of Alaria and fought till the very end before being cut down and collapsing into the ground amongst the armies. When humans came and drank from her blood, the Ulvsjael were born.

The Ulvsjael are a pragmatic and fiercely loyal race who believe in the natural order of life. Much of life revolves around small, nomadic units which travel as a pack. They will protect their comrades with their own lives, but they also feel no qualms about keeping those who cannot defend themselves alive. If you cannot contribute, you are culled. This harsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders, who are usually seen as dead weight until they have proven their worthiness to their pack. However, when the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider—a rare appearance, due to their tendency to stick with their kind—they are frequently the hardest working, such is their desire to prove their usefulness to a new community.

Ulvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are known for their formidable mercenary groups, trackers, and explorers.

#### Aspects

- Loyal to a fault
- Only the strong can survive

#### Aspect of the Wolf

**Major ability.**
You may channel your blood of Ulvsjael, and transform into a wolf-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a wolf and claws grow on your hands. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- You gain A2 on all skill checks for perceiving things that can be smelt or heard.
- Your move speed increases by 40 feet.
- Your jaws and claws count as light piercing and slashing melee weapons, respectively.
- Whenever you are in an engagement, choose a valid target for your stance. All creatures have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or manipulate fine objects.

You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.

### Sharabha (Lion hearts)

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father and third child of Gaea. When Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped Shara Bolasi's heart out through his chest, before stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when people had settled across Alaria once more, the humans who ate from the soil there became the first Sharabha.

Sharabha are known for their warmth, compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most respected member of a pride. They will make unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is chosen.

Outside these communities, Sharabha who have willingly left do not practice many of their more traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of principles and morality.

#### Aspects

- My honor before my life
- Better die brave than live a coward

#### Aspect of the Lion

**Major ability.**
You may channel your blood of Shara Bolasi, and transform into a lion-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a lion and claws grow on your hands. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- Your jaws count as a heavy piercing weapon. Your claws count as light slashing weapons.
- Whenever you deal damage with your jaws to an enemy, you may choose to not let go. If you do, and if the creature is no more than one size larger than you, the creature takes a level of restrained until it spends its action and wins a might check against your might challenge number. While holding on, you cannot attack with your jaws again. Both you and the bitten creature have your move speeds reduced by half, and move together.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or manipulate fine objects.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.

You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.

Looking at the existing format and the information provided, here are the markdown entries for the new human subraces:

### Vyanoweir

The Vyanoweir were once a mighty culture of community-oriented Deoric casters who wielded words of power to shape reality itself. Their mastery over the language of truth was unparalleled, allowing them to speak changes into existence with collective rituals that could reshape landscapes and bend the fundamental laws of nature.

Now their great cities lie in ruins, their libraries burned, and their people scattered to the winds. Only a handful of individuals with Vyanoweir blood remain, carrying within them the fading echoes of their ancestors' incredible power. These survivors often don't even know their true heritage until moments of great need awaken the dormant magic in their blood.

Among the scattered remnants are the Jae-Kai, nomadic spirit wranglers who have adapted their ancestral magic to herd spirits across the Plains of Oblivion. They make yearly pilgrimages to Estornum Agnostus to pay homage to the desolate ruins of their lost civilization.

#### Aspects

- The last echo of a great civilization
- Words have power beyond comprehension

#### Ancient Bloodline

Work with your GM. This culture is nearly gone.

### Husakas

The Husakas are nomadic scorpion riders who traverse the endless dunes in search of the precious red dust that gives their culture its power and purpose. This crimson powder, harvested from rare desert blooms that grow only where ancient magic has seeped into the sand, is both blessing and curse to the Husakas people.

From childhood, the Husakas consume small amounts of the red dust daily, allowing it to flow through their veins and awaken mystical abilities. The dust is highly addictive, and those who go without it for too long suffer terrible withdrawal that can drive them to madness. This dependency shapes their entire way of life, as they must constantly migrate across the desert following the seasonal blooms and maintaining their sacred harvest.

The Husakas form close bonds with giant scorpions that serve as both mounts and companions, capable of navigating the treacherous desert terrain and defending against the many dangers that lurk beneath the sands.

#### Aspects

- The red dust flows through my veins
- Always moving, never settling

#### Dust Dependency

**Passive ability.**
You carry a small pouch of red dust that you must consume daily. The dust has been running through your veins since childhood, awakening mystical powers within you. Choose any handmagic talent - you gain it as a racial ability (it does not count towards your total number of talents).

However, you are dependent on the dust. If you go more than a week without consuming it, you gain one level of all mental conditions (confused, frightened, enraged, charmed) that do not fade until you consume the dust again. Your dust supply must be replenished yearly through trade or pilgrimage to the sacred harvesting grounds.

### The Guiltless

The Guiltless are the tragic creation of the great wizard Thenry Gilmora, who sought to create the perfect servants of good by magically removing their capacity for evil. Born unable to lie, steal, harm others, or act with malicious intent, they were intended to be living saints who would guide the world toward righteousness.

Instead, they became victims. Their absolute honesty and inability to defend themselves made them easy targets for exploitation and abuse. Over thousands of years of mistreatment, however, the Guiltless have developed subtle methods of resistance and revenge that work within the constraints of their nature.

The Guiltless have interbred with humans across the world and can appear as any other human. The trait often skips generations, sometimes manifesting unexpectedly in someone's lineage - which can be catastrophic for those unprepared for its implications.

#### Aspects

- Incapable of malice or deception
- The meek shall inherit through persistence

#### Blessed Curse

**Passive ability.**
You are magically incapable of lying, stealing, or intentionally harming others. You automatically fail any attempt to deceive, pickpocket, or make attack rolls against sentient creatures. However, this absolute goodness grants you protection - you have advantage on all saving throws against hostile magic, and creatures attempting to harm you take disadvantage on their attack rolls as the universe itself seems to conspire to protect the innocent.

Additionally, your complete honesty allows you to speak uncomfortable truths that others cannot. Once per day, you may ask any creature a direct question, and they are compelled to answer truthfully if they understand you.

### Qord'ik

The Qord'ik are a proud people of the Free Isles, distinguished by their dark brown skin, exceptional height, and powerfully built frames that speak to the giant blood many believe flows through their veins. Standing head and shoulders above most other humans, they are natural sailors whose massive frames allow them to handle the rigging and cargo of the great ships that ply the southern seas.

Equally skilled as traders and fighters, the Qord'ik have built a reputation for fair dealing backed by the implicit threat of their formidable physical presence. Their island homes have made them master navigators, and their trading vessels are welcomed in ports across Alaria - though few would dare to cheat a Qord'ik merchant.

The harsh life of the islands and the constant struggle against fierce storms and sea monsters has bred a people of incredible resilience, both in body and spirit.

#### Aspects

- Giants' blood runs in my veins
- The sea is in my bones

#### Strong Bones

**Passive ability.**
Your giant heritage has blessed you with incredibly dense bones and resilient flesh. Increase the damage threshold for taking wounds by 2 - where others would take a wound from 10 or more damage, you require 12 or more damage to suffer a wound.

Additionally, your imposing size grants you advantage on intimidation checks against creatures smaller than you, and you count as one size larger for the purposes of carrying capacity.

### Shontobi

The Shontobi are the noble samurai of the great plains, a people who have built their entire culture around concepts of honor, inheritance, and family duty. In their society, one's position is determined not just by skill with a blade, but by the honor of one's ancestors and the careful maintenance of family obligations that stretch back generations.

The nobility ride magnificent griffons into battle, their great wings casting shadows across the grasslands, while other honorable warriors mount swift horses bred for speed and endurance across the endless plains. Sacred eagles, revered as divine messengers, serve as hunting companions and symbols of prestige - to harm another's eagle is among the gravest of insults.

Marriages among the Shontobi are strategic affairs, carefully arranged to strengthen family alliances and preserve bloodlines. To go against one's family is the ultimate disgrace, leading to exile from the clan and the loss of one's name. They are cunning tacticians who plan their battles with the same care they use to plan their dynasties.

#### Aspects

- Honor above all else
- My family's name must not be shamed

**Choose One:**

#### Eagle Companion

**Passive ability.**
You have an eagle companion that has grown up alongside you since childhood. You gain the Beast Companion talent targeting this eagle as a racial ability (it does not count towards your total number of talents). Your eagle is particularly intelligent and can deliver simple messages over long distances.

#### Honor Bound

**Passive ability.**
Any aspects related to honor, duty, or pursuing honorable goals are empowered by your unwavering commitment. Such aspects grant twice as much DP when invoked for penalties and provide double the bonus when used for advantages. Additionally, upgrading honor-related aspects costs 1 less XP, as your dedication makes such growth natural.

### Tarnak

The Tarnak are a nomadic people of the deep desert whose mastery of blood magic and communion with death has made them feared across the sands of Ulkevolm. Dark-skinned and adorned with precious jewelry that catches the desert light, they paint their faces and bodies with intricate patterns using their own blood mixed with sacred inks, creating a tapestry of red and black that tells the story of their lineage and magical accomplishments.

These desert shamans form deep bonds with great desert tigers that prowl alongside their caravans, hunting by night and resting in the shade of their tents by day. The Tarnak practice blood magic not for power over others, but to commune with the spirits of the dead and divine the movements of fate through the patterns of life and death in the desert.

Their rituals and appearance make them deeply unsettling to outsiders, but the Tarnak see beauty in death as much as life, understanding it as part of the natural cycle that governs all existence.

#### Aspects

- Blood tells all stories
- Death is just another kind of life

#### Blood Sight

**Major ability.**
Through ancient blood magic rituals, you can divine truth from the patterns of life and death. Once per day, by examining a small amount of blood (your own or willingly given), you can learn one piece of information about the creature it came from: their current emotional state, whether they have told any lies in the past day, if they are suffering from any diseases or curses, or the general direction and distance to their current location.

### Nuun

The Nuun are a desert people blessed with striking golden or ice-blue eyes that reflect their deep attunement to the primal elements of fire and water. Dark-skinned and dark-haired, they have built magnificent cities in the desert realm of Kura, where their mastery of trade has brought wealth and their appreciation for beauty has created architectural wonders that rival any in the known world.

Education and proper upbringing are cornerstones of Nuun society. Every child is taught not only practical skills but also philosophy, art, and the appreciation of beauty in all its forms. Their cities are filled with fountains, gardens, and structures that seem to defy the harsh desert environment through the careful application of elemental magic.

As competent traders, the Nuun have established trading routes that stretch across continents, their caravans protected by their elemental magic and their reputation for fair dealing. They believe that beauty and knowledge are the highest achievements of civilization.

#### Aspects

- Beauty in all things must be preserved
- Knowledge is the greatest treasure

#### Elemental Heritage

**Passive ability.**
Choose fire or water - you have a basic elemental attunement to that element as a racial ability (this does not count towards talents gained). Your eyes glow faintly with elemental energy when you use this attunement, growing brighter during more powerful applications.

Additionally, your appreciation for beauty and culture grants you advantage on presence checks when dealing with matters of art, architecture, trade negotiations, or academic discussions.

### Temptari

The Temptari are a deeply spiritual people who have mastered the art of reading the subtle currents of time and weather. Through generations of religious devotion and seasonal rituals, they have developed an uncanny ability to sense what is about to unfold. Their monasteries dot the mountainous regions where the seasons change most dramatically, and their timemasters are sought after as advisors by rulers across Alaria. A Temptari never seems rushed or surprised—they move through life as if they've already lived it once before.

Temptari settlements can be found in the high mountain passes and valleys where the seasons are most pronounced. They are renowned for their prophets, weather-readers, and the legendary timemasters who can glimpse moments yet to come.

#### Aspects

- Time flows differently for me
- The seasons speak to those who listen

#### Temporal Awareness

**Passive ability.**
You cannot be surprised. Additionally, once per round, when you or an ally within 30 feet would roll a 1 on any die, you may warn them of the impending complication. They may choose to not take that action instead, avoiding both the roll and its consequences entirely.

### Kuru

The Kuru are perhaps the most unusual of human cultures, having discovered an ancient ritual that allows them to bond with the spirits of beasts. By pressing the skull of a slain animal to their forehead and speaking the words of binding, they fuse with the creature's essence, gaining its strength at the cost of human speech. The transformation is reversible but few choose to return—the call of the wild becomes part of their very soul. Kuru warriors are feared across the southern lands, as one never knows if the approaching figure is merely human or something far more dangerous.

The Kuru inhabit the Killing Hills and Avakus Forest south of Kyagos, where the barrier between human and beast grows thin. They are known for their beast warriors, primal shamans, and the haunting skull masks they wear before transformation.

#### Aspects

- The beast and I are one
- Words are cages—the wild speaks in actions

#### Skull Fusion

**Major ability.**
As an action, you may press the skull of a beast to your forehead, fusing with its spirit. Choose a beast form with your GM's approval (as per the Beastform talent). You transform into this creature, gaining its physical stats while maintaining your mental abilities. While transformed:

- You cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components
- You gain the beast's natural weapons, movement modes, and senses
- You can understand speech but cannot respond verbally
- The transformation lasts until you take a long rest or spend an action to end it

Unlike the Beastform talent, you may stay in this form indefinitely, but each long rest while transformed requires a might save (CN 10) or gain one level of mental vulnerability as the beast's instincts grow stronger.

### Shapers

The Shapers are perhaps the most distrusted of all human bloodlines, marked by their distinctive silver eyes that remain constant no matter what form they take. Gifted with the ability to perfectly mimic the physical appearance of any humanoid they have seen, they are living shapeshifters whose talents have unfortunately made them valuable for infiltration, espionage, and other unsavory professions.

Their abilities are not illusion but true physical transformation, allowing them to perfectly replicate height, build, facial features, and even voice. However, their silver eyes always remain, serving as the only reliable way to identify a Shaper. This limitation has led to widespread fear and suspicion of anyone with silver eyes, even among those who are not Shapers.

Many Shapers struggle with questions of identity, as the ease with which they can become someone else sometimes makes it difficult to remember who they truly are. Some embrace their gift as freedom from the constraints of a single form, while others see it as a curse that forever separates them from genuine human connection.

#### Aspects

- Am I who I appear to be?
- Trust is a luxury I cannot afford

#### Perfect Mimicry

**Major ability.**
You can perfectly transform your physical appearance to match any humanoid you have seen, changing height, build, facial features, skin tone, and even voice. This transformation is not an illusion but a true physical change that can fool even magical detection. However, your distinctive silver eyes never change, always remaining as the one identifying feature that cannot be hidden.

The transformation takes one minute and lasts until you choose to change again or revert to your true form. You retain all your abilities and statistics while transformed, but gain no special knowledge or memories of the person you're mimicking.
