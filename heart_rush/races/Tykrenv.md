## Tykrenv

The Tykrenv are scavengers of the deep desert, humanoid in body but possessing the head and secondary wings of a vulture. They subsist by feeding on the eternally regenerating corpse of a cursed giant god in the desert's heart. This diet of divine, rotten flesh has made them immune to disease and capable of digesting anything organic.

They are patient observers, often circling battles from high above, waiting for the combatants to weaken or die before descending to feast. Tykrenv society revolves around the sacred corpse at the center of their territory—they believe it is their duty to consume the god's flesh and prevent it from rising again.

### Flight

**Passive ability.**
Your wings allow you to fly with a fly speed of 40 feet. You cannot hover, and you must move at least half your fly speed each round you remain airborne. You can glide for hours on thermal currents without tiring—while gliding (moving horizontally while descending at least 5 feet per round), you do not need to use your movement to maintain altitude.

### Iron Stomach

**Passive ability.**
You are immune to all ingested poisons and diseases. You can eat any organic matter—rotten meat, bone, leather, wood, or offal—without ill effect and gain full nourishment from it. You have A2 on all saves against disease from any source, and you can identify whether something is poisonous or diseased by smell alone.
