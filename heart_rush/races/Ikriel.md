## Ikriel

The Ikriel, known as Icehearts, are pixie-like beings who have adapted to the frozen wastes through their worship of winter itself. Similar in size to their Yorinthian dwarf neighbors, these tiny humanoids have skin like frosted glass and hair that resembles icicles, constantly chiming softly as they move. Where other pixies embrace nature's warmth, the Ikriel have found beauty in winter's stark brutality.

Their devotion to ice and snow has transformed them physicallyâ€”their blood runs cold like antifreeze, their breath forms clouds even in warm air, and their touch can freeze water. They build elaborate ice palaces that never melt, sculpting frozen art that captures light in impossible ways. The Ikriel see winter not as a season of death but as a time of preservation, when the world's true beauty is revealed in crystal clarity.

Small communities of Ikriel can be found throughout the northern reaches, often allied with the Yorinthian dwarves who share their harsh philosophy. They are known for their ice magic, their ability to survive in conditions that would kill others, and their hauntingly beautiful winter festivals.
