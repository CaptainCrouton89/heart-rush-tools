## Orc

Orcs are a diverse and hardy race known for their physical prowess, tribal cultures, and fierce independence. Found across many different environments on Alaria, orcs have adapted to thrive in conditions that would challenge most other races. Their societies are typically clan-based, with strong traditions of warfare, survival, and loyalty to their chosen family groups.

While often misunderstood by other races as purely savage, orcish cultures are rich with tradition, spiritual practices, and complex social structures. Their natural resilience and strength have allowed them to carve out territories in some of the most hostile environments on Alaria.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-7 feet
- **Weight:** 160-280 pounds

### Orcish Resilience

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on saving throws against poisons and diseases. When you take a wound, you may immediately make a might saving throw against a CN equal to the wound's rank. On a success, reduce the wound's rank by 2.

### Hedroscobbi (Black Orc)

The Hedroscobbi are master smiths who have learned to forge iron combined with corrosive algae from rivers and swamps to create incredibly heavy armor. This armor is so abrasive that only their naturally tough skin can withstand wearing it. Their mastery of this unique metallurgy makes them nearly impervious to conventional weapons.

The Hedroscobbi's dark skin has adapted over generations to resist the corrosive properties of their algae-iron alloys. They are often found in the contested swamplands, where they fight alongside and against other orc clans for territory and resources.

#### Aspects

- Master of algae-iron smithing
- Skin like leather armor

#### Corrosive Armor Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You can wear specially crafted algae-iron armor that provides +8 defense instead of the normal +6 for heavy armor, but weighs twice as much. When a creature hits you with a melee weapon while you wear this armor, their weapon takes a -1 penalty to future attack rolls (cumulative). You are immune to acid damage.

### Glivornaxi (Gray Orc)

The Glivornaxi have dark eyes and muddy green skin, living in harmony with the natural world around the Grand Tolkarsus as it passes through the Plenjorn Swamp. This mystical swamp has regenerative properties that heal those who bathe in its waters, and the Glivornaxi have become its guardians.

They are skilled spear-fighters, using their weapons primarily as defense against the Shazuihni boar riders who frequently raid their territory. Their connection to nature runs deep, and they understand the swamp's moods and secrets better than any outsider ever could.

#### Aspects

- Guardian of the healing swamp
- One with the wetlands

#### Swamp Regeneration

**Passive ability.**
While in a swamp or marshland environment, you regain 1 hit point at the start of each round. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes bathing in swamp water to reduce all wound ranks by 1. You ignore difficult terrain in swamps and marshes.

### Tarni (Darkeyes)

The Tarni are orcs strong not just in body, but in spirit. They are virtually unkillable through conventional means, as they have learned to fortify their very souls against destruction. Their warriors wield special spirit weapons that can attack the essence of their enemies directly, bypassing physical defenses entirely.

These orcs have developed a unique understanding of the connection between spirit and flesh, making them formidable opponents who can fight on multiple planes of existence simultaneously.

#### Aspects

- Unbreakable spirit
- Warrior of two realms

#### Spirit Warrior

**Passive ability.**
When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, roll your heart die. On a result of 6 or higher, you remain at 1 hit point instead. Your weapons can be enchanted to deal spirit damage that ignores armor and shield bonuses to defense.

### Uihonaii (Wooden Men)

The Uihonaii have an extraordinary bond with trees—their bloodline is literally tied to the forest. When they die, they become trees, and when the time is right, they are reborn from their wooden forms. These walking forests possess bark-like skin when in their tree form and can live for centuries, accumulating vast wisdom.

However, they can only take root and transform in special soil, requiring them to always return to their homeland. Weapons crafted from their sacred wood are incredibly powerful, often becoming sentient artifacts.

#### Aspects

- Born from sacred groves
- Wisdom of centuries

#### Tree-Soul Bond

**Major ability.**
You may spend 1 hour to transform into a tree. While in tree form, you are immobile but gain +10 defense, immunity to most damage types, and can sense everything within 100 feet. You may remain in this form indefinitely but can only transform in soil from your homeland. If you die, you may choose to become a tree permanently, allowing for potential future rebirth.

### Shazuihni (Boar Rider)

The Shazuihni are hairy, ogre-like orcs with limited intelligence but incredible ferocity. They ride massive giant boars into battle, wielding enormous axes that can cleave through multiple enemies. Their brutal simplicity makes them unpredictable and extremely dangerous in combat.

These orcs live for the thrill of battle and the bond with their boar mounts. Their society is based on strength and the ability to control their savage beasts.

#### Aspects

- Savage boar rider
- Simple but deadly

#### Boar Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have a giant boar companion with 60 hit points, d8 might and agility, and a gore attack that deals 2d8 damage. While mounted, you and your boar move as one unit, and you may use heavy weapons with one hand. If your boar dies, you may bond with a new one after 1 week.

### Griebi (Lakemen)

The Griebi are blueish-gray skinned orcs who can breathe underwater and rarely speak above the surface. They hunt and fish in the depths of lakes and rivers, using their terrifyingly long, needle-like teeth to catch prey underwater. Their society is ruled by a mysterious hag queen who dwells in the deepest waters.

These silent orcs are perfectly adapted for aquatic life, making them formidable opponents both above and below the water's surface.

#### Aspects

### Tytheri (Blood Orc)

The Tytheri are musclebound orcs with totally white skin and razor-sharp teeth, capable of smelling blood from miles away. Within their society, Tythmasters—orcs fed a diet rich in magical blood—grow to enormous size, reaching 10 feet in height as they become the leaders of their people.

These orcs are constantly at war with the Kadroka, and their entire culture revolves around blood, combat, and the pursuit of ever-greater physical power.

#### Aspects

- Hunter who smells blood on the wind
- Devoted to the crimson path

#### Blood Scent

**Passive ability.**
You can smell blood within 1 mile and track wounded creatures with perfect accuracy. When you deal damage to a bleeding creature (one that has taken a wound), add your heart die to the damage roll. If you consume magical blood, gain +2 to all physical ability checks for 24 hours.

### Xi'ivrach (Divine Orc)

The Xi'ivrach are deeply religious orcs who live in Jeh Bli, adorning themselves with heavy stone jewelry and clothing. They must be incredibly strong to bear the weight of their sacred stone garments. Their bodies are covered in ritual scarification, and their high priests are masters of Deoric magic.

Their entire culture is built around religious devotion and the pursuit of divine favor through physical and spiritual trials.

#### Aspects

- Marked by divine ritual

#### Stone-Bearer's Strength

**Passive ability.**
You count as one size larger for carrying capacity and can wear stone armor that provides +8 defense but reduces your speed by 20 feet. Ritual scars covering your body grant you +1 to all presence checks when interacting with religious individuals. You may learn Deoric spells regardless of other prerequisites.

### Thrygun (Wild Orc)

The Thrygun are blue-skinned, red-haired orcs with prominent tusks who dwell in the White Hills. They represent the most primal and untamed aspects of orcish nature, living in small tribes and following ancient traditions that predate most civilizations.

Their wild nature makes them unpredictable allies and dangerous enemies, as they follow instinct and tribal law above all else.

#### Aspects

- Child of the wild hills
- Untamed and free

#### Primal Instincts

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on survival checks in wilderness environments. When you roll initiative, if you roll your maximum heart die result, you may immediately move up to your speed and make one attack. You have resistance to cold damage.

### Bloodreavers

The Bloodreavers inhabit Bloodwood and practice the ancient art of blood tattooing, using blood treated with preservative tree sap to mark their skin. All their clothing, armor, and weapons are stained with blood—not from cruelty, but from deep respect, as they believe blood imbues items with the aspects of its source.

Despite their terrifying appearance, they are actually protective and loyal, though generally quiet and reserved. They are frequently misunderstood by other races who see only the blood and miss the honor beneath.

#### Aspects

- Marked by honored blood
- Silent guardian of family

#### Blood Bond Ritual

**Passive ability.**
You may spend 1 hour treating a weapon or piece of armor with blood (yours or a willing donor's) to grant it a +1 bonus to attack rolls or defense for 1 week. If you use the blood of a defeated enemy you respected, the bonus increases to +2. You have advantage on checks to track creatures whose blood you have tasted.

### Enti

The Enti are brutal slave traders from the north, constantly at war with the Danaki minotaurs. They are huge, aggressive orcs who wear furs and gold as symbols of their wealth and conquests. Their no-nonsense approach to conflict has made them both feared and wealthy through their harsh trade practices.

These orcs believe that might makes right and that the strong have every right to profit from the weakness of others.

#### Aspects

- Trader in chains and gold
- Northern raider

#### Slaver's Dominance

**Passive ability.**
You have advantage on intimidation checks against creatures smaller than you. When you successfully grapple a creature, they gain an additional level of restrained. You gain +2 to all checks related to capturing, restraining, or controlling other creatures.

### Xi'ivrach (Stone Bearers)

The Xi'ivrach are deeply religious orcs who have built their entire culture around devotion to their stone gods. Living in the sacred lands of Jeh Bli, they wear elaborate stone jewelry and garments as acts of worship, their bodies strengthened over generations to bear these tremendous weights. Their skin is marked with intricate ritual scarification that tells the stories of their faith and accomplishments.

Their priests are among the few mortals who have mastered fragments of Deoric, the language of truth, using it to channel divine power through their scarred flesh. The Xi'ivrach believe that the weight of stone brings them closer to their gods, and that each scar is a prayer written in flesh.

#### Aspects

- Bearer of sacred stones
- Scarred vessel of divine truth

#### Stone Bearer's Strength

**Passive ability.**
Your body has adapted to bearing tremendous weight as an act of worship. You treat your might die as one size larger for determining encumbrance, and armor penalties to movement are reduced by 5 feet (minimum 0). When wearing stone ornaments or jewelry worth at least 100 ducats, you gain +1 to all presence checks when dealing with religious matters. If you have ritual scarification covering at least half your body, you may use your might die instead of your presence die when making religious or intimidation checks, as your devotion is written in your flesh.
