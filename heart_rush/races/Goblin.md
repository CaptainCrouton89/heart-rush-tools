## Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all raised together, with no knowledge of their specific mother. The brood-father, over the course of his lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen, who will mother the next brood-father—the first born son.

Most goblins live in communities around a single goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and friends are one's half-siblings. This can lead to bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict. Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

### Cooperative

**Passive ability.**
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or take the help action in combat, you provide two levels of advantage rather than one, and they may add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin, they gain three levels of advantage instead.

### Scalawag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature. They are viewed more as pests than as people by many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat similar to that of ants. However; living among Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are born into enormous broods, and are expected to defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will spend most of their lives doing just that, along with anything else they feel like doing. Besides the general wellbeing of the community, though, scalawags have few other obligations, and will sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.

Scalawag can be found across the mountains and scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are known for their incredible performers, parties, and oddly enough, philosophers.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally turbulent
- Impulsive and improvisational

#### Ankle biter

**Passive ability.**
Rules for moving through and climbing on creatures larger than yourself apply even if the creature is only one size larger than you. You have advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same space as a hostile creatures provides one level of cover from attacks from all other creatures.

### Etherweaver

Etherweavers get their name for their longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every goblin is born with an attunement to one of those elements.

Etherweavers are generally more reserved and cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value preparation, and are usually more conscientious, even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at protecting their broods using magic, and therefore require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a greater sense of individuality among the etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.

The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.

#### Aspects

- Level-headed
- Reflective and thoughtful

#### Etherweaver

**Passive ability.**
Choose and gain two attunements from the following list:

- Time
- Void
- Force
- Light
- Dark

### Coghead

The Cogheads are ingenious goblins who have embraced the marriage of flesh and machinery. Living within a massive hollowed-out machine in Kobuk, they have spent generations perfecting the art of mechanical augmentation, replacing or enhancing their natural body parts with intricate contraptions and gear-driven devices.

These goblins harbor a particular hatred for the Echean gnomes, viewing them as inferior tinkerers who lack the courage to truly commit to their craft. Where gnomes merely build external devices, Cogheads integrate machinery directly into their bodies, becoming living testaments to their engineering prowess.

#### Aspects

- Flesh is weakness, gears are strength
- Gnomes are inferior tinkerers

#### Tinkerer

**Passive ability.**
Through tinkering and contraption building, you have found a way to improve on your body's natural features. Choose one of the following modifications:

- **Spectacles:** Multi-lens glasses with infrared vision (90 feet), light inversion, and telescopic capabilities (10x magnification).
- **Rocket Boots:** Aether-powered boots that increase move speed by 10 feet and allow jumping 10 feet with 50-foot glide speed.
- **Multi-tool:** Replaced arm containing circular saw, knives, pliers, wrenches, torch, and lock picks. Grants advantage on tool-related skill checks.

You may spend 4 XP to gain additional modifications from this list.

### Darkling

The Darklings are pitch-black goblins who dwell in the shadowy realm of Lethos, their skin so dark it seems to absorb light itself. These unsettling creatures have adapted to perpetual darkness, subsisting on a diet of rodents and bats while developing an unnatural mastery over shadow itself.

Unlike other goblins, Darklings are genuinely frightening, their darkness attunement creating impenetrable shadows that only they can see through. They move like living nightmares through their underground lairs, and those who encounter them in the dark rarely live to tell the tale.

#### Aspects

- Child of eternal darkness
- Predator in the shadows

#### Umbral Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to darkness. Darkness you create cannot be seen through by any creature except other Darklings, and cannot be dispelled except by magical light. You have darkvision out to 120 feet and can see perfectly in any darkness, magical or natural.

### Rudding

The Ruddings are small, mysterious goblins with beady red eyes who inhabit the otherworldly copper and brick temples of the Copper Hills. These enigmatic creatures are driven by an unrelenting sense of justice and vengeance, carefully tracking every slight and wrong committed against them or their kin.

Despite their vengeful nature, Ruddings are remarkably skilled Deoric enchanters who have domesticated the massive Desert Mammoths. They will pursue slow, methodical revenge against wrongdoers unless proper reparations are offered in the form of copper or copper jewelry, which they prize above all else.

#### Aspects

- Vengeance delayed is vengeance perfected
- Copper is the currency of justice

#### Blood Debt

**Passive ability.**
When a creature deals damage to you or wrongs you in a significant way, you may mark them for vengeance. You always know the general direction and distance to marked creatures within 10 miles. You have advantage on all attack rolls and skill checks made against marked creatures. You may remove this mark if they provide reparations worth at least 100 ducats in copper.

### Red Devil

The Red Devils are the most malevolent of all goblin subraces, small creatures with burning red eyes and hearts full of genuine evil. Like their Rudding cousins, they inhabit the Copper Hills, but where Ruddings pursue calculated vengeance, Red Devils simply revel in causing pain and suffering for its own sake.

These goblins take pleasure in tormenting others and have no sense of honor or justice. They are cruel, sadistic, and utterly without mercy, making them feared throughout the region as harbingers of misfortune and malice.

#### Aspects

- Cruelty is its own reward
- Evil runs in my veins

#### Sadistic Glee

**Passive ability.**
Whenever you deal damage to a creature or cause a creature to gain a negative condition, you regain 1 hit point. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain 1 rush point at the start of the next round. You have advantage on intimidation checks against creatures that have witnessed your cruelty.

### Blitzling

The Blitzlings possess the strange and dangerous property of accumulating massive amounts of static electricity in their bodies before discharging it all at once in devastating electrical bursts. These energetic goblins inhabit the chain of hills south of the Dunes of Kunagi, in the settlement of Shyalaviin.

Their unique physiology makes them both fascinating and hazardous to be around, as they constantly crackle with barely contained electrical energy. When threatened or excited, they can release this stored power in spectacular and deadly displays.

#### Aspects

- Living lightning rod
- Electricity courses through me

#### Static Discharge

**Passive ability.**
You accumulate static charge throughout combat. At the start of each round, gain 1 charge point (maximum 5). As an action, you may discharge all stored charge, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per charge point to all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures wearing metal armor take double damage. You take half the total damage dealt.

### Mudzwiti

The Mudzwiti are tribal goblins who dwell in the dense Lyoki Ingi Ingi jungle, their bodies adorned with elaborate bone piercings and ritualistic scarification. These fierce warriors have formed a symbiotic relationship with the utahraptors that roam their jungle home, riding them into battle while wearing the skulls of fallen dinosaurs as helmets.

Their culture revolves around death and legacy, constructing incredibly elaborate tombs for their deceased leaders, complete with buried servants and accumulated riches. Their kings consume rare jungle plants that extend their lifespans dramatically, allowing them to accumulate vast wealth over centuries.

#### Aspects

- Dinosaur rider of the deep jungle
- Death builds the greatest monuments

#### Raptor Bond

**Passive ability.**
You have formed a bond with a utahraptor companion. The raptor has the stats of a riding horse but with a climb speed of 20 feet and the ability to make claw attacks (1d8 damage). If your raptor dies, you may spend a week in the jungle to bond with a new one. You have advantage on all checks related to dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures.

### Spine Goblin

The Spine Goblins are perhaps the most disturbing of all goblin subraces, afflicted with a leprosy-like disease that causes their bones to pierce through their skin. Their spinal columns protrude grotesquely from their backs, and rather than hide this deformity, they have embraced it by binding nails, spikes, and other sharp implements to their exposed bones.

These crude and malevolent creatures represent the darkest aspects of goblin nature, using their horrifying appearance and weaponized deformities to terrorize their enemies. They are among the most feared and reviled of all goblins, and for good reason.

#### Aspects

- My deformity is my weapon
- Pain has made me stronger

#### Bone Spikes

**Passive ability.**
Your exposed bones are fitted with sharp metal implements. Whenever a creature grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack, they take 1d4 piercing damage. You may use your bone spikes as ultralight piercing weapons. When you take damage, you may spend 1 rush point to cause the attacker to take 1d6 piercing damage if they are within 5 feet.

### Wydling

Wydlings, also known as icelings, are the frost-touched cousins of the goblin family tree. Born in the frozen wastes and glacial caverns of the far north, these pale blue goblins have adapted to survive in the harshest cold. Unlike their more communal relatives, Wydling broods are smaller and more nomadic, following the seasonal migrations of their prey across the tundra. Their razor-sharp icicle teeth have evolved to strip frozen meat from bones and crack through ice to reach fish below.

Wydling society values patience and cunning over the impulsiveness of their southern kin. They are master hunters and trackers, capable of waiting motionless in snowdrifts for hours before striking. Their long noses serve a practical purpose—warming frigid air before it reaches their lungs and detecting the faintest scents carried on arctic winds. While other goblins might gather in hundreds, Wydlings move in small hunting packs of extended family, each member knowing their role in the hunt.

Those Wydlings who venture south often find work as guides through mountain passes, ice sculptors, or surprisingly effective fishmongers—their natural affinity for cold keeping goods fresh far longer than normal.

#### Aspects

- Patient predator
- Cold pragmatism over warm emotions

#### Frostbite

**Passive ability.**  
Your icy heritage grants you several adaptations. You are immune to the effects of freezing temperatures and take half damage from cold-based attacks. Your razor-sharp teeth count as ultralight piercing weapons. Additionally, when you bite a creature you are grappling or that is restrained, they take 1d6 damage and gain one level of slowed as numbing cold spreads from your icy fangs.
