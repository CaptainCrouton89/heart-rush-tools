## Myushli

The Myushli are perhaps the most unsettling of the civilized races—mushroom folk whose genuine kindness masks a terrifying biological imperative. Standing roughly human height, their bodies are composed of spongy fungal matter topped with wide caps that serve as both head and hat. They speak in soft, melodious voices and genuinely care for visitors to their underground settlements, offering warm beds and hearty fungal stews.

Yet this hospitality hides a dark truth: the Myushli reproduce through spores that can take control of other creatures' bodies. They see nothing wrong with this process, viewing it as a beautiful transformation rather than the horrifying possession it appears to others. Their settlements are often filled with "converts"—former travelers who now serve the collective with glassy eyes and perpetual smiles.
