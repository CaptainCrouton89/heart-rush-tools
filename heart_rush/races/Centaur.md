## Centaur

The Centaurs of Siquestrya are a proud and volatile race, possessing the upper bodies of humanoids and the lower bodies of powerful horses. They are quick to anger and prone to violence, valuing strength and speed above all other virtues. Centaur society is nomadic and herd-based, roaming the vast plains and trampling anyone foolish enough to cross their path.

They view bipedal races with a mixture of pity and contempt, seeing them as slow and fragile. To a Centaur, the thundering of hooves is the heartbeat of the world, and a life spent inside walls is a life wasted. Their herds follow ancient migration routes, and the arrival of a centaur herd is an event that sends most settlements into a panic.

### Thundering Charge

**Major ability.**
When you move at least 30 feet in a straight line and make a melee attack, you deal an additional 1d8 damage and the target must make a Might saving throw against CN 12 or be knocked prone. If the target is smaller than you, they are also pushed 10 feet away from you.

### Hoof Strike

**Passive ability.**
Your hooves are deadly natural weapons that count as light bludgeoning weapons. You can make hoof attacks even when your hands are occupied. Once per round, as a reaction when a creature enters or leaves a space adjacent to you, you may make a single hoof attack against them.
