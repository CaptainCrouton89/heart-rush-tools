## Lyzine

The Lyzine are fallen nobility whose pride remains unbroken despite their exile to the depths below. With the graceful torsos of elegant humanoids seamlessly joined to the powerful, chitinous bodies of giant spiders, they embody both beauty and horror. Once rulers of great surface kingdoms, they were banished to the underground realms of Mez after their arrogance and cruelty became too much for even their subjects to bear.

Every year, the Lyzine attempt to reclaim their "rightful" place on the surface, sending expeditions to establish new footholds in the world above. They view themselves as inherently superior beings temporarily displaced by the jealousy and ignorance of lesser races. Their underground cities are marvels of web-architecture and dark elegance, maintained by strict hierarchies that mirror their lost surface kingdoms.

Despite their exile, the Lyzine have retained their sophisticated culture, complete with elaborate courts, intricate political maneuvering, and a refined aesthetic sense. They are skilled in both diplomacy and warfare, though their overwhelming pride often makes peaceful coexistence difficult.

### Arachnid Heritage

**Passive ability.**
You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed and can move across webs and similar surfaces without penalty. You can produce silk strong enough to support your weight, creating 50 feet of rope as an action. Additionally, you have advantage on checks to intimidate or impress others with displays of nobility or superiority.

### Web Weaver

**Heart ability. Full action.**
You can rapidly spin webs to control the battlefield. Choose a 20-foot square area within 30 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and creatures that enter or start their turn in the webbed area must make an agility saving throw against your cunning challenge number or become restrained. Creatures can break free with a successful might check against the same CN. The webs last for 10 minutes or until destroyed.
