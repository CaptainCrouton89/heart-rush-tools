## Gillykin

The Gillykin are the cheerful amphibians of rivers and wetlands, their bulbous eyes and wide mouths giving them an expression of perpetual surprise. These frog-like humanoids bound through life with infectious enthusiasm, their powerful legs carrying them in great leaps that defy their small stature. Their skin ranges from bright greens to deep blues, often mottled with patterns unique to each individual.

Despite their jovial nature, Gillykin face a constant challengeâ€”their amphibian biology demands regular submersion in water. This need shapes their settlements, which cluster around rivers, lakes, and specially constructed pools. Many Gillykin who venture into dry lands carry large water skins not for drinking, but for emergency skin-wetting.

### Aspects

- Eternally optimistic
- Needs water to survive

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 3-4 ft
- **Weight:** 40-80 lbs
- **Max Age:** 70

### Hoppy

**Passive ability.**

Rather than moving any amount of distance up to your move speed, you get two hops each turn. With each hop you may move up to half your move speed. Ignore all difficult terrain, enemies, and opportunity attacks between your starting location and ending location. Whenever you hop, you may forgo any amount of horizontal distance for half as much vertical height.

### Amphibious

**Passive ability.**

You can breathe underwater and gain a swim speed equal to half your move speed. If you do not submerge yourself in water for 5 minutes once a week, your skin dries out and you begin to die. For each week that passes without submersion, your maximum hit points fall by 20.
