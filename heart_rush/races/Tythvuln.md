## Tythvuln

The Tythvuln are a race of vulture-headed humanoids who serve as the eternal guardians of an ancient undead giant, their entire culture built around this sacred duty. With black-feathered heads, sharp beaks, and keen eyes that can spot movement from miles away, they circle endlessly above their charge on powerful wings, watching for any who might disturb its slumber.

These carrion priests have developed a complex religious philosophy around death and undeath, viewing themselves as shepherds of the boundary between life and death. They consume only carrion, seeing it as a sacred act that prevents the unworthy dead from rising as undead. Their settlements are built into cliff faces surrounding their giant ward, with bone architecture that creates haunting whistles when the wind blows through.

The Tythvuln believe that when their giant finally awakens, it will lead them to establish a new world order where death and undeath exist in perfect balance. Until then, they maintain their vigil, generation after generation, never wavering in their duty.
