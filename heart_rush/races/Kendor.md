## Kendor

The Kendor are an ancient aquatic people whose grace and beauty are matched only by their mastery of courtly intrigue. Evolved from seahorses in the warm tropical seas, they have developed into bipedal beings who can thrive both in water and on land, though they vastly prefer their hidden underwater palaces. Their elongated, elegant forms move with hypnotic fluidity, and their iridescent scales shift color with their moods and intentions.

Kendor society revolves around elaborate courtship rituals, political maneuvering, and the cultivation of beauty in all its forms. Violence is considered the ultimate vulgarity—a last resort for those who lack the wit and charm to achieve their goals through more civilized means. Their hidden fortress-cities are marvels of coral architecture and bioluminescent gardens, accessible only to those who know the secret currents and can navigate the maze-like approaches.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7.5 feet (including decorative fin crests)
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds

### Aquatic Grace

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe both air and water, and suffer no disadvantage for skill checks or AD rolls made underwater. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet while both you and the target are underwater. On land, you must immerse yourself in water for at least 10 minutes during each long rest or gain a level of weakened that doesn't fade until you do so.

### Kendrel (Court Kendor)

The Kendrel embody the highest ideals of Kendor society—masters of etiquette, romance, and social manipulation. Their scales shimmer with pearl-like iridescence, and they decorate themselves with cultivated coral jewelry and woven kelp garments of impossible intricacy. Every movement is a calculated dance, every word chosen for maximum impact.

In their hidden palace-fortresses beneath tropical reefs, the Kendrel engage in elaborate games of courtship and politics that can span decades. They view violence as beneath them, preferring to destroy enemies through social exile, romantic humiliation, or financial ruin. Many Kendrel who venture to the surface world become diplomats, matchmakers, or advisors to powerful nobles who value their supernatural understanding of social dynamics.

#### Aspects

- Master of courtly intrigue
- Violence is beneath me

#### Mesmerizing Presence

**Major ability.**
Your beauty and grace can stop conflicts before they begin. When combat would begin, you may use this ability before initiative is rolled. Each creature makes cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. Each creature that fails becomes unable to take hostile actions against you for the next minute unless you or your allies attack them first. Affected creatures may still defend themselves if attacked. This ability has no effect on creatures that are already in combat or have been in combat with you within the last hour.

### Cendoriln (Abyss Kendor)

Where the Kendrel embrace light and beauty, the Cendoriln have adapted to the crushing darkness of deep ocean trenches. Their scales are darker—deep purples, blacks, and midnight blues—with bioluminescent patterns they can control at will. The "nasty" reputation they've earned comes from their willingness to do what other Kendor won't: engage in violence when necessary, though they still prefer manipulation and fear to direct confrontation.

The Cendoriln's hidden fortresses lie in underwater caves and thermal vents, places where even other aquatic races fear to venture. They are master secret-keepers and blackmailers, trading in information that could topple kingdoms. Their courtship rituals involve elaborate displays of bioluminescence and tests of mental fortitude rather than the Kendrel's focus on beauty and charm.

#### Aspects

- Secrets are currency
- I thrive where others fear to swim

#### Abyssal Intimidation

**Passive ability.**
You can control your bioluminescent patterns to unnerve and disorient. You have advantage on intimidation checks, and when you successfully intimidate a creature, they also gain one level of dazed. Additionally, in darkness or dim light, you can shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 10-feet beyond as a free action.

### Pelaendor (Wanderer Kendor)

Some Kendor have abandoned the hidden fortresses entirely, becoming nomadic wanderers who travel the ocean currents and occasionally venture onto land. The Pelaendor have adapted to life between worlds, their scales taking on sandy, mottled patterns that help them blend into various environments. They serve as the primary ambassadors between Kendor society and the surface world.

Unlike their fortress-dwelling kin, the Pelaendor have learned that sometimes violence, while regrettable, is necessary for survival. They maintain the Kendor appreciation for beauty and social grace but temper it with practicality. Many become traders, messengers, or guides, using their ability to navigate both underwater and terrestrial societies.

#### Aspects

- Comfortable in any current
- Bridge between worlds

#### Adaptive Camouflage

**Major ability.**
Your scales can shift color and pattern to match your surroundings, and you can blend into crowds or natural environments with ease. As an action, you can become nearly invisible automatically succeeding on a check to hide and become obscured, even in bright light. If you move or attack, you lose this effect and are visible once more.
