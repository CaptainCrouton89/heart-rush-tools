## Ayblek

The ayblek are enigmatic beings from the distant realm of Instraxofinum, where the very nature of existence operates on principles alien to mortal comprehension. A single ayblek was brought to this world by a curious traveling mage, and from that lone individual, all ayblek in Pyonokraus have spawned through their peculiar asexual reproduction.

With their four arms constantly in motion and minds that process information at bewildering speeds, the ayblek are perpetually understimulated by the comparatively sluggish pace of mortal life. To compensate, they gravitate toward centers of chaos and activity—battlefields, bustling marketplaces, political upheavals—anywhere multiple threads of action converge. They pursue goals that seem arbitrary or nonsensical to other races, following internal logic chains that can span centuries and involve collecting specific grains of sand or counting the number of times a particular word is spoken in their presence.

Though they understand concepts of morality intellectually, empathy remains foreign to their psychology. An ayblek might save a drowning child not from compassion, but because the child's survival factors into some incomprehensible personal objective they established decades ago.

### Meditative Trance

**Passive ability.**

You don't need to sleep. Instead, you enter a meditative trance for 4 hours to gain the benefits of a long rest. While in this trance, you remain conscious and aware of your surroundings but have disadvantage on all skill checks and cannot take actions. You automatically succeed on sleeping checks when taking a long rest.
