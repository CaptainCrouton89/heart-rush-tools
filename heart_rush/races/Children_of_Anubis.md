## Children of Anubis

Anubis is one of several servants of Kahz, Lord of Malstaris. Anubis is in charge of ensuring that the shadows of the dead make it to Malstaris, and stay there, as well as weighing their souls for determining whether they enter the Gardens of Glyss—a paradise in Kahz's palace—or the Black Wastes—the name given to everything beyond.

Long ago, while on a trip to the material plane, Anubis had children with a mortal, who then gave birth to the first children of Anubis. Every child of Anubis passes on their heritage to their children, and thus the bloodline does not wane.

All children are born with the ability to communicate with Anubis on Malstaris. As they grow up, they can choose to serve Anubis, or turn their back on him and leave his guidance forever. This choice typically manifests during adolescence, marking them forever as either Servants or Forsaken.

Regardless of which path they follow, all children of Anubis are capable of weighing the souls of those they touch, an inheritance from their divine ancestor that allows them to perceive the moral weight of a person's deeds.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5.5-6.5 feet
- **Weight:** 120-200 pounds
- **Max Age:** 160 years

### Weigher of Souls

**Passive ability.**

As an action, you may place your hand on a creature's chest to weigh their soul. When you do so, you learn:

- The weight of the creature's soul. If it is heavier than a feather, then the creature is unjust and deceitful. If it is lighter, then the opposite.
- What the last deceitful thing the creature said was.

### Servants of Anubis

Those who choose to serve their ancestral father become known as Servants of Anubis. They dedicate their lives to maintaining the natural order of death, ensuring that souls reach their proper destination in Malstaris and that none return to trouble the living. These children are famous for their work hunting liches, destroying the undead, and guiding lost souls to their final rest.

Servants often work as undertakers, exorcists, or wandering death-speakers, traveling from town to town to perform last rites and eliminate undead threats. They wear their connection to Anubis proudly, often adorning themselves with jackal imagery and carrying ankhs as symbols of their divine duty.

#### Aspects

- Duty to the natural order of death
- Death is sacred, undeath is abomination

#### Guardian of the Veil

**Passive ability.**

Anubis grants you power to fulfill your sacred duty. You gain the following abilities:

- You can sense any undead within 60 feet, even if they are hidden or invisible.
- When you make an attack against an undead creature, add 1d6 to your attack roll.
- Once per day, when you touch a corpse that died within the last hour, you may speak with it for up to one minute. The corpse can answer questions about its death and final moments.

### Forsaken of Anubis

Those who turn away from Anubis's guidance become the Forsaken, choosing to wield their inherited powers for their own purposes. Rather than allow their ancestral father to weigh souls for judgment, they choose to deliver justice themselves, acting as both judge and executioner. Like their father, they can feed souls to Ammit, devourer of souls. While Anubis only sends the most corrupted souls to be devoured, the Forsaken are bound by no such restrictions.

Feeding souls to Ammit is dangerous, for Ammit is eternally hungry and sometimes takes more than offered. The Forsaken walk a razor's edge between power and damnation, using their divine heritage as a weapon rather than a responsibility.

#### Aspects

- Judge, jury, and executioner
- Power justifies itself

#### Ammit's Justice

**Major ability.**

You begin to feed a still-living person's soul to Ammit. You may spend an action to cause an incapacitated creature that you are touching to decrease its heart die any number of times. Then roll 1d6. If the result is less than the number of levels you decreased, you lose an equal number of levels of your own heart die. If a creature would have its heart die decreased and it cannot fall any further, it instead falls to 0 hit points. If the creature is already at 0 hit points, or would lose two levels of its heart die while at its minimum, it dies.
