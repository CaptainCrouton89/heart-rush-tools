## Bogies

The Bogies are humble frog-folk who have built their peaceful civilization in the wetlands of Kosko. Standing only three to four feet tall with mottled green and brown skin, they appear unassuming and even primitive to outsiders. Their villages of reed huts and mud structures blend seamlessly into the swamps they call home, and their simple lifestyle revolves around fishing, farming bog plants, and crafting.

However, the Bogies harbor one of Alaria's deadliest secrets: they produce the most toxic venoms in the known world. Their skin naturally secretes a variety of poisons that they carefully harvest and refine into weapons of terrifying potency. Despite this lethal capability, Bogies are fundamentally peaceful, preferring to hide rather than fight. When threatened, they can disappear into their bogs, submerging themselves in mud and water for months at a time, entering a hibernation-like state until danger passes.

Their philosophy of conflict avoidance has allowed them to survive for millennia in lands that others might try to conquer, simply by being too troublesome to catch and too dangerous to corner.

Your skin constantly produces poison. Any creature that grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack takes 1 level of poisoned. You are immune to all poisons. Once per day, you can harvest your own toxins to apply to a weapon, granting it the ability to inflict 2 levels of poisoned on hit for the next hour.

### Bog Hibernation

**Major ability.**
You can enter a state of suspended animation by burying yourself in mud or submerging in swamp water. While hibernating, you don't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and you can remain hidden for up to 3 months. You have tremorsense out to 30 feet while buried and can choose to wake at any time. Creatures must succeed on a CN 18 perception check to notice you while hibernating.
