## Satyr

The Satyr are creatures of primal passion and bloody revelry who have embraced their wild nature completely. With the upper bodies of humanoids and the lower bodies of goats, they reject the constraints of civilized clothing and armor, preferring to live as nature intended. Their culture revolves around ecstatic dances performed to haunting pipe music, often culminating in frenzied celebrations drenched in the blood of their prey.

These beings feed not just on blood, but on the raw emotion and chaos of the hunt and the kill. They are most alive during their blood-soaked festivities, where one plays the pipes while others dance themselves into transcendent states of violence and joy. To outsiders, these rituals appear horrifying, but to the Satyr they represent the purest expression of life itself.

Normal clothing and armor cannot accommodate their unique physiology, forcing them to rely on their natural resilience and supernatural abilities. They view civilized society with a mixture of pity and contempt, seeing it as a denial of the wild truth that courses through all living things.

### Blood Frenzy

**Major ability. Instant.**
When you kill a creature, you may shower yourself in its blood to enter an uncontrollable frenzy. For the next minute, you have A2 on all attack rolls and cannot choose the defensive stance. You must attack if able, prioritizing the nearest enemy.

### Enchanting Pipes

**Major ability. Full action.**
You play haunting melodies on your magical pipes. Choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear you. That creature must make a cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. On a failure, they are charmed by you for the next hour and compelled to dance to your music, giving them D2 on all rolls. The charm immediately ends if you attack them, and they know they were charmed when the effect ends.
