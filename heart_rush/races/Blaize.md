## Blaize

The Blaize are enigmatic humanoids whose very existence seems to flicker between states of being, their blue-tinged skin constantly shifting in subtle ways that make them difficult to focus on. These emotion-feeding beings were once enslaved across the western regions of Alaria, bred for their supernatural speed and used as messengers, scouts, and worse. Though now free, the scars of their servitude run deepâ€”they are pathologically suggestible, finding it nearly impossible to resist direct commands or strong suggestions.

The Blaize survive by feeding on the emotional energy of those around them, creating a tragic cycle of dependency. They gravitate toward populated areas where emotions run high, yet their presence often provokes fear and mistrust, leading to abuse that ironically provides the very emotional sustenance they need. This horrific symbiosis has shaped their culture into one of constant movement and careful social navigation.

Their incredible speed allows them to literally run on water, their feet moving so rapidly that surface tension becomes solid ground. When threatened or excited, their skin flickers more intensely, creating a disorienting strobe effect that can nauseate those who stare too long.

### Aspects

- Too fast to catch, too weak to resist
- I need your emotions to survive

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 80-120 pounds

### Flicker Speed

**Passive ability.**

Your body exists in a state of constant motion, flickering between moments. Your movement speed increases by 40 feet. You can run across liquid surfaces as if they were solid ground, and you may continue moving on liquid for up to 10 feet after you stop moving before falling in.

Additionally, your flickering nature makes you difficult to pin down. You have advantage on saving throws against being restrained or grappled, and creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you.

### Emotional Parasite

**Passive ability.**
You sustain yourself on the ambient emotional energy of others. Once per day, you must feed on emotions in one of the following ways:

- Spend at least 1 hour within 30 feet of 5 or more people
- Remain within 30 feet of someone experiencing emotional extremes (fear, rage, grief, or ecstasy) for at least 10 minutes
- Make physical contact with a willing creature and share in their emotional state for 5 minutes, gaining one level of any mental condition they have (this feeds you but doesn't remove their condition)

If you fail to feed for a day, you gain one level of weakened and one level of mental vulnerability. For each additional day without feeding, both conditions increase by one level. These conditions are removed one hour after feeding.

**Suggestible Nature**  
_Passive ability._  
You must make a CN 8 presence saving throw against any direct command or strong suggestion made to you. You may spend DP up to your highest aspect rank and add that to your roll. If you fail, you feel compelled to follow the suggestion for the next minute unless it would directly harm you.
