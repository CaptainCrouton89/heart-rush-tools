## Blaize

The Blaize are enigmatic humanoids whose very existence seems to flicker between states of being, their blue-tinged skin constantly shifting in subtle ways that make them difficult to focus on. These emotion-feeding beings were once enslaved across the western regions of Alaria, bred for their supernatural speed and used as messengers, scouts, and worse. Though now free, the scars of their servitude run deepâ€”they are pathologically suggestible, finding it nearly impossible to resist direct commands or strong suggestions.

The Blaize survive by feeding on the emotional energy of those around them, creating a tragic cycle of dependency. They gravitate toward populated areas where emotions run high, yet their presence often provokes fear and mistrust, leading to abuse that ironically provides the very emotional sustenance they need. This horrific symbiosis has shaped their culture into one of constant movement and careful social navigation.

Their incredible speed allows them to literally run on water, their feet moving so rapidly that surface tension becomes solid ground. When threatened or excited, their skin flickers more intensely, creating a disorienting strobe effect that can nauseate those who stare too long.

### Aspects

- Too fast to catch, too weak to resist
- I need your emotions to survive

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 5-6 feet
- **Weight:** 80-120 pounds

### Flicker Speed

**Passive ability.**
Your movement speed increases by 40 feet. You can run across liquid surfaces as if they were solid ground, but if you end your movement on liquid, you fall in. When you dash, your flickering form grants you +2 defense against opportunity attacks.

### Emotional Parasite

**Heart ability.**
You feed on the strong emotions of others. When a creature within 30 feet experiences intense emotion (gains or loses a mental condition, takes a wound, or at GM's discretion), you may gain hit points equal to your heart die. However, when someone gives you a direct command, you must make a presence saving throw against their presence challenge number or be compelled to follow it for the next minute.
