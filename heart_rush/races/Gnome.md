## Gnome

Gnomes are small, naturally magical creatures, resembling miniature humans. They range in height from two to three feet, and are frequently quite slender and nimble. Gnomish adventurers are generally more magically adept than hearty, and will often have entire sleeves of handmagic tattoos stretching up their arms.

### Vitals

- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

**Passive ability.**
Handmagic talents and their destiny levels cost 2 less XP, and increasing your maximum hit point costs 1 more XP. Your size is small.

### Goshwen (Hill Gnome)

If there is one thing that can be said about Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get into trouble all the time—but they are definitely clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves, merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons. While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and competent.

Goshwen's culture of openness and constant change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of their communities. This has given rise to many different branches of Goshwen communities across Alaria with different quirks and identities. However, all of them maintain their appreciation for progress and wit.

#### Aspects

- Creative
- Let's just see what happens!

#### Clever

**Passive ability.**
You gain the talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with it's destiny level.

### Ezuri (Tree Gnome)

The Ezuri, or "tree people" as it translates to from Old Gnomish, stemmed from when Mad Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the forest dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters. While many fled the jungle, some were trapped, and forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty places.

The Ezuri also value connection with each other as well as the natural world around them, and are taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a young age. This, combined with their natural affinity for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger humanoids across Alaria.

#### Aspects

- Insightful
- Compassionate

#### Speaker for the Small

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Nature's Child talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level.

### Foxborne (Noble Gnome)

The Foxborne are a gallant and noble breed of gnomes who dwell in the picturesque Cherry Blossom Valley. These refined gnomes have formed deep bonds with foxes, riding them as mounts and treating them as honored companions rather than mere beasts. Their society is built around chivalric ideals and courtly traditions, making them perhaps the most aristocratic of all gnomish communities.

The Foxborne value honor, loyalty, and grace above all else. Their cherry blossom-adorned settlements are marvels of elegant architecture, and their mounted cavalry units are both beautiful and formidable in combat.

#### Aspects

- Noble bearing
- Honor before all

#### Vulpine Bond

**Passive ability.**
You gain a fox as a loyal mount and companion. The fox has the stats of a Beast Companion with d6/d6/d4/d4 abilities, 25 hit points, and a d8 heart die. It can carry you without penalty and has a move speed of 50 feet. If your fox dies, you can bond with a new one after a week of mourning.

### Bloodlings (Vampire Gnome)

The Bloodlings are pale, translucent-skinned gnomes who dwell in the dark caves of the Chimean Blood Mountains. These vampiric gnomes have adapted to a life sustained by blood rather than traditional sustenance, developing an eerie, ghostly appearance that reflects their unnatural dietary needs.

Living in complete darkness for generations, the Bloodlings have become masters of stealth and ambush. Their society is built around blood hierarchies, where status is determined by the quality and rarity of blood one can obtain.

### Neka (Savage Gnome)

The Neka are dark-skinned, feather-adorned gnomes who rule as apex predators in the Nekanzi Jungle. With filed teeth and wild hair, they live in mud and palm huts while maintaining a culture that seems primitive to outsiders but is actually highly sophisticated in its own way. They consume raw animals and have been known to eat intruders, though they maintain complex customs around peace talks and greetings.

Despite their seemingly poor material culture, the Neka create fantastic tombs and have mastered fire magic for hunting and combat. They can imitate any animal sound and have no written language, passing knowledge through oral tradition.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator
- Fire and fang

#### Primal Mimic

**Passive ability.**
You can perfectly imitate any animal sound you have heard. You have a basic attunement to fire. You gain +2 to intimidation checks against creatures that have seen you eat raw meat, and your bite counts as an ultralight weapon.

### Ohblex (Gem Gnome)

The Ohblex are crystalline gnomes born from the gems and jewels deep within the Gemstone Peaks. Their skin reflects the colors of precious stones, and they sustain themselves by consuming a few gems each year rather than traditional food. Masters of clockwork and the sole keepers of clockmaking secrets on Nin, they craft incredible mechanical devices and jewelry.

The Ohblex live in elaborate underground mazes filled with mechanical traps, endlessly scheming against rival family houses in complex political games. They value secrecy, mystery, and complication above all else.

#### Aspects

- Lover of mysteries
- Gemstone heritage

#### Clockwork Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You do not need to eat normal food, instead consuming gems worth 10 ducats per month. You have advantage on checks to create, understand, or disable mechanical devices. You know the secrets of clockmaking and can craft complex mechanical items that others cannot replicate.

### Shyoka Saseidi (Beast Tender Gnome)

The Shyoka Saseidi are light-skinned, curly-haired gnomes who dwell in dens beneath the great pine trees of Nykotheryx Amberylika. While their Luma neighbors tend the trees, these gnomes serve as caretakers for all forest fauna. They maintain close relationships with badgers, squirrels, rabbits, and foxes, often wearing badger pelts as marks of respect.

Their society revolves around the sacred but dangerous dragon totems scattered throughout their forest, with only specially chosen priests permitted to approach these powerful artifacts.

#### Aspects

- Guardian of the wild
- Reverent of ancient powers

#### Forest Kinship

**Passive ability.**
You gain advantage on all skill checks involving small woodland creatures (badgers, squirrels, rabbits, foxes). You can communicate basic concepts with these animals and they will not attack you unless magically compelled. You have advantage on checks to track or navigate in forested terrain.

### Techgnomes (Lost Gnome)

The Techgnomes were once the most technologically advanced gnomes on Alaria, creators of incredible mechanical wonders including the mighty mechwurm. However, their greatest creation turned against them, and their civilization was virtually destroyed. Now essentially extinct, the few remaining Techgnomes wander as living relics of a lost age.

These surviving gnomes carry with them fragments of forgotten knowledge and broken mechanical devices, serving as both a warning about unchecked ambition and a repository of lost technological secrets.

#### Aspects

- Last of a lost age
- Technology's double edge

#### Mechanical Remnant

**Passive ability.**
You begin play with a damaged but functional mechanical device of your choice (subject to GM approval). You have advantage on checks to understand, repair, or operate technological devices. Once per day, you can jury-rig a simple mechanical solution to a problem using scrap materials.

### Qipi (Sinkhole Gnome)

The Qipi are the smallest of all gnome heritages, dwelling in the vast sinkhole cities of Tyberoskos. Generations of underground living have transformed these gnomes—their wrinkled green skin helps them blend with the mossy cavern walls, while their oversized eyes pierce through the perpetual twilight of their subterranean homes. Sharp, needle-like teeth have evolved to efficiently strip meat from the blind cave fish that populate their underground pools. Despite their somewhat fearsome appearance, the Qipi have developed a sophisticated culture centered around acoustic communication and echolocation, using complex clicking languages that echo through their vertical cities. They've mastered the art of fishing in complete darkness and have developed unique architectural techniques for building into sinkhole walls.

#### Aspects

- Vigilant
- Patient as stone

#### Eyes of the Deep

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Observant talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 30 feet and can see normally in dim light.

### Shyoka Saseidi (Fauna Keeper Gnome)

The Shyoka Saseidi of Nykotheryx Amberylika have long served as the forest's animal caretakers, complementing the Luma's role as tree-tenders. These pale-skinned, curly-haired gnomes build elaborate den networks beneath the protective boughs of ancient pines, creating comfortable homes that mirror the burrows of their beloved badgers. Their society revolves around the sacred dragon totems scattered throughout the forest—powerful artifacts they both revere and fear. Only specially trained priests, marked by ceremonial badger pelts, dare approach these totems to tend the creatures dwelling in their mystical auras. The Shyoka Saseidi have formed deep bonds with the forest's smaller creatures, particularly badgers, squirrels, rabbits, and foxes, learning their languages and sharing their lives. This connection runs so deep that many Shyoka Saseidi consider their animal companions to be family members rather than pets.

#### Aspects

- Protective
- Spiritually attuned

#### Totem-Blessed Bond

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Beast Companion talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. Your beast companion must be a badger, squirrel, rabbit, or fox. Additionally, you have advantage on all skill checks related to understanding or caring for forest animals.

### Whiteling (Prophet Gnome)

The Whitelings are perhaps the most mysterious and tragic of all gnome heritages. Their alabaster skin stretches taut over gaunt frames, giving them an ethereal, almost translucent appearance. These gnomes are blessed—or cursed—with the ability to perceive the threads of fate itself, their minds constantly awash with visions of possible futures. This gift comes at a terrible price: their bodies are frail as parchment, and their reproductive cycles occur perhaps once in a century. When Whitelings do mate, it is through elaborate rituals that can last days, treated with the solemnity of a religious sacrament. The resulting children, so rare and precious, are raised not by their parents but by specialized caretakers known as the Tuk-tuk—elderly Whitelings who have mastered the art of nurturing young prophets without overwhelming their developing minds.

Their extreme rarity and prophetic abilities make Whitelings objects of obsession throughout the world. Some cultures worship them as living oracles, building temples around solitary Whitelings and interpreting their every utterance. Others see them as tools to be captured and exploited, keeping them in gilded cages to divine military strategies or market trends. A free Whiteling is always in danger, for their very existence is both a blessing and a commodity. Most learn to speak in riddles and half-truths, not from duplicity but from self-preservation—for a prophecy too clearly spoken is a prophecy that invites intervention.

#### Aspects

- Fragile as glass
- Burdened by knowledge

#### Oracle's Burden

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Oracle talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have), along with its destiny level. However, your connection to the threads of fate has left your body withered: your maximum hit points start at 25 instead of 40, and increasing your maximum hit points costs 1 additional XP (stacking with the gnomish penalty for 2 total). Additionally, your might die can never be increased above a d6.
