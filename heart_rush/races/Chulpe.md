## Chulpe

Savage, bestial humanoids that combine the worst aspects of predatory animals with a cruel intelligence, the Chulpe are among the most feared races in the known world. These monstrous beings possess powerful, muscular bodies covered in coarse fur, with elongated snouts filled with razor-sharp teeth and claws capable of rending flesh from bone. While their intelligence varies between subspecies, all Chulpe share an insatiable hunger for meat—particularly humanoid flesh—and a pack-based social structure built around dominance, violence, and the hunt. Their origins are shrouded in mystery, with some scholars believing them to be the result of ancient magical experiments, while others claim they are simply evolution's answer to creating the perfect predator.

### Predatory Instincts

**Passive ability**

Your bestial nature grants you enhanced senses and combat reflexes. You have advantage on cunning checks to track creatures and detect threats. Additionally, you have darkvision out to 60 feet, and when you deal damage to a wounded creature (one that has taken a wound), you regain 2 hit points.

### Skree (The Pack Runners)

The smaller and more numerous of the Chulpe subspecies, Skree are vicious pack hunters roughly the size of large wolves. What they lack in individual strength compared to their Terrogone cousins, they more than make up for in speed, cunning, and sheer bloodthirsty aggression. Skree society is built around loose pack structures that form and dissolve based on hunting success and dominance displays. They are known for their hit-and-run tactics, using their superior numbers and coordination to bring down prey much larger than themselves.

Skree live in the harsh borderlands and wilderness areas, often competing with their larger Terrogone relatives for territory and prey. Their lean, wiry builds make them excellent climbers and runners, allowing them to pursue fleeing victims across virtually any terrain. While less intelligent than Terrogones, Skree possess a feral cunning that makes them expert ambush predators. They communicate through a complex series of growls, yips, and body language that allows entire packs to coordinate attacks with frightening efficiency.

The social structure of Skree packs is fluid and violent, with leadership constantly shifting as members challenge each other for dominance. They have no permanent settlements, instead following game trails and establishing temporary camps wherever the hunting is good. Skree reproduction is rapid, with large litters ensuring their numbers remain high despite their dangerous lifestyle and frequent conflicts with other predators.

#### Aspects

- Bloodthirsty pack hunter
- Recklessly aggressive

#### Pack Frenzy

**Passive ability**

Your violent nature intensifies when fighting alongside allies. When you are adjacent to an ally at the start of your turn, you gain one additional rush point. Additionally, when an adjacent ally deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that same creature until the end of the round.

### Terrogones (The Bone Crushers)

The massive, terrifying cousins of the Skree, Terrogones are apex predators that stand six feet high even when moving on all fours. These hulking monstrosities make their home in the savage wasteland of Echem Yiakraxis, where they have adapted to be the ultimate hunters in one of the world's most dangerous regions. Unlike their smaller Skree relatives, Terrogones possess enough intelligence to use crude tools, set elaborate traps, and employ sophisticated hunting strategies that have made them the undisputed masters of their domain.

Terrogone society is built around small family groups led by the largest and most successful hunters. These family units claim vast territories within Echem Yiakraxis, marking their borders with the bones of their victims and engaging in brutal conflicts with neighboring groups over prime hunting grounds. Their intelligence, while not matching that of most humanoid races, is sufficient for them to understand fear as a weapon, often keeping captured prey alive for days to terrorize other potential victims.

The physical presence of a Terrogone is overwhelming—their massive frames are covered in thick, mottled fur that provides protection against the harsh environment of their homeland, while their enormous heads house jaws capable of crushing armor and bone with equal ease. They have developed a complex relationship with the twisted ecosystem of Echem Yiakraxis, serving as both apex predator and, in some cases, protector of the region's most dangerous secrets. Their reproduction is slow and deliberate, with mated pairs raising their young together for several years before the offspring are strong enough to claim their own territory.

#### Aspects

- Apex predator with insatiable hunger
- Monstrous and intimidating presence

#### Crushing Might

**Passive ability**

Your massive size and strength make you a devastating opponent. You count as one size larger for the purposes of grappling, pushing, and intimidation checks. When you deal damage to a creature smaller than you with a melee attack, they must make a presence saving throw against your might challenge number or gain two levels of frightened toward you until the end of the encounter. Additionally, when using the might stance with heavy weapons, you may add your weapon die to the attack roll twice instead of once.
