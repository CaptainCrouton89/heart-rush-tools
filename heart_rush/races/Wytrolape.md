## Wytrolape

The Wytrolape are massive white-furred apes who embody the duality of peace and violence. For most of their lives, these intelligent beings are gentle giants, working as laborers in northern settlements, using their incredible strength for construction and other peaceful purposes. They have "civilized" themselves, learning to speak, use tools, and integrate into humanoid society with remarkable success.

However, the Wytrolape carry within them an ancient curse tied to the celestial cycles. When both moons vanish from the sky—an event they call the "war moon"—these peaceful creatures transform into berserk warriors of terrifying power. During these nights, they must be restrained or isolated, as they attack anything that moves with a fury that seems completely alien to their normal temperament.

This duality has shaped Wytrolape culture profoundly. They are constantly aware of their potential for violence, leading to a philosophy of extreme self-control and calendar awareness. Many wear special restraints they can activate when they feel the war moon approaching, while others retreat to isolated strongholds built specifically for these occasions.

**Passive ability.**
Your ape heritage grants you a climb speed equal to your movement speed and the ability to use your feet as hands for climbing. Your carrying capacity is doubled, and you count as one size larger for grappling. You have advantage on might checks to lift, break, or throw objects.

### War Moon Fury

**Major ability.**
When both moons are dark (or at GM's discretion, when you choose to activate this), you enter a berserk rage that lasts 1 hour. While raging:

- Your might-based attacks deal an additional 2d6 damage
- You gain 20 temporary hit points
- You must attack the nearest creature each round
- You cannot distinguish friend from foe
- You are immune to being charmed or frightened

You can attempt a CN 15 presence save at the end of each round to end this early.
