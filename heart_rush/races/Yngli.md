## Yngli

The Yngli are living reminders of the danger of careless words around vengeful cyclopes. These squat, one-eyed beings were once the faithful assistants in the great cyclops forges, using their inborn force attunement to accelerate hammers and move tools with mere thoughts. But when one of their number spoke too freely about their master's work, the betrayed cyclops cursed their entire race to eternal silence.

Now the Yngli struggle as second-class citizens across the Western Isles and Kura. Unable to negotiate, explain, or defend themselves verbally, they are easily exploited by those who separate them from their kin. Only when united under a rare telepath of their kind can they organize effectively, forming silent unions that communicate through gesture and force manipulation.

Long ago, a terrible curse was placed on all yngli, preventing them from ever speaking. Although they can produce sound with their mouths with enough concentration, the sounds that come out are garbled and incoherent.
