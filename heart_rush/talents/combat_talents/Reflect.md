## Reflect

_Major ability. Instant. Handmagic._

You bind your hit points to another creature's. Choose a creature within 30 feet. The next time you take damage, the chosen creature takes half as much damage, rounded down.

**Destiny Level:**
The creature takes as much damage as you take, instead.
