## Elemental Overdrive

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

When you first gain this talent, choose a spell you know. You may decrease your heart die to immediately regain the use of that spell. If the spell is ongoing, casting the spell again ends the original effect.
You may take this talent any number of times, choosing a different spell each time.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use this ability, you may cast the spell as a quick ability this round without using your action.
