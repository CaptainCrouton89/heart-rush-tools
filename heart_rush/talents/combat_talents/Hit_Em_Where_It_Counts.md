## Hit â€˜Em Where It Counts

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You may forgo any number of levels of advantage on an attack roll to instead get +1 to your attack roll for each level you forgo.

**Destiny Level:**
If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain an additional two levels of advantage.
