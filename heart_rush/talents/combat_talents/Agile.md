## Agile

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

When you choose the agility stance, you may sidestep twice instead of once.

**Destiny Level:**
Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D rolls made this round. Increase the die's size by one for each consecutive time you chose this stance.
