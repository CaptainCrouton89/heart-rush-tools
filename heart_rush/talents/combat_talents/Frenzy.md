## Frenzy

_Major ability. Cognitive talent._

For the next minute, treat this talent as an additional minor ability, with its own separate cost. Whenever you use this as a minor ability, choose one of your minor abilities and perform that effect. At the end of the minute, you gain a level of weakened, off-balanced, and dazed for each time you used this as a minor ability. These levels do not fade until you take a long rest.

**Destiny Level:**
Each time you use this as a minor ability, roll your heart die and regain that many hit points.
