## Critical Observation

_Major ability. Quick. Martial talent._

You may spend a minute examining a creature to try to identify a weakness in a creature's defenses. Make an observation (cunning) skill check contested by 8 plus the creature's defense bonus. On a success, you get AD2 on all attack rolls against the creature.
On success or failure, you cannot attempt to make another critical observation about that creature.

**Destiny Level:**
You may instead make the skill check contested by 12 plus the creature's defense bonus. On a success, you get AD4 on all attacks against the creature instead.
