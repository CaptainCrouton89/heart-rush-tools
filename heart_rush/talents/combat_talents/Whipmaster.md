## Whipmaster

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You may forgo making an attack roll with your whip to instead inflict one level of restrained on the creature until the end of the round. Whips you use are treated as light weapons rather than ultralight weapons.

**Destiny Level:**
In addition to restraining the creature, you may immediately jerk the whip back, knocking the creature prone so long as the creature is no more than one size larger than you. It takes 1d6 damage if it falls prone.
