## Divine Weapon

_Major ability. Quick. Cognitive talent._

Through the favor you hold with your patron, you may channel their power into your weapon, granting it magical properties for the next minute. Whenever you use this ability, your weapon takes on features that resemble the values of the patron you worship, and you get +2 on all of your attack rolls with that weapon.
You may instead spend a minute in prayer to activate this ability with double its effect.

**Destiny Level:**
You may forgo the +2 bonus that this talent provides, and instead work with your GM to develop a custom weapon ability fitting to your patron. You may take this destiny level multiple times, working with your GM each time you do so. For example, the weapon may inflict a level of burning on a hit, or heal the wielder a few hit points when it's used.
