## Judoka

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

So long as you are unarmed, whenever you are grappling, you may choose to also throw the grappled creature. You may move them to any open space adjacent to you. You and the creature become prone, and the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage. They remain grappled.

**Destiny Level:**
You have learned to choke. So long as you are unarmed and grappling a prone creature, the creature gains the suffocating condition. You cannot choke a creature that does not have a throat or does not need to breathe.
