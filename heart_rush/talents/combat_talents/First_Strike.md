## First Strike

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make an attack roll against a creature with hit points equal to its hit point capacity, add 1d6 to your attack roll. If you are the very first person to enter an engagement in an encounter, you may make an opportunity attack.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use this ability, the target creature takes your choice of three levels of dazed, weakened, or off-balanced.
