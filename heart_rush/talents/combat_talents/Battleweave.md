## Battleweave

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you sidestep, you deal damage to an adjacent creature at your new location equal to twice the number of enemies you began the round adjacent to.

**Destiny Level:**
You may choose to either deal twice as much damage to the target of this ability, or the same amount of damage to every adjacent enemy.
