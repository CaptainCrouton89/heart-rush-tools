## Maledict

_Minor ability. Instant. Martial talent._

When you or an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against a creature, you can invoke this curse to add 2 levels of a fading condition to the attack (choose from: weakened, off-balanced, dazed, shaken, or slowed). However, the curse takes its toll on you as well—you immediately take 1 level of the same condition you inflicted.

This ability represents a tactical sacrifice, allowing you to debilitate a dangerous foe at the cost of your own combat effectiveness.

**Destiny Level:**
You can apply up to 5 levels of the chosen condition to the attack. You take half as many levels (rounded up) of the same condition. If you would gain more than 5 levels of a condition by using this ability, you instead gain 1 level of mental vulnerability (for dazed or shaken) or physical vulnerability (for weakened, off-balanced, or slowed), based on the condition applied.
