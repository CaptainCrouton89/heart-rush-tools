## Sundering Blows

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make an attack roll with the might stance, using a heavy melee weapon against someone who chose the cunning stance, you may choose to permanently decrease the defense bonus from their armor by 2, to a minimum of 0. If the armor is natural, the penalty lasts until the creature heals all of its wounds. If it is physical armor, then the armor requires repairs before it can work effectively again.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures you hit with this ability can have a negative defense bonus.
