## Push Off

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Once per round, when you move adjacent to a wall or other piece of impassable terrain, you can sacrifice up to 10 feet of movement to immediately sidestep that many feet in a straight line, for free. Whenever you use this ability, you get advantage on your next A/D roll made in the same round if you make your A/D roll from where you ended your sidestep.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use this ability up to three times per round.
