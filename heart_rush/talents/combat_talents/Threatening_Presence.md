## Threatening Presence

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever a creature ends its turn adjacent to you without having entered an engagement with you or joined an engagement you were part of, it gains a level of aggravation towards you.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures aggravated at you cannot initiate engagements with creatures other than you so long as they are adjacent to you.
