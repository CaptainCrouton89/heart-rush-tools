## Imperial Defenses

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and fails to wound you, it gains one level of aggravated towards you. Additionally, you have advantage on defense rolls against creatures that are aggravated towards you.

**Destiny Level:**
If a creature's attack deals no damage to you, they gain five levels of aggravated towards you instead of one. You gain A2 on defense rolls against creatures that are aggravated towards you instead of advantage.
