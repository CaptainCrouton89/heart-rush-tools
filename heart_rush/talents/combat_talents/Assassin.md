## Assassin

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You have learned the art of debilitating your foes and killing them silently. When you enter an engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately make a might or agility check against their agility challenge number. On a success, you either gag them, garrote them, or in some other way remove their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.

**Destiny Level:**
Once per month, you may declare a humanoid to be the target of your assassination. So long as that creature never learns you are an assassin, they remain marked. Given you spend one month studying the target of your assassination before attempting to kill them, you have A5 on opportunity attacks made against your target, and advantage on all other attacks against it.
