## Chain Warden

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon that has the reach tag, you may pull that creature up to 10 feet closer to you. If they end their movement adjacent to you, you may immediately attempt to grapple them as a free action.

**Destiny Level:**
You may pull creatures up to 15 feet closer instead. You have A2 on grapple checks made with this ability. Alternatively, when you hit a creature with a reach weapon, you may tether yourself to that creature until the end of the round. While tethered, the creature gains the slowed condition and you are dragged behind the creature, maintaining a distance no greater than your current distance from them.
