## Blood Bond

_Passive ability. Handmagic._

Through Deoric runes tattooed with mixed blood, you create a mystical life-link between yourself and others. To establish a bond, you and another creature with this talent must spend one minute as a handmagic practitioner inscribes connecting runes on both participants using a mixture of their blood and titan blood.

Once bonded, you may freely transfer hit points between yourself and any bonded creature within 120 feet as an instant ability requiring no action. You may transfer up to 40 hit points per day in this way. Hit points transferred cannot exceed either creature's maximum.

You may be bonded to a number of creatures equal to your presence die.

**Destiny Level:**
The mystical connection transcends all distance - you may transfer hit points to bonded creatures anywhere in existence. The daily limit increases to 100 hit points. Additionally, when transferring hit points, you may choose to also transfer one condition affecting you to the recipient or vice versa (with their permission).
