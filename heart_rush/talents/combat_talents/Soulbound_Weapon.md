## Soulbound Weapon

_Passive ability. Handmagic._

You perform a one-hour ritual to forge a mystical bond with a single weapon, binding a portion of your essence to it. Once bonded, you can summon the weapon to your hand or banish it to an extradimensional space as an object interaction, regardless of distance. The weapon appears in your hand when summoned and vanishes when dismissed.

While wielding your soulbound weapon, your attacks count as magical damage for the purpose of overcoming damage resistances and immunities. The bond persists until you perform the ritual again with a different weapon, which severs the previous bond.

**Destiny Level:**
Your connection to the soulbound weapon deepens. When you make an attack with your soulbound weapon, add 1d4 to the damage roll. This represents the weapon's attunement to your fighting style and the arcane energy flowing through your bond.
