## Ballad of Bj√∂rn

_Weekly ability. Quick. Gaeic melody._

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, you may choose any number of creatures besides yourself within 60 feet and in earshot. They lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had any, and are immune to both conditions for the next 24 hours. In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest, and gain one additional rush point the next time they gain rush points today.

**Destiny Level:**
This ability becomes a major ability. You may include yourself in the creatures affected by your song.
