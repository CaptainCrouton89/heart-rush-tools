## Bloodlust

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make an attack roll against an enemy that has taken a wound, you may give it three levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened.

**Destiny Level:**
If that creature is already dazed, off-balanced, or weakened, you have advantage on your attack, and regain 4 hit points.
