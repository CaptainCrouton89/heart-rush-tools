## Careful Shot

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

If you didn't move in the previous round and have not moved yet during this round, you may apply two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened with your ranged attacks. Your range is doubled, and you ignore levels of cover less than total cover.

**Destiny Level:**
You may instead apply two levels of each condition.
