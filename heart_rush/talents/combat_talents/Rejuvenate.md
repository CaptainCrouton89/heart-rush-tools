## Rejuvenate

_Major ability. Handmagic._

As an object interaction, you may lay your hands on someone else, causing some of their wounds to close up, at the cost of your own health. When you use this ability, you may reduce your hit points by any amount, increasing the target's hit points by half that amount.

**Destiny Level:**
The healing is equal to the full amount spent, rather than being halved.
