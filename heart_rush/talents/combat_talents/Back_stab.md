## Back stab

_Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent._

If you and another ally are opposite to each other with an enemy directly between you (you can draw a line from a single corner of your space to every corner of the ally's space such that the line passes completely through the enemy's space), and the enemy has used its action to enter an engagement with your ally this round, you may treat your weapon as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against that enemy until end of the round. You must be wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the benefits of this ability.
You may also use this die if you are granted an opportunity attack because you are hidden.

**Destiny Level:**
You may replace your weapon die with 2d20 instead.
