## Backstab

_Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent._

When you have flanking position on an enemy (you can draw a straight line from any corner of your space through the enemy's space to any corner of your ally's space), you may treat your weapon as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against that enemy until end of the round. You must be wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the benefits of this ability.

You may also use this die if you are granted an opportunity attack due to being hidden.

**Destiny Level:**
You may replace your weapon die with 2d20 instead.
