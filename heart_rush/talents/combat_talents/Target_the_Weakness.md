## Target the Weakness

_Heart ability. Instant. Cognitive talent._

After entering an engagement, but before anyone declares stances, you may use this ability. Announce a stance, and a creature in the engagement. Once stances are revealed, any attack roll against the creature made using the announced stance ignores half of the target's defense roll.

**Destiny Level:**
Ignore the creature's entire defense roll instead.
