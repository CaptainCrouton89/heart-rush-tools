## Charge

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you move 20 feet or more in a straight line towards an enemy and immediately engage them with a heavy melee weapon, if you make an attack roll against them, they fall prone. For every 20 feet of distance you charge, you may add an additional 1d6 to your attack, up to 3d6 damage. The enemy must be no greater than one size larger than you to use this ability.

**Destiny Level:**
Add d10s to your roll, rather than d6s.
