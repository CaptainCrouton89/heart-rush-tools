## Taunting Blow

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make an attack roll with the cunning stance against someone who chose the agility stance, you may choose to give them two fewer conditions and instead give them two levels of aggravated towards you.

**Destiny Level:**
You may choose to also forgo making an attack roll to instead give them five levels of aggravated.
