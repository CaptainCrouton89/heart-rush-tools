## Taunting Blow

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make an attack roll with the cunning stance against someone who chose the agility stance, you may choose to give them two fewer conditions and instead give them a level of enraged towards you.

**Destiny Level:**
You may choose to also forgo making an attack roll to instead give them three levels of enraged.
