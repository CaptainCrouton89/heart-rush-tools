## Baited Attack

_Minor ability. Instant. Martial talent._

If a creature makes an attack against you and deals no damage to you, they instead deal damage equal to their roll to another creature behind you as you redirect their attack. A creature is considered behind you if at least one straight line can be drawn from a corner of the attacker's space, through your space, and to a corner of the new victim's space.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use this ability, both creatures gain 2 levels of enraged towards you.
