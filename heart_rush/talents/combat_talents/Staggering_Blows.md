## Staggering Blows

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you roll the maximum on one of the dice in your attack roll, the defending creature takes three levels of off-balanced.

**Destiny Level:**
The target is also knocked prone so long as it is no more than one size larger than you. If it is, instead add your weapon die to the attack an additional time.
