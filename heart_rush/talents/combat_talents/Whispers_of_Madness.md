## Whispers of Madness

_Major ability. Quick. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may lace otherworldly whispers into the mind of your target. They gain a level of dazed and shaken for the next minute as they try to remain focused.

**Destiny Level:**
You may repeat this action for free on consecutive rounds, up to three times total. Each time you do so, the target creature gains another level of dazed and shaken.
