## Tumble

_Major ability. Instant. Martial talent._

When you choose the agility stance, you may sidestep before those who chose the cunning stance attack, potentially allowing you to avoid an attack.

**Destiny Level:**
Whenever you sidestep in this manner, you may add 1d8 to your next attack roll in the current engagement.
