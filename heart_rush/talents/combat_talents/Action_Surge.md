## Action Surge

_Major ability. Martial talent._

You push your body and mind beyond normal limits, moving with impossible speed and precision. When you use this ability on your turn, immediately gain an additional action that must be used during this same turn. This action follows all normal rules and restrictions, and you may use other major abilities with this extra action.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use Action Surge, you also immediately gain 3 rush points. However, these rush points cannot be spent to enhance your class's major ability - they must be used for minor abilities, opportunity attacks, or sidestepping.
