## Battlescreech

_Heart ability. Martial talent._

You emit a horrifying, earsplitting screech, terrifying and disturbing your enemies. Choose any number of creatures within 30 feet. Those creatures get D2 on their next A/D roll.

**Destiny Level:**
Those creatures also don't gain the benefit of the next stance they choose, and gain two levels of dazed.
