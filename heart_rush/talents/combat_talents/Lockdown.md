## Lockdown

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, that creature's movement speed becomes 0 until the end of the round, and it gains one level of aggravated towards you.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures also cannot take the sidestep action until the end of the next round. The creature gains two levels of aggravated instead of one.
