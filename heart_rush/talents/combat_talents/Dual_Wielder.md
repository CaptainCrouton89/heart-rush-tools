## Dual Wielder

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You may wield two different weapons simultaneously, allowing you to gain the benefits from attacking with either one. If the weapons both deal the same type of damage, you instead gain +2 to attack rolls.

**Destiny Level:**
You have learned how to use one weapon to attack while using the other to defend. When making an attack roll against a creature that chose the same stance as you, you may add the weapon die from your other hand to the roll. If the damage type matches the stance, add the weapon die a second time. When making a defense roll against someone who chose the same stance as you, you may add the weapon die from either hand to your roll, adding it a second time if the weapon die matches the stance.
