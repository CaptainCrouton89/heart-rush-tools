## Harass

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you enter an engagement with one or more enemies that are adjacent to a wall or another piece of impassable terrain, you may choose one of those creatures. That creature cannot take the sidestep action until the end of the next round, and if that creature attacks anyone besides you in that engagement, you may make an opportunity attack against it.

**Destiny Level:**
The opportunity attack does not cost an action.
