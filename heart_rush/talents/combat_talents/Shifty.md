## Shifty

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

If you use your action to initiate or enter an engagement, once everyone has entered the engagement who wishes to, you may choose to sidestep before stances have been declared. You may do this once per round.

**Destiny Level:**
If you would sidestep such that you cannot be attacked by anyone in the engagement, you regain your action.
