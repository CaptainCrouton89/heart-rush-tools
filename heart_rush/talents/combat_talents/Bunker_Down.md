## Bunker Down

_Minor ability. Martial talent._

You bunker down, preparing for the worst. You may only use this ability if you have a shield. When you bunker down, you gain the following effects until the end of the round:

- You cannot dash, enter engagements, or make attack rolls.
- You must choose the defensive stance if someone enters an engagement with you.
- You may treat all defense rolls you make as their maximum result.
- When you are pushed, you are pushed half as far as you would be otherwise.

**Destiny Level:**
You may bunker down as an instant ability, so long as you are not in an engagement in which you have already made an attack.
