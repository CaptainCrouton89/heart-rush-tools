## Boundless Fury

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever your attack deals more damage than the defending creature's maximum heart die, you may enter an engagement with a different, adjacent creature immediately after the current engagement ends. You cannot attack a creature you have already attacked this round. After the new engagement, you gain one level of weakened for each time you used this ability in the round.

**Destiny Level:**
Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, your next attack roll deals an additional 1d10 damage.
