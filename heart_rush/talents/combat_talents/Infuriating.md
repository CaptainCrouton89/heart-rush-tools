## Infuriating

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

When you are in an engagement with a creature that you have aggravated, it must make its attack against you if its able.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures with 3+ levels of aggravation towards you can only attack you in engagements that you are part of (or make no attack at all).
