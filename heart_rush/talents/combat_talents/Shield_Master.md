## Shield Master

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You have learned how to attack with your shield and use it as a proper weapon itself. Your shield counts as a light bludgeoning weapon. If you would push a creature while attacking with your shield, the target is pushed 5 additional feet.

**Destiny Level:**
You may choose to hunker behind your shield, to increase your defenses. When you take the defensive stance, you take one fourth as much damage, rather than half.
