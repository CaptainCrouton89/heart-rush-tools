## Fling

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

When you choose the might stance and make an attack roll against a creature you are grappling, you may instead choose to fling the target. Make a might ability check contested by the creature's might or agility challenge number. On a success, you throw the creature a number of feet equal to 5 times the difference, and the creature falls prone. You may choose to fling them directly to the ground so that all the forced movement turns into damage instead.

**Destiny Level:**
They instead fly a number of feet equal to 7 times the result of your might check, rounded down.
