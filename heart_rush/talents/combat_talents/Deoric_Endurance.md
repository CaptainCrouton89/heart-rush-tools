## Deoric Endurance

_Monthly ability. Instant. Handmagic._

When you must roll your heart die, you may roll your maximum heart die instead for the next minute.

**Destiny Level:**
When you use this ability, remove all levels of weakened, dazed, and off-balanced affecting you. You are immune to those effects for the next minute, unless self-inflicted.
