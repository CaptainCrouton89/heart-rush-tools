## Slippery

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to try to physically dodge a trap or an area effect, you may choose to first sidestep and fall prone. Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to avoid or escape being restrained, you may choose to replace the result of either die with its maximum, after rolling. You cannot be grappled.

**Destiny Level:**
Once per round, if you roll doubles on a defense roll, you may immediately sidestep. If you are no longer a valid target for your attacker, you do not take damage.
