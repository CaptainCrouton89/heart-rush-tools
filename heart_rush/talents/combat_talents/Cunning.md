## Cunning

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

When you choose the cunning stance, the target of your attack takes four levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened, instead of two.

**Destiny Level:**
Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D rolls made this round. Increase the die's size by one for each consecutive time you chose this stance.
