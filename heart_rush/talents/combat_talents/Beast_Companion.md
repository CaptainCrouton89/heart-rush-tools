## Beast Companion

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

Choose an animal with the GM's approval. It has a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, must be of small size or smaller, has 20 hit point capacity, and a d6 heart die (you may work with your GM to adjust these values). You can communicate simple ideas with it from a distance using verbal and somatic commands. The animal obeys all your commands. When in combat, your companion is not very effective on its own. Your companion cannot use its action to enter engagements, though it can still be forced into engagements by other combatants. It can otherwise use its action normally.
You may take this talent any number of times. If your companion dies, you may choose to replace this talent with another talent instead.

**Destiny Level:**
You may spend XP on your beast companion as though it were yourself. Beast companions cannot gain talents as oaths, and cannot gain cognitive talents. Your beast companion cannot gain a beast companion.
While adjacent to your companion, if you or your companion would be forced to make a defense roll, the other may choose to step in to make the defense roll and take the damage instead. If that creature was already being attacked from the same source, they cannot use this ability.
