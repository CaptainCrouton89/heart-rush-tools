## Reckless Attack

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Upon entering an engagement or making an opportunity attack, but before choosing stances, you may declare this to be a reckless attack. You may add 1d4 to each of your attack rolls until the end of the round. Enemies have advantage on their attack rolls against you until the end of the round.

Add 1d8 to your attacks instead.
