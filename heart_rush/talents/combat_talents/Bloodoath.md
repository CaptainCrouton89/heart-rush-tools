## Bloodoath

_Weekly ability. Quick. Handmagic._

As an action, you swear vengeance against a creature that you believe has wronged you. You can only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time. While you have sworn vengeance against a creature you always know where the creature is, and whenever you engage with or make an opportunity attack against the creature you gain a rush point at the beginning of the next round.

**Destiny Level:**
You have advantage on A/D rolls against your sworn enemy. In addition, you do not need to use your action to use this ability.
