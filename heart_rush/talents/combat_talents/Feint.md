## Feint

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Once per round, when you sidestep, you may instead choose to feint and remain stationary. If so, choose an adjacent creature. When you do this, you gain A2 on your next A/D roll made this round against that creature.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use this ability three times per round. When you use it a third time in a round against the same creature, you do not have to remain stationary.
