## Net Master

_Passive ability. Martial talent._

Your expertise with nets makes them far more effective. When you successfully hit with a net:

- The CN to escape increases by 2
- Size large creatures are fully affected (not just slowed)
- You may throw nets 30 feet instead of 20

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures entangled by your nets gain 2 levels of restrained instead of 1 (3 with might stance). You may entangle creatures up to size L2.
