## Beast Bond

_Passive ability. Handmagic. Prerequisite: Beast Companion._

You can magically, telepathically communicate with your companion, and over any distance. As an action, you may begin sensing through the senses of your beast companion. You cannot use your own senses again until you spend an action returning to your own body.

**Destiny Level:**
As an action, you may take total control of your beast companion. While in control, you play each round as the animal instead of yourself. You may use any cognitive and martial talents you have, but the cooldowns are not separate for your animal. For example, once you've used a major ability, you cannot use it yourself or as your animal until you take a long rest. You may also cast spells you know and use your attunements as the animal. While controlling your companion, your body falls prone and is incapacitated, and you cannot sense using your body's senses. You may return to your body as an action.
