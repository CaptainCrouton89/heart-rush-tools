## Body Shield

_Minor ability. Instant. Martial talent._

The next time you are hit by a melee attack from a source that is adjacent to both you and a creature you are grappling, if the attacking creature's stance did not directly beat your own, you may use the grappled creature as a body shield. Add the creature's defense bonus to your own and split the damage between you, rounding up.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use this ability against ranged attacks as well, so long as the grappled creature is between you and the source (a line can be drawn from one of your corners to theirs that passes through the grappled creature's space). When you use this ability, the grappled creature takes all of the damage and makes the defense roll instead.
