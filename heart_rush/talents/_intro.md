# Talents

Talents represent specific abilities you have learned, been gifted, or know how to perform through religious or magical ritual. Each talent will fall into one of three types of abilities: passive abilities, heart abilities, or major abilities. As with abilities gained from your class, passive abilities can be used whenever and at no cost, and major abilities can be used once per day. Heart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you take a wound.

Additionally, talents may also have the instant or full action tag. If it is instant, then you can use the ability at literally any time, even right before you roll. If it has the full action tag, it requires you to use your action.

## Types of Talents

Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by their tags. Each require different conditions to be met in order to gain that talent.

### Cognitive and Martial Talents

Martial talents are those that require physical prowess and training. They represent the culmination of extensive practice and training. There are no prerequisites for taking a martial talent.

Cognitive talents, like martial talents, come from vigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.

### Gaeic Melodies

Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that reverberate throughout all living things—left over from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world into life.

Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to them have magical effects. However, they cannot be discovered innately, and require a teacher or a songbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or higher aspect in musical talents in order to play them.

When playing a gaeic melody, it requires your action to play the instrument. You can move up to half your move speed while playing, but cannot move more than that. You cannot play more than one gaeic melody at the same time.

### Handmagic

Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create their effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where words spoken in it simply come true.

Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the back of one's hand, inscribed in the blood of magical creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the tattooed hand in specific ways, one can then create those magical effects. The knowledge and necessary materials to inscribe hand runes is rare and expensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely require you to be in a city.

### Elemental Talents

Elemental talents include passive elemental effects and powerful invocations of elemental power. Each talent will have one or more elemental tags, indicating the element it is associated with, and the attunement(s) required to pick up the talent. Elemental talents are listed in their own section of the talent list. Gaining an elemental talent represents long periods of study, practice, and meditation.

## Combat Talents

The talents in this section are combat-related talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding talents, and has no other effect.
