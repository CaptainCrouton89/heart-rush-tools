## Blink Step

_Minor ability. Instant. Void._

When you dash, you may instead teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 90 feet.

**Destiny Level:**
So long as you are holding on to someone, they may come with you if they are willing. You can bring up to two creatures besides yourself when using this ability.
