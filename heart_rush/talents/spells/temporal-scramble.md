### Temporal Scramble

_Major ability. Time. Instant._

After everyone who wants to join the engagement has done so, but before stances are chosen, you may use this ability. Each creature in the engagement should roll a d100. In order from lowest to highest result, each creature should announce their stance. Creatures of your choice may roll the d100 with advantage (roll twice and take the higher result).

**Destiny Level:**
Roll the d100s with A2 instead.
