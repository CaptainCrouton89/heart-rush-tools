### Gale

_Major ability. Air. Ongoing._

You push your palm in the air before you, causing a powerful wind to pick up. Choose a direction. Creatures of your choice within 90 feet of you are affected. At the start of each subsequent round, chosen creatures must use 30 feet of movement or else be pushed 30 feet in the chosen direction (though creatures can spend 20 feet to only be pushed 10). The range of all projectile weapons fired primarily downwind is doubled, and halved when fired primarily upwind.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures must use 60 feet of movement instead.
