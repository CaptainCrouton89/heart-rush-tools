### Gale

_Major ability. Air. Ongoing._

You push your palm in the air before you, causing a powerful wind to pick up. Choose a direction. Creatures of your choice within 90 feet of you are affected. At the beginning of each round, each affected is pushed 10 feet in the direction you chose. The range of all projectile weapons fired primarily downwind is doubled, and halved when fired primarily upwind.
