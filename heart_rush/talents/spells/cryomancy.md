## Cryomancy

_Passive ability. Water._

Add ice to your resonate substances as a solid attunement. Your level of attunement with ice is equal to your level of attunement with water.  
In addition to creating or destroying ice out of nothing, you can also convert between water and ice. Use the resonate substance conversion rules to determine the rate and range of your control.

**Destiny Level:**  
Ice you create is as hard as stone and does not melt unless exposed to fire.
