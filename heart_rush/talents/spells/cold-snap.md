### Cold Snap

_Weekly ability. Ice._

Snapping the fingers of your hand makes a loud crack that causes all non-magical liquid within 45 feet to freeze solid. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet gain one level of restrained until the end of the round. If they are wet or standing in water, they instead gain 2 levels of restrained.

**Destiny Level:**
This becomes a major ability instead.
