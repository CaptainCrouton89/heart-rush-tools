### Punishing Glare

_Major ability. Force and Light. Ongoing._

You bring your clenching fist down, pressing the light down into an opressive glare. Whenever a creature within 5 feet enters or begins the round in bright light, it takes the crippled condition until the end of the round.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures effected by this ability cannot attack more than once creature each round.
