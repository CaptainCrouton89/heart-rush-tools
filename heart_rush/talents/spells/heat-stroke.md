### Heat Stroke

_Major ability. Fire. Ongoing._

You open your fist into the open air, releasing intense heat into the surrounding area. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take two levels of dazed and two levels of weakened when they enter the spell's area or start the round there, no more than once per round.

**Destiny Level:**
They take three levels instead.
