## Burning Brilliance

_Major ability. Fire and Light. Ongoing._

You rub your fingers together, heating nearby areas of light. All spaces within 45 feet in bright light ignite into white, brilliant flames. So long as those spaces remain in bright light, the flame remains. The flames emit no light. Whenever a creature enters or begins the round in one of these spaces, you may choose for it to take one level of burning.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures in the light take two levels of burning instead.
