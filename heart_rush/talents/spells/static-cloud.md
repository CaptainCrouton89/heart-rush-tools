### Static Cloud

_Major ability. Air. Ongoing._

You snap your fingers, charging the air around you, creating a cloud of highly static energy suspended in the air. Whenever a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you may have that creature take three levels of dazed as electricity crackles through them.

**Destiny Level:**
They take five levels instead.
