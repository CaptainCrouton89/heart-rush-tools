### Chilling Wind

_Major ability. Air._

You beckon with your fingers, calling forth the north wind, sending a bone-chilling breeze passing by. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet of you immediately take a level of crippled. If the temperature is already below freezing, those creatures also take one level of restrained until the end of the round instead.
