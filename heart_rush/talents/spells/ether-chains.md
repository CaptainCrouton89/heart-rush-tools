### Ether Chains

_Major ability. Force. Ongoing._

You link your thumb and forefinger, causing visible, ethereal chains to form between two creatures' souls, linking them together. Choose two creatures within 45 feet of you and within 10 feet of each other. At the end of each round, if the two creatures are not within 10 feet of each other, they each take two levels of dazed, off-balanced, and weakened, and 1d6 damage.
