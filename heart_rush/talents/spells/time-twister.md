### Time Twister

_Major ability. Time._

By yanking loose the threads of time, you revert time to an earlier state. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet of you are teleported to wherever they started this round. Creatures of your choice who have not moved yet this round may immediately move a distance up to their move speed.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use this ability immediately after stances are declared, but before attacks rolls are made. Everyone must choose stances again.
