### Pillars of Ice
_Water. Ongoing._

You raise an open, grasping hand to the air, raising huge icicles forth from the ground, each radiating a chilling aura. Choose three spaces within 45 feet. In each space, a 10-foot pillar of ice rises there. Each pillar can take 15 damage before being destroyed, and has a flat 10 defense.

Creatures of your choice within 5 feet of a pillar take one level of slowed when they enter the spell's area for the first time on a turn or start the round there. The icicles melt when the spell ends.
