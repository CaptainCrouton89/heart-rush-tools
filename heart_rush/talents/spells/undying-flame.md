## Undying Flame

_Major ability. Fire and Time. Ongoing._

Choose a creature within 45 feet. It takes one level of burning. Levels of burning do not fade from this creature.

**Destiny Level:**
If a creature would use its action to reduce the levels of burning from this creature, it removes only one level of burning, rather than half.
