## Sandstorm

_Major ability. Earth and Air. Ongoing._

You twist your hand into a fist, causing a brutal sandstorm to whirl around you. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 1d4 damage whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.  
Additionally, the storm provides one level of cover from ranged attacks.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures take 2d4 instead.
