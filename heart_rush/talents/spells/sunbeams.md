### Sunbeams
_Light. Ongoing._

You drag a pointed finger from the sky to your target, sending beams of sunlight down from the heavens, blinding and burning those caught within. Choose a point within 45 feet. A pillar of light beams down, and bright light illuminates everything in a 5-foot radius around that point. Whenever a creature enters or starts the round in one of these spaces, you may choose for them to take 2 levels of blinded and 1d6 damage.
