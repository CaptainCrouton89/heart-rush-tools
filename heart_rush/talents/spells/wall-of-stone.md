### Wall of Stone

_Major ability. Earth._

By drawing a line with your finger, you cause stone walls to shoot up from the ground where you point. Choose a point within 45 feet and draw a straight line up to 20 feet in length starting from that point. A wall of rock grows up there, 10 feet high.

Each wall segment can take 30 damage before disintegrating, and has 15 defense (treat is as rolling a 15 on defense rolls when attacked).
