## Eye of the Storm

_Monthly ability. Air, Water, and Light. Ongoing._

You untwist your hand from a fist, unleashing your inner storm. Lightning, thunder, and rain engulf you. The storm extends to a radius of 15 feet around you. Creatures within the storm gain three levels of cover, and creatures of your choice take your choice of 1d6 lightning damage or are pushed 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice whenever they enter or start the round in that space.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures take 3d6 instead, or are pushed 10 feet. The radius of the storm increases to 90 feet.
