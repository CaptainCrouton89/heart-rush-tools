## Fire Storm

_Major ability. Air and Fire. Ongoing._

You twist your open hand in the air before snapping your fingers together, bringing together a whirling storm of fire around you. Whenever a creature enters or starts the round adjacent to you, you may choose for them to roll damage for their levels of burning again, no more than one additional time per round. If this takes place at the beginning of the round, it occurs after all fading conditions are reduced by one. For example, if a creature had two levels of burning on the previous turn, and they began the round next to you, they would have taken 2d6 burning damage at the end of the last round, then would take an additional 1d6 at the beginning of the current one.

**Destiny Level:**
Levels of burning are not reduced for creatures adjacent to you.
