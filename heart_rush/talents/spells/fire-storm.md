### Fire Storm

_Major ability. Air and Fire. Ongoing._

You twist your open hand in the air before snapping your fingers together, bringing together a whirling storm of fire around you. Whenever a creature enters or starts the round in that space, you may choose for them to take one level of burning, or 2 damage for each level of burning they already have, no more than once per round.
