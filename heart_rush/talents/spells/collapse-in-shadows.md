### Collapse in Shadows

_Major ability. Dark and Force._

You clap your fingers to your palm, dragging everyone's bodies to their shadows. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet fall prone. If they are in bright light, they gain two levels of restrained. If they are in dim light, they gain one level of restrained instead.
