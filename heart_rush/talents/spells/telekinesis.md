## Telekinesis

_Passive ability. Force. Ongoing._

During engagements, you may use nearby inanimate objects as heavy, ranged, bludgeoning weapons, by hurling them at your opponents. Objects must be between 5 and 20 pounds, within 45 feet, and cannot be attached to anything else that would prevent it from moving (likely, valid options include loose rocks, chairs, etc).

**Destiny Level:**
Add 1d6 to all attack rolls made using this ability.
