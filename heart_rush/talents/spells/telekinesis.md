### Telekinesis

_Major ability. Force. Ongoing._

During engagements, you may use nearby objects as heavy, ranged, bludgeoning weapons, by hurling them at your opponents. Objects must be between 5 and 20 pounds, within 45 feet, and cannot be attached to anything else that would prevent it from moving (likely, valid options include loose rocks, chairs, etc). You have advantage on these attack rolls.
