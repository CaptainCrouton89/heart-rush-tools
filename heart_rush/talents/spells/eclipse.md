### Eclipse

_Major ability. Dark._

You turn your cupped hand in the air, briefly causing a shadow to pass before the sun. The sun provides no light to any space in a 90 foot radius until the spell ends or you choose to end the effect during a subsequent action phase. This has no effect on other sources of light.
