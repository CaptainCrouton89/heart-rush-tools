### Earthen Umbra
_Earth and Dark. Ongoing._

You splay your fingers and raise your hand, pulling shadows from the ground beneath you. Two feet of pure shadow rise up from the ground and away from all walls in a 45 foot radius around you. While prone or adjacent to a wall affected by this spell, creatures are obscured.
