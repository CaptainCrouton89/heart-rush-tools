## Leaden Fists

_Major ability. Earth. Ongoing._

You draw earth up and around your fists, turning them into weighted clubs of stone. Your fists become light, bludgeoning weapons. Whenever you deal damage to an enemy with your fists, if they are no more than one size greater than you, you may choose for them to be pushed 5 feet back.

**Destiny Level:**
Your fists become heavy weapons instead.
