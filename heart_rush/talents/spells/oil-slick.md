## Oil Slick

_Major ability. Water and Earth. Ongoing._

You cause a pool of slippery oil to expand over an area, making it impossible to safely walk on. Choose a point within 45 feet. All space within 15 feet of that point is slippery, and creatures of your choice that move more than five feet through the space or make an A/D roll in that space must make an agility saving throw contested by your spellcasting ability.  
If the creature fails, it falls prone. If it was making an A/D roll, treat the result of their roll as a zero.

**Destiny Level:**
The radius of this effect extends to 30 feet.
