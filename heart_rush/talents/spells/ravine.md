## Ravine

_Major ability. Earth._

You bring your hand in a chopping motion towards the ground, causing it to split open in a deep ravine. Choose four connected spaces on the ground within 45 feet. A 10-foot deep hole opens in those spaces. Creatures in those spaces must make agility saving throws to avoid fall damage and landing prone.

**Destiny Level:**

The hole is 20 feet deep instead.
