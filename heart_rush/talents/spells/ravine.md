### Ravine

_Major ability. Earth._

You bring your hand in a chopping motion towards the ground, causing it to split open in a deep ravine. Choose four connected, spaces on the ground within 45 feet. A 15-foot deep hole opens in those spaces. Creatures in those spaces must make agility saving throws to avoid fall damage and landing prone.
