## Twister

_Major ability. Air. Ongoing._

By spinning your finger in the air, you stir the air into a twister. A coiling tornado touches down, throwing people aside as it travels across the ground. Choose a 10-foot square within 45 feet. All area there is affected.  
Projectiles are thrown aside if they pass through, and anyone who enters is thrown 10 feet in a direction of your choice and land prone, taking 1d6 damage.  
At the beginning of each round, you may choose to move the twister 15 feet in a direction of your choice.

**Destiny Level:**
Choose a 15 foot square instead. Creatures that enter are thrown 20 feet instead of 10.
