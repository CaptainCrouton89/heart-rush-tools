### Cardinal Direction

_Major ability. Void and Force. Ongoing._

You align your fingers with the complex grid of the void, applying its strict physical laws to the world around you. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet of you can only move in straight lines this round (they cannot change direction by breaking up their movement).

**Destiny Level:**
Choose one direction. Creatures can only move back and forth along the chosen direction.
