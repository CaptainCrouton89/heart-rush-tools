### Lightning Ward
_Light and Air. Ongoing._

You snap your fingers, agitating the air into a crackling cloud of energy, electrifying and energizing those inside. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 1d6 damage when they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.  
If a player takes damage from this effect, they gain a rush point. If this would cause them to exceed their maximum, they may immediately spend their points. Creatures standing in water take three times as much damage from this spell.
