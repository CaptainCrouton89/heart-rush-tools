### Lightning Aura

_Major ability. Light and Air. Ongoing._

You snap your fingers, agitating the air into a crackling cloud of energy, electrifying and energizing those inside. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 1d4 damage when they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round. Add 2d4 if the creature is standing in water. Add 2d4 if the creature is wearing metal armor.

**Destiny Level:**
Use a d8 instead of a d4.
