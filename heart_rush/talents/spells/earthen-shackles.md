## Earthen Shackles

_Heart ability. Earth and Force._

You grasp your hand into an upturned fist, causing the ground to reach up and anchor those above it. Creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you take the crippled condition until end of turn.

**Destiny Level:**
This becomes a passive ability.
