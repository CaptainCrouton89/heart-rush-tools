## Earthen Shackles

_Minor ability. Earth and Force._

You grasp your hand into an upturned fist, causing the ground to reach up and anchor those above it. Creatures of your choice that are size large or smaller and are within 5 feet of you take the crippled condition until end of turn.

**Destiny Level:**
This becomes a passive ability.
