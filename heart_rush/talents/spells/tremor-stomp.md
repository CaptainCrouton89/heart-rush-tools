### Tremor Stomp

_Major ability. Earth._

You stomp the ground, causing it to shutter and quake. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet immediately take 3 levels of off-balanced and fall prone. If you are underground, those creatures take 5 levels instead.

**Destiny Level:**
The range of this ability extends to 120 feet instead, and automatically occurs at the beginning of your next turn as well, as after-shocks shake the area.
