## Pummeling Shadows

_Major ability. Force and Dark. Ongoing._

You raise your clenching fist up, binding the shadows to fists of force. Whenever a creature within 5 feet enters or begins the round in dim light or darkness, you may choose for it to take 1d8 damage, no more than once per round.

**Destiny Level:**
Effected creatures take 2d8 instead.
