### Deluge
_Water and Force._

You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away. Choose a 20-foot by 40-foot section of the map. Everyone creature of size L3 or smaller in that area is swept to one of the 20-foot sides of the rectangle, and lands prone. The water puts out any fire in that area.
