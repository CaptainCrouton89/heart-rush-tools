## Deluge

_Major ability. Water and Force._

You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away. Choose a 15-foot by 30-foot section of the map. Everyone creature of size L3 or smaller in that area is swept to one of the 15-foot sides of the rectangle, and lands prone. The water puts out any fire in that area.

**Destiny Level:**
The wave can be up to 45 feet by 90 feet, and pushes creatures up to L4 in size.
