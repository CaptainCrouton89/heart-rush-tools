### Deluge

_Heart ability. Water and Force._

You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away. Choose a 10-foot by 20-foot section of the map. Everyone creature of size L3 or smaller in that area is swept to one of the 10-foot sides of the rectangle, and lands prone. The water puts out any fire in that area.

**Destiny Level:**
The wave can be up to 30 feet by 60 feet, and pushes creatures up to L4 in size.
