### Aura of Ignition

_Major ability. Fire. Ongoing._

You snap your fingers, agitating the air around you into a hyper-flammable state, allowing you to easily ignite moments of already high-energy, such as the impact of a blade. Whenever a creature within 10 feet takes damage, you may have them take a level of burning if they don't already have any levels of burning.
