## Grasp of the Ice Witch

_Major ability. Ice. Ongoing._

Your hands freeze over, turning blue with cold and dripping with ice. While grappling a creature, the creature cannot make more than one attack roll per round.

**Destiny Level:**
If the grappled creature would regain hitpoints, it regains half as many (rounded up). The creature takes five levels of slowed.
