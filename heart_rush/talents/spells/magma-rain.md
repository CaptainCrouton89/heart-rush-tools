## Magma Rain

_Major ability. Earth and Fire._

You pull your hand down into a fist, causing magma to begin falling from the sky. Choose a point within 90 feet. There must be a large area of open sky above the point. Magma appears in the sky and begins falling towards that point.  
At the end of the next round, the hail of magma reaches the ground. Everyone (friend or foe) within a 15-foot radius of the point takes 6d8 damage and a level of burning.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures take 10d8 instead.
