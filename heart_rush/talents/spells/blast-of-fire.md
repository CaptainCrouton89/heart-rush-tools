### Blast of Fire

_Major ability. Fire and Force._

You point your finger, sending forth a bolt of force and flame and blasting someone back. Choose a creature within 45 feet. That creature is knocked back 10 feet and then falls prone, taking two levels of burning. They may make an agility saving throw against your spellcasting CN. On a success, they are not knocked prone, and take only one level of burning.
