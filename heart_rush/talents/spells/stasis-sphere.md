## Stasis Sphere

_Major ability. Void. Ongoing._

You pull in the void, cocooning the space around you. All incoming and outgoing sources of damage (e.g. attack rolls) have their initial damage reduced by half, before accounting for defense rolls. Round up the remaining damage.

**Destiny Level:**
The effect of this spell extends in a 5 foot radius around you, to creatures of your choice.
