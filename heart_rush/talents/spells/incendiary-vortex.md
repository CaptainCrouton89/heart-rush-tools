### Incendiary Vortex
_Fire and Void. Ongoing._

You twist your splayed hand in front of you, knitting together and embroiling the planes of fire and void. At the start of each round, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take two levels of burning and are pulled 5 feet towards you, if possible.
