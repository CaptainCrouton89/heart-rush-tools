## Incendiary Vortex

_Major ability. Fire and Void._

You twist your splayed hand in front of you, knitting together and embroiling the planes of fire and void. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take a level of burning and are pulled 5 feet towards you, if possible.

**Destiny Level:**
This ability becomes ongoing, occuring when you cast it, and again at the beginning of each round.
