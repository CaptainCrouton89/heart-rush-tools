### Cloud of Poison
_Water. Ongoing._

You raise your finger to the air, spewing forth billowing dark clouds of poison. All spaces within 10 feet of you are layered in a heavy cloud of poison. Creatures of your choice count as obscured and take a level of poisoned whenever they enter or start the round in those spaces, no more than once per round. Creatures cannot take more than one level of poisoned with this effect. The cloud does not move with you.
