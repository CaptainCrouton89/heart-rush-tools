### Fog Bank

_Major ability. Water. Ongoing._

You open your fist, releasing moisture into the air, sending billowing clouds of fog into the area around you. Choose eight spaces within 45 feet. A wall of fog grows up there. Creatures within the fog bank are obscured from everyone, and people on opposite sides are obscured from each other. While within the fog, everything is obscured to you.

**Destiny Level:**
Choose any number of spaces within 120 feet instead.
