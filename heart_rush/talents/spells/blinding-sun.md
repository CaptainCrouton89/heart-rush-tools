### Blinding Sun
_Light. Ongoing._

You rub a sphere of pure, brilliant light into your fingers before casting it into the air. Choose a point within 45 feet. Creatures of your choice within a 5-foot radius of that point take three levels of blindness whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round. For every 5 feet further you are from the point, creatures gain one level fewer of blindness.
