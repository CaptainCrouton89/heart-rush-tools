### Illusory Double
_Water and Air. Ongoing._

You create a shimmering, misty duplicate of yourself, slightly offset from your position, disguising your true location. You have A2 on your defense rolls.  
At any time while maintaining your illusory double, you may remove it to double your defense roll.
