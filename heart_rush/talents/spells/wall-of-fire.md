## Wall of Fire

_Major ability. Fire. Ongoing._

By drawing a line with your finger, you cause immense flames to grow up where you point. Choose a point within 45 feet and draw a straight line up 20 feet in length starting from that point. A wall of fire grows up there.

Anyone who passes through the fire takes 3 levels of burning. The fire does not spread, and disappears when the spell ends.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures take 5 levels of burning instead.
