### Shield of Air

_Major ability. Force and Air. Instant._

You raise your hand in the air, causing the air to harden, right before a weapon lands. Roll your heart die twice, and add it to a creature's defense roll, before they take damage.

**Destiny Level:**
Roll your heart die six times instead.
