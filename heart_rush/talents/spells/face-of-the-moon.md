### Face of the Moon

_Major ability. Force. Ongoing._

Your hand aligns with the tides of force all around you. At the start of each each round, you may choose high tide or low tide. If you choose high tide, all creatures within 25 feet of you are pulled 10 feet towards you. If you choose low tide, all creatures within 25 feet are pushed 10 feet away, but not beyond the affected area.
