## Elemental Talents

The talents in this section are elemental talents. Each talent will have one or more elemental tags, indicating the element it is associated with, and the attunement(s) required to pick up the talent.

These talents also may include the tag "ongoing", indicating that the effect lasts for 1 minute. Players may choose to end the effect early as a free ability during the action phase.
