## Shadow Jaunt

_Minor ability. Instant. Dark._

When you dash, you may instead teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet. Both your current location and your destination must be in shadow, darkness, or dim light.

When you arrive, you become obscured until the start of your next turn or until you make an attack or cast a spell, whichever comes first.

**Destiny Level:**
The range increases to 90 feet. So long as you are holding on to someone in shadow or darkness, they may come with you if they are willing. You can bring up to two creatures besides yourself when using this ability. All creatures brought with you also become obscured until the start of their next turn or until they make an attack or cast a spell.
