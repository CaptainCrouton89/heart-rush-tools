### Searing Shadows
_Fire and Dark. Ongoing._

You rub your fingers together, heating nearby areas of darkness. All spaces within 45 feet in dim light or darkness ignite into pulsing, dark flames.  
So long as those spaces remain in dim light or in darkness, the flame remains. Whenever a creature enters or begins the round in one of these spaces, it takes one level of burning, and then one additional level of burning if the space was in darkness, no more than once per round.
