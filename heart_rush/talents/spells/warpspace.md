### Warpspace

_Major ability. Void. Ongoing._

By dragging at the seams separating the void from the material world, you allow some of it to spill over. Certain spaces become areas of warped space. Choose six unoccupied spaces within 45 feet. Each space ceases to exist.  
It costs no movement speed to cross that space, and all spaces adjacent to a warped space are considered adjacent to all other spaces adjacent to that and any other contiguous warped spaces.

**Destiny Level:**
Choose any number of spaces instead.
