### Hand of Lorus

_Major ability. Dark. Ongoing._

By clenching your hand into a fist, you can engulf your surroundings in shadows. The space in a 45-foot radius around you becomes dark if the space was previously dim, and dim if it was previously bright. Nonmagical light cannot penetrate through this darkness.

**Destiny Level:**
The space becomes dark, even if it was previously bright.
