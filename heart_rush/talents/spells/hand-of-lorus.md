### Hand of Lorus
_Dark. Ongoing._

By clenching your hand into a fist, you can engulf your surroundings in shadows. The space in a 45-foot radius around you becomes dark if the space was previously dim, and dim if it was previously bright. Nonmagical light cannot penetrate through this darkness. See the Other Factors section for details on the effects of dim light.
