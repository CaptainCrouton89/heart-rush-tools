## Pyromania

_Major ability. Fire. Ongoing._

You raise your open hands into the air, flickering your fingers, causing flames to erupt around you. Choose an adjacent space that contains flammable materials. It bursts into flame.

Fire within 90 feet of you spreads unnaturally fast. At the end of each round, it spreads to all adjacent spaces with flammable materials. Anyone who enters or ends the round in the fire takes two levels of burning.

You may stop the unnaturally fast spread of the fire as an instant ability, but the fire does not cease to exist. The fire can still be put out by normal means.

**Destiny Level:**
Once per month, you may use this ability to choose _any_ number of spaces within 90 feet to ignite.
