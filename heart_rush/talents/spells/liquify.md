## Liquify

_Major ability. Earth. Ongoing._

You flutter your hand such that it resonates at the exact frequency to turn the surrounding rock into an unstable slew of loose stone. The ground within 10 feet of you immediately becomes difficult terrain, and creatures of your choice that enter or start the round in that space begin sinking into the ground and gain one level of restrained.  
Creatures stuck in the ground may take the dash action to remove all levels of the restrained condition from themselves.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures gain two levels of restrained instead.
