## Temporal Hiccup

_Major ability. Time. Instant._

With the clap of your hands, a flicker in the normal continuum of time ripples out from you. All creatures of your choice within 45 feet have D3 on the next roll they make, or until the end of the round, whichever comes first.

**Destiny Level:**
They have D5 instead.
