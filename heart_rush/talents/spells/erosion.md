### Erosion

_Major ability. Force and Time._

You rub your fingers together, grinding time against force, accelerating the natural desiccation and erosion of a nearby object. Choose an inanimate object no greater than a 10-foot cube. If it is softer than wood, it erodes away immediately. If it is softer than stone, it erodes away in the next minute. If it is as hard as stone or harder, it crumbles over the course of the next hour.

**Destiny Level:**
The object can be up to a 25-foot cube.
