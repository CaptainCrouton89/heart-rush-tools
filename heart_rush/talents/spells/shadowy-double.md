### Shadowy Double
_Dark. Ongoing._

You drag darkness from around you to your form. If you are in dim light, you may create shadowy duplicates of yourself. The next two times you are attacked, you instead take no damage, as they attack a shadowy double. The duplicates disappear if you exit dim light.
