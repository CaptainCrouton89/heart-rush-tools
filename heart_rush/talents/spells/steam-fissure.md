### Steam Fissure
_Fire and Water. Ongoing._

You open your hand towards the sky, forcing fissures open in the ground around you, producing geysers of scalding steam from the depths beneath you. Choose four spaces within 45 feet. Creatures take 1d10 damage whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.
