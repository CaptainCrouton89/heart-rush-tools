_FMajor ability. ire and Water. Ongoing._

You open your hand towards the sky, forcing fissures open in the ground around you, producing geysers of scalding steam from the depths beneath you. Choose four spaces within 45 feet. Creatures take 1d10 damage whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.

Choose up to 6 spaces. Creatures take 2d10 instead, and are pushed 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.
