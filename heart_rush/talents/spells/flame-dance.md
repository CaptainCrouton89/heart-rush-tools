## Flame Dance

_Major ability. Fire. Ongoing._

Through intricate motions while walking, you weave fire into every footstep. Whenever you leave a space, it is ignited with fire until the spell ends. Creatures of your choice take two levels of burning whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.

**Destiny Level:**
Creatures take three levels of burning instead.
