## Waltz of the Weissenkauer

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._  
You play a macabre and sinister tune. After playing your instrument for a minute or more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot gain one level of frightened towards you for the rest of the day.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may choose for them to gain three levels of frightened instead, and you may choose to exempt creatures from the effects.
