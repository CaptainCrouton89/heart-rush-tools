## Oracle

_Monthly ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may choose a creature other than yourself. That creature's next roll is replaced with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a complication occurs. At any time, the GM may replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum possible result. It cannot be rerolled or replaced. The GM may not do so again until you use this ability again.

**Destiny Level:**  
This no longer takes an action.
