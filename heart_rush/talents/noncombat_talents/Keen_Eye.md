## Keen Eye

_Monthly ability. Quick. Cognitive talent._
When you make a perception check, you may declare one thing that is unusual but nearly unnoticeable about the current scene. It must be an addition to the scene, not a change to what's already happening. The GM may then declare one additional thing, modifying your stated fact.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may add one detail to whatever thing you notice.
