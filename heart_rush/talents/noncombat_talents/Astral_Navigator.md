## Astral Navigator

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  
So long as you can see the stars, you may ignore the navigation challenge number for your environment and use a default value of 10. You do not have disadvantage if you make this roll as part of a navigation camp action at night. If you are already lost, you cannot identify your location only by looking at the stars, though a successful navigation check will tell you that you are lost.

**Destiny Level:**  
You have advantage on navigation checks. You can identify your location from a successful navigation check.
