## Master of Espionage

_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._  
Whether it be heists, spying, or sabotage, you are accomplished in the ways of espionage. You may declare an object as the target of your espionage. If you spend one day gathering knowledge about the security around your target, you have advantage on all rolls related to accessing that object, and then escaping thereafter.  
If you spend one week gathering knowledge about your target, you may make an "educated guess" about the security around your target. The GM will confirm or deny your educated guess with a simple "yes" or "no".

**Destiny Level:**  
Before you perform your act of espionage, you may choose to lay out a detailed plan. You must describe your plan to the GM. While you execute your espionage, so long as everything goes as planned, you may choose to replace any roll made during the heist with the maximum of your relevant ability die. These benefits do not extend to contingency plans, nor to tasks that were not clearly specified in the plan.
