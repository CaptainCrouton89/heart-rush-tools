## Necromancy

_Major ability. Quick. Handmagic._
You can raise the dead. By sacrificing a creature, you can reanimate another creature of the same type. The ritual takes one hour, and at the end you have a creature with stats identical to the dead creature, with the same might die, d2 cunning, agility, and presence dice, half of the hit point maximum, and no ability to communicate. It loses any special combat abilities it had, and obeys any orders you give it to the best of its ability. You can have no more than one undead creature under your control.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may create and control up to three undead servants with this talent.
