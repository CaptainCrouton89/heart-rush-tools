## Merchant's Luck

_Heart ability. Handmagic._

Fortune favors the bold in business. When making any roll related to trading, buying, selling, or negotiating prices, you may immediately reroll all dice showing results of 3 or lower. You must keep the new results. This includes rolls for finding buyers/sellers, determining trader levels, negotiating prices, or avoiding trade-related complications.

**Destiny Level:**
This ability becomes a passive ability instead. Additionally, when you roll the maximum value on any die during a trade-related roll, you may roll that die again and add the result.
