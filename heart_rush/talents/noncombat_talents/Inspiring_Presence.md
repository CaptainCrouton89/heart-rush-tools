## Inspiring Presence

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

Your natural leadership and encouragement elevate those around you to perform beyond their normal capabilities. When you use the help action, the creature you're helping may use your presence die instead of their heart die when making the skill check, in addition to gaining advantage.

Additionally, when you help someone who is already being helped by another creature, your assistance grants them an additional level of advantage beyond the normal cap of one.

**Destiny Level:**
You can help multiple creatures with a single action. When you take the help action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see and hear you. All chosen creatures gain the benefits of your help for their next applicable roll.
