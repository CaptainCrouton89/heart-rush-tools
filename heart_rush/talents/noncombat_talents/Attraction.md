## Attraction

_Major ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Force._

Choose any two inanimate objects. Those objects attract each other with 50 pounds of force if they are within 10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you choose two new objects.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may choose up to five objects, and the attractive force begins at 100 feet away. If you use this ability on the same objects every day for a month, the effect becomes permanent.
