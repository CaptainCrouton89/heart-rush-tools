## Misty Illusions

_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._  
You can manipulate the water in the air to create realistic illusions. Add mist to your resonate substances as a liquid attunement.  
As an action, you may make an illusion of a single object within the range of your mist manipulation. The illusion cannot be seen through, and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion until they have interacted with it in some way, at which point the illusion fades from their sight. Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of another object, though they appear as three-dimensional objects, so they cannot be illusions of darkness, empty space, or your immediate surroundings.  
If a creature has reason to suspect it is an illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or disappears, they may make a cunning check contested by your cunning challenge number. On a success, they see through the illusion.

**Destiny Level:**  
By agitating the molecules in the air, you can also cause the illusion to emit realistic sounds of your choice. You may manipulate the image and sounds as an object interaction.
