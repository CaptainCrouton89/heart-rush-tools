## Adherence

_Heart ability. Handmagic._
As an action, you may point at a non-living, unoccupied object or space within 30 feet. Up to a 5-foot cube worth of volume of that object becomes covered in an extremely sticky slime, with sticking power equal to 100 pounds. If a creature steps on the object, they must use their action to step free of it, and the space counts as difficult terrain.

**Destiny Level:**  
The sticking force increases to 200 pounds. Freeing oneself from the slime requires a CN 12 might check.
