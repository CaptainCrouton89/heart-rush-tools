## Beastform

_Major ability. Handmagic._
When you pick this talent, work with your GM to pick a common and mundane creature that you can transform into. As an action, you may transform into this creature. You maintain your mental stats, though take on the physical stats and abilities of the chosen creature.  
The creature cannot have a fly speed or a swim speed, and should use either a d4 and d8, or two d6s for its might and agility ability dice. It must be either a small or medium creature. It has the same maximum hit points and heart die as you do.  
You automatically revert to your natural form after one hour, or as an action any time before then.

**Destiny Level:**  
This becomes a passive ability. You may stay in your transformed state for any amount of time. The creature you transform into may be tiny, and may have a swim speed. The creature can have 2d8s, or a d4 and d10 for its might and agility dice.
