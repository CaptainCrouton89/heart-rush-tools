## Hunter

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  
You have AD2 on your roll to find the animal. You may hunt while traveling without being forced to move at half speed. When you fail to kill a creature you hunt, it will not become aggressive unless you get a complication.

**Destiny Level:**  
When you hunt, you may choose which animal you are hunting for, so long as that animal is native to the environment.
