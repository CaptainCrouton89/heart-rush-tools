## Chaos Gambler

_Passive ability. Handmagic._

You have inscribed runes of pure chaos upon your hands, channeling unpredictable forces through your very being. When you take this talent, choose physical or mental. You gain one level of permanent vulnerability in your chosen type (complications and failures occur on 1s and 2s for might and agility checks if physical, or cunning and presence checks if mental).

In exchange, whenever you roll the maximum result on any die during a skill check of your chosen type, you may immediately roll another die of the same size and add it to your result. This can trigger multiple times on the same roll - each maximum roll grants another die. Note that multiple 1s _always_ triggers total failure and a complication.

**Destiny Level:**
The chaos runes spread across your body like living tattoos. You gain an additional level of vulnerability in your chosen type (complications and failures now occur on 1s, 2s, and 3s). However, your exploding dice now trigger on the maximum result OR one below maximum (e.g., 5-6 on a d6, 11-12 on a d12) for skill checks of your chosen type.
