## Chaos Gambler
_Major ability. Handmagic._

You have inscribed runes of pure chaos upon your hands, channeling unpredictable forces through your very being. When you make a skill check, you may invoke the chaos flowing through these runes, surrendering control of the outcome entirely.

When you invoke chaos, this check ignores advantage and disadvantage—roll your normal dice pool as if you had neither. For this check, you suffer one level of vulnerability (complications and failures occur on 1s and 2s). However, whenever you roll the maximum result on any die (including exploded dice), immediately roll another die of the same size and add it to your result. Each maximum result triggers another explosion. Only dice from your original pool can trigger vulnerability—exploded dice cannot cause failures.

**Destiny Level:**
The chaos runes spread across your body like living tattoos, deepening your connection to unpredictable forces. Your exploding dice now trigger on the maximum result OR one below maximum (e.g., 5-6 on a d6, 11-12 on a d12).
