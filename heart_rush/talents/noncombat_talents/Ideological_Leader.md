## Ideological Leader
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

You have a cause, and you are good at rallying those around you to it. If you spend ten minutes talking to a crowd of ten or more, you convert 1/10th of the people who are at least one level of influence lower than you into followers.  
You have advantage when trying to persuade your followers to take an action that aligns with your ideology.

**Destiny Level:**  
Your rhetoric is so strong, you can convert 1/4th of a crowd to followers, rather than 1/10th.  
When you take this destiny level, you may also choose and describe how you gain one devotee to your ideology. You may take this destiny level multiple times.
