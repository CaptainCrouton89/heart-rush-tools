## Everything has a price

_Weekly ability. Handmagic._
If you touch someone, you may force them to be willing to sell any item to you. They will not necessarily be willing to sell it for a price that you desire, but if they would not have otherwise been willing to sell the item, they are now.

**Destiny Level:**  
When you touch someone, you know with certainty for the next 24 hours when they are bluffing about anything related to prices, markets, risk, and gambling.
