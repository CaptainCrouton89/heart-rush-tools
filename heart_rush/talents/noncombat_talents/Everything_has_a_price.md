## Everything Has a Price

_Weekly ability. Handmagic._

You gain advantage (d4) on all rolls for haggling over material goods—persuading someone to sell to you at a cheaper cost, or buy from you at a higher cost—and appraising item value.

**Destiny Level:**  

Your advantage is not limited to material goods and extends to information, services, and other intangible exchanges. Additionally, you gain advantage (d4) to tell when someone is bluffing about a thing in their possession. This applies when they claim to have or not have something (an item, information about an external thing, etc.), or when they misrepresent its value. This does not reveal lies about their internal state or motivations.
