## Inanimate Object

_Major ability. Quick. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may transform into any generic object that would fit in a space somewhere between a 1 inch cube and a 10 foot cube. You remain sentient but cannot move. You can sense your surroundings in a 5 foot radius. The transformation lasts for one hour, or until you spend your action to transform back into your natural form.

**Destiny Level:**  
There is no limit to the duration you can remain transformed.
