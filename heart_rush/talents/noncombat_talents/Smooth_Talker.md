## Smooth Talker
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

Whenever you speak, your words come out like smooth butter. You have A2 on presence skill checks to persuade, intimidate, and deceive.

**Destiny Level:**  
When you gain this destiny level, choose persuasion, intimidation, or deception. Whenever you make a skill check in that category, before you roll, you may choose to instead use the maximum result of your presence die rather than rolling.
