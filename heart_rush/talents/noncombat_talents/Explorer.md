## Explorer

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  
Adventuring and unexpected difficulty have taught you how to prepare for any situation. At any time, you may choose to allocate 10 slots as "adventuring gear". When you do so, choose one from the following list of benefits. You can only choose each benefit once, and the slots remain allocated until you reach a location where you can resupply and change out your equipment.

- You have A2 on checks to navigate. You know which direction is North.
- Your shelter counts as indoors for purpose of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.
- Your bed counts as a straw bed for the purpose of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may choose each option more than once, to grant additional levels of advantage on navigation checks, or give other people the benefits of shelter and a straw bed.  
Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense for where there may be more to discover, and what you might find. Once per month, while exploring a location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that there is more to be discovered. Then name either ruin, settlement, or natural wonder, and choose a direction that you have not been in before. Whatever you named is located somewhat closely in the named direction. The GM may ask you to choose a different direction, or a different discovery.
