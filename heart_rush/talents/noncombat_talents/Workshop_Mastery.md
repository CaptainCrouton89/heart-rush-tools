## Workshop Mastery
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._


You've learned advanced techniques that let you exceed normal workspace limitations. You may use a workshop or laboratory as if it were one level higher than it actually is. This cannot raise an ordinary workshop above level 5.

**Destiny Level:**
You can use workspaces as if they were two levels higher (still capped at level 5 for ordinary workshops). Additionally, while working in a level 4+ workspace, you get +2 on all crafting skill checks. If you own a workspace, you may spend a month customizing it to your techniques; a customized workspace grants +4 instead.
