## Divine Consult

_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._  
You are capable of limited communication with the daemon you worship. After spending one minute in prayer, you may ask one yes or no question of the daemon. The GM must either answer it truthfully, or you may put 1 XP into the experience bowl. You cannot use this ability more than once per session, and you cannot ask the same question again, regardless of if the GM answered it.

**Destiny Level:**  
Rather than ask a yes or no question, you can ask any question, and get no more than a couple of words in answer.
