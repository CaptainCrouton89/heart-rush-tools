## Salvage Master
_Heart ability. Cognitive talent._


When you come across a broken or ruined magical item, you may spend an hour examining it to extract a single magical component. The component's level equals half the item's level (round down, minimum 1), and its tags relate to the item's original properties.

**Destiny Level:**
You extract 1d4 components instead of one, and they can be extracted at a level equal to the level of the orginal item. Additionally, if you study the broken item for a full day, you learn its original crafting recipe.
