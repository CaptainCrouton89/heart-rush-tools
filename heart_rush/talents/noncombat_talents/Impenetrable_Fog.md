## Impenetrable Fog

_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._  
Add fog to your resonate substances as a gaseous attunement. Your attunement to fog is equal to the lower of levels between your attunements to water and air. Fog cannot be seen through.

**Destiny Level:**  
The fog you create is incredibly thick, and hangs heavy in the air. It takes 1 hour to dissipate instead of 1 minute, and mutes the sounds within it, granting A3 on all stealth checks to remain quiet while navigating within the fog.
