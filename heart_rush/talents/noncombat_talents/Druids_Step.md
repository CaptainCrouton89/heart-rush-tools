## Druid's Step

_Passive ability. Handmagic._  
So long as you are walking on unaltered, natural terrain, you may ignore difficult terrain, you cannot be tracked if you do not wish to be, and your move speed increases by 20 feet.

**Destiny Level:**  
Your move speed bonus increases by another 20 feet. The ability grants a 20-foot swim speed, and you can climb any tree with a 10-foot climb speed.  
Whenever you move, you may move directly through trees and other large plants.  
If you have the destiny level of the Druid's Touch talent, you gain a move speed of 20 feet so long as you are transformed as a plant.
