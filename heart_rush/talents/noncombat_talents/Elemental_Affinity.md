## Elemental Affinity

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  
Choose an element. You gain a basic level of attunement with that element, or gain an advanced level of attunement with an element you already have a basic attunement with. You may take this talent multiple times.

Note: Elemental attunements grant access to both cantrips (magical weapons) and spells (strategic abilities). See the Weapons & Cantrips section for cantrip rules, and the Spells section for spell rules.

**Destiny Level:**  
Choose an element you are attuned to. You do not have to wait more than a single short rest between casting spells that require just that element.
