## Mad Inventor

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

Your unorthodox methods allow you to push beyond normal crafting limits. When inventing items, you may use components that are one level lower than normally required. However, all items crafted this way are automatically unstable (as per the unstable creation rules) with maximum starting instability points.

**Destiny Level:**
You may use components that are up to two levels lower than required. When you do this, the item is "very unstable". Very unstable items cannot be stabilized. When instability triggers, a 6 triggers a random, one-time minor benefit instead of stabilizing.
