## Batch Producer
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._


When crafting alchemical items that normally produce multiple doses/items per batch, increase the batch size by 50% (round up). Additionally, when crafting unique consumables, you have a 25% chance to produce two instead of one.

**Destiny Level:**
Batch sizes are doubled instead. The chance for extra unique consumables increases to 50%. Additionally, when making items in batches, if you succeed on all crafting checks without any failures, one item in the batch is of exceptional quality (minor beneficial property determined by GM).
