## Dream Witness

_Minor ability. Void._

You spend one minute concentrating on a willing or unconscious creature within 10 feet to pierce the veil between consciousness and dreams. Make a contested cunning check against their presence or cunning—willing participants can choose to fail this check. On a success, both of you enter a shared dream state where you are unconscious, incapacitated, and completely unaware of your physical surroundings.

While dreaming, you witness one specific event from the target's memory that occurred within the last month. You experience it from their perspective, seeing what they saw, feeling what they felt, understanding their thoughts and emotions in that moment. The dream continues until the memory concludes naturally, or you choose to end it early.

If either of you takes damage or another creature spends an action attempting to wake you, the target can make another contested cunning check to break free if they wish to resist. On a failed check, the dream continues uninterrupted.

**Destiny Level:**
Your mastery of dream-walking allows you to extract deeper truths. While in the dream, you can ask the target questions about the event they're reliving. They must answer truthfully, though their answers may manifest as cryptic symbols or metaphorical imagery, as dreams often distort meaning. You can also follow threads of memory to witness additional related events that connect to the central experience, forming a chain of connected memories.

However, this deeper intrusion risks detection. For every two questions you ask or each additional event you attempt to witness, an unwilling target may begin to sense the artificial nature of the dream. Make another contested cunning check. On a success, you maintain the dream's integrity and continue your investigation. On a failure, the target's subconscious recognizes the intrusion—they awaken immediately and the dream shatters, ending the effect and leaving both of you disoriented.
