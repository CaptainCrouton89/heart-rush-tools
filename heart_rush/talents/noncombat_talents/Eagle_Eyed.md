## Eagle Eyed
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

You may take the Lookout action for free, once per travel and camp phase.

**Destiny Level:**  
Whenever you use the Lookout action, choose "threat" or "opportunity". When you choose "threat," you automatically succeed the cunning check but do not spot anything interesting. If you choose opportunity, you only have to beat the challenge number by one in order to spot something interesting.
