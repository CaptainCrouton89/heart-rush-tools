## Two-faced

_Passive ability. Handmagic._  
You have two faces, your natural face and a second face with features you decide, which you can switch between by passing a hand over your face. The second face is always the same face. It requires an action to perform this ability.

**Destiny Level:**  
Your face can change to any face you've seen before when you use this ability.
