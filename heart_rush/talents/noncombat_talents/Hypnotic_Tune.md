## Hypnotic Tune

_Weekly ability. Full action. Gaeic melody._  
As an action, you may begin playing this song. So long as you are playing this song, creatures within 120 feet and in earshot cannot move or take actions, so long as they are not being attacked, and are not in obvious danger. You may continue playing for up to one hour. When you stop playing, the effect takes 1 minute to wear off.

**Destiny Level:**  
Even if a creature is being attacked, or is in danger, it still cannot move more than half of its speed each round, so long as it is within the effects of the spell. In addition, you may play this song for up to twelve hours.
