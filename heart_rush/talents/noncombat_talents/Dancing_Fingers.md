## Dancing Fingers

_Passive ability. Handmagic._  
As an action, you can make a small object (less than a couple pounds, no bigger than your hand) disappear on your person so long as you are wearing clothes and your hands are free. You can carry up to 20 slots of items in this way. In addition, once per day, you may produce any non-unique, inexpensive item from your person.

**Destiny Level:**  
You have A4 on all attempts to perform any sort of sleight of hand.
