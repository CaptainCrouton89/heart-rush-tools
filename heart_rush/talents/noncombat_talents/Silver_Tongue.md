## Silver Tongue

_Major ability. Quick. Handmagic._
As an action, you may charm a person you are talking to. They gain 2 ranks of charmed towards you for the next hour, after which they know they were magically charmed by you. They lose all ranks of charmed if you take a hostile action towards them.

**Destiny Level:**  
The effect lasts twelve hours rather than one. The person does not realize they were charmed when the effect ends.
