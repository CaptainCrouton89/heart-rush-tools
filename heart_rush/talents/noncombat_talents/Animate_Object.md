## Animate Object

_Heart ability. Quick. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may point at an inanimate object within 30 feet that could fit in a 5-foot cube. The object obeys your commands to the best of its ability, and gains a move speed of 15 feet. This effect lasts for as long as you remain pointing at it. You cannot animate more than one object using this ability.

**Destiny Level:**  
You may manipulate up to three objects at once with this ability. You do not have to point at them to animate them, but they must remain within 30 feet. The objects must fit in a 10-foot cube.
