## Faceless Servant
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you summon forth a faceless, humanoid servant in peasant's clothes. Their face is a smooth surface with only eyes to see and ears to hear. They will obey polite, safe commands until they disappear in one hour. They use a d4 for all ability dice, a d6 heart die, and immediately disappear if they take any damage or negative effects. The servant requires no food, water, or sleep, but can only obey simple commands, and must remain within 100 feet of you at all times.

**Destiny Level:**  
The servant remains indefinitely. You cannot have more than one servant alive at any time. You may take this destiny level again to increase the maximum number of servants at your disposal by one.
