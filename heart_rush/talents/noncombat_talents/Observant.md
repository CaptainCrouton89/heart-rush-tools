## Observant
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._  

You have A4 on cunning checks to notice things.  
In addition, so long as you can see someone's lips and understand the language they are speaking, you know what they are saying, even if you can't hear them.

**Destiny Level:**  
Hidden attackers cannot make opportunity attacks against you, you do not suffer any penalty from attacking an obscured enemy, and obscured enemies gain no advantage when attacking you.  
In addition, if you spend your action watching a creature fight for three rounds or more, you learn the creature's strengths and weaknesses, and have advantage on all A/D rolls made against that creature.
