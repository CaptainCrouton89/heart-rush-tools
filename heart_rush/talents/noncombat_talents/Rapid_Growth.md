## Rapid Growth
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may place your hand on a non-living object that fits in a space somewhere between a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows to fill a 10-foot cube, or shrinks to fit a 2-inch cube, though it will not grow if it is enclosed. The transformation lasts for one hour, or until dismissed as an action.

**Destiny Level:**  
The transformation lasts indefinitely, though you may not use this ability on more than three different objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases to a 25-foot cube.
