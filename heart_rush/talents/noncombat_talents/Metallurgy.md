## Metallurgy
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Earth._  

Add iron and steel to your resonate substances as a basic solid attunement.  
Whenever you are hit with a melee weapon made of iron or steel, you may catch the blade in your hand, warping and bending it in your grip. Do not roll a defense roll—you take the full damage—but the weapon is rendered useless, and cannot be used again.

**Destiny Level:**  
If you have a paragon attunement to earth, you gain an advanced attunement to iron and steel.
