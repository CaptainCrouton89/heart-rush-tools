## Song of Rage

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._  
After playing your instrument for a minute or more, you may choose a creature within 60 feet and in earshot. It feels an inexplicable dislike towards a creature of your choice. If they were close, they become neutral. If they were friendly, they become unfriendly. If they were neutral or unfriendly, they become hostile, and potentially violent. This effect lasts for the rest of the day.

**Destiny Level:**  
That creature gains three levels of enraged towards that creature until the end of the day.
