# Heart Rush TTRPG Rules

## Aspects

Aspects are traits or characteristics that can influence gameplay. For example, a character with the aspect "Kleptomaniac" could gain a bonus to rolls when attempting to steal. However, players can also gain Drama Points (DP) for invoking this aspect at times when it would be best _not_ to steal. 

You can even use both the aspect and the DP system simultaneously. For instance, if you decide to steal something you shouldn’t, you would gain DP for the attempt but could immediately spend that same amount to gain a bonus on the roll.

## Wounds

When you take wounds, they will have a description and a rank, similar to an aspect. You may use wounds as aspects as well, but you cannot gain more than 5 DP from invoking a wound, regardless of its rank. 

### Example:
- If you have a rank 12 wound called "Guts spilling out," you could gain 5 DP by taking a -12 penalty to nearly any Athletics check. This penalty reflects the logical difficulty of performing physical actions with such a severe injury.

## Progress

There are six different ranks of combat power in Heart Rush. Each rank grants access to more combat abilities. At the start of the game, players should agree on which rank to begin. 

- **Rank 1**: Players are barely more than commoners with a desire for excitement.
- **Rank 4**: Players are incredible combatants, likely known throughout their community.
- **Rank 6 and beyond**: Players reach low heroic levels, with everything else falling somewhere in between.

### Abilities and Experience Points (XP)

At each rank, you gain new abilities. If you start at a rank higher than 1, you gain all abilities from previous ranks and start with XP equal to the corresponding value in the table below.

| Rank | Abilities                     | Starting XP |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| 0    | None                          | 5           |
| 1    | Some class abilities          | 15          |
| 2    | Class and subclass abilities   | 30          |
| 3    | More subclass abilities       | 50          |
| 4    | Even more subclass abilities   | 80          |
| 5+   | A paragon ability per rank    | 120 + 40 per level |

## Combat Ranks, Classes, Subclasses, & Paragon Levels

While you will gain XP every session, progression in combat ranks is at the GM’s discretion. Generally, you should expect to advance to the next combat rank when you have an amount of total XP corresponding to the respective rank outlined in the table above. However, the final decision rests with the GM.

### Rank Descriptions

- **Rank 0**: You have no special abilities beyond those purchased with your XP.
  
- **Rank 1**: Choose a class from the Classes section. Your class determines your role in combat (e.g., tanking, dealing damage, or supporting teammates). Mark down all abilities for that class that are at or below rank 1.

- **Rank 2**: Choose a subclass, which specializes your class. Mark down all abilities for your class and subclass that are at or below rank 2. At this stage, decide if you wish to become Spelltouched, a universal subclass specializing in elemental damage. More information can be found in the Spelltouched section.

- **Rank 3**: Unlock additional abilities in your subclass. Mark down all abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 3.

- **Rank 4**: Unlock the final abilities from your subclass. Mark down all abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 4.

- **Rank 5 and Above**: Upon reaching rank 5 and for each rank thereafter, you gain a paragon level. You may choose and gain an ability from the Paragon Abilities section, representing heroic-level capstones to various combat archetypes.

## Building Your Character

### Advice for New Groups

If everyone in your group is new to Heart Rush, starting at rank 0 is advisable. Many rules only come into play once you have a class, and Heart Rush combat can take time to understand, so starting small can be beneficial.

### GM Note

When determining when to grant players the next combat rank, it’s generally a good idea to wait until the party has won a suitably impressive fight. These combat ranks are significant upgrades in player combat power and serve as a rewarding incentive for overcoming more dangerous challenges.

## Burn Through Those DP

To maximize your character's potential, frequently invoke your aspects. DP are not meant to be hoarded—spend them and earn more by invoking your negative aspects. When creating your character, ensure your aspects are enjoyable to use, as you will be utilizing them often.
