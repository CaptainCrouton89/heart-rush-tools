# Heart Rush TTRPG Rules

## Spells

### Steam Fissure
**Element:** Fire and Water  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
You open your hand towards the sky, forcing fissures open in the ground around you, producing geysers of scalding steam from the depths beneath you. Choose four unoccupied spaces within 45 feet. Creatures take **1d10 damage** whenever they enter or start their turn in that space, no more than once per round.

### Stone Skinned
**Element:** Earth  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
You can make your skin turn as tough as stone, whether literally or figuratively. You gain a **+6 bonus** on slashing and piercing defense rolls, and your movement speed decreases by **10 feet**.

### Sunbeams
**Element:** Light  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
You drag a pointed finger from the sky to your target, sending beams of sunlight down from the heavens, blinding and burning those caught within. Choose a point within **45 feet**. Bright light illuminates everything in a **5-foot radius** around that point. Creatures of your choice that enter or start their turn in one of these spaces take **2 levels of blinded** and **1d6 damage**.

### Telekinesis
**Element:** Force  
**Duration:** Immediate  
You hurl a large object at a creature. The object must weigh between **5 and 20 pounds**, be within **45 feet**, and cannot be attached to anything else that would prevent it from moving. The target must make an agility saving throw against your spellcasting ability. On a failure, they take **5d6 damage** and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage.

### Temporal Hiccup
**Element:** Time  
**Duration:** Instant  
With the clap of your hands, a flicker in the normal continuum of time ripples out from you. All creatures within **45 feet** have **DA3** on the next roll they make, or until the end of the round, whichever comes first.

---

### Temporal Scramble
**Element:** Time  
**Duration:** Instant  
After everyone who wants to join the engagement has done so, but before stances are chosen, you may use this ability. Each creature in the engagement rolls a **d100**. In order from lowest to highest result, each creature announces their stance. You may roll the **d100** twice and take either result.

---

### Thunder Blast
**Element:** Air  
You clap your hands or snap your fingers, releasing a concussive blast of thunder that blows creatures away from you. Creatures of your choice within **10 feet** of you are blown back **10 feet** directly away from you.

---

### Time Cube
**Element:** Time  
**Duration:** Instant  
By twisting the threads of your own timeline between your fingers, you bind it into a cube within which you can act. This round, you can take **three additional actions**. None of these actions can affect any other creature.

---

### Time Twister
**Element:** Time  
You yank loose the threads of time, reverting it to an earlier state. Creatures of your choice within **45 feet** of you are teleported to their starting positions this round. Creatures of your choice who have not moved yet this round may immediately move a distance up to their movement speed.

---

### Tremor Stomp
**Element:** Earth  
You stomp the ground, causing it to shudder and quake. Creatures of your choice within **10 feet** immediately take **three levels of off-balanced** and fall prone. If you are underground, those creatures also take **1d6 damage**.

---

### Twister
**Element:** Air  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
By spinning your finger in the air, you stir the air into a twister. A coiling tornado touches down, throwing people aside as it travels across the ground. Choose a **10-foot square** within **45 feet**. All area within is affected. Projectiles are thrown aside if they pass through, and anyone who enters is thrown **10 feet** in a direction of your choice and lands prone, taking **1d6 damage**. At the beginning of each round, you may choose to move the twister **15 feet** in a direction of your choice.

Choose a creature within **45 feet**. It takes **one level of burning**. Levels of burning do not fade from this creature.

---

### Wall of Fire
**Element:** Fire  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
By drawing a line with your finger, you cause immense flames to grow where you point. Choose a point within **45 feet** and draw a straight line **20 feet** in length starting from that point. A wall of fire grows there. Anyone who passes through the fire takes **three levels of burning**. The fire does not spread and disappears when the spell ends.

---

### Wall of Stone
**Element:** Earth  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
By drawing a line with your finger, you cause stone walls to shoot up from the ground where you point. Choose a point within **45 feet** and draw a straight line **20 feet** in length starting from that point. A wall of rock grows there, **10 feet high**. Each wall segment can take **30 damage** before disintegrating and has a flat **15 defense**.

### Warpspace
**Element:** Void  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
By dragging at the seams separating the void from the material world, you allow some of it to spill over. Certain spaces become areas of warped space. Choose **six unoccupied spaces** within **45 feet**. Each space ceases to exist. It costs no movement speed to cross that space, and all spaces adjacent to a warped space are considered adjacent to all other spaces adjacent to that and any other connected warped spaces.
