# Gameplay Basics

This section describes how general gameplay should proceed.

## Rolling Dice

### Skill Checks

Whenever you attempt to do something that has a realistic chance of failure, the GM may ask you to roll a skill check to see if you succeed. When rolling a skill check, you need to roll two dice: your heart die and one of your ability dice. The ability die should correspond to the activity you are doing. For example, if you are lifting something heavy, you should use your might die.

After rolling the dice, calculate the sum and add any modifiers you may gain from your aspects or other bonuses. If the total is equal to or higher than the GM’s predetermined challenge number (CN), then you succeed.

### Difficulties

The GM should use the following chart to set the challenge number:

| CN | Difficulty       | Low Skill (d8+d6) | High Skill (d8+d8+2) | Very High Skill (d8+d10+4) |
|----|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 6  | Fairly Easy      | 79%               | 95%                  | 100%                       |
| 9  | Average          | 44%               | 77%                  | 93%                        |
| 12 | Hard             | 13%               | 44%                  | 74%                        |
| 15 | Very Hard        | –                 | 16%                  | 45%                        |
| 18 | Nearly Impossible | –                 | 2%                   | 19%                        |
| 21 | Heroic           | –                 | –                    | 4%                         |

The percentages in the cells correspond to the chance of success for a typical human at full heart with low, high, and very high skill levels. Note that players can eventually reach up to d12+d20+10, and this chart does not account for complications.

### Complications

As your heart leads you through your life and story, there may be times that it stutters. When it does, you may fail at whatever you are doing, or something else may go wrong. This is represented by rolling a 1 on a skill check.

Whenever you make a skill check, if the result on one of the dice is a 1, you must choose to either automatically fail the check or re-roll that die, using the new result. If you choose to re-roll, a complication occurs. A complication does not mean you fail at your task; instead, something related to the task at hand but not determinative of your success or failure goes wrong. This can manifest in various ways, such as breaking your lock picks if you were trying to open a door or sparking a new line of interrogation if you were trying to smooth talk your way past guards. If you roll additional 1s, they do not cause complications. However, if you roll two 1s as your first roll, you fail the check, and a complication occurs.

### Raising the Stakes

Before rolling dice for a skill check, you or another player may choose to raise the stakes. This increases the effectiveness of a success and heightens the consequences of a failure. You may do this once per session on any roll made by any player.

## Saving Throws

Whenever you need to roll to avoid or mitigate the effects of someone else’s action, such as dodging a falling boulder or withstanding powerful venom, you make a saving throw. Saving throws are identical to skill checks, except they do not provoke complications. Instead, rolling equal to or over the challenge number implies you avoid the negative effect, while rolling under implies you suffer the negative effect.

When the effect was created by another creature, saving throws are usually made against that creature’s ability challenge number. If the effect comes from the environment, the CN will be determined by the GM.

### Ability Challenge Number

When another creature is avoiding an effect you have caused, the GM may have them roll a saving throw. The CN for this roll is equal to the maximum of your most applicable ability die, plus two times your paragon level (which starts at zero). This number is generically called your ability challenge number. Use whichever ability is most relevant for the roll, or if no ability die fits—such as in the case of magical effects—use your heart challenge number, which is the maximum of your heart die.

## Attack & Defense Rolls

Attack and defense rolls (A/D rolls) are made whenever you roll to deal or negate damage in an engagement or opportunity attack. Roll the relevant ability die, your heart die, and add any necessary modifiers. A/D rolls are explained in greater detail in the Combat chapter.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

Advantage and disadvantage provide bonuses or penalties to a roll. For each instance of advantage, roll an additional instance of the lowest of the dice, and then remove the lowest result when calculating the total. When rolling with disadvantage, roll an additional instance of the highest of the dice, and then remove the highest result.

Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, and multiple instances of either can stack. Multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage are referred to as Ax or Dx, where 'x' indicates the number of instances. When determining the outcome with advantage or disadvantage, treat the final result as if only the dice that were kept were rolled.

## Helping

When someone wishes to assist another person with a skill check, they can choose to help. If you are in combat, this requires your action. Helping grants the person making the check advantage, as long as you can reasonably provide help in that situation. If you help someone, you are both liable to suffer any consequences from complications or failures.

## Group Rolls

Sometimes, everyone in a group will need to make the same check or will want to help on the same check. For example, working together to break down a door, sneaking past guards, or persuading a judge could all be group rolls. Rolls are calculated differently depending on the exact type of task.

- **Weakest Link Check**: If everyone is making a check where the group is only as strong as the weakest link (e.g., sneaking past guards), only one person rolls. The person in the group who is the worst at making this roll rolls for the group with advantage. It is assumed that everyone else will succeed, but if this person fails, everyone else may fail as well.

- **Collaborative Check**: If it is a task where people work together (e.g., convincing someone of the truth), only the person best at the task rolls, and they may roll with advantage.

## Using Abilities

When creating your character, you will gain various abilities. Abilities are any chunk of rules that let you create an effect, perform an activity, or do anything at all. Examples include class abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels. You can recognize an ability by its format:

**Ability Name**  
*Ability tags.*  
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.

All abilities listed in this rulebook have their name, followed by tags, and then followed by their rules. Most abilities can be used whenever you want; however, some have restrictions, usually listed in their tags or in the ability rules itself.

### Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often it can be used. An ability can be either _passive_, _minor_, _heart_, _major_, _weekly_, or _monthly_. This tag is always listed as the first tag.

- **Passive Ability**: There are no restrictions on how many times you can use this ability. It is assumed to always be active.

- **Minor Ability**: You may use this ability by spending a rush point for each time you have used it during the current encounter. You may not use it outside of an encounter.

- **Heart Ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest. If you take a wound, you may use the ability again.

- **Major Ability**: You may use this ability once per long rest.

- **Weekly Ability**: You may use this ability once per week.

- **Monthly Ability**: You may use this ability once per month.

### Timing Tag

Outside of combat, you can use an ability whenever you want—there are no restrictions besides those listed on the ability itself. However, during combat, you must have priority to use your abilities. Priority is described in detail in the Combat section. The _instant_ tag is an exception to this rule. Abilities that don’t have the instant tag are referred to as “priority abilities.”

- **Instant**: If an ability is marked as instant, it can be used literally any time, even when you don't have priority. This includes while another creature is using an ability or while you roll dice for an attack—literally any time, as long as the ability doesn’t have any further explicit instructions on when it can be used. If multiple creatures want to use an instant ability, whoever declared their use last goes first. You must declare how you are using your ability when you announce that you are using it.

### Action Tag

During each round of combat, you only have one action. By default, abilities don’t use your action unless they have the full action tag. If an ability is marked as full action, it means that the ability uses your action. If you don't have an action left during this round, you cannot use the ability.

## Other Rules

### Forced Movement

If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and this movement is interrupted by a wall, another creature within two sizes of your own, or a heavy shield wielded by an enemy, you immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for every 5 feet remaining in your movement. If this movement is stopped by a creature that is not wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and the total damage is split evenly between the two creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to move.

### Size

Creatures can be of many different sizes. From smallest to largest, they are: minuscule, tiny, small, medium, large, and then L2, L3, L4, and so on. Different sizes come with different bonuses and penalties, especially in combat. Up to a thousand minuscule creatures can fit into...
