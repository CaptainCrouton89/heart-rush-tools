# Combat

Combat in Heart Rush occurs in rounds, divided into engagements and actions. Engagements represent short scenes of combat between participants, abstracting the actions of multiple combatants attempting to attack each other. Each round allows everyone to use their abilities and take actions, but the order of these actions can vary.

## Starting Combat

When combat begins, all participants lose priority, meaning they cannot use abilities that are not **instant**. Priority is granted to one side, which then alternates until all participants have acted. 

### Determining Starting Priority

1. If one side is caught off guard, the other side gains priority and chooses a participant to start.
2. If both sides anticipated combat, players roll **1d6**:
   - A roll of **4 or higher** grants priority to the players.
3. The starting side retains priority at the beginning of each subsequent round.

## Priority During Combat

When your side has priority, any participant can use an ability. After an ability is used, priority passes to the opposing side. If they choose not to use an ability, priority returns to your side.

### Sequence of Actions

1. A participant on the side with priority uses an ability.
2. Once that ability resolves, the opposing side can choose to use an ability.
3. If the opposing side opts not to use an ability, the original side can act again.
4. This continues until neither side wishes to act, ending the round.

**Note:** Abilities with the **instant** tag do not require priority and do not trigger priority changes.

### Engagements

During engagements (detailed in the **Engaging the Enemy** section), no side has priority. Once an engagement begins, priority is suspended until the engagement concludes.

## Engagements Are Important

Engagements are the core of Heart Rush combat. They may take some time to understand, but they represent chaotic melee situations where anyone could be hurt, including yourself.

## Actions During Combat

In each round, you can take one action and use any number of abilities, adhering to their frequency restrictions.

### Actions

- **Action Limit:** You get one action per round. All actions are abilities and require priority to use.
- **Free Actions:** The first time you perform the following actions each round, they do not cost your action:
  - **Dash**
  - **Object Interaction**
  - **Call Out**

### Engage the Enemy

**Full Action**

You may engage with the enemy, initiating a combat interaction. This does not guarantee you will hit or injure them; they may hit you instead. Rules for engagement are detailed in the **Engaging the Enemy** section.

### Cast a Spell

**Full Action**

Refer to the **Spellcasting** section for details and restrictions on casting spells. You cannot cast a spell if you do not know any spells.

### Sidestep

**Full Action (Instant)**

Instead of using an action, you may spend a rush point to perform this ability. When you take this action, you may move 5 feet or stand up from prone without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Dash

**Full Action (Instant)**

The first dash you take each round does not cost your action. Move a number of feet up to your move speed (60 feet by default). If you move more than 5 feet within a creature’s melee range or leave their melee range without using the sidestep action, that creature may make an opportunity attack against you.

### Object Interaction

**Full Action (Instant)**

The first object interaction you take each round does not cost your action. Any simple interaction with an object counts as an interaction action. Stowing a weapon and retrieving a new one are separate interactions.

### Help

**Full Action**

You aid an adjacent creature, granting them advantage on their next attack/defense roll, skill check, or saving throw.

### Call Out

**Full Action (Instant)**

The first call out you make each round does not cost your action. You may say (or shout) something, limited to one reasonable-length sentence.

## Instant Actions

The following actions can be taken at instant speed, even while another creature is acting. They do not trigger priority changes.

### Enter an Engagement

**Full Action (Instant)**

You may enter an engagement that has already been initiated. You do not need priority to use this ability. After someone uses the **Engage the Enemy** action, everyone can choose to enter until no one wishes to do so. You must have a valid target in range.

### Trip

**Full Action (Instant)**

When a creature with a level of off-balance moves through a space adjacent to you, you may trip them, knocking them prone.

### Opportunity Attack

**Full Action (Instant)**

Instead of using an action, you may spend a rush point to perform this ability. Opportunity attacks allow you to exploit an enemy's weakness without winning an engagement.

**Conditions for Opportunity Attacks:**

- The enemy willingly leaves your melee reach without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy willingly moves more than 5 feet within your melee reach without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy stands up without using the sidestep action.
- You are hidden.
- The target of your action is surprised.

When you take this action, make an attack roll against the creature with your chosen stance.

## Rush Points

Rush points represent the excitement and tension of combat. You start with one rush point at the beginning of combat. At the start of each subsequent round, you gain rush points equal to the number of rounds in which you were part of an engagement, made an opportunity attack, or cast a spell, up to the current number of rounds. Unspent rush points are lost at the end of every round. Outside of combat, you have 0 rush points.

### Hard to Get, but Great

Opportunity attacks are valuable. Enemies will go to great lengths to avoid them, so use this to your advantage.

## Minor Abilities

Minor abilities are unique to your class and subclass. Each time you use a minor ability, you must spend one rush point for each use, including the current one. They do not require an action, but there may be limitations on when you can use them.

## Major Abilities

Major abilities are powerful moves that can only be used once per day. They may have optional rush point costs, allowing them to grow stronger as the fight progresses. Like minor abilities, they do not require an action, but there may be limitations on their use.

## Special Use Cases

Rush points can also be spent to make opportunity attacks or to sidestep.

## Engaging the Enemy

An engagement may involve a flurry of blows or a larger melee with many combatants. When you decide to engage the enemy by taking the **Engage the Enemy** action, choose an enemy you can hit with your weapon. This enemy is now part of the engagement, and they do not have a choice in the matter.

### Joining an Engagement

Once an engagement begins, creatures no longer have priority. The engagement must be resolved before priority is restored. Other creatures within weapon range may choose to join the engagement by spending their action to do so.

### Choosing Stances

After all participants have joined the engagement, each combatant must secretly choose their stance: might, agility, cunning, or defensive. Once everyone has chosen, reveal your stances. Attacks proceed similarly to rock-paper-scissors.

**Note:** If players discuss their stances, the GM should choose the enemies' stances first to prevent accusations of cheating.

## Typical Rounds

In most rounds, you’ll want to move (the first dash is free) and engage the enemy, as this is the primary way to deal damage. Use various abilities as needed, but moving and engaging are the main focuses.

## Stance Descriptions

### Cunning

Those who choose cunning can read and avoid attacks from those who cannot match their strength. They may attack a single creature in the engagement that did not take the might stance. Cunning attacks resolve first, and cunning directly beats agility. When attacking a creature defending with agility, apply up to two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened.

### Agility

Those who choose agility can maneuver effectively, allowing them to evade attacks from those who cannot match their speed. Further details on agility and other stances will follow.
