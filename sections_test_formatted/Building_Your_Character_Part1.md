# Building Your Character

As you create a character in **Heart Rush**, remember that at the center of every character is their heart. It is the foundation on which you build your life and soul; it is the chassis and essence of your decisions and their consequences. It drives you forward. You are building an entire fictional person—make them awesome.

## Your Dream

With this in mind, build a character that has a vision of what they want to achieve. You should have a dream that is complex, difficult, and worthy of the caliber of legend you wish to become. Remember—you determine the direction the story takes. There’s no goal to this game besides the one you set for yourself. Speak with your GM about the world in which the game takes place, and figure out how you want to be remembered. It’s your story, and the stakes are low, so it’s okay to set your sights high.

Once you have come up with something, write this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit or add to it later.

## Your Vitals

These are the core stats of your character. They represent the raw capabilities and limits of your mind and body.

### Experience

When the game begins, you will start with some experience points (XP). During the game and between sessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills, abilities, and more. See the **Spending Experience** section to learn more. After making your character, you may begin spending your XP.

### Ability Dice

Players have four important stats—**Might**, **Agility**, **Cunning**, and **Presence**. These traits define your physical and mental abilities and are used to determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task you attempt.

#### Might

Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude. High Might allows you to push through locked doors, lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles without rest.

#### Agility

Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and reflexes. High Agility allows you to dodge falling rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a somersault on a tightrope.

#### Cunning

Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses. High Cunning allows you to recall information you’ve learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and discern fact from fiction.

#### Presence

Presence is your charm, charisma, and social influence. High Presence allows you to persuade guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone about it.

### Assigning Dice to Your Core Stats

Your prowess in each of these abilities is represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the ability’s corresponding die and add it to the result. 

The first step in creating your character is determining which dice you will use for which stat. Typical humanoids use **d6s** and **d4s** for each ability, reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When you create your character, assign a **d6** to two of your abilities and a **d4** to the remaining two.

## Movement

By default, you have a **60 feet** move speed. This means that when you take the dash action (see the **Combat** section), you can cover that distance. Note that your move speed is negatively affected by equipment penalties (like armor).

- **Swimming**: You have a swim speed of **15 feet**, which is also negatively affected by equipment penalties. Don’t swim with heavy armor on.
- **Climbing**: Your move speed is **5 feet** while climbing. This is not affected by equipment penalties.

## Health

The health of your character is represented by a combination of your hit points, heart die, and wounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take wounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will fall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and taking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too many wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of these systems will be explained further in the following sections.

### Hit Points

Hit points represent your physical health. Damage causes your hit points to fall by a corresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer to death. When you create a character, you start at **40 hit points**. If your hit points ever reach **0**, you can choose to immediately go unconscious. If you don’t, you go unconscious after **10 minutes** if your hit points are still at **0**.

Your hit points can go negative as well. If your hit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of your maximum hit points, you die. When you take a long rest, your hit points return to their maximum.

### Heart Die

Your heart die represents your stamina. It manifests itself when you roll dice to perform challenging actions. With very few exceptions, this die will be part of every roll you make. When you create a character, it starts at a maximum of a **d8**. Other creatures can have larger or smaller heart dice. A rat, for example, will only have a **d4** heart die, while an adult dragon would use a **d20**. It is possible to increase your own heart die beyond a **d8**, but it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.

Sometimes, there will be effects that cause your heart die to increase or decrease. This means replacing your heart die with a die of a larger or smaller size. For example, decreasing your heart die from a **d8** would mean replacing it with a **d6**.

### Wounds

When you take damage in **Heart Rush**, it can mean different things depending on how much damage you take. If it’s less than **10 damage**, this represents minor injuries—nothing that poses a real threat. However, if you take **10 or more damage**, this represents something serious—a wound. The exact details of taking wounds and healing them will be described later in the **Combat** section.

## Your Niche

### Kin & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and has a different upbringing. When you create a character, choose a race from the **Kin & Culture** section. You gain the aspects and abilities that come from choosing that race. Many races have multiple heritages within that race. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities of the race, as well as those of a chosen heritage.

### Talents

Talents are specialized abilities that you know and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing your play style and differentiating you from anyone else in the world. Although you do not start with any talents, they can be purchased with XP, which you start the game with and can immediately use to buy talents.

### Background

Your background describes your past life and skills. Choose up to three professions and distribute **4 ranks** between them. They can all be in one, or they can be spread between them. Whenever you make a skill check that one or more of your professions would apply to, add your rank in the relevant professions to that roll.

### Aspects

For every facet of your character that cannot be described with abilities and skills, they can be described with aspects. Your aspects describe the features and traits from your personality, background, and experiences that make you distinct—both positive and negative.

When you first create your character, you gain **three destiny points (DP)**. You will gain and lose DP each session as you spend them to benefit from your positive aspects and gain them by letting your negative ones shine through. If you ever start a session with fewer than **three DP**, you instead start with **three DP**. You cannot have more than **10 DP**. As you play your character, you will gather more aspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has two parts: its description and its rank.

#### Description

The description describes the aspect as a whole and should be a phrase or a few words to describe your character. It should be a significant personality trait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed title, or some sort of reputation. Examples include:

- "Bullheaded"
- "Record everything"
- "Chronic headaches"
- "Kleptomaniac"
- "Fortune teller"
- "Leave no one behind"
- "I fear nothing"
- "I can see straight into your soul"
- "I want revenge for my father"

Avoid generic descriptions like "good at most things" or "lucky," as they will apply to everything or be too vague to decide if they should apply to a situation. If the GM says your aspect description is too generic, you need to choose a new one or make it more specific.

#### Rank

The rank of an aspect represents how influential that aspect is over who you are and will determine the modifier to your rolls. The rank will be a number between **one and five**, though in some cases, it can be increased even further.

### Using Your Aspect for Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an aspect’s rank, you may add that much to any skill check. In order to use this, whatever roll you are making must align with the meaning of your aspect, as approved by the GM.

For example, if you had the aspect "Leave no one behind" at rank **two**, and you were trying to save a friend stuck in prison, you could spend **two DP** and add **2** to a die roll made to break open the bars of the cell.

If you had the aspect "I want revenge for my father" at rank **four**, you could spend **four DP** and add **4** to any skill check related to getting revenge for your father.

If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll, use only the highest-ranking aspect that applies.

### Using Your Aspect for Destiny Points

If an aspect would complicate a situation or indicate you were bad at something, you may choose to do whatever your aspect would suggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect’s rank. 

Examples of negative aspects include "Bum leg," "Kleptomaniac," and "Quick to draw my sword." If you role-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the GM will award DP. For example, if a bookstore owner insults you, and you have the aspect "Quick to draw my sword" at rank **three**, you would gain **three DP** by drawing your sword and threatening the shop owner.

Likewise, if you were chasing after a fleeing thief, rather than making a skill check to keep up with them, you could choose to fail the roll, citing your bum leg and taking DP corresponding to the rank of the aspect.

### Creating Your Aspects

When you create your character, create **two aspects**. You will gain **two more** from your race and culture, and you may gain more throughout the game. All aspects start at rank **one** when they are created, unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater than rank **five**.

When creating an aspect, it is generally a good idea to have aspects with both positive and negative sides. Without any negative aspects, you have no way of gaining more destiny points, and therefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Also, look out for aspects that can be both positive and negative.

#### Example

Let’s say you have the aspects "Diplomat" at rank **2**, and "I need revenge for my family" at rank **3**. You have just met the queen and are trying to convince her that civil war is imminent. When you make the skill check to convince her of this truth, you spend **3 DP** to increase your roll by **3**, successfully convincing her. However, moments later you find out that the queen herself was complicit in your family’s murders. The GM invokes your aspect for revenge—you gain **2 DP**, but must now exact revenge, or else be forced to pay **2 DP** instead.
