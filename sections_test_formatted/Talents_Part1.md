# Talents

Talents represent specific abilities you have learned, been gifted, or know how to perform through religious or magical ritual. Each talent falls into one of three types of abilities: **passive abilities**, **heart abilities**, or **major abilities**. 

- **Passive abilities** can be used whenever and at no cost.
- **Major abilities** can be used once per day.
- **Heart abilities** can be used again only after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you take a wound.

Additionally, talents may have the **_instant_** or **_full action_** tag:
- **_Instant_**: You can use the ability at any time, even right before you roll.
- **_Full action_**: It requires you to use your action.

## Types of Talents

Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by their tags. Each requires different conditions to be met in order to gain that talent.

### Cognitive and Martial Talents

- **Martial talents** require physical prowess and training, representing the culmination of extensive practice. There are no prerequisites for taking a martial talent.
- **Cognitive talents** also come from vigorous training and practice, with no prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.

### Gaeic Melodies

Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that reverberate throughout all living things—left over from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world into life. Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to them has magical effects. However, they cannot be discovered innately and require a teacher or a songbook. You must have a rank 3 or higher aspect in musical talents to play them.

- **Playing a Gaeic Melody**: Requires your action to play the instrument. You can move up to half your move speed while playing, but cannot move more than that. You cannot play more than one gaeic melody at the same time.

### Handmagic

Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create its effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where words spoken in it simply come true. Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the back of one’s hand, inscribed in the blood of magical creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the tattooed hand in specific ways, one can create magical effects. The knowledge and necessary materials to inscribe hand runes are rare and expensive, often requiring you to be in a city.

### GM Note

Gaeic melodies and handmagic are rooted in lore specific to “Alaria,” the world held in mind during the writing of the Heart Rush rulebook. Feel free to re-flavor these tags, remove them, or add new tags and categorizations.

## Combat Talents

The talents in this section are combat-related talents. This categorization is for ease of finding talents and has no other effect.

### Adrenaline Spike
**Major ability. Handmagic.**  
Increase the size of an ability die for a single roll. You can't increase the size of the die beyond a d12.

**Destiny Level**: Increase the size of the die by two instead, or increase a d12 to a d20.

### Agile
**Passive ability. Martial talent.**  
When you choose the agility stance, you may sidestep twice instead of once.

**Destiny Level**: Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D rolls made this round. Increase the die’s size by one for each consecutive time you chose this stance.

### Assassin
**Passive ability. Martial talent.**  
You have learned the art of debilitating your foes and killing them silently. When you enter an engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately make a might or agility check against their agility challenge number. On a success, you either gag them, garrote them, or in some other way remove their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.

**Destiny Level**: Once per month, you may declare a humanoid to be the target of your assassination. So long as that creature never learns you are an assassin, they remain marked. Given you spend one month studying the target of your assassination before attempting to kill them, you have A5 on opportunity attacks made against your target, and advantage on all other attacks against it.

### Back Stab
**Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.**  
If you and another ally are opposite each other with an enemy directly between you (you can draw a line from a single corner of your space to every corner of the ally’s space such that the line passes completely through the enemy’s space), and the enemy has used its action to enter an engagement with your ally this round, you may treat your weapon as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against that enemy until the end of the round. You must be wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the benefits of this ability. You may also use this die if you are granted an opportunity attack because you are hidden.

**Destiny Level**: You may replace your weapon die with 2d20 instead.

### Baited Attack
**Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.**  
If a creature makes an attack against you and deals no damage to you, they instead deal damage equal to their roll to another creature behind you as you redirect their attack. A creature is considered behind you if at least one straight line can be drawn from a corner of the attacker’s space, through your space, and to a corner of the new victim’s space.

**Destiny Level**: When you use this ability, both creatures gain 2 levels of enraged towards you.

### Ballad Of Björn
**Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.**  
After playing your instrument for a minute or more, you may choose any number of creatures besides yourself within 60 feet and in earshot. They lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had any, and are immune to both conditions for the next 24 hours. In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest and gain one additional rush point the next time they gain rush points today.

**Destiny Level**: This ability becomes a major ability. You may include yourself in the creatures affected by your song.

### BattleFrenzy
**Passive ability. Martial talent.**  
While there are two or more enemies adjacent to you, you have advantage on your attack roll for each enemy adjacent to you.

**Destiny Level**: Whenever you start the round with two or more enemies adjacent to you, you gain a rush point for each adjacent enemy.

### Battlescreech
**Heart ability. Martial talent.**  
You emit a horrifying, earsplitting screech, terrifying and disturbing your enemies. Choose any number of creatures within 30 feet. Those creatures get D2 on their next A/D roll.

**Destiny Level**: Those creatures also don’t gain the benefit of the next stance they choose and gain two levels of dazed.

### Battleweave
**Passive ability. Martial talent.**  
Whenever you sidestep, you deal damage to an adjacent creature at your new location equal to twice the number of enemies you began the round adjacent to.

**Destiny Level**: You may choose to either deal twice as much damage to the target of this ability, or the same amount of damage to every adjacent enemy.

### Beast Bond
**Passive ability. Handmagic.**  
**Prerequisite**: Beast Companion  
You can magically, telepathically communicate with your companion, over any distance. As an action, you may begin sensing through the senses of your beast companion. You cannot use your own senses again until you spend an action returning to your own body.

**Destiny Level**: As an action, you may take total control of your beast companion. While in control, you play each round as the animal instead of yourself. You may use any cognitive and martial talents you have, but the cooldowns are not separate for your animal. For example, once you've used a major ability, you cannot use it yourself or as your animal until you take a long rest. You may also cast spells you know and use your attunements as the animal. While controlling your companion, your body falls prone and is incapacitated, and you cannot sense using your body’s senses. You may return to your body as an action.

### Beast Companion
**Passive ability. Cognitive talent.**  
Choose an animal with the GM’s approval. It has a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, must be of small size or smaller, has 20 hit point capacity, and a d6 heart die (you may work with your GM to adjust these values). You can communicate simple ideas with it from a distance using verbal and somatic commands. The animal obeys all your commands.

When in combat, your companion is not very effective on its own. Your companion cannot use its action to enter engagements, though it can still be forced into engagements by other combatants. It can otherwise use its action normally. You may take this talent any number of times. If your companion dies, you may choose to replace this talent with another talent instead.

**Destiny Level**: You may spend XP on your beast companion as though it were yourself. Beast companions cannot gain talents as oaths and cannot gain cognitive talents. Your beast companion cannot gain a beast companion. While adjacent to your companion, if you or your companion would be forced to make a defense roll, the other may choose to step in to make the defense roll and take the damage instead. If that creature was already being attacked from the same source, they cannot use this ability.

### Beckon
**Heart ability. Handmagic.**  
Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. It teleports to a free space in which it can stand that is adjacent to you.

**Destiny Level**: The range extends to 90 feet instead.

### Blink Step
**Heart ability. Instant. Handmagic.**  
When you dash, you may instead teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 90 feet.

**Destiny Level**: So long as you are holding on to someone, they may come with you if they are willing. You can bring up to two creatures besides yourself when using this ability.

### Bloodblade
**Passive ability. Handmagic.**  
Whenever you make an attack roll, you may first choose to lose 4 hit points. If you do, add 1d8 to your roll.

**Destiny Level**: You may lose 6 hit points and add 1d12 instead.

### Bloodknight
**Passive ability. Handmagic.**  
The first time you gain hit points each round, gain an additional 2 hit points.

**Destiny Level**: Instead, gain an additional 4 hit points.

### Bloodlust
**Passive ability. Martial talent.**  
Whenever you make an attack roll against an enemy that has taken a wound, you may give it three levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened.

**Destiny Level**: If that creature is already dazed, off-balanced, or weakened, you have advantage on your attack and regain 4 hit points.

### Bloodoath
**Weekly ability. Handmagic.**  
As an action, you swear vengeance against a creature that you believe has wronged you. You can only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time. While you have sworn vengeance against a creature, you always know where the creature is, and whenever you engage with or make an opportunity attack against the creature, you gain a rush point at the beginning of the next round.

**Destiny Level**: You have advantage on A/D rolls against your sworn enemy. In addition, you do not need to use your action to use this ability.

### Body Shield
**Heart ability. Martial talent.**  
The next time you are hit by a melee attack from a source that is adjacent to both you and a creature you are grappling, if the attacking creature’s stance did not directly beat your own, you may use the grappled creature as a body shield. Add the creature’s defense bonus to your own and split the damage between you, rounding up.

**Destiny Level**: You may use this ability against ranged attacks as well, so long as the grappled creature is between you and the source. When you use this ability, the grappled creature takes all the damage instead of splitting it.
