# Equipment & Gear

## Encumbrance

Your capacity for carrying items is tracked using **encumbrance points (EP)**, with each point representing approximately five pounds of weight. Your maximum EP is calculated as follows:

**Maximum EP = 6 + (Half of your Might die)**

For example, if your Might die is **d4**, your maximum EP would be **8**. This means you can carry more than **40 pounds** (8 * 5), but you cannot carry more than your maximum EP for extended periods without becoming exhausted. In such cases, you may need to make endurance checks as determined by the GM.

### Gear EP Values

Different adventuring gear has varying EP values. The table below lists the EP values and prices for all gear. Note that whether you are wearing or carrying the gear, it counts against your maximum EP.

## Pack Animals & Vehicles

Using a pack animal or vehicle allows you to carry significantly more gear. Below is a list of common animals and vehicles along with their maximum EP:

| Animal/Vehicle          | Maximum EP |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Donkey                  | 30         |
| Horse                   | 60         |
| Horse-drawn wagon       | 300        |

### Limited Use Gear
