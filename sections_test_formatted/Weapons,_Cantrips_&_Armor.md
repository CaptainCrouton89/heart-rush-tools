# Weapons, Cantrips & Armor

Equipment encompasses all of the gear you might use while adventuring. When you first create your character, you will likely start out with a weapon and some armor, though it is up to the GM. This section also includes the rules for cantrips. Cantrips are similar to weapons; you choose stances, and on a hit, you usually make an attack roll with your chosen stance. However, cantrips differ from weapons in that there is no physical weapon used to strike the opponent, and only those with magical attunements can use them.

## Weapons

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and damage type, which together describe the weapon and its properties. You may choose one weapon to be your primary weapon. This weapon does not use up equipment slots. You can only wield one weapon at a time. If wielding a weapon does not require being held in your hands, it does not count towards this restriction.

### Size

The size of a weapon refers to how big and powerful it is. Three sizes exist: heavy, light, and ultralight (or improvised). It is up to the GM to determine the size of any given weapon.

#### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons require two hands, can only be wielded by creatures of size medium or larger, and cannot be easily hidden on your body. Examples include longbows, longswords, pikes, mauls, and heavy crossbows. 

- **Attack Roll Bonus**: Add 1d12 to your attack rolls.
- **Movement Penalty**: Your move speed decreases by 5 feet if this weapon is not part of your body.
- **Gear Slots**: Heavy weapons use 10 gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or part of your body.

#### Light Weapons

Light weapons are, as their name suggests, light and easy to handle. Examples include crossbows, shortswords, and shortbows.

- **Attack Roll Bonus**: Add 1d8 to your attack rolls.
- **Gear Slots**: Light weapons use 5 gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or part of your body.

#### Ultralight Weapons

Ultralight weapons are small and easy to handle. Examples include knives, shurikens, and claws.

- **Attack Roll Bonus**: Add 1d4 to your attack rolls.
- **Gear Slots**: Ultralight weapons use 2 gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or part of your body.

#### Improvised Weapons

Chairs, your teeth, and your falling body can all be weapons in the right context. Improvised weapons count as ultralight weapons unless indicated otherwise.

### Attack Type

There are two types of weapons: melee and ranged. Each comes with different benefits.

#### Melee

Melee weapons do not involve any part of the weapon leaving your hand. They are generally more powerful than ranged weapons due to their weight. Heavy melee weapons require two hands, while light and ultralight melee weapons require only one. Melee weapons have a range of 5 feet.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: You may push the defending creature 10 feet away from you after everyone in the engagement has made their might attack roll. You may enter any of the free spaces they left or passed through because of your attack. Moving into that space does not provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Ranged

Ranged weapons trade damage for the ability to inflict injuries from a safer distance. 

- **Light Ranged Weapons**: Range of 30 feet.
- **Heavy Ranged Weapons**: Range of 60 feet.
- **Disadvantage**: You can attack targets outside of that range, but have disadvantage on the attack for every 10 feet beyond the range listed, to a maximum of double the weapon’s range.

Ranged weapons come with drawbacks:

- All ranged weapons require two hands unless specifically noted otherwise.
- You cannot choose anything but the defensive stance if you move more than half of your move speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties) during a round.
- You cannot move more than half your move speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties) if you already took a non-defensive stance in an engagement.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Creatures defending against this attack cannot add their defense bonus from armor to their defense roll.

#### Thrown Weapons

Thrown weapons combine elements of both melee and ranged combat. They behave similarly to melee weapons in terms of handling but are used up as they are thrown. 

- **Range**: 20 feet.
- **Disadvantage**: You can attack targets outside of that range, but have disadvantage on the attack for every 5 feet beyond the range listed, to a maximum of double the weapon’s range.
- **Throwing Restrictions**: Unless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons can be thrown. Weapons cannot be thrown in water.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: The first time you hit with a thrown weapon attack in an engagement, you may make an immediate follow-up attack with another thrown weapon against a different valid target in the engagement.

#### Whips

Whips have a range of 20 feet. Unless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons can be whips. Whips cannot be used in water.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add another weapon die to your attack roll.

### Damage Type

Weapons can inflict different types of damage, which can affect their effectiveness based on your character's attributes.

#### Bludgeoning

Bludgeoning weapons use raw force to inflict damage and are best used with high might. Examples include war hammers and clubs.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Whenever you wield a bludgeoning weapon and use the might stance, add an additional weapon die to your roll.

#### Slashing

Slashing weapons use accuracy and dexterity to inflict damage and are best used with high agility. Examples include swords and scythes.

- **Agility Stance Bonus**: Whenever you wield a slashing weapon and use the agility stance, add an additional weapon die to your roll.

#### Piercing

Piercing weapons use knowledge of your opponent's maneuvering to inflict damage and are best used with high cunning. Examples include rapiers and weapons that use arrows.

- **Cunning Stance Bonus**: Whenever you wield a piercing weapon and use the cunning stance, add an additional weapon die to your roll.

### Other Weapon Tags

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and damage type. However, weapons can also have tags, making them further distinct.

#### Reach

Melee weapons can have this tag. If you haven’t dashed this round, the range of this weapon is 10 feet instead of 5. If you attack a creature at this extended range, you cannot dash this round.

## Cantrips

Cantrips are similar to normal weapons. They can be melee or ranged, heavy, light, or ultralight, and they can be cast any time you would normally make an attack with a weapon. However, unlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you have an attunement to the corresponding element. Since elemental attacks are not always physical, they don't always deal damage, and the bonus granted by the might stance is sometimes different.

There are two types of cantrips: bolts and blasts. Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line from your hand, while blasts are short bursts of energy emitted from the caster themselves. Each has more specific rules outlined in their sections.

### Bolts

Bolts are individual streaks of elemental energy or matter that are fired from a single hand. They behave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though they do not get a bonus from damage type. 

- **Range**: All bolt cantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement to that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and 120 feet at paragon attunement.

#### Lightning Bolt (Air)

You shoot a crackling bolt of lightning from your hand. This attack deals damage as an ultralight, ranged, spell-weapon attack. If the target is wearing metal armor or is wet, double the result of your attack roll.

#### Fire Bolt (Fire)

You shoot a bolt of fire from your hand. This attack does no damage but ignites the target, dealing 2 levels of burning.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add a level of burning.

#### Water Bolt (Water)

You may shoot a heavy jet of water from your hand. This attack deals damage as a light, ranged, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack. On a hit, the target is drenched in water and takes a level of off-balanced.

#### Earthen Bolt (Earth)

You may launch a massive stone from your hand. This attack deals damage as a heavy, ranged, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.

#### Force Bolt (Force)

You shoot a roiling bolt of force from your hand. This attack does no damage, but the target is pushed back 20 feet.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: They are pushed 30 feet instead.

#### Void Bolt (Void)

You shoot a bolt of pure void from your hand. The faint sound of faesong can be heard in the air as the bolt travels. This attack does no damage, but the target takes a level of confused as faesong rips through their body.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add a level of confused.

#### Dark Bolt (Dark)

You shoot a bolt of darkness from your hand. This attack does no damage, but the target takes 2 levels of weakened as their skin is chilled to the bone.

#### Radiant Bolt (Light)

You shoot a bolt of brilliant light from your hand. This attack does no damage, but the target takes 2 levels of blinded as light ripples across their body.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add a level of blinded.

#### Time Bolt (Time)

You shoot a bolt of time from your hand. This attack does no damage, but the target takes a level of stunned as time temporarily freezes for the creature. Once a creature has been stunned from a time effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add two levels of dazed.

### Blasts

Blasts are outbursts of an element centered on oneself, generally taking the form of a rapidly expanding circle of elemental matter or energy. They behave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that you must choose a stance, can only attack those whom your stance beats, and gain the benefits associated with each stance—though not all blasts deal damage, and not all blasts are attacks. You must have both hands free to use blast cantrips.

After choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up to two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of you. At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any number of valid targets in range. At paragon attunement, the range of your blast increases by 5 feet.

#### Blast of Lightning (Air)

You spread your arms, sending electricity crackling away from you. This attack deals damage as an ultralight, melee, spell-weapon attack. If targets are wearing metal armor, double the result of your attack roll.

#### Blast of Fire (Fire)

You spread your arms, radiating large waves of fire. This attack does no damage, but the target is ignited, taking two levels of burning.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add a level of burning.

#### Blast of Water (Water)

You spread your arms, sending a short but powerful wave of water away from you. This attack deals damage as a light, melee, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack. On a hit, targets are drenched in water and take a level of off-balanced.

#### Blast of Earth (Earth)

You spread your arms, hurling rocks away from you. This attack deals damage as a heavy, melee, bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.

#### Blast of Force (Force)

You spread your arms, emitting a blast of pressure. This attack does no damage, but targets are pushed back 20 feet.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add a level of confused.

#### Blast of Darkness (Dark)

You spread your arms, engulfing yourself and the area around you in rippling darkness. This attack does no damage, but targets take two levels of weakened as they are sapped of their energy by the shadowy tendrils engulfing them.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add two levels of weakened.

#### Blast of Radiance (Light)

You spread your arms, emitting brilliant white light. This attack does no damage, but targets take two levels of blinded as light engulfs them.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add a level of blinded.

#### Blast of Time (Time)

You spread your arms, causing time to distort around you. This counts as a light, melee, spell-weapon attack. On a hit, this attack does no damage, but the target takes a level of stunned as time temporarily freezes for the creature. Once a creature has been stunned from a time effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.

- **Might Stance Bonus**: Add two levels of dazed.

## Armor

Armor works by increasing your defense rolls, making it harder for damage to get through. Armor, as with other clothing, does not require equipment slots while being worn.
