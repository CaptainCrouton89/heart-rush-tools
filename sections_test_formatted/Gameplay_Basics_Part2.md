# Heart Rush TTRPG Rules

## Movement and Spaces

- A single space can accommodate:
  - **10 Tiny Creatures**
  - **5 Small Creatures**
  - **1 Medium or Large Creature**
  - **Creatures of Size L2 and Greater**: Take up a number of spaces equal to the square of their level. For example:
    - An L1 creature takes up **4 spaces** (2x2).
    - An L5 creature takes up **25 spaces** (5x5).

## Attacking

Whenever an attacking creature uses the **Might Stance** to push a defending creature of a different size, the defending creature may move more or less than the default of **10 feet**:

- If the defending creature is **smaller** than the attacker, it moves an additional **5 feet** for each level of size difference.
- If the defending creature is **larger** than the attacker, it moves **5 feet fewer** for each level of size difference. This could mean that the defending creature is not pushed at all.

## Creature Occupation

- One creature can occupy and move through the space of another creature if it is at least **two sizes smaller**. Those creatures count as **difficult terrain**.
- While in the same space as a non-hostile creature, you also have **one level of cover**.

## Weapons

- Creatures of size **Small** or **Tiny** cannot wield **heavy weapons**.
- Creatures of size **Tiny** cannot wield **heavy** or **light weapons**.

## Lighting

There are three different states of lighting that can occur in an environment:

1. **Brightly Lit**: 
   - Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern, and intense fire produce bright light. 
   - No penalties to vision or combat.

2. **Dim Light**: 
   - Found in alleyways, twilight, and spaces between bright light and darkness. 
   - Perception and observation skill checks are made with disadvantage for creatures that require light to see.

3. **Darkness**: 
   - Anywhere there is no light. 
   - Unless you have **darkvision**, you cannot see anything.

## Darkvision

Some creatures have **darkvision**. A creature with darkvision can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and can see in darkness as though it were dim light.

## Hiding

If the environment provides suitable places to hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may choose to hide. This requires more than a single action and cannot be performed during combat.

- When you attempt to hide, make a **Stealth** skill check. 
  - On a success, you are hidden and count as unseen for the purposes of attacking.
- While hidden, you may use your action to make an **opportunity attack** against a creature you are hidden from. 
  - You may still be obscured after you attack, but you do not count as hidden and cannot make opportunity attacks.
- All hidden creatures that wish to make opportunity attacks may use their action to attack before combat begins.

## Terrain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous environments that pose unique challenges.

### Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy foliage. While in difficult terrain, after accounting for other movement penalties, your remaining movement speed is halved.

### Water

Doing anything while in or under water comes with severe limitations:

- **Shallow Water**: Counts only as difficult terrain.
- **Deeper Water**: Requires movement at your swim speed. Unless you explicitly have a swim speed, your base swim speed is **15 feet**.
  - If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement.
  - If you cannot stand or are underwater, you have **D5** on all of those rolls instead.
  - Ranged weapons travel half their distance when fired underwater.

### Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a **Might Check** to determine if you can climb at all. On a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which is **5 feet** unless otherwise stated.

## Sources of Damage

There are several sources of damage besides combat. Some common ones include:

### Combat

Combat is one of the most common ways to lose health. Check out the **Combat** section to learn more.

### Hazards & Traps

You may need to avoid damage from the environment, such as being hit by a falling rock or struck by a dart trap. In these cases, make a **Saving Throw** (detailed in the **Saving Throws** section). On a failure, you will take damage.

### Falling

When falling from **5 feet or more**, roll an **Agility Saving Throw** against the height fallen. If you roll less than the distance fallen, you take the difference as damage.

### Suffocation and Strangulation

Different effects occur depending on whether you are holding your breath or being strangled:

- **Holding Your Breath**: Make a Might Check. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your result. Subtract one from the total whenever you take an action or move while holding your breath. After you run out of breath, you take the **Suffocating Condition**.
  
- **Strangulation**: If you are strangled or suddenly prevented from breathing, you begin suffocating immediately.

## Gameplay Basics

### Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across various poisons. Different poisons have different properties and means of application. Some may paralyze you if ingested, while others may kill you if they enter your bloodstream but are harmless if swallowed. 

- Most poisons will have specific rulings, but some general rules apply:
  - Poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.
  - Each application uses one dose of poison, and dealing damage with a poisoned weapon uses up the poison.
  - Most poisons can be applied to weapons prior to combat, but the length of potency varies.
  - Damage from poison occurs after the weapon attack—it is not rolled with the attack dice.

### Experience

Over the course of many games, you will gain XP, which can be used to purchase new features for your character.

#### Gaining Experience

It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players. Common triggers for rewarding XP include:

- Pursuing goals
- Reaching milestones in a story arc
- Winning combats
- Length of session

The GM should communicate the metrics for determining XP to the players.

#### Spending Experience

Between sessions, or during sessions (as long as you are not in combat), you may spend XP to access new features. Use the following chart to find the cost of your desired new feature.

| Type                     | XP Cost | Effect                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New Aspect**           | 1       | Add a new aspect at rank 1.                                           |
| **Increase Aspect**      | X+1     | Increase Aspect X, where X is the aspect’s current level.             |
| **Change Aspect**        | 0       | Replace the text of your aspect with different text.                  |

#### GM Note

Granting XP equal to players’ combat rank is a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading their characters every few sessions. For slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this by one or two can be acceptable.

### New Aspect

Creating a new aspect means writing down another word or phrase describing your character. The aspect starts at rank one.

### Increase Aspect

Increase the rank of one of your aspects by one. Aspects cannot have a rank greater than five.

### Change Aspect

You may replace your aspect with a brand new aspect if you believe your character development warrants it. The aspect remains at the same rank, but you may change the description.

### Increase Maximum Hit Points

Increase your maximum hit points by **10**.

### Increase Ability Die

Increase an ability die by one size. Ability die size increases in the order: **d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12 > d20**. Each increase costs XP equal to the size of the new die. For example, an increase from **d8 to d10** would cost **10**. You cannot increase your heart die in this way.

### New Combat/Non-Combat Talent

Choose and mark down a new talent from the combat or non-combat talent list. If it is a cognitive or martial talent, you immediately gain it. Otherwise, see the **Talent** section for details on the prerequisites for picking up that talent.

### Destiny Level

Choose one of your talents. You gain its destiny level. Any prerequisites for the original talent are also necessary to gain the destiny level.

### New Spell

Choose a spell from the spell list. At least one element will be listed as a tag. If you have a basic attunement or better to all of the listed elements, you learn the spell. Note that spells are cheaper if you are **spelltouched**.

### Increasing Heart Die

As you gain XP, your experience and the strength of your spirit reach critical levels at which your maximum heart die is automatically increased.

#### Increase Maximum Hit Points

- **X/10 + 1**, where X is your current hit point maximum.

#### Increase Ability Die

- **X**, where X is the next die size. Increase an ability die by 1 size, to a maximum of a **d12**.

#### New Combat Talent

- **X+3**, where X is the number of combat talents you already have. Gain a new combat talent. Some talents may have prerequisites.

#### New Non-Combat Talent

- **X+3**, where X is the number of non-combat talents you already have. Gain a new non-combat talent. Some talents may have prerequisites.

#### Destiny Level

- **X+5**, where X is the number of talents with destiny levels you already have. Gain the destiny level of a talent you have.

#### New Spell

- **6+2X** (or X if you are spelltouched), where X is the number of spells you already know. Gain a new spell. You must have the corresponding elemental attunements.

### Experience Options

| Type                     | XP Cost | Effect                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New Aspect**           | 1       | Add a new aspect at rank 1.                                           |
| **Increase Aspect**      | X+1     | Increase Aspect X, where X is the aspect’s current level.             |
| **Change Aspect**        | 0       | Replace the text of your aspect with different text.                  |

### Cumulative XP Milestones

- **200 XP**: Increase your heart die to a **d10**.
- **500 XP**: Increase your maximum heart die to a **d12**.
- **1000 XP**: Increase your maximum heart die to a **d20**.
