# Rests & Healing

In Heart Rush, there are several ways to regain hit points. The primary method is through rests, but magic, racial abilities, potions, and other effects can also facilitate healing.

## Rests

You can heal hit points, refresh heart dice, and reduce wounds through rests. There are two types of rests: **short rests** and **long rests**.

### Short Rest

A **short rest** is a period of 10 minutes of stationary relaxation. When you take a short rest:
- Your heart die returns to its maximum value.
- You can take any number of short rests per day.

### Long Rest

A **long rest** occurs when you sleep for the night. Key points about long rests include:
- Must last at least **7 hours**.
- You can only take **one long rest** each day.
- If you take a long rest away from shelter, bed, and warmth, you must make a **sleeping check**.

#### Sleeping Check

To make the sleeping check:
1. Roll **1d100**.
2. Add all relevant modifiers from the **Sleeping Conditions** table below.
3. If the total is **100 or higher**, you succeed.

**Note:** If you have warmth, a bed, and full shelter, you automatically succeed on the sleeping check.

If you do not rest for the night, you take the penalties associated with failing a sleeping check.

#### Successful Sleeping Check

On a successful sleeping check:
- Reduce the ranks of each of your wounds by **one**.
- Heal hit points up to your current maximum (which may be reduced if you have wounds).

### Example

You just survived a nasty fight. You have 14 hit points, a d4 heart die, and a rank 12 wound. 

1. You take a short rest, and your heart die becomes a d8.
2. At night, you take a long rest. It’s warm, but you have no shelter, so you fail your sleeping check.
   - Your maximum hit points is 28 (40 - 12), and you are currently at 14. You regain 7 hit points, going up to 21.
   - You start the next day with a level of **dazed**.

The next day, you reach your destination, getting a bed, warmth, and shelter, thereby automatically succeeding your sleeping check. 
- Your wound decreases to rank 11.
- You heal to 29 hit points (40 - 11) and remove your level of dazed.

You decide to stay in town without feeling pressured to leave, reducing your wound by one each night until fully healed after 11 more days.

### Failed Sleeping Check

On a failed sleeping check:
- Do not reduce the ranks of your wounds.
- Regain half of your missing hit points, rounded down.
- Take a level of **weakened**, **off-balanced**, or **dazed**, chosen at random.

If you fail a second night, inflict two conditions at random. On a third night and every night thereafter, inflict one level of each condition. A successful long rest removes all conditions gained this way.

## Healing

Besides rests, other effects and abilities may cause you to heal hit points. When you heal hit points:
- You cannot exceed your maximum hit points if it is restricted due to wounds.

### Healing Potions

If your game includes healing potions, the following rules apply:
- One hour after drinking a healing potion, reduce the rank of each of your wounds by one and regain **20 hit points**.

### GM Note

The pacing of Heart Rush tends to be slower than other games. Allowing players to take long rests does not let them heal significantly, so don’t feel pressured to pack multiple combats into a single day. A long trip through the wilderness, where good rest is uncertain and combat is intermittent, is plenty grueling for most parties.
