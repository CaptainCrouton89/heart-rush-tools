# Heart Rush TTRPG Rules

## Abilities

### Cease to Exist
- **Action**: You may cease to exist and disappear. Choose any length of time. After that time, you reappear in the same spot. 
  - **Note**: If that spot has any solid objects passing through it when you return, those objects are now passing through you—potentially killing you.

### Advanced Attunement
- **Action**: You can send a non-living object you touch into the void, causing it to cease to exist forever. 
  - The object must not be larger than a 1-foot cube and must be a distinct object—not part of something larger.

### Paragon Attunement
- Whenever you move, you may instead choose to teleport half the distance.
- The maximum size of objects you send to the void increases to a 5-foot cube.

## Time

### Basic Attunement
- Once per day, immediately after learning the result of an action you took, you may choose to go back to right before you made that action and choose not to take it. This could include things such as stepping onto a trap or making a conversational gaffe.
- By touching a nonliving object for a minute, you can cause it to age a year. The object must be able to fit within a 5-foot cube.

### Advanced Attunement
- When you unwind time, you may choose to unwind time when another creature makes an action rather than yourself. You may make an action now.
- The size of the object to age increases to a 10-foot cube.

### Paragon Attunement
- The size of the object to age increases to a 100-foot cube.
- You may choose to use your own timeline to fix the past. The entire world reverts to whatever state it was 24 hours ago. You gain 3 levels of dazed that don’t fade until you take a long rest, and your body ages by 10 years.

## Light

### Basic Attunement
- You can produce bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light 30 feet beyond that. It dispels magical darkness. By touching an inanimate object, it gains this property. You cannot produce more than one source of light.
- You may inflict three levels of blindness to creatures you are touching.

### Advanced Attunement
- The bright light you can produce extends up to 60 feet, and 60 feet of dim light beyond that. You can produce up to three sources of this light.
- You may cast _blinding sun_ on yourself any number of times per day.

### Paragon Attunement
- You can raise the light level to dim light in any number of locations that you can see. This overrides any magical darkness and cannot be turned into darkness.
- Whenever you cast _blinding sun_, you may inflict up to 5 levels of blindness.

---

## Darkness

### Basic Attunement
- You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet, or increase your current darkvision by 30 feet.
- As an action, you dim the light in a 30-foot radius, turning non-magical bright light into dim light, or dim light into darkness.

### Advanced Attunement
- The range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.
- The range at which you can create darkness increases by 30 feet.

### Paragon Attunement
- Other creatures with darkvision cannot see through darkness you create.
- The range at which you can create darkness increases by 60 feet.

---

## Force

### Basic Attunement
- As an action, you can apply up to 10 pounds of force to any non-living object within 90 feet. You can manipulate fine objects, so long as they only require one linear force applied to them.

### Advanced Attunement
- The force you can apply increases to a maximum of 20 pounds.
- You may divide this force between up to three different objects.
- You can manipulate fine objects that would not otherwise require a skill check to manipulate and can apply rotational force.

### Paragon Attunement
- You may divide this force between any number of different objects.
- You may manipulate objects that would require a skill check to use. You cannot wield a weapon using this force.

## Spellcasting

### Gaining Spells
Learning a spell represents mastery over some aspect of one’s connection with an element, allowing the user to perform some fantastical feat. Anyone with an attunement can learn to cast a spell. By spending XP, as described in the Gaining and Spending XP section, one can gain a new spell, chosen from the list of spells in the Spells section. You must have at least a basic attunement to all of the elements in the tags listed below each spell in order to learn that spell.

### Casting Spells
Casting a spell is more difficult than simple elemental manipulation performed with just an attunement, as it requires more precise control for a longer duration. Performing a powerful act of elemental control while in the thick of a fight takes skill and practice, and comes with the following restrictions:

- Casting a spell requires your action.
- You may cast only one spell per round.
- Casting a spell requires at least one free hand.
- If casting a spell, you cannot have moved more than half your movement speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties), rounded up.
- After casting the spell, you cannot move more than half your movement speed (after accounting for armor and other penalties).

Casting spells is strenuous and takes a toll on your body. Without proper preparation, it can wreak havoc on your ability to channel your attunement in that way again for a while. You must wait four long rests before casting that spell again, though that time may vary as per the following rules:

- Subtract one long rest for each consecutive round taken before this action spent unmoving, taking no actions, using no abilities, and not communicating (in complete, meditative concentration).
- Subtract one long rest if you have an advanced attunement with the elemental type of the spell you are casting.
- Subtract two long rests if you instead have a paragon attunement with the elemental type of the spell you are casting.

If the total number of long rests would be reduced to zero, you must still wait at least one short rest before casting the spell again.

### Spellcasting Ability
Whenever a creature has to make a saving throw against your spellcasting ability, it must make a check against the maximum of your current heart die, plus two times your paragon level.

## Spells

Spells are listed by their name, along with two tags—their required attunements, and if they are ongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a single attunement as a prerequisite for casting the spell, but some have two or more. If the spell is immediate, the spell effect occurs once when the spell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell’s effects continue for up to one minute, or when the spellcaster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.

### Aura of Ignition
**Fire. Ongoing.**  
You snap your fingers, agitating the air around you into a hyper-flammable state, allowing you to easily ignite moments of already high-energy, such as the impact of a blade. Whenever a creature within 10 feet takes damage, you may have them take a level of burning if they don’t already have any levels of burning.

### Billowing Smoke
**Fire. Ongoing.**  
You cause thick, billowing smoke to erupt from a nearby space. Choose a point within 45 feet. All space within 5 feet of that point is obscured. Additionally, creatures of your choice within the smoke gain the suffocating condition.

### Blast of Fire
**Fire and Force.**  
You point your finger, sending forth a bolt of force and flame, blasting someone back. Choose a creature within 45 feet. That creature is knocked back 10 feet and then falls prone, taking two levels of burning. On a success, they are not knocked prone and take only one level of burning.

### Burning Brilliance
**Fire and Light. Ongoing.**  
You rub your fingers together, heating nearby areas of light. All spaces within 45 feet in bright light ignite into white, brilliant flames. So long as those spaces remain in bright light, the flame remains. The flames emit no light. Whenever a creature enters or begins the round in one of these spaces, it takes one level of burning.

### Blinding Sun
**Light. Ongoing.**  
You rub a sphere of pure, brilliant light into your fingers before casting it into the air. Choose a point within 45 feet. Creatures of your choice within a 5-foot radius of that point take three levels of blindness whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round. For every 5 feet further you are from the point, creatures gain one level fewer of blindness.

### Cardinal Direction
**Void and Force. Ongoing.**  
You align your fingers with the complex grid of the void, applying its strict physical laws to the world around you. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet of you can only move back and forth in one direction each round (no diagonals).

### Chilling Wind
**Air.**  
You beckon with your fingers, calling forth the north wind, sending a bone-chilling breeze passing by. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you immediately take four levels of slowed. If the temperature is already below freezing, those creatures also take one level of restrained.

### Cloak of Shadows
**Dark.**  
You drag wisps of shadows over your form, obscuring yourself and actions. You count as obscured until the end of your next engagement or the end of the round, whichever comes first.

### Cloud of Poison
**Water. Ongoing.**  
You raise your finger to the air, spewing forth billowing dark clouds of poison. All spaces within 10 feet of you are layered in a heavy cloud of poison. Creatures count as obscured and take a level of poisoned whenever they enter or start the round in those spaces, no more than once per round. You are immune to the poison effect for the duration of this spell. Creatures cannot take more than one level of poisoned with this effect. The cloud does not move with you.

### Cold Snap
**Water.**  
Snapping the fingers of your hand makes a loud crack that causes all non-magical liquid within 45 feet to freeze solid. Creatures of your choice within 45 feet gain one level of restrained until the end of the round. If they are wet or standing in water, they instead gain 2 levels of restrained.

### Collapse in Shadows
**Dark and Force.**  
You clap your fingers to your palm, dragging everyone’s bodies to their shadows. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet fall prone. If they are in bright light, they gain two levels of restrained. If they are in dim light, they gain one level of restrained instead.

### Crippling Aura
**Force. Ongoing.**  
You emit an aura that saps those around you of their strength, greatly weakening them. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take three levels of weakened whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.

### Deluge
**Water and Force.**  
You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away. Choose a 10-foot by 20-foot section of the map. Everyone in that area is swept to one of the 10-foot sides of the rectangle and lands prone. The water puts out any fire in that area.

### Earthen Shackles
**Earth and Force. Ongoing.**  
You grasp your hand into an upturned fist, causing the ground to reach up and anchor those above it. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take two levels of slowed whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.

### Earthen Umbra
**Earth and Dark. Ongoing.**  
You splay your fingers and raise your hand, causing the ground to rise and envelop your enemies in shadow. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take one level of restrained whenever they enter or start the round in that space, no more than once per round.
