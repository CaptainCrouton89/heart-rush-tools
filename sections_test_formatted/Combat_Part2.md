# Heart Rush TTRPG Rules

## Combat Mechanics

### Engagements

In an engagement, players choose a stance that determines their actions and interactions with other creatures. The available stances are:

- **Cunning**: Attack a single creature in the engagement that did not take the cunning stance. Creatures that chose the agility stance can make their attack rolls after all cunning stance attack rolls have been made. If you choose this stance, you may take the sidestep action for free during the engagement, either before or after your attack. Creatures that attack before moving do so before those that sidestep.

- **Might**: Attack a single creature in the engagement that did not take the agility stance. Creatures that chose the might stance make their attack rolls last. Additionally, when attacking a creature defending with the cunning stance, you trigger your weapon’s might stance bonus. Refer to the Weapons section for more details.

- **Defensive**: You do not attack but reduce incoming damage. After subtracting your defense from an attack, halve the remaining damage, rounding up.

### Resolution of Attacks

After all players have revealed their stances, resolve attacks in the following order:

1. **Cunning**
2. **Agility**
3. **Might**

Each player may attack one other character that their stance beats and is within range of their weapon. All stances beat the defensive stance. If no other stance can be beaten or if the target is out of range, you cannot attack in this engagement.

- **Cunning Attacks**: Players who chose the cunning stance may attack any character who chose the agility or defensive stance.
- **Agility Attacks**: Players who chose the agility stance may attack any character who chose the might or defensive stance.
- **Might Attacks**: Players who chose the might stance may attack any character who chose the cunning or defensive stance.

Although attacks of the same stance may not literally happen simultaneously, treat them as though they did. For example, if a might attacker pushes a creature away, that creature cannot prevent its attack on another target. If an attack pushes a target out of range, that target cannot attack during subsequent turns.

## Combat Mechanics

### Attack Rolls

When you attack, make an attack roll consisting of:

- Your heart die
- Ability die for the stance you chose
- Weapon die

The defending creature makes a defense roll using:

- Their heart die
- Ability die corresponding to the stance you chose
- Armor bonuses

After both sides roll, the defender takes damage equal to the result of the attack roll minus the defense roll. If this result is negative, the defender takes no damage. 

**Contested Rolls**: If you are attacking someone who is also attacking you with the same stance, make contested attack rolls instead of separate attack and defense rolls. Anyone can attack someone in the defensive stance, but the resulting damage is halved.

### Example of Combat

You initiate a fight against an undead orc. The orc's undead wolf joins the engagement. You and your ally decide to attack the orc. You choose might, and your ally chooses agility. The orc chooses might, and the wolf chooses cunning.

1. **Cunning**: The wolf does not attack since it is not adjacent to your ally.
2. **Agility**: Your ally attacks the orc, which is in range. The orc reduces its heart die to halve the damage.
3. **Might**: You and the orc both chose might. You can attack either the orc or the wolf. You choose the orc, and both make contested rolls. The loser takes the difference in damage.

The engagement ends after all attacks are resolved, and priority passes to the side that was targeted when the engagement started.

### Taking Damage

When you take damage, you can choose to use stamina to "shrug off" or "dodge" the injury. You take half damage, but your heart die decreases by one size. If your heart die is already a d4, you must take full damage. 

Regardless of how much damage you take, subtract it from your hit points. If your hit points reach a negative amount equal to your maximum hit points, you are dead.

### More Than 10 Damage

Taking 10 or more damage represents serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit points, mark a wound. The GM will describe the wound, and you should write it down along with its rank, which equals the amount of damage taken.

### Wounds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points. You cannot heal beyond your normal maximum minus the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. For example, if your maximum is 40 hit points and you have 23 ranks of wounds, you cannot heal past 17 hit points.

Outside of combat, wounds function like aspects, which can be invoked for a penalty on a roll equal to the rank of the wound, in exchange for DP equal to the rank of the wound, up to 5.

### Treating Wounds

To treat a wound, make a medicine skill check. Reduce the rank of all untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by the rolled amount. If a wound's rank is reduced below zero, remove it completely. 

If you are treating your own wounds, you have disadvantage. You can treat multiple wounds at once, but once treated, a wound cannot be treated again. Treated wounds will heal naturally over time during long rests.

### Zero Hit Points

When your hit points reach zero, you are unconscious. If you do not choose to go unconscious, you will fall unconscious after 10 minutes. If you take damage while at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and any wounds. If your hit points reach an amount equal to or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.

Once unconscious, you remain so until your hit points are above zero. You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by taking rests.

## Other Offensive Actions

If you want to perform an action other than attacking, such as grappling or climbing onto a creature, you must win the engagement by directly beating their stance. If you do, you may forgo your attack roll and use one of these options. The effects of the offensive action occur after all attack rolls have been made.

Some options require a contested skill check instead of an attack and defense roll. These checks receive advantage or disadvantage as though they were an attack or defense roll but do not use additional dice or armor bonuses.

### Grappling

Make a might ability check against an adjacent creature, contested by the creature’s might or agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it gains a level of advantage on their roll for each level of size difference. 

If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You gain the condition "grappling," and the opposing creature gains the condition "grappled." At least one hand must be free to grapple another creature. If grappling with only one hand, halve your grapple ability check, rounding up. A creature can only be grappled by one creature at a time.

### Example of Grappling

You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before it attacks your friend. You enter an engagement, choose stances, and reveal them. You choose cunning, and the wolf chooses agility. Since cunning beats agility, you get to attack. However, you decide to make a might check instead of attacking. Your ally used the help action earlier, giving you advantage. The wolf rolls less than you, and it is now grappled.

### Why Would I Go Unconscious?

In a fight, combatants tend to attack those who are still fighting back. Going unconscious may make you less of a target, but be cautious—some creatures may still attack you regardless.
