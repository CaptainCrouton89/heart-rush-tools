# Travel & Survival

Travel in Heart Rush can be divided into two modes: **Travel Mode** and **Action Mode**. Each mode serves a distinct purpose during gameplay, allowing for both narrative flow and detailed decision-making.

## Travel Mode

In Travel Mode, the party's activities are described like a montage. Players are encouraged to contribute to the narrative by describing their actions as they travel, but the pace remains macro. The Game Master (GM) may highlight key moments of the journey and note any peculiarities along the way, but nothing should feel out of the ordinary.

### Transition to Action Mode

Travel Mode continues until survival becomes a challenge or notable incidents arise. At this point, the game shifts to Action Mode, where players make decisions moment to moment, scene by scene. Once the challenges are resolved, the party can return to Travel Mode and continue their journey.

## Journey Segmentation

The GM breaks the trip into segments of terrain. Each segment requires a specific number of successful travel checks to navigate uneventfully and is defined by its length in days.

- **X**: Number of successful travel checks required
- **Y**: Days of travel for each segment
- **Z**: Number of events to include throughout the journey

### Travel Checks

- Roll each travel check as necessary.
- Upon reaching different locations during Travel Mode, a re-roll is triggered.
- All failures occur simultaneously.

#### Handling Failures

When a roll fails, the GM determines which failure causes the journey to halt. The remaining failures impose disadvantage on the next check related to that roll.

### Terrain Segmentation

- Split the trip into segments of terrain, each with its own travel mode roll.
- The GM should sprinkle failures throughout the segment as they see fit.
- Once Action Mode begins, the GM can utilize these failures during that phase.

## Action Mode

In Action Mode, checks become more interactive, particularly when hunting or gathering resources.

### Resource Gathering

- **Hunting**: Roll to find animals and roll to kill them. The animals provide a random duration of food.
- **Assistance**: Other players can assist to gain advantage on these rolls.
- **Water Collection**: A failure means the party must continue traveling into the night to find water.
- **Shelter**: A failure requires the party to keep traveling, skip sleep, or find a more dangerous place to rest.
- **Navigation**: A failure results in no progress and may lead to new encounters.

### Food Management

When Action Mode begins, the party has a number of days of food equal to the surplus from the food-finding roll. Rolling one higher than needed grants an extra day of food. All canteens are assumed to be full.

Travel Mode can resume once more than half of the party has completed a successful long rest.

## GM Guidelines

1. Segment the trip as necessary between different terrains. Many trips may consist of just one terrain and therefore just one segment.
2. Approximate the length of each segment in miles and time.
3. Add **X** events to the trip. Events can occur at any time, but including at least one per terrain is advisable.
4. Make **Y** rolls for each necessity within each segment, in order. If a segment requires four rolls, the first roll represents the first quarter of the distance traveled.
5. When a roll fails, immediate consequences occur. The GM chooses which roll causes the party to fail, while the remaining rolls impose disadvantage during the Action Phase.
