# Talents (continued)

### Reckless Attack
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
Upon entering an engagement or making an opportunity attack (before choosing stances), you may declare this to be a reckless attack. You may add **1d4** to each of your attack rolls until the end of the round. Enemies have advantage on their attack rolls against you until the end of the round.

#### Destiny Level
- Add **1d8** to your attacks instead.

---

### Reflect
**Type:** Major ability, Instant, Handmagic  
You bind your hit points to another creature’s. Choose a creature within 30 feet. The next time you take damage, the chosen creature takes half as much damage (rounded down).

#### Destiny Level
- The creature takes as much damage as you take instead.

---

### Rejuvenate
**Type:** Major ability, Handmagic  
As an object interaction, you may lay your hands on someone else, causing some of their wounds to close up at the cost of your own health. When you use this ability, you may reduce your hit points by any amount, increasing the target’s hit points by half that amount.

#### Destiny Level
- The healing is equal to the full amount spent, rather than being halved.

---

### Savage Attacker
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
Whenever you push a creature back with a heavy weapon using the might stance, they take **1d8** damage for every 5 feet of movement blocked by a wall, rather than **1d6**.

#### Destiny Level
- This damage increases to **1d10** instead of **1d8**.

---

### Searing Blood
**Type:** Passive ability, Handmagic  
Your blood is infused with eldritch power. Whenever you take a wound, the creature that wounded you loses hit points equal to one-tenth of your maximum hit points.

#### Destiny Level
- The creature loses hit points equal to one-fifth instead.

---

### Shield Master
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
You have learned how to attack with your shield and use it as a proper weapon. Your shield counts as a light bludgeoning weapon. If you push a creature while attacking with your shield, the target is pushed an additional 5 feet.

#### Destiny Level
- You may choose to hunker behind your shield to increase your defenses. When you take the defensive stance, you take one-fourth as much damage, rather than half.

---

### Shifty
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
If you use your action to initiate or enter an engagement, once everyone has entered the engagement who wishes to, you may choose to sidestep before stances have been declared. You may do this once per round.

#### Destiny Level
- If you sidestep such that you cannot be attacked by anyone in the engagement, you regain your action.

---

### Slippery
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to physically dodge a trap or area effect, you may choose to sidestep and fall prone. Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to avoid or escape being restrained, you may replace the result of either die with its maximum after rolling. You cannot be grappled.

#### Destiny Level
- Once per round, if you roll doubles on a defense roll, you may immediately sidestep. If you are no longer a valid target for your attacker, you do not take damage.

---

### Staggering Blows
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
Whenever you roll the maximum on one of the dice in your attack roll, the defending creature takes three levels of off-balanced.

#### Destiny Level
- The target is also knocked prone as long as it is no more than one size larger than you. If it is, instead add your weapon die to the attack an additional time.

---

### Still Fresh
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
If you are at your maximum heart die size, levels of dazed, off-balanced, and weakened fade twice rather than once.

#### Destiny Level
- Enemies cannot inflict the dazed, off-balanced, or weakened conditions upon you while your heart die is at its maximum.

---

### Sundering Blows
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
Whenever you make an attack roll with the might stance using a heavy melee weapon against someone who chose the cunning stance, you may choose to permanently decrease the defense bonus from their armor by 2 (to a minimum of 0). If the armor is natural, the penalty lasts until the creature heals all of its wounds. If it is physical armor, then the armor requires repairs before it can work effectively again.

#### Destiny Level
- Creatures you hit with this ability can have a negative defense bonus.

---

### Take Advantage
**Type:** Passive ability, Cognitive talent  
Whenever an enemy has two or more levels of weakened, dazed, or off-balanced, or has two or more conditions affecting it, you have A2 on your attacks against them.

#### Destiny Level
- You instead get a number of levels of advantage on your attack rolls equal to the total number of conditions affecting the defending creature, or the maximum number of levels of any one condition the creature has, whichever is greater.

---

### Target the Weakness
**Type:** Heart ability, Instant, Cognitive talent  
After entering an engagement but before anyone declares stances, you may use this ability. Announce a stance and a creature in the engagement. Once stances are revealed, any attack roll against the creature made using the announced stance ignores half of the target’s defense roll.

#### Destiny Level
- Ignore the creature’s entire defense roll instead.

---

### Taunting Blow
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
Whenever you make an attack roll with the cunning stance against someone who chose the agility stance, you may choose to give them two fewer conditions and instead give them a level of enraged towards you.

#### Destiny Level
- You may choose to also forgo making an attack roll to instead give them three levels of enraged.

---

You can throw light weapons.

#### Destiny Level
- You can throw heavy weapons.

---

### Tumble
**Type:** Major ability, Instant, Martial talent  
When you choose the agility stance, you may sidestep before those who chose the cunning stance attack, potentially allowing you to avoid an attack.

---

### Whipmaster
**Type:** Passive ability, Martial talent  
You may forgo making an attack roll with your whip to inflict one level of restrained on the creature until the end of the round. Whips you use are treated as light weapons rather than ultralight weapons.

#### Destiny Level
- In addition to restraining the creature, you may immediately jerk the whip back, knocking the creature prone as long as it is no more than one size larger than you. It takes **1d6** damage if it falls prone.

---

### Whirlwind Strike
**Type:** Major ability, Instant, Martial talent  
When you make an attack roll against an enemy using a melee slashing weapon, you may make the attack a whirlwind attack. If you do, creatures of your choice within melee range must make a defense roll against your attack roll and take the damage as well. This only counts as making one attack.

#### Destiny Level
- This ability becomes a heart ability instead.

---

### Whispers of Madness

---

## Noncombat Talents

### Adherence
**Type:** Heart ability, Handmagic  
As an action, you may point at a non-living, unoccupied object or space within 30 feet. Up to a 5-foot cube worth of volume of that object becomes covered in an extremely sticky slime, with sticking power equal to 100 pounds. If a creature steps on the object, they must use their action to step free of it, and the space counts as difficult terrain.

As an action, you may point at an inanimate object within 30 feet that could fit in a 5-foot cube. The object obeys your commands to the best of its ability and gains a move speed of 15 feet. This effect lasts for as long as you remain pointing at it. You cannot animate more than one object using this ability.

#### Destiny Level
- The target does not realize that you performed mind-altering magic on it.

---

### Beastform
**Major ability. Handmagic.**  
When you pick this talent, work with your GM to determine the specifics of your transformation. As an action, you may transform into a beast form, gaining its physical abilities while retaining your mental stats. You automatically revert after one hour or as an action.
