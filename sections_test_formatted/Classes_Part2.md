attacks someone other than you.

## Spending HP

### Overview
You can spend hit points (HP) to gain benefits during combat. You are rewarded for losing HP, especially when an enemy attacks someone other than you. 

### Effects of Spending HP
- Whenever you take a wound from an enemy’s attack, your bonus is temporarily doubled.
- For each rush point spent, you gain the following benefits:
  - **Gain 2X hit points** at the start of each round.
  - **+X to all defense rolls.**
  - **+X to all attack rolls.**
  - **Move speed +10X.**

Your nearby allies are inspired with the same intensity as you are. You may spend any number of rush points and set them aside. Whenever an adjacent creature is the target of an attack, you may choose one of the following effects for each rush point spent. The number of times you choose a given effect cannot be more than one more than the least-chosen effect. You and all creatures of your choice within 10 feet gain the benefits of the chosen effects until the end of combat.

## Classes

### Battleheart
Battlehearts excel at dealing damage. Their abilities grant bonuses that increase their chances to hit and deal more damage. There are two types of battlehearts: **Strikers** and **Ravagers**.

#### Brutal Attacks
- **Type**: Passive Ability
- **Rank**: 1  
Your attacks are vicious and true. Whenever you roll the maximum result on one of the dice in an attack roll or damage from a spell you cast, you may add another die of the same size and roll it, adding it to the result. This can trigger multiple times.

#### Making It Count
- **Type**: Minor Ability
- **Rank**: 1  
You may apply the effects of your stance twice during the current engagement.

### Subclass: Striker
Also known as: Ranger, Bounty-hunter, Assassin.

Strikers are lethal assassins, masters of precision and efficiency, capable of bringing down even the mightiest foes with deadly accuracy. They turn their tools into instruments of death, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies.

#### Called Shot
- **Type**: Passive Ability
- **Rank**: 2  
By aiming for a specific location on your target, you maximize your potential damage at the risk of dealing less damage if you miss. If you have advantage on an attack roll, you may declare the attack to be a called shot. 

1. Announce a target number for your attack roll.
2. Determine the multiplier, starting at one. You may remove levels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it.
3. Make your attack roll. If any of the dice rolled are equal to or higher than your target number, multiply your target number by the multiplier and add that to your attack roll.

#### Power Strike
- **Type**: Minor Ability
- **Rank**: 3  
Before you announce your stance in an engagement, you may declare the attack to be a power strike. All dice used in the attack roll trigger your Brutal Attacks ability if they land on a result greater than half the size of the die.

#### Execute
- **Type**: Minor Ability
- **Rank**: 3  
Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you may choose for it to be an execution instead. If this damage would reduce the creature to zero or fewer hit points, the creature immediately dies.

#### Devastation Strike
- **Type**: Major Ability
- **Rank**: 4  
You deliver a massive blow, potentially finishing off your enemy. Until the end of the round, you may use each of your minor abilities once for free. You may also spend any number of your rush points to roll 1d6 and add it to your next attack roll this round.

- **Type**: Passive Ability
- **Rank**: 2  
You may force two enemies to engage rather than just one. You can make a melee attack against any number of valid targets in the engagement. If you do not make any melee attacks, you may instead make a ranged attack against any number of valid targets in the engagement who are adjacent to each other. Stowing and drawing weapons counts as a free action.

#### Lightning Reflexes
- **Type**: Minor Ability
- **Rank**: 3  
Your reflexes are faster than anyone else’s on the battlefield. During this round, you keep priority after using abilities. If you choose not to use an ability while you have priority, priority is still passed to the other side as usual.

#### Bloodthirsty
- **Type**: Minor Ability
- **Rank**: 3  
When you deal enough damage to cause a creature to go unconscious or die this round, you regain an action at the end of the engagement (to a maximum of one). When you attack a creature that has not been attacked yet this round, you get +AD3 on the attack roll.

#### Blitz
- **Type**: Major Ability
