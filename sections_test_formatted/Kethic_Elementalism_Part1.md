# Kethic Elementalism

Kethic elementalism, also known as Kethic and elemental magic, is one of the most prevalent systems of magic. Its basis lies in attunement. By understanding a fundamental element completely and having a primal bond with it, one can develop the power to control that element. As this bond and understanding grow, so does one’s power over that element.

## Fundamental Elements

There are nine fundamental elements: 
- Earth
- Air
- Fire
- Water
- Light
- Dark
- Force
- Time
- Void

With these elements, nearly everything is created. By attuning to different elements, you gain basic power over them. There are three levels of attunement for each element, each granting increasing abilities. However, attuning to an element is difficult. Most people never attune to any elements in their lifetimes, and your spirit must be able to handle the additional pressure of resonating with your attuned element. 

Those who do attune often do so accidentally after unusual or extreme exposure to one of these elements. More advanced attunements require even more exposure, while paragon-level attunements generally require special activities dedicated to developing an attunement to that element.

Kethic also comes with limitations. Every living thing has a very low-level attunement with all the elements, making it nearly impossible for another creature to interfere with elements especially close to another living being, such as its blood or flesh.

## Resonate Substances

One of the primary forms of elemental manipulation is through attunement to resonate substances. These are the collection of materials that you have control over. Different types of substances have different rules dictating your affinity to them at various levels. For example, a master of earth cannot create as much stone as an equally skilled master of air can create breathable air—the solid stone is simply more difficult to work with.

### Categories of Substances

There are three different categories of substances:
- Solids
- Liquids
- Gases

---

## Solids

### Manipulation

- **Basic Attunement**: You can physically manipulate the shape and form of the substance with your hands as though it were clay. This manipulation is as fast as shaping something out of clay.

- **Advanced Attunement**: The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 15 feet. You do not have to physically touch the material to shape it; your hand movements control the manipulation as though the solid were in your hands.

- **Paragon Attunement**: The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 45 feet.

### Sensing

- **Basic Attunement**: You can sense the direction and approximate shape and size of the substance within 15 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your approximations are in 5-foot cube increments.

- **Advanced Attunement**: The range of your sensing increases to 45 feet. For substances you can hold in your hands, you can sense precise details as though you were looking through them.

- **Paragon Attunement**: The range of your sensing increases to 120 feet.

### Creation & Destruction

- **Basic Attunement**: As an action, you can create or destroy up to a 1-foot cube of the substance in your hands. If digging a passageway, you can burrow a humanoid-sized hole at a rate of 1 foot per minute. When creating this solid, it is created in shapeless 1-foot cubes, requiring further action to shape them.

- **Advanced Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of 2 feet per minute.

- **Paragon Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of 5 feet per minute.

## Liquids

### Manipulation

- **Basic Attunement**: As an action, you can crudely manipulate the flow of the substance within a 15-foot range around you, creating eddies or currents in one direction or another. Currents you create can be up to 2 miles per hour. Additionally, you can hold up to a 1-foot cube of it in your hands without a container.

- **Advanced Attunement**: The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 45 feet. You can cause currents of up to 4 miles per hour.

- **Paragon Attunement**: The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 120 feet. You can cause currents of up to 6 miles per hour.

### Movement

- **Basic Attunement**: While in this substance, your swim speed is increased by 10 feet.

- **Advanced Attunement**: While in this substance, your swim speed is increased by 20 feet. Additionally, you can walk on this substance.

- **Paragon Attunement**: While in this substance, your swim speed is increased by 40 feet.

### Sensing

- **Basic Attunement**: You can sense the direction of the substance within 120 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.

- **Advanced Attunement**: The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.

- **Paragon Attunement**: The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.

### Creation & Destruction

- **Basic Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 1-foot cube of the substance in your hands as an action.

- **Advanced Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in your hands as an action.

- **Paragon Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in your hands as an action.

## Gases

### Manipulation

- **Basic Attunement**: As an action, you can crudely manipulate the flow of the substance within a 15-foot range around you, creating eddies or currents in one direction or another. Currents you create can be up to 10 miles per hour.

- **Advanced Attunement**: The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 45 feet. You can cause air speeds of up to 20 miles per hour.

- **Paragon Attunement**: The range of your manipulation increases to substances within 120 feet. You can cause air speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.

### Movement

- **Basic Attunement**: While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 50 feet per round and may travel 5 feet for every 5 feet you fall, up to 30 feet of lateral movement. You take half fall damage if you fall through this substance. You can jump up to 10 feet in the air while in this substance and over creatures of size Medium and smaller.

- **Advanced Attunement**: While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 25 feet per round and may travel 10 feet for every 5 feet you fall, up to 60 feet of lateral movement. You take no fall damage from falling. You can jump up to 15 feet in the air while in this substance and over creatures of size Large and smaller.

- **Paragon Attunement**: You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (affected by armor and other movement penalties). You ascend at half speed.

### Sensing

- **Basic Attunement**: You can sense the direction of the substance within 120 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.

- **Advanced Attunement**: The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.

- **Paragon Attunement**: The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.

### Creation & Destruction

- **Basic Attunement**: You can cause this substance to slowly appear or disappear from around you as an action. If this substance causes a condition such as blindness or suffocation, it can be produced at a maximum of a single level. You can produce a 5-foot cube once each round as an action, and in no more than a 5-foot radius from you. You cannot create or destroy in airtight locations, including within liquids. Gases dissipate after a minute or immediately if blown away with a breeze.

- **Advanced Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 10-foot cube as an action instead, and in a 15-foot radius.

- **Paragon Attunement**: You can create or destroy up to a 15-foot cube as an action instead, and in a 45-foot radius.

## Converting Between Substances

Sometimes, you will be able to convert between different types of substances, such as ice and water or lava and stone. These conversions use the following rules:

- Conversions happen at a rate equal to twice the creation rate of whatever substance you are turning it into, and at a range equal to the corresponding manipulation range.

For example, with an advanced attunement to a solid, you can create a 1.5-foot cube as an action. If you are instead turning a liquid into a solid, you can create a 2-foot cube of solid as an action, and you can do it at a range of 15 feet. If you were converting that solid into a liquid at an advanced level, you would have the same increase in volume but would instead be able to do it at a range of 45 feet, since that is the advanced liquid manipulation range.

### Trapping a Creature

If you try to convert the substance a creature is standing in into a solid, it is usually slow enough that the creature can escape becoming trapped unless it already cannot move.

## The Elements

There are nine different elements: fire, air, water, earth, light, dark, force, void, and time. When you have a level of attunement with an element, you gain all of its benefits, as well as the benefits from every level before it. Gaining attunements to elements is also one of the primary ways to gain attunements to resonate substances. You can gain an elemental attunement with the **Elemental Affinity** talent, found in the Talents section.
