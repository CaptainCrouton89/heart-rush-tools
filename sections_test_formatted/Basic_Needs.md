# Basic Needs

Basic needs such as water, food, and warmth can spell life or death when they are in short supply, especially during a challenge phase of a journey. While usually not necessary to track, it is important to be aware of these needs.

## Food

- If you start a new day without eating a ration of food the previous day, you gain one level of **weakened**, **off-balanced**, or **dazed** at random.
- For every 24 hours thereafter without food, you gain one level of each condition.
- These conditions do not fade until you consume two rations of food.
- After a number of days equal to **10 times your might die**, you starve.

## Water

- If you start a new day without drinking a ration of water the previous day, you gain **two levels** of **weakened**, **off-balanced**, and **dazed**.
- These conditions do not fade until you drink two rations of water.
- If this occurs for two consecutive days, you die on the third morning.

## Temperature

There are six tiers of temperature. The GM should communicate the temperature if it is anything other than comfortable, as staying warm or cool may be a concern.

- **Searing Hot**
- **Muggy/Sweltering**
- **Comfortable**
- **Chilly**
- **Freezing**
- **Bone-Chilling**

While adventuring in extreme heat or cold, you must track your own tier of warmth. If you get too cold or hot, you could suffer penalties or even die. Without clothes or fire, your temperature rating is equal to the ambient temperature. Depending on your temperature, you may suffer different effects.

### Temperature Effects

#### Muggy/Sweltering & Chilly
- These temperatures do not inflict penalties but make it harder to sleep. Refer to the **Rests & Healing** section for details on sleeping checks.

#### Searing Hot
- If you spend a quarter of the day in searing hot conditions, roll **1d12**. 
  - On a result of **10 or higher**, you take a wound of rank equal to the result, labeled “heatstroke.”
  - On a result less than **10**, you take that much damage but suffer no wounds.

#### Freezing
- If you spend a quarter of the day freezing, roll **1d10** and take a wound of rank equal to the result, labeled “frostbite.” This wound does not heal while you are freezing.

#### Bone-Chilling
- If you spend a quarter of the day in bone-chilling conditions, roll **6d10** and take a wound of rank equal to the result, labeled “frostbite.” This wound does not heal while you are freezing.

## Modulating Temperature

Fortunately, you can modulate your temperature using shelter, fire, and clothes to avoid the associated penalties of extreme conditions.

### Shelter
- While you are in shelter, your temperature counts as one tier closer to comfortable. Tents and caves count as shelter. For other natural features, it is up to the GM to determine if the feature counts as shelter.

### Fire
- While next to a fire, your temperature counts as one tier higher. You cannot build a fire in a tent unless specifically stated otherwise.

### Clothes
- Different clothes can increase your temperature by one or more tiers. Check out the **Equipment & Gear** section for details on different clothing options. You cannot sleep in your clothes, but an insulated bedroll will also work.
