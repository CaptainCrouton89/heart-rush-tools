## Subclass: Skirmisher

_Also known as: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Jack of All Trades_

A wiry figure darts between the shadows, slipping past a lumbering ogre’s sweeping fist. With a quick flick of the wrist, she throws a handful of sand into the creature’s eyes, blinding it and slipping away before it can even roar.

Despite standing amid a dozen pikemen in a frenzied brawl, a goblin seems to simply melt away from the thrusting pikes, evading every swipe and thrust aimed at him. Then, with a sly grin, he lashes out, tripping an overzealous soldier and leaving him sprawled at the mercy of the goblin’s allies.

With a smirk, a tall elven woman swishes her rapier up and flicks the ear of the orc before her. With a roar, the orc charges forward, but suddenly the elf is behind him, pushing him with her boot into the wall beyond.

Skirmishers are elusive and unpredictable, dancing around the battlefield with an unsettling ease. They specialize in dirty tricks and misdirection, exploiting every weakness to leave their enemies vulnerable. Hard to pin down and even harder to catch, they disrupt their foes and wear them down with a series of debilitating strikes.

### Skirmisher Abilities

#### Improved Interference  
_Passive ability. Rank 2._  
Choosing the same stance as another creature does not prevent you from using a non-attacking offensive action against them.

Additionally, whenever you choose to hinder a creature, choose from the following list instead:

- The creature takes 1d6 damage and 3 levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1d6 damage and 2 levels of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is not more than two sizes larger than you.
- Push the creature 10 feet. It travels 5 less feet for every size larger than you that it is, and 5 more feet for every size smaller.
- If the creature can see or hear you, it gains one level of enraged towards you.
- If the creature is no more than one size bigger or smaller than you, switch places with it.

#### Bag of Tricks  
_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._  
Choose one:

- **Acrobatics**: The next time you sidestep, move up to 10 feet instead. Ignore difficult terrain. Flavor at will.
- **Scamper**: Increase your climb speed by 20 feet this round.
- **Shenanigans**: The next time you perform a stunt, you have A3 on the contested ability check.
- **Switcheroo**: The next time you sidestep, you may sidestep into an adjacent and willing creature’s space. Switch places with that creature. That creature must be no more than one size bigger or smaller than you.
- **Taunt**: After stances are chosen but before stances are revealed, you may choose a creature and call out their stance. After stances are revealed, if you guessed correctly, that creature gains a level of enraged towards you.
- **Quick Reflexes**: You start this round with priority.

## Classes

### Elusive  
_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._  
Immediately after taking damage during an engagement, you may take the sidestep action as a free, instant ability. This may cause you to no longer be a valid target for some attackers. You cannot make any attack rolls this round.

### Nasty Tricksies  
_Major ability. Rank 4._  
When you hinder a creature, you may instead choose one of the following options. X is equal to the number of rush points spent on this ability.

- The creature is stunned for X/2 rounds, rounded down.
- The creature takes your choice of X levels of blinded, or X/3 permanent levels of blinded.
- The creature takes X permanent levels of weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- Choose one of the creature’s move speeds. That move speed is permanently reduced by 5X, to a minimum of 5.

## Subclass: Spelltouched

_Also known as: Gish, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Archer, Spellsword_

A dwarf charges forward, cloaked in flames, his fists blazing with fiery energy. With a swift motion, he raises a wall of fire behind the ogre, trapping it, and then strikes with a searing punch, sending the creature tumbling back in a smoldering heap.

A gnome darts ahead, each step propelled by the wind itself, carrying her swiftly toward the looming giant spider. With a graceful twirl of her blade, she slashes at the creature’s thorax, releasing a concussive blast of air that hurls it backward.

An elf raises her hand, and a towering wave rises from the earth, sweeping the fleeing thugs back toward her. With a sharp stomp, the cobblestone beneath them seems to melt, dragging the panicked foes into the ground, immobilized.

Spelltouched blend elemental magic with martial prowess, wielding their attunements to shape the battlefield. By casting spells, they can deny areas to their enemies, unleash devastating attacks, and manipulate the movement and position of their foes.

### Spelltouched Abilities

#### Elemental State  
_Passive ability. Rank 2._  
You must have an attunement to fire, earth, water, or air in order to gain the benefits of this class. You know how to incorporate your knowledge of the elements into your fighting.

  - Your move speed decreases by 20 feet.
  - Once per round, as a priority ability, you may choose to cause a 10-foot tall spire of stone to rise in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The spire has 10 HP and 10 defense and counts as impassable terrain.

- **Water: Tempest**  
  As an instant free action, you may enter or exit the Tempest state. While in this state, waves rise up beneath your feet, water runs down your skin, and raindrops condense around you. You embody the storm and gain the following abilities:
  - You are immune to the off-balanced or prone condition.
  - You can breathe underwater and fight underwater without any of the penalties applied due to underwater combat.
  - When you make an attack roll, you may choose to attack with the force of waves, drenching your target and knocking them prone if they are no more than one size greater than you. If they are more than one size greater than you, they instead take two levels of weakened.

- **Air: Dance of the Winds**  
  As an instant free action, you may enter or exit the Dance of the Winds state. While in this state, the wind blows with every footstep, lifting you up and pushing you forward, and the faint sound of thunder and lightning can be heard around you. You embody the soul of air and wind and gain the following abilities:
  - Your move speed increases by 20 feet.
  - Ignore difficult terrain. Other creatures cannot inflict the slowed condition on you.
  - When you make an attack roll, you may choose to knock your target up to 10 feet away from you.

#### Warcaster

You may use this minor ability to cast any of your spells without using your action. Lastly, you may spend any number of additional rush points on this ability. Reduce the number of long rests you wait before casting the spell again by one for every rush point spent. You must still wait a minimum of a short rest.

#### Elemental Attacks

  - The ground in a 5X-foot radius erupts into flame, inflicting a level of burning to creatures of your choice that enter or begin the round in the area for the next minute.
  - Creatures of your choice within 45 feet take X levels of dazed as the temperature in the area skyrockets.

- **Earth: Stone Soul**

  - **Liquefaction**: Creatures of your choice within 45 feet gain 2 levels of slowed.
  - **Arms of Gaea**: A creature of your choice within 45 feet is knocked 10 feet in any direction. If they are size large, this distance is decreased by 5 feet. If they are even bigger, they aren’t pushed at all but instead take 1d6 damage.
  - **Natural Cover**: The ground raises up as a natural barrier. Choose a segment within 45 feet. Standing behind it grants two levels of cover.

- **Water: Eye of the Storm**  
  Waves well up from the ground as you are engulfed in a miring tempest. Choose any number of creatures within 45 feet. They are immediately knocked prone as waves crash against them. The ground in a 45-foot radius counts as difficult terrain, and creatures of your choice in range cannot take the sidestep action. Creatures prone in the water immediately gain the suffocating condition.

- **Air: Bourne by the Gale**  
  For the next minute, you can jump up to 40 feet.
