# Talents (continued)

## Nature’s Child

**Passive Ability. Handmagic.**

You can sense basic intentions and communicate simple ideas with wild animals. When you take this talent, you may choose to limit this ability to only one type of animal (e.g., ravens, spiders, or wolves). If you do, those creatures will never attack you, and you have **A3** on all interactions with those creatures.

### Destiny Level
As an action, you can summon forth wild animals within a mile radius. If you have chosen a specific animal, you gain exclusively that animal instead.

---

## Necromancy

**Major Ability. Handmagic.**

You can raise the dead. By sacrificing a creature, you can reanimate another creature of the same type. The ritual takes one hour, and at the end, you have a creature with stats identical to the dead creature, including:

- Same might die
- d2 cunning, agility, and presence dice
- Half of the hit point maximum
- No ability to communicate

The reanimated creature loses any special combat abilities it had and obeys any orders you give it to the best of its ability. You can have no more than one undead creature under your control.

### Destiny Level
You may create and control up to three undead servants with this talent.

---

## Observant

**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**

You have **A4** on cunning checks to notice things. Additionally, as long as you can see someone’s lips and understand the language they are speaking, you know what they are saying, even if you cannot hear them.

### Destiny Level
- Hidden attackers cannot make opportunity attacks against you.
- You do not suffer any penalty from attacking an obscured enemy.
- Obscured enemies gain no advantage when attacking you.
- If you spend your action watching a creature fight for three rounds or more, you learn the creature’s strengths and weaknesses, gaining advantage on all A/D rolls made against that creature.

---

## Oracle

**Monthly Ability. Full Action. Handmagic.**

As an action, you may choose a creature other than yourself. That creature’s next roll is replaced with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a complication occurs. At any time, the GM may replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum possible result. This cannot be rerolled or replaced. The GM may not do so again until you use this ability again.

### Destiny Level
This ability no longer takes an action.

---

## Pinky Swear

**Passive Ability. Handmagic.**

While the smallest finger of your hand is interlocked with the smallest finger of another person’s hand, neither you nor that person can knowingly utter a lie.

### Destiny Level
While your fingers are intertwined, both people are compelled to speak truthfully and cannot withhold information.

---

## Poisoner

**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**

As long as you can disguise it as another action, you automatically succeed on any check to slip poison into someone’s food or drink, even while in plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they will not notice there is poison in their food, only that they will not realize you are poisoning it as you do it.

- For every 10 times you digest a single type of poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it, taking 10 damage less from every instance of damage it deals.

### Destiny Level
You know your poisons. You immediately know if any food or drink you consume contains poison, as well as all of its properties.

---

## Rapid Growth

**Major Ability. Full Action. Handmagic.**

As an action, you may place your hand on a non-living object that fits in a space between a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows to fill a 10-foot cube or shrinks to fit a 2-inch cube, though it will not grow if it is enclosed. The transformation lasts for one hour or until dismissed as an action.

### Destiny Level
The transformation lasts indefinitely, but you may not use this ability on more than three different objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases to a 25-foot cube.

---

## Repulsion

**Heart Ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental Attunement: Force.**

Choose any two objects. Those objects repulse each other with 50 pounds of force if they are within 10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you choose two new objects.

### Destiny Level
You may choose up to five objects, and the repulsive force begins at 100 feet away.

---

## Rope Servant

**Passive Ability. Handmagic.**

If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were an extension of your arm, including floating straight up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a weapon. The control persists only while you hold the rope, which can be up to 50 feet long.

### Destiny Level
The rope becomes unbreakably strong while being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.

---

## Runescribe

**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**

If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or a similar aspect, you may begin making handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you can memorize that sign and tattoo your hands with that sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and titan bone, which equates to about half the price of getting a new handmagic sign.

### Destiny Level
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or a similar aspect, you may make additional modifications to a handmagic sign to upgrade its destiny level. You must spend a week studying and practicing before memorizing and inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.

---

## Silver Tongue

**Major Ability. Handmagic.**

As an action, you may charm a person you are talking to. They gain 2 ranks of charmed towards you for the next hour, after which they know they were magically charmed by you. They lose all ranks of charmed if you take a hostile action towards them.

### Destiny Level
The effect lasts twelve hours rather than one. The person does not realize they were charmed when the effect ends.

---

## Siren’s Song

**Weekly Ability. Gaeic Melody.**

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are enthralled by your performance and struggle to pull their gaze away.

### Destiny Level
The range of your song increases to 120 feet. Additionally, you may choose to exclude individuals from the collection of creatures you enthrall.

---

## Smooth Talker

**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**

Whenever you speak, your words come out like smooth butter. You have **A2** on presence skill checks to persuade, intimidate, and deceive.

### Destiny Level
When you gain this destiny level, choose persuasion, intimidation, or deception. Whenever you make a skill check in that category, before you roll, you may choose to instead use the maximum result of your presence die rather than rolling.

---

## Song of Rage

## The Spider

**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**

You have a network of spies and informants at your fingertips. Once per day while within a city within the range of your influence, you may meet with your informants to learn what is going on around town. You may ask two unique questions of the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or more, your spies return with answers. 

- The GM answers one of your questions truthfully and either gives false information about the other or does not answer it at all.
- Any information that fewer than 25 people know about cannot be answered by your spy network.

### Destiny Level
You may ask up to three questions and may ask questions with answers known by no fewer than five people. The GM must truthfully answer two of the three questions.

## Smell Something Fishy

**Heart Ability. Cognitive Talent.**
