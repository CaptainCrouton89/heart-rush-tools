## Call of Delorn
**Monthly Ability. Gaeic Melody.**  
You play a song, making a plea to the wilds for their help. After playing your instrument for an hour, a friendly, non-humanoid animal comes to your aid. The animal is not your servant but will do its best to help you in any way that does not put itself in danger. You may communicate with it through your song, though the animal cannot communicate back.

- The animal remains in your aid for the rest of the day.

### Destiny Level
You may choose for a sentient creature, including other humanoids, to answer your call instead. They feel a strong compulsion to help you for reasons they cannot identify, as long as you do not drive them away with your words or actions.

## Coin Jingle
**Major Ability. Gaeic Melody.**

You can suss out information from someone even without them knowing. If you spend 10 minutes talking with someone, you may ask the GM one thing about them that they aren’t trying to hide from the following list:

- Profession
- Childhood
- Moral compass

If you wish, you may press further and make a presence check contested by their cunning challenge number. This check is made with disadvantage if they are unfriendly or hostile towards you. On a success, you learn any one specific piece of information that the target knows and is not actively hiding. On a fail, they know that you are fishing for information about your topic.

### Destiny Level
You do not make this check with disadvantage against unfriendly creatures, and you make the check with advantage if it’s against a friendly or neutral creature. Additionally, if you fail, the creature does not know that you were probing for details on your topic.

## Cryomancy
**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental Attunement: Water.**  
Add ice to your resonate substances as a solid attunement. Your level of attunement with ice is equal to your level of attunement with water.

## Divine Consult
**Monthly Ability. Cognitive Talent.**  
You are capable of limited communication with the daemon you worship. After spending one minute in prayer, you may ask one yes or no question of the daemon. The GM must either answer it truthfully, or you may put 1 XP into the experience bowl. You cannot use this ability more than once per session, and you cannot ask the same question again, regardless of if the GM answered your question.

## Dream Thief
**Passive Ability. Handmagic.**  
By spending one minute concentrating on someone else within 10 feet, you can pull thoughts from their mind. Make a contested cunning check against another character.

Your move speed bonus increases by another 20 feet. You gain a 20-foot swim speed and can climb any tree with a 10-foot climb speed. Whenever you move, you may move directly through trees and other large plants. If you have the destiny level of the Druid’s Touch talent, you gain a move speed of 20 feet while transformed as a plant.

---

## Druid’s Touch
**Passive Ability. Handmagic.**  
As an action, by touching a plant, you can cause it to grow as much as it would in one year over the span of one minute. You may direct its growth, so long as growing in such a way would not kill the plant. You can cause a plant you are touching to slowly change its shape as you command, so long as its new shape would not hurt the plant.

### Destiny Level
As an action, you can meld with a tree or other equally large plant. By doing so, your body and gear disappear, and your spirit inhabits the wood of the tree. You can sense your surroundings out to a range of 45 feet. While transformed as a tree, you maintain the stats of your untransformed character, though your defense becomes 8, and you may double your current hit points. You are also incapacitated and cannot speak. You may transform back to your original form at will, or at the end of the round if in combat.

---

## Druid’s Voice
**Passive Ability. Handmagic.**  
You can communicate with plants, so long as you are touching them. Plants recognize you as an ally and will generally be willing to help in any way they can.

### Destiny Level
If you speak in an area of dense vegetation, such as a forest, plains, or garden, you may choose for your voice to carry as whispers in the blades of grass or leaves on the trees to everywhere within the reaches of that vegetation, up to a 100-mile radius. Likewise, you may choose to listen to any sounds or voices within 100 miles, so long as you are both in the same larger body of dense vegetation. If you have the destiny level of the Druid’s Touch talent, you may speak while transformed as a plant.

You may take the Lookout action for free, once per travel and camp phase.

---

## Elemental Affinity
**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**  
Choose an element. You gain a basic level of attunement with that element or gain an advanced level of attunement with an element you already have a basic attunement with. You may take this talent multiple times.

### Destiny Level
Choose an element you are attuned to. You do not have to wait more than a single short rest between casting spells that require just that element.

---

## Everything Has a Price
**Weekly Ability. Handmagic.**  
If you touch someone, you may force them to be willing to sell any item to you. They will not necessarily be willing to sell it for a price that you desire, but if they would not have otherwise been willing to sell the item, they are now.

### Destiny Level
When you touch someone, you know with certainty for the next 24 hours when they are bluffing about anything related to prices, markets, risk, and gambling.

---

## Explorer
**Passive Ability. Cognitive Talent.**  
Adventuring and unexpected difficulty have taught you how to prepare for any situation. At any time, you may choose to allocate 10 slots of inventory space as “adventuring gear.” When you do so, choose one from the following list of benefits. You can only choose each benefit once, and the slots remain allocated until you reach a location where you can resupply and change out your equipment.

- You have A2 on checks to navigate. You know which direction is North.
- Your shelter counts as indoors for the purpose of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.
- Your bed counts as a straw bed for the purpose of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.

### Destiny Level
You may choose each option more than once to grant additional levels of advantage on navigation checks or give other people the benefits of shelter and a straw bed. Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense for where there may be more to discover and what you might find. Once per month, while exploring a location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that there is more to be discovered. Then name either ruin, settlement, or natural wonder, and choose a direction that you have not been in before. Whatever you named is located somewhat closely in the named direction. The GM may ask you to choose a different direction or a different discovery.

### Faceless Servant
**Major ability. Full action. Handmagic.**  
As an action, you summon forth a faceless humanoid servant in peasant's clothes. Their face is a smooth surface with only eyes to see and ears to hear. The servant will obey polite, safe commands until they disappear in one hour.

**Destiny Level**: The servant remains indefinitely. You cannot have more than one servant alive at any time.
