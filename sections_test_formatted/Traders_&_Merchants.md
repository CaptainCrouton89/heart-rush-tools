# Traders & Merchants

Money is what makes the world go around, and in the world of Alaria, it is no different. If you are interested in making money at a large scale through trade, this section is for you.

## Making Money

Every settlement has an economy centered around buying and selling roughly the same goods. For example, almost everyone needs food and clothing, and most settlements also require stone, lumber, beer, salt, and a variety of other “core” resources. However, some settlements produce these goods or are adjacent to producers, resulting in a surplus, while others have deficits and therefore have high demand. This is where you come in.

## Prices

Every settlement has a rating for its size, which determines the number of buyers and sellers present, as well as their levels. For every common good (see the _Common Goods_ table below), there is a level of need that reflects whether the good is in demand or in surplus, and to what magnitude. The rating is secretly determined by the GM but will reflect the availability of that good in the area. Note that a settlement will only ever have demand or surplus for a good—never both—since individuals would trade amongst themselves until there was no more surplus or demand. This rating determines the price of any given good within a settlement.

To find the price of a good, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Demand/Surplus Modifier**: 
   - If the good is in demand, multiply the base price by the modifier.
   - If the good is in surplus, divide the base price by the modifier.
   
The end result is the approximate price for that good in that location. While you, as a merchant, may (and should) approximate this value yourself, the “true” value is determined and held secretly by the GM.

## Buyers and Sellers

To take advantage of the price, you must find buyers and sellers. Even if individuals want to buy or sell some goods, you cannot turn a profit by making individual sales—you must buy or sell in bulk. Typically, only shopkeepers and local merchants can be your customers.

To determine the number of buyers or sellers in a settlement:

1. **Identify the Good**: Check if it is in surplus or demand.
   - If in surplus, there are only sellers.
   - If in demand, there are only buyers.
   - If the rating is 0, there is an equal division of buyers and sellers (rounded at GM discretion).

2. **Calculate the Number of Buyers/Sellers**: 
   - Take the value in the bonus traders column of the _Surplus & Demand_ table and add it to the value listed in the buyers/sellers column of the _Settlements_ table.

**Example**: 
- If furs are in moderate demand (1d4 - 1) in a small town (+1), then the number of buyers would be equal to 1d4.
- If bricks are in extreme surplus (1d4 + 1) in a hamlet (+0), then the number of sellers would be equal to 1d4 + 1.
- If honey is neutral (1d4 - 3) in a metropolis (+4), then there would be 1d4 + 1 buyers and sellers, split evenly.

## Securing a Buyer or Seller

When you arrive at a settlement, you can choose to spend a day looking for a buyer or seller of a particular good. This time is spent perusing shops, visiting guilds, and gathering information. While this part of the day may not be played out, actually meeting the buyer or seller will be.

When you meet a buyer or seller, the GM will roll a die equal to the value in the buyer/seller level column of the _Settlement_ table and then add your influence, up to the maximum level listed in the max level column. This is the level of the trader, representing how many units of goods they may be willing to buy or sell to you at the given price.

From this point on, it is up to you to secure a price you want. Although an approximate base price has been calculated by the GM using the supply/demand table, it is your responsibility to find the best deal possible. Once you agree on a price, you may transfer a number of goods to the trader up to their level and receive payment at the agreed price.

You may continue looking for buyers and sellers of the same good or search for a different good. In either case, this still takes a day and follows the same process.

Once you have made a deal with one or more buyers or sellers in a settlement, you may always return to that settlement to make the exact same exchange of money for goods once per month. You do not need to find new buyers or sellers, nor do you have to haggle for a new price (though you may choose to do so). Although a trader may disappear or wish to renegotiate prices, this typically will not happen unless the GM decides it makes sense.

## Trade Routes

At the heart of being a successful merchant is identifying and exploiting lucrative trade routes. While it’s possible for a trader to constantly travel, buying and selling whatever they deem fit, it is much better to automate this process so that the merchant’s time can be spent elsewhere. This automation takes the form of trade routes.

Trade routes are cyclical paths connecting a collection of settlements, where the starting and ending settlement are the same, and the quantity of purchases and sales in every settlement along the way remains in equilibrium with each pass through the cycle.

Although there are no specific rules dictating special properties of trade routes, it is highly recommended that you develop them, as they allow you to assign the job of traveling between settlements and executing trades to someone else. 

To count as a trade route, there must not be any renegotiating on prices and quantities for each good at each stop in the trade route, and there must be a settlement of origin where your trade route begins and ends. Once confirmed, your trade route’s profit can be calculated by looking at the total revenue from completing a trade route and then subtracting the maintenance costs for whatever vehicles were used during that time. This money can then be picked up from your settlement of origin after each cycle of the trade route is completed.

## Milestones

As you improve as a trader, you unlock certain benefits due to a combination of your influence, wealth, and experience. Each milestone is unlocked once you achieve its prerequisite achievements.

### Trader: Novice
**Prerequisite**: Establish 20 miles worth of trade routes.  
You know how to identify who’s more likely to buy or sell a lot. When you enter a new settlement, you may ask the GM to roll the level for each buyer or seller in the settlement and announce their levels to you. You may meet them in any order.

### Trader: Amateur
**Prerequisite**: Establish 100 miles worth of trade routes.  
Your minimum influence level becomes 2.

### Trader: Professional
**Prerequisite**: Establish 500 miles worth of trade routes.  
You have gained an intuition about where pirates and thieves may lie. You have A3 on all checks to predict their presence, including when you research a trade route and while actually traveling it. Your minimum influence level becomes 3.

### Trader: Expert
**Prerequisite**: Establish 2,000 miles worth of trade routes.  
You can find a better deal on most things. If you find an item being sold that is not unique and costs less than 50,000 ducats, roll 1d100. If you roll under 50, you know someone else who’s selling it at a price at that percentage discount on the price you originally found. The GM will tell you their name and how you know to contact them. You may use this ability once per month.

**Example**: If you found a magical knife that costs 40,000 ducats, you could use this ability and roll 1d100. If you rolled a 25, then the GM would tell you that you know a friend, “Andre,” who sells that exact item for 30,000 (40,000 - 25% x 40,000). The GM will tell you how you know (or know of) this person, as well as where they are and how to contact them. You may use this ability on bulk purchases as well, so long as each individual item of the bulk purchase costs less than 50,000. Additionally, your minimum influence level becomes 4.

### Trader: Master
**Prerequisite**: Establish 10,000 miles worth of trade routes.  
You have connections everywhere. If an item is on the market in any of the markets your trade route touches, you can use your trade network to locate a buyer or seller. You may use this ability any number of times for non-unique items and only once per month for unique items. Additionally, your minimum influence level becomes 5.

## Complications & Other Factors

These rules outline what things will look like when everything is going smoothly. However, there are several other factors to consider when implementing them in an actual game.

### Taxes

Taxes are a significant concern for merchants and can be a pain to avoid. Most cities and large ports have tariffs on imported resources, usually ranging from 2–5% of the imported value. The exact rates are up to the GM, as well as whether they exist at all. Fortunately, bribes, smuggling, and other trickery can be used to circumvent these. As a player, it is up to you to decide if you want to avoid these taxes, and if so, how.

### Weather

The second bane of the merchant lifestyle is the weather. Weather can lead to delays, damaged shipments, or no shipments at all, such as if a ship sinks at sea. When the GM approximates the time it takes to travel from one settlement to another, they should take this into account. Additionally, if you are traveling to a place where shipments could be damaged, the GM may choose to impose a percentage loss on profits based on how likely they estimate these damages to occur.

Lastly, the GM may decide that weather has caused an entire shipment to disappear. Usually, this is cause for player investigation, but if you are shipping goods through a dangerous area, this may just be a cost of doing business.

### Pirates & Thieves

The last thorn in the side of merchants comes from pirates and thieves who steal merchandise in transit. As with weather, this may just be a constant cost to your shipments, or it may be a source of further adventure. The GM should think carefully about where pirates and thieves reside and how they go about stealing.
