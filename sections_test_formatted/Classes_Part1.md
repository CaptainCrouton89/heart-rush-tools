# Heart Rush TTRPG Rules: Classes

Your class defines your general role in combat. It does not dictate your actions outside of combat, and in games where combat is infrequent, your class may be less relevant compared to your aspects and talents. There are three distinct classes: **Stronghearts**, **Battlehearts**, and **Cleverhearts**. Each class has a unique combat style:

- **Stronghearts**: Beefier characters responsible for preventing enemies from harming their allies.
- **Battlehearts**: Damage dealers focused on quickly downing enemies.
- **Cleverhearts**: Supportive characters who help allies excel in their roles and weaken enemies.

### Class Selection

When you reach Rank 1, choose one of the classes and gain the abilities listed with the **Rank 1** tag. Upon reaching Rank 2, select one of the subclasses your class offers, each specializing in a unique play style. For example, a **Striker** specializes in single-target damage, while a **Ravager** excels at dealing damage to multiple foes.

Within each subclass, there are three types of abilities: **Rank 2**, **Rank 3**, and **Rank 4** abilities. Upon reaching each rank, gain the corresponding abilities from your subclass.

## Party Composition

Heart Rush is a game where every role in the party is critical during team fights. Each class enables or takes advantage of the synergistic abilities of other classes. A party with at least one of each class will generally perform better than one missing a core class. However, feel free to choose a class based on your preferences rather than solely on party composition.

## Strongheart Abilities

### Hulking Blows
**Minor Ability. Instant. Rank 3.**

### Fists, Knees, and Elbows
