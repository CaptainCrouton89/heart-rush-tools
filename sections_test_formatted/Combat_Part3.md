# Combat (Part 3)

## Grappling Damage

### Might Stance

When you have a creature grappled and use the **Might Stance**, you may choose to deal **1d6 damage**, plus **1d6 damage** for every size greater you are than the grappled creature.

### Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature that is two or more sizes larger than you. Make a **Might** or **Agility** ability check contested by the creature’s **Might** or **Agility** ability check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the creature. While you are on the creature, you have the **Creature Climber** condition. The climbed-on creature has the **Climbed On** condition. A creature can only climb on one creature at a time.

### Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform an action that interferes with your target. This could involve throwing sand in their eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker-punching them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target with this ability. Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes **1d4 damage** and gains **2 levels** of **Weakened**, **Off-Balanced**, or **Dazed**.
- The creature gains **1 level** of **Blinded**.
- The creature is knocked prone, provided it is no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature **5 feet**. It travels **5 feet less** for every size larger than you it is, and **5 feet more** for every size smaller. The creature gains **2 levels** of **Off-Balanced**.

### Stunt

Choose your own effect with the GM’s permission. This could involve stealing an item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their sword by the blade to turn it into clay, taunting the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet. In these cases, make a contested ability check against the creature.

## Special Circumstances

### Surprise

In some cases, when combat begins, one or more parties may be completely surprised, giving anyone who was prepared to fight a significant advantage. Special rules apply in these circumstances:

- A creature is not surprised if they can see their opponent before the round begins and are unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or do not know their opponent.
- If one party in an encounter is completely surprised, each un-surprised creature can use their action to make an opportunity attack, while each surprised creature does not get to use abilities or move on the first round of combat.

### Attacking the Helpless

Sometimes, you will make attacks against creatures that are completely unable to defend themselves. At the GM’s discretion, you may make an opportunity attack against the creature. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

## Cover

Cover is an important part of staying alive—if you remain behind cover, you are safe from ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist between the attacker and the defender:

1. **Determining Cover**: Draw imaginary lines between any one point on the attacker and each corner of the square that the enemy occupies. For each line obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker suffers a level of disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack that creature.

2. **Types of Cover**:
   - **One Level of Cover**: Small obstacles that provide minimal protection (e.g., a small tree).
   - **Two Levels of Cover**: Objects that require the defender to poke their body out to attack (e.g., the rise of a hill or the back of a couch).
   - **Three Levels of Cover**: Structures designed for uni-directional attacks (e.g., arrow slits).

In cases where obstacles do not lend themselves to the line-blocked method of determining cover, it is up to the GM to decide how much cover should be awarded to the defender.
