## Hermelia

Tags: npc, villain, deceased, fire mage

Hermelia was a fire and air mage of considerable power who became infamous for burning the city of Shtaneres in Breia to the ground before fleeing into exile. She died in the Hellion Hills, in the volcanic lair that now bears her name.

### Origins

Hermelia grew up in Shtaneres, a city in Breia, where she developed her talents in fire and air magic. The details of her early life have been deliberately obscured—Breia's records on the matter are incomplete, and those who knew her before the burning either died in it or refuse to speak of it.

What is known: she was gifted, ambitious, and increasingly unstable. Something happened in Shtaneres that pushed her over the edge. The result was catastrophic.

### The Burning of Shtaneres

The fire started in multiple locations simultaneously and spread faster than any natural conflagration. Hermelia used her dual mastery of fire and air to create a firestorm—flames fed by winds she commanded, spreading to consume the city faster than anyone could respond.

Thousands died. Shtaneres was effectively destroyed as a functioning city. Hermelia fled before the fire burned out, heading northeast toward the Wurmspine mountains.

Why she burned her home city remains unknown. Some accounts suggest she was wronged—betrayed by lovers, cheated by merchants, condemned by authorities. Others paint her as simply mad, destroying for destruction's sake. Breia's official position is that she was a monster and her motives don't matter.

### Exile and Death

Hermelia made her way to the Hellion Hills, drawn by the fire ley line that runs through the region. She constructed a lair in the volcanic terrain, carving chambers into the rock and warding them with fire magic that still partially functions decades later.

She lived there for years, possibly decades, continuing her research into fire magic. Whether she intended to return to civilization, strike against her enemies, or simply hide forever is unknown.

How she died is equally uncertain. Her lair shows signs of violence, but no body was recovered. She may have been killed by hunters from Breia, betrayed by allies, or consumed by her own experiments with the fire ley line. The truth died with her.

### Legacy

Hermelia's Lair remains a site of interest for treasure hunters and fire mages. Her research notes, if they survive, would be extraordinarily valuable. The magical barriers protecting her inner chambers suggest something worth protecting—or something too dangerous to release.

The "fire echoes" around her lair—flames that replay old events, heat mirages that show the past—may contain fragments of her knowledge, imprinted on the ley line itself. Scholars who've studied the phenomenon believe careful observation could teach techniques she developed. The danger is significant, but so is the potential reward.
