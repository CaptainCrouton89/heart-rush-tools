## Phendexelas the Beautiful

Tags: monster, leader

Phendexelas is the gorgon queen of Phirexes.

She partially controls the fogs of the swamp, causing lycanthropy, driving people insane or blind, and chaining souls to the swamp. She is also able to turn those who look upon her to stone, and the snakes on her head are extremely venomous. She can perform a variety of Deoric magic inherently as a gorgon, and she knows even more from her studies.
