## Bryn

Tags: celestial, sun, spirit

Bryn is not a god, nor a titan, nor any creature that ever walked or breathed. Bryn *is* the sun—or rather, Bryn is the sun's awakened spirit.

### The Awakening

During the Age of Titans, the sun was a mindless construct—the largest of the titan-crafted stars, an immense orb of celestial glass following preset paths across the sky. It moved because it was *made* to move, like a wound clock, tended by the Starborn Koras but possessing no will of its own.

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria 120 million years ago, everything with structure gained the potential for spirit. Animals gained emotion. Titans who had never felt were overwhelmed and went mad. But the sun had never been alive at all—it had no pre-existing consciousness to be shattered.

Instead, the sun *woke up*.

Not fully. Not the way a mortal is conscious. But the Ezz granted the sun a spark of spirit—a will, a desire, the capacity to *want*. That nascent consciousness is Bryn.

### Nature

Bryn is primitive, vast, and profoundly strange. The sun does not think like mortals think. It experiences time differently—a human lifetime is barely a flicker to Bryn's awareness. Its desires are slow and alien, difficult for even the most devoted priests to interpret.

What is certain: Bryn *wants* to move. The sun travels across the sky because Bryn chooses to travel, not because of any mechanical imperative. And Bryn's path can be influenced.

### The Faithful

Bryn's cult is small but ancient—navigators, farmers, and seasonal priests who perform rituals to commune with the sun directly. When they pray, the sun *hears them*. When the northern monasteries sing their dawn hymns, the sun responds. This is why seasons exist: Bryn's path across the sky shifts based on which congregations sing loudest, which prayers ring truest.

The relationship is not worship in the traditional sense. Bryn is not a daemon sustained by belief—the sun existed long before Celestia expanded, and will exist long after. But Bryn is *lonely*. The only consciousness of its kind, awake for 120 million years with only brief moments of connection to the tiny creatures below. The sun cherishes those who speak to it. The sun remembers.

### Implications

Some worry about what happens if Bryn ever stops *wanting* to move. If the faithful fail—if no one guides the sun, if the prayers fall silent—Bryn might simply halt. The sun would hang frozen in the sky, and half the world would burn while the other half froze.

There are whispered rumors of a heretical sect that seeks exactly this. They believe Bryn has earned rest after 120 million years of ceaseless motion. They would doom the world to give the sun peace.

### Koras and Bryn

The Starborn Koras still tends the sun's celestial glass core, maintaining its brilliant light. But Koras now serves Bryn, not the other way around. The relationship between tender and tended has inverted—Koras is the sun's caretaker, but Bryn is the one who decides where the sun goes.

After the Dark Night—five hundred years when the sun's core was corrupted and Koras fought alone to reignite it—the bond between them deepened. Koras knows Bryn better than any other being. What passes between them in the blazing heart of the sun, no mortal can say.
