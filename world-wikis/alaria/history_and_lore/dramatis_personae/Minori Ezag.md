## Minori Ezag

Tags: druid, npc, elder_wilds

An extremely powerful and thoroughly insane druid who dwells in the northeastern Elder Wilds, where three Anchor Trees stand in unusual proximity.

### Nature

Minori Ezag's age is unclear but certainly measured in centuries, possibly millennia. Their gender is ambiguous or perhaps irrelevant—they have lived alone in the wilderness so long that such distinctions seem to have lost meaning. They are one of the greater druids, immortal unless killed by violence.

Their power is immense. Their sanity is not.

### Behavior

Minori Ezag moves through the canopy like a primate—climbing between trees with unsettling speed and grace, leaping gaps that should be impossible, hanging from branches with apparent effortlessness. They are occasionally spotted from a distance at dusk, a distant silhouette moving through the treetops.

They accept no students. They offer no wisdom. They do not communicate in any conventional sense.

Travelers who pass too close to their territory find themselves... redirected. Not attacked—simply turned around, their path subtly altered until they're heading away without remembering when they changed direction.

### The Three Trees

The three Anchor Trees near Minori Ezag's territory are the only ones in the Elder Wilds that stand so close together—within a few hundred yards of each other. Some speculate that Minori Ezag has become attuned to the collective consciousness of the Anchor Trees—that they hear what the trees remember, perceive what the trees perceive. Whether the druid chose this location because of the trees, or whether their presence has somehow caused the unusual proximity, is unknown.
