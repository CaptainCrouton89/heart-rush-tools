## Thorne

Tags: druid, npc, elder_wilds

An ancient druid who dwells in the interior of L'Coth D'hari, in the Elder Wilds. Thorne (both the being and the grove they inhabit) predates the Gamori arrival on the peninsula by an unknown span of time—possibly millennia.

### Nature

Thorne is immortal in the manner of greater elves—the original druids who emerged alongside Gaea 120 million years ago. They have pursued a path that diverged from traditional Faesong practice long ago, though the specifics are unknown. Thorne is not exactly evil, but operates by principles that most mortals find disturbing.

Rumors suggest:
- Bargains with entities in the Anchor Tree collective
- Experiments with the boundary between life and death
- Knowledge of the titans buried beneath the Elder Trees

### The Grove

The place called Thorne is not a fortress. It is a region of forest—extent unknown—where the plants move with too much purpose, where the animals watch with too much intelligence, where visitors find themselves forgetting why they came or losing hours without memory of their passage.

The Gamori of L'Coth D'hari give it wide berth. They have an understanding with the druid, the terms of which they do not discuss with outsiders.

### Appearance

Unknown. Those who have glimpsed Thorne describe contradictory impressions—sometimes humanoid, sometimes more like a growth of the forest itself. Whether this is shapeshifting, illusion, or the confusion of the grove is unclear.
