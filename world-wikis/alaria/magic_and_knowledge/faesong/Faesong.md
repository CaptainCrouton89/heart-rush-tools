## Faesong

Tags: magic, Melera

Faesong is the ambient music of Melera that drifts through all of creation. Though Melera remains imprisoned by Azus, her song resonates across the universe—weak, but ever-present. It is the counterpart to the Psywinds, and together they represent the two great ambient magical forces in Alaria.

### Nature

Where the **Psywinds** carry the *thoughts* of living beings—the collected ideas, memories, and intentions that flow through Ezz—**Faesong** carries *emotion* and *harmony*. It is not generated by mortal minds but flows directly from Melera herself, a constant melody that underlies all of reality.

Faesong is subtle. Most creatures cannot hear it at all. Those who can perceive it describe it as a harmony just beneath the threshold of hearing—a feeling of rightness when things are in balance, a dissonance when they are not. It is the music of creation itself, the resonance that makes beauty possible.

### Who Can Hear It

**Fae creatures**—rusalka, faeries, nelkie, nymphs, and their kin—can hear Faesong and use it to perform magic. Their spells work with the melody rather than imposing will upon reality. This is why fae magic often feels organic, flowing, and strange—it is not commanding the world but harmonizing with it.

**Druids** are mortal beings who have learned to attune to Faesong. Their magic is neither Kethic (which channels psyic energy through emotional intent) nor Deoric (which commands reality through absolute language), but something older and stranger: direct harmony with Melera's song. This makes druids a true mixture of both primordial sources—part of Azus's ordered creation, yet attuned to Melera's imprisoned melody.

**Bards** who perform Gaeic Melodies are reproducing Faesong, though most do not realize it. When a bard's song moves an audience to tears or courage, they are briefly channeling the same harmony that Melera creates. The most skilled bards learn to tap this connection consciously.

### Faesong and Psywinds

Faesong and the Psywinds are counterparts—two ambient magical forces that flow through all of Alaria:

| Aspect | Faesong | Psywinds |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Source** | Melera's imprisoned song | Collective thoughts of all living beings |
| **Substance** | Pure harmony/emotion | Flowing Ezz carrying thought |
| **Direction** | Flows from Melera outward | Flows between all minds |
| **Perception** | Felt as harmony/dissonance | Heard as whispers/images |
| **Users** | Druids, fae, bards | Telepaths, syncopaths, psy mages |

Some scholars believe Faesong and Psywinds are two aspects of the same phenomenon—that Melera's music *is* what gives Ezz its capacity for carrying thought and emotion. Others argue they are distinct but complementary, like two instruments playing in the same orchestra.

### Melera's Influence

Though imprisoned, Melera's presence is felt wherever Faesong is strong:
- Natural places of great beauty often have stronger Faesong resonance
- Music and art can briefly amplify local Faesong
- The druids believe their groves are places where Melera's song pools
- Some say Melera watches Alaria through the Faesong, hoping that one day someone will rise up and set her free
