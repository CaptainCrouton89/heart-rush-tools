## The School of Summoning

Tags: school, institution, summoning, psy magic

An ancient academy straddling the border between Chechol and the Dalizi city-state of Turbuni, specializing in communion magic, planar contact, and summoning techniques. Founded to study the nearby Pyramid of Five Sides, the School has operated for over two thousand years—long enough to accumulate secrets it no longer remembers, including a corruption it doesn't know it carries.

### Location and Jurisdiction

The School occupies a sprawling campus on a low ridge overlooking Lake Ntsa, with territory claimed by both Chechol and Turbuni. Neither state has ever resolved the jurisdictional dispute, and the School prefers it this way—answering to two masters means effectively answering to neither.

The main campus consists of:
- **The Spire of Calling**: A seven-story tower housing lecture halls, libraries, and the faculty's private quarters
- **The Communion Halls**: Low stone buildings where students practice mental contact techniques
- **The Binding Grounds**: Warded outdoor arenas for summoning exercises
- **The Archives**: Underground vaults containing texts on planar theory, summoning records, and—locked away in the deepest levels—research too dangerous for students

A small town has grown around the School, housing families, merchants, and retired practitioners who couldn't quite leave.

### What They Teach

The School's curriculum centers on three disciplines:

**Communion Magic**

The art of mental contact with other minds—spirits, intelligent creatures, or entities from other planes. Students learn to project their consciousness, establish psychic links, and receive information from distant sources. This is the School's most famous (and most corrupted) discipline.

Advanced communion techniques allow practitioners to contact multiple minds simultaneously, maintain links across vast distances, or receive "inspired" guidance during meditation. These advanced techniques are what Gynor has infiltrated—students believe they're contacting celestial sources, but the guidance they receive passes through Gynor's filter.

**Summoning**

The practical art of calling creatures from other planes and binding them to service. The School teaches careful, structured summoning with extensive safety protocols—wards, binding circles, dismissal contingencies. Students start with minor elementals and work up to more dangerous entities over years of training.

Summoning is dangerous work. The School maintains extensive records of what went wrong and why, used as cautionary teaching material. Every student learns about the Collapse of 2891, when a faculty member attempted to summon something from the Far Realms and had to be stopped by collapsing the building on top of him.

**Planar Theory**

Academic study of the planes, their relationships, and the beings that inhabit them. This is the intellectual foundation for the practical disciplines—understanding *why* summoning works, what communion actually contacts, and how the planar stack fits together.

The School maintains one of the best planar libraries in southern Aboyinzu, including original texts from the scholars who first studied the Pyramid of Five Sides.

### History

**Foundation (~1200 SD)**

Human scholars from the northern states established the School to study the Pyramid of Five Sides—a genuine Celestia gateway they didn't fully understand. Early research focused on documenting what pilgrims experienced and developing techniques to achieve similar states of communion without requiring the Pyramid itself.

These early communion techniques worked. They contacted *something*. The founders assumed they were touching the same celestial source the Pyramid accessed. They weren't—they were developing methods that could contact any sufficiently powerful mind, celestial or otherwise.

**The Golden Age (1300-1700 SD)**

For four centuries, the School thrived as the premier institution for summoning and communion magic in Aboyinzu. Kings consulted School-trained seers. Armies employed School summoners. The faculty grew wealthy and respected.

The arrival of the Rentar (~1600 SD) created new opportunities. Rentar pilgrims sought the Pyramid, but many also studied at the School, integrating its communion techniques into their spiritual practices. The School encouraged this—Rentar made devoted students, and their spiritual discipline produced excellent practitioners.

**Gynor's Tenure and Fall (~1730-1750 SD)**

Gynor arrived as a promising student and quickly demonstrated unusual aptitude for communion magic. He rose through the ranks, eventually joining the faculty. His research into "deep communion"—techniques for more profound mental contact—earned respect and interest.

What the faculty didn't realize was that Gynor had moved beyond contact into *influence*. He'd developed techniques to subtly shape the minds he touched during communion, planting suggestions that felt like the recipient's own thoughts.

When his research was discovered, the faculty moved to expel him. Gynor killed three masters who confronted him—Senior Summoner Valeth, Communion Master Dryn, and Archivist Kellos—and fled with foundational texts on celestial communion. A manhunt failed to find him. The School assumed he died in the highlands.

They were half right. He died. He didn't stay dead.

**The Corrupted Era (1750 SD - present)**

Over the past six centuries, Gynor—now a lich—has slowly corrupted the communion techniques he once helped develop. The corruption is undetectable from inside—practitioners believe they're receiving celestial guidance, but that guidance passes through Gynor's influence.

The School has noticed something is wrong. Psychic anomalies in the local area. Communion sessions that produce unusual resonances. Students who describe visions that don't quite match theoretical expectations. The faculty has investigated repeatedly, but they're looking for external threats—they've never considered that the corruption might be *inside* their techniques, baked into the methods themselves.

### Current Faculty

**Headmaster Tivor Lenn**

A human in his seventies, Tivor has led the School for twenty years. He's a capable administrator and respected summoner, but his communion abilities are limited—he learned the techniques but never excelled at them. This has actually protected him from the worst of Gynor's influence; he rarely practices communion deeply enough to receive corrupted guidance.

Tivor knows something is wrong. The psychic anomalies trouble him. But he's a practical man, and the School continues to function, continues to produce graduates, continues to earn revenue. He's asked investigators to examine the anomalies. He's commissioned research. He hasn't found answers, and he's beginning to wonder if he wants to.

**Communion Master Sethine**

A Rentar elder who oversees communion training. Sethine is deeply corrupted—she practices the School's techniques daily and receives what she believes is celestial guidance constantly. Her certainty, her confidence, her conviction that she knows the right path—all of it is Gynor's work.

Sethine is genuinely kind. She cares about her students. She believes she's teaching them to touch the divine. She has no idea she's passing on a spiritual disease.

**Senior Summoner Herak**

A gruff human responsible for summoning instruction. Herak focuses exclusively on summoning—the practical work of calling and binding—and has little patience for communion "mysticism." This makes him one of the few senior faculty members who isn't corrupted.

Herak has noticed that communion practitioners have gotten... weird. Too confident. Too certain. He's complained about it to Tivor, calling it "theological arrogance." He doesn't know how right he is.

### The Corruption in Practice

A student learning communion at the School goes through this progression:

1. **Basic Training**: Mental exercises, focus techniques, learning to project consciousness. Safe and uncorrupted—these foundational skills don't involve actual contact.

2. **First Contact**: Students learn to touch other minds—spirits, elementals, willing volunteers. Still relatively safe, though Gynor can begin influencing students who show particular aptitude.

3. **Celestial Communion**: The advanced technique, taught to students who demonstrate both skill and "spiritual maturity." This is where the corruption lives. Students learn to open themselves to guidance from what they believe are celestial sources. What they actually contact is Gynor's network of influence.

4. **Deep Communion**: The most advanced level, practiced by faculty and exceptional students. Practitioners report profound spiritual experiences, visions, and unshakeable certainty about their path. They are the most deeply corrupted.

The corruption doesn't feel evil. It feels like faith. Like knowing the right answer. Like peace. That's what makes it so dangerous—there's nothing to resist, because it feels like exactly what communion *should* feel like.

### Player Hooks

**The Investigation**

Headmaster Tivor hires adventurers to investigate the psychic anomalies. He wants answers but fears what they might find. The investigation will eventually lead to the School's own techniques—and the faculty won't want to believe it.

**The Awakening**

A student begins to suspect something is wrong. Their communion experiences don't match what the texts describe. They're having doubts in a community where doubt has become unacceptable. They need outside help before they're "corrected."

**The Archive**

The deepest level of the Archives contains Gynor's original research notes—the texts he couldn't take when he fled. If someone could access them, they might find clues to his methods and vulnerabilities. The problem: the Archives are heavily warded, and Sethine—corrupted—controls access.

**The Emergency**

Gynor has decided to test his control. One morning, every communion-capable practitioner at the School receives the same "divine guidance": eliminate the Headmaster. What happens next depends on whether anyone can break through before Tivor dies.

### Connection to the Pyramid

The School was founded to study the Pyramid of Five Sides, and many students make the pilgrimage there. This creates an interesting dynamic: Pyramid communion is genuine and uncorrupted, while School communion is Gynor's trap.

Students who experience both often notice differences. Pyramid visions are stranger, more ambiguous, harder to interpret. School communion feels clearer, more direct, more *useful*. Most students conclude that the Pyramid is the raw, ancient form, while the School's techniques are the refined, practical version.

They have it backwards. The Pyramid's difficulty is authenticity. The School's clarity is corruption.

A handful of Pyramid-focused practitioners—the Keepers of the Fifth Face and their allies—have begun to suspect this. They've noticed that School-trained practitioners don't seem to receive the same guidance they do. They've attributed this to spiritual pride or insufficient devotion. They haven't considered that the School might be channeling something other than celestial truth.

If someone could connect these observations—show the Pyramid Keepers that the discrepancy isn't about devotion but about *source*—the resistance might begin.
