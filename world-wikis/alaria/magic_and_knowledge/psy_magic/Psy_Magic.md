## Psy Magic

Tags: magic

Psy magic harnesses the **Psywinds**—the ever-present, swirling mass of thoughts of all life within the planar stack. It is the counterpart to Faesong, and together they represent the two great ambient magical forces in Alaria.

### The Psywinds

The Psywinds are currents of flowing Ezz that carry the collective thoughts, ideas, and intentions of all living beings across Alaria. They are what allows telepathic creatures to communicate, syncopaths to function, and prayers to be heard from Celestia. You can hear your true name no matter where it is spoken on Alaria because it ripples through the Psywinds.

Where **Faesong** carries emotion and harmony (flowing from Melera outward), the **Psywinds** carry thought and intention (flowing between all minds). They are the cognitive substrate of Alaria—the medium through which minds can touch.

### Nature of Psy Magic

Psy magic works by tapping into the Psywinds directly, either reading what flows through them or adding one's own thoughts to their currents. Unlike Kethic magic (which channels emotion through elemental expression) or Deoric (which commands reality through absolute language), psy magic operates on the realm of pure thought and will.

Psy mages do not impose their will on the physical world directly. Instead, they:
- Read thoughts and memories from the Psywind currents
- Project their own thoughts into other minds
- Sense disturbances and intentions at a distance
- Manipulate the perceptions of others by altering what the Psywinds carry to them

### Who Practices Psy Magic

**Syncopaths** are naturally attuned to the Psywinds. They perceive the currents of thought constantly, which can be overwhelming but grants them powerful telepathic abilities.

**Telepaths** of various races have learned to tap the Psywinds for communication and sensing. Some are born with the gift; others train for years to develop even basic sensitivity.

**Certain religious orders** teach psy magic as a means of communion—sensing the prayers of the faithful or projecting blessings across distances.

**The daemons of Celestia** rely on the Psywinds to hear prayers and maintain connection with their followers. This is how they know when their true name is spoken.

### Learning Psy Magic

Psy magic can be learned, but it requires:
1. **Sensitivity training** - Learning to quiet one's own thoughts enough to perceive the Psywinds
2. **Filtering** - The Psywinds carry the thoughts of billions of beings; learning to focus on relevant currents without going mad is essential
3. **Projection** - Adding one's own thoughts to the currents with enough force and clarity to be received

Some are born with natural sensitivity; for them, training focuses on control. Others must develop sensitivity through meditation, sensory deprivation, or exposure to places where the Psywinds run strong.

### Psywinds and Faesong

| Aspect | Psywinds | Faesong |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Source** | Collective thoughts of all living beings | Melera's imprisoned song |
| **Substance** | Flowing Ezz carrying thought | Pure harmony/emotion |
| **Direction** | Flows between all minds | Flows from Melera outward |
| **Perception** | Heard as whispers/images | Felt as harmony/dissonance |
| **Users** | Telepaths, syncopaths, psy mages | Druids, fae, bards |

Some scholars believe Faesong and Psywinds are two aspects of the same phenomenon—that Melera's music is what gives Ezz its capacity for carrying thought and emotion. Others argue they are distinct but complementary, like two instruments playing in the same orchestra.

### Dangers

The Psywinds are not a safe medium:
- **Overexposure** can drive psy mages mad—hearing the thoughts of thousands at once shatters the mind
- **Predators** hunt through the Psywinds, seeking vulnerable minds to infiltrate
- **Echoes of the dead** sometimes persist in the currents, ghostly thought-fragments that can overwhelm the unwary
- **Intentional attacks** can be launched through the Psywinds by those skilled enough—psychic assaults that bypass physical defenses entirely
