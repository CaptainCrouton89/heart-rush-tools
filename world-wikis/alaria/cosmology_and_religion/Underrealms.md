## Underrealms

Tags: region, planes

The Underrealms is the overarching name for all of the underground beneath the upper surface of the Material Plane. Near the upper layers of the Underrealms lie dwarves and other moderately civilized creatures. As you travel deeper, you uncover more and more horrific creatures. 

200 miles of earth below the surface. Filled with all manners of creatures and beasts.

Near the bottom of the underrealms is the Dwexes River—a circular river that spans the width of Alaria.
