## Stars, Suns, and Moons

Tags: cosmology, celestial

### Stars

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Lives and maintains the star that is the sun, propelled by Bryn across the sky each day. Immune to the extreme heat from the sun.

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

### Suns

There are three suns within Alaria, each over a different layer of the planar stack.

#### Aurus, the White Sun

Aurus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, up above the Astral Plane.

What the soul is made of.

Very slowly bobs around the sky above the Astral Plane. Its positive energy makes material plane warmer or cooler.

#### Nydus, the Black Sun

Nydus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. He became the Black Sun, up above Malstaris.

The black sun that illuminates all of malstaris. Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely illuminates one's shadow. Many things lie hidden in the dark.

What one's shadow is made of.

Slowly bobs around the sky, causing cold temperatures to spike around the Material Plane.
