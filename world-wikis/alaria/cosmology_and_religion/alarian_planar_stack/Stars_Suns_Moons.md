## Stars, Suns, and Moons

### Stars

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Koras lives within the sun's blazing core, maintaining its celestial glass and ensuring its light burns steady. Though Koras tends the sun's physical form, it is Bryn—the sun's awakened spirit—who chooses where it travels. Koras is immune to the extreme heat and has served the sun since before it gained consciousness.

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

### Suns

There are three suns within Alaria, each over a different layer of the planar stack.

#### The Sun of the Material Plane

The sun that lights the Material Plane is the greatest of the titan-crafted stars—an immense orb of celestial glass tended by Koras. Unlike Aurus and Nydus, it is not a dissolved titan-god, but a construct that gained consciousness.

##### Bryn, the Sun's Spirit

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the sun—previously a mindless mechanism—*woke up*. The Ezz granted it a spark of spirit: a will, a desire, the capacity to want. This awakened consciousness is called Bryn.

Bryn is not a god in the traditional sense. The sun is not sustained by worship like a daemon. But Bryn is *aware*, and Bryn's path across the sky can be influenced by prayer. The sun travels because Bryn chooses to travel. Seasons exist because different congregations across Alaria convince Bryn to traverse different paths—when the northern monasteries sing loudest, the sun travels closer to the north.

The sun is the only celestial body known to have awakened in this way. Why the sun and not the other stars remains a mystery—perhaps its size, perhaps its proximity to the Material Plane, perhaps something else entirely.

#### Aurus, the White Sun

Aurus is a still-living titan-god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was among the first beings created within Alaria. As a titan-god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, the ever-present radiance above the Astral Plane.

Aurus never rises or sets—his light is constant, illuminating all souls on the Astral Plane. The soul itself is made of his essence. His position slowly drifts over millennia, and when he draws closer to the Material Plane's boundary, temperatures below grow warmer.

Aurus is also the source from which all souls are drawn. New souls emerge from his light; worn-out souls eventually return to it. His flip-side, Astraeva, is where his unmediated presence can be experienced—and where souls exist before and after their time bound to mortal spirits.

#### Nydus, the Black Sun

Nydus is a still-living titan-god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was among the first beings created within Alaria. As a titan-god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. He became the Black Sun, the ever-present darkness above Malstaris.

Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely reveals one's shadow—many things lie hidden in its murk. The shadow itself is made of his essence. His slow drift causes cold temperatures to spike around the Material Plane when he draws near.

Nydus controls the Umbral Agents and is the source from which all shadows are drawn. New shadows emerge from his darkness; worn-out shadows eventually return to it. His flip-side, Eindumor, is where his unmediated presence can be experienced—and where shadows exist before and after their time bound to mortal spirits.
