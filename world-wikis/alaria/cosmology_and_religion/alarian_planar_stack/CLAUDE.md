# Alarian Planar Stack

Documents the cosmological structure, celestial bodies, and planar layers of Alaria.

## Content Organization

- **Stars_Suns_Moons.md** - Celestial bodies (three suns, two moons, stars), Starborn caretakers, and astronomical phenomena
- **Time_and_Seasons.md** - Calendar systems (11-day week, 25,300-year Great Cycle), seasons, and cultural celebrations
- **planes/** - Individual planar layer documentation (14 planes including Material, Astral, Ethereal, Elemental, Hells, Celestial, and more)

## Key Cosmological Concepts

**Three Suns**: Each illuminates a different planar layer—Bryn (Material Plane, awakened consciousness), Aurus (Astral Plane, white titan-god), Nydus (Malstaris, black titan-god).

**Great Cycle**: A 25,300-year calendar repeating forward then backward. Marks ages when solstices align with double full/new moons.

**Planar Stack**: Vertical cosmology with Material Plane at center, flanked by Ethereal/Nethereal overlays, topped by Astral/Celestial realms, and bottomed by shadow and elemental planes.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Planar Hierarchy**: Document planes' position relative to Material Plane and connection to suns/moons
- **Celestial-Planar Links**: Connect astronomical phenomena (sun movement, lunar cycles) to planar mechanics and divine influence
- **Calendar Mechanics**: Keep temporal systems consistent—lunar weeks, seasonal cycles, and Great Cycle alignments
- **Cosmological Consistency**: Maintain alignment with established religion, daemons, and magic systems
- **Consciousness & Spirit**: Honor that Bryn (the sun) is awakened—explain how prayers influence its path and create seasons

## Compilation Notes

Content here feeds the cosmology section of the world wiki. Cross-reference to deity/daemon files and magical systems for interconnected worldbuilding context.
