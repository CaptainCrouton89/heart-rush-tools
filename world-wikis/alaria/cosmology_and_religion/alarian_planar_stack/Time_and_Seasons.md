## Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

The sun passes around the center strip of the sky every day, all year. Alaria has no axial tilt.

Two moons—Auris and Nyxara—pass over at various times throughout their cycles. A third moon once existed but was lost; its absence is remembered in the name "Killing Moon," given to the catastrophic destabilization periods that occur every several thousand years.

Seasons come and go when followers convince Bryn to traverse a different trail across Alaria. When the northern monasteries sing loudest, summer comes to the north; when the southern congregations raise their voices, warmth travels south.

Stars are viewports for the gods. Daemons can look down through them upon their subjects. Stars are usually located above places of importance to the daemon who claims them.

### The Calendar

**Moon cycles:** Auris has an 11-day cycle that marks the week, beginning at new moon and reaching full moon mid-week. Nyxara has a 23-day cycle, meaning roughly once every year there is one double full moon (Brightnight) and one double new moon (Hollownight)—both important holidays.

**The year:** 200 days long, split into eight 25-day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice. Two quarters each of spring, summer, fall, and winter. The hemispheres experience opposite seasons, but the solstice marks new year for all.

**The Great Cycle:** When the solstice coincides with Brightnight or Hollownight, it signals the beginning of a new age. This occurs once every 25,300 years (~14,000 Earth years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years when various lunar alignments fall on significant dates.

**Year counting:** Years are counted forward from 0 to 25,300, then back down again. The suffix F or B indicates whether time is moving forward or backward through the Great Cycle. At year 0, Hollownight falls on the northern summer solstice. At year 25,300, Brightnight falls on new year. Each marks the beginning of a new age.

### Lunar and Solar Celebrations

The moons aligning represents the cycle of magic; the solstice represents the cycle of nature.

**Lunar cultures:** Moon elves and other peoples who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on Brightnight, the monthly rhythms of Nyxara, and the weekly tide of Auris.

**Solar cultures:** Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to magic and more connected to nature. Major celebrations fall on the first day of spring, the solstice/new year, the last week of fall, and the opposite solstice. Winter celebrations are especially important—cheerfulness held against the cold and dark.

Both lunar and solar holidays are observed by most cultures, though the emphasis varies.

### The 11-Day Week

The week follows Auris's cycle, beginning at new moon:

1. **Cautious** (new moon): Stay indoors after dark. The week's most dangerous night.
2. **Wakeday** (waxing crescent): Made it through Cautious. Safe to emerge.
3. **Patrons' Day**: Give thanks to your daemon.
4. **Moil**: A day of work.
5. **Marketday**: Trading and commerce.
6. **Merrynight** (full moon): Auris at its brightest. Stay up late, celebrate.
7. **Brightlove**: The glow continues. A day for joy and connection.
8. **Lazyday**: Rest.
9. **Farewell**: Travelers depart to reach home before Cautious.
10. **Gather**: Prepare supplies and close up for the dark nights ahead.
11. **Fireday** (waning crescent): Burn candles through the night. The last light before darkness.
