### Origin

Celestia's creation required two events separated by 115 million years.

During the Lyzaria Era (235–180 million years ago), the titan-god **Celest** sacrificed herself to create a pocket dimension—a protected space outside the conflict between her brothers Aurus and Nydus. This seed of Celestia served as a refuge where those who died could persist, a source of power the titans of the Material Plane could draw upon. As a titan-god, Celest could not truly die, only transform—and her essence became the core of this dimension.

For 115 million years, this seed remained small and hidden, accessible only through death. Then came the **Ezz Rift** (120 million years ago). When Melera's music fractured the Alarian Planar Stack and Ezz flooded in, it accumulated around Celestia because it was the only structure in Alaria that resonated with her song. The pocket dimension bloomed into a full plane, peeling away from the Material Plane to become its mirror-image flip side.

This dual origin explains Celestia's strange nature: its *core* is Celest's essence (which is why it serves as a refuge for spirits), but its *substance* is made of Ezz (which is why it reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the living). The titan-god created the vessel; Melera's music filled it.

### Nature

Celestia is the home of daemons. It is a reflection of the world but lacking any of the typical life that exists in the material realm. The plane is shaped by the thoughts and beliefs of the living—the world as mortals *understand* it, not as it physically is. Where there is thought on the Material Plane, there is a counterpart in Celestia.

Since the plane is shaped by belief rather than physical law, it cannot be directly altered by those within it. Daemons who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celestia.

### Spirits in Celestia

Spirits arrive here upon death, after their soul rises to the Astral Plane and their shadow sinks to Malstaris. Unlike souls and shadows, which cycle through cosmic reservoirs to be renewed, spirits in Celestia face a different fate.

While in Celestia, you have no body—only a spirit—and cannot die by any means except Ezz-forged weapons, which sever your will from your spirit. Survival depends entirely on the prayers of those who knew your true name. Upon death, your spirit fades to Celestia, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

**When a spirit is forgotten, it does not return to some cosmic source. It simply ends.** The spirit—the part of you that was *you*, your free will and personality—ceases to exist entirely. Souls cycle through Aurus. Shadows cycle through Nydus. But spirits made of Ezz have no such reservoir. The self that made you distinct is *gone*, irrevocably, forever. This is the true finality of death in Alaria: not the separation of soul and shadow, but the eventual forgetting that ends the spirit.

Some spirits, however, remain remembered. Those who know Deoric and gather enough worshippers become capable of affecting the material realm. These beings are called **daemons**, and they may be worshipped as gods.

### Travel to Celestia

Willingly going to Celestia requires leaving your shadow and soul behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your spirit, making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

### Magic in Celestia

Deoric does not function on Celestia due to Ezzic interference—the Ezz that fills the plane disrupts the absolute commands of Deoric speech. However, many Deoric masters reside in Celestia. They cannot cast directly within the plane, but they can project their knowledge and power across the boundary, channeling Deoric through their followers on the Material Plane. This is how daemons grant miracles: the worshipper provides the ritual and sacrifice on the Material side, and the daemon provides the Deoric knowledge and guidance from Celestia.
