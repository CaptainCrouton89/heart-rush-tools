## Astraeva

Tags: plane, cosmology, soul, Aurus

Astraeva is the flip side of the Astral Plane—but unlike other planar flip-sides, it is not truly a "place" in the conventional sense. Astraeva is **Aurus himself**, unfiltered and unmediated.

### Nature

The Astral Plane is Aurus's light filtered through structure: the floating islands, the Astral Sea, the accumulated souls that buffer his brilliant radiance. Astraeva is what remains when those buffers are stripped away—the raw, direct presence of the White Sun.

To enter Astraeva is to stand within the source of all souls. There are no islands here, no sea, no landmarks. Only light—warm, vast, and terrifyingly welcoming.

### The Cosmic Reservoir

Astraeva serves a fundamental role in the cycle of life and death:

**Origin of Souls**: When a new creature is conceived anywhere in Alaria, a soul is drawn from Astraeva. This raw Aurus-essence passes through the Astral Plane, threads down through the Ethereal Plane, and binds with the newly formed spirit. Every living creature's soul was once part of this undifferentiated light.

**Return of Souls**: When creatures die, their souls rise to the Astral Plane, where they persist for a time—sometimes centuries, sometimes millennia, depending on how they are remembered. But souls do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn souls—those that have cycled through many lives, or those that are utterly forgotten—drift back through to Astraeva. They dissolve into Aurus's light, losing their individual definition, becoming raw essence once more. In time, they may be drawn forth again as new souls, with no memory of what they were before.

### The Danger

Traveling to Astraeva is not merely dangerous—it is existentially threatening. Your soul is not a separate thing here; it is *part* of Aurus, and the boundary between self and source grows terrifyingly thin.

Visitors report:
- Their sense of self beginning to blur
- Memories feeling shared with countless other beings
- Identity becoming negotiable, optional, easily shed
- A profound sense of peace that makes returning seem pointless

Stay too long, and your soul may simply rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. Your body might continue breathing somewhere else, soulless and empty. But the *you* that made you distinct would become part of everything, and therefore nothing in particular. You would be *completed*—and completion, in this context, means the end of individual existence.

### What Exists There

Astraeva is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain definition under Aurus's unfiltered light. What few beings exist are:

- **Echoes of Aurus's will**: Not separate creatures, but expressions of the titan-god's vast, slow thoughts given momentary shape
- **Pre-birth souls**: The formless potential of souls waiting to be drawn into new lives—not conscious, but *present*, hungry to become
- **The Completed**: Rare cases where a being's soul returned to source but left behind some fragment, some echo, that persists as a memory of a memory

Some scholars theorize that if you could communicate with the pre-birth souls of Astraeva, you might learn what you were in previous lives—or what you will become in future ones. But no method of communication has ever succeeded without the questioner losing themselves in the attempt.

### Reaching Astraeva

Like all planar flip-sides, Astraeva is reached by traveling to the edge of the Astral Plane and continuing past the boundary. But the Astral Plane's "edges" are not clearly defined—the islands simply become sparser, the light brighter, until at some point you realize you have crossed over.

The transition is gradual, which makes it dangerous. Many who enter Astraeva do not realize they have done so until it is too late to return unchanged.
