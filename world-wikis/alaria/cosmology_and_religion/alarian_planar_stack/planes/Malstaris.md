## Malstaris

Tags: plane

Malstaric Rivers go through the land, which can sweep your shadow away.

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate Malstaris. There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in Malstaris, and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

Malstaris is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in Malstaris can cause strange interactions, as your soul is so far away, and your shadow so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made Malstaris their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids.

High above Malstaris is Nydus, the Black Sun, spilling heavy darkness across the land.

### The First Dark

When Lyzaria, the first titan to die, was split apart 235 million years ago, her soul rose to the Astral Plane—but her shadow sank here, to Malstaris. As the first shadow to ever enter this plane, she carried with her the first secret Malstaris had ever known: the secret of what death *is*.

That shadow became the entity known as **The First Dark**—the oldest and most powerful of the Shadow Lords. Unlike other shadows in Malstaris, which are echoes or remnants of the living, The First Dark is something closer to a titan in nature: ancient, vast, and terribly aware.

The First Dark rules a region of Malstaris that no other power dares challenge. Even Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, does not extend his authority into her domain. What occurs there is unknown—shadows that enter do not return, or return changed in ways they cannot explain.

Some scholars believe The First Dark still longs for reunion with her other half—the Dreaming of Lyzaria in the Astral Sea. They claim the strange currents between the planes, the ways shadows sometimes seem to reach for light, are echoes of her attempt to become whole. Others believe the separation has driven her to something darker: if she cannot reunite with herself, perhaps she will find other ways to bridge the gap between soul and shadow.
