## Psywinds

Tags: cosmology, magic

The flow of all thoughts, ideas, and emotions across Alaria. The Psywinds are currents of flowing Ezz that carry the collective mental activity of all living beings within the planar stack. These thoughts pass through all, connecting mind to mind across any distance.

### What the Psywinds Enable

- **Telepathic communication** between creatures attuned to the currents
- **Syncopaths** perceive and manipulate the Psywinds constantly
- **Prayers** can be heard from Celestia through the Psywinds—this is how daemons know when their followers call
- **True names** ripple through the Psywinds; you can hear your true name no matter where it is spoken on Alaria
- **Psy magic** draws power directly from these currents

### Substance

The Psywinds are made of flowing Ezz—the universal substrate that contains both Azus's order and Melera's randomness. After the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the Psywinds became the medium through which spirit-bearing creatures could think, feel, and connect.

### Counterpart: Faesong

The Psywinds and Faesong are the two great ambient magical forces in Alaria:

- **Psywinds** carry *thought* and *intention*—they flow between all minds, generated by the collective mental activity of living beings
- **Faesong** carries *emotion* and *harmony*—it flows from Melera outward, a constant melody underlying all creation

Where the Psywinds are heard as whispers and images, Faesong is felt as harmony or dissonance. Telepaths and psy mages work the Psywinds; druids and fae creatures attune to Faesong.

Some scholars believe these are two aspects of the same phenomenon—that Melera's music is what gives Ezz its capacity for carrying thought and emotion. Others argue they are distinct but complementary, like two instruments in the same orchestra.

### The Psywinds and Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent substrate through which the Psywinds flow. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform psy magic.
