## Planar Stacks

Tags: cosmology

A planar stack is a collection of tightly grouped planes, usually holding strong connections to each other. 

A planar stack consists of a series of planes, clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, magic, and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a planar stack, to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.

### Major Planar Stacks

#### Alaria
The primary focus of this almanac.

#### Epyphiozath
Little is known about Epyphiozath, other than it is a major planar stack existing elsewhere in the cosmos.

#### Instruxofinum
Instruxofinum consists of billions of planes jammed tightly together, nearly perfectly frozen in time. Almost anything can be found there with enough searching.

### Other Known Stacks

#### Glyssen
Glyssen is a spherical ocean of whispers and insanity. Aberrant creatures roam across both the currents and time itself. No one has returned with their sanity intact.

#### Klokas
Klokas is a vast void of empty space filled with huge demonic creatures floating through the skies. 

#### Narglon
Completely dark, nothing can be seen in Narglon. Those who have returned have come back infected with the darkness itself. Like a horrible, infective liquid of nothingness.
