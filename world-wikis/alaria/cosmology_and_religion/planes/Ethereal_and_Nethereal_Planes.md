## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Tags: plane

The Ethereal and Nethereal planes are two thin planes that overlay all other planes within Alaria. They are counterparts to one another.

### Ethereal Plane

Within the Ethereal Plane, echoes of events from the Material Plane linger as ethereal imprints. Skilled individuals can access these echoes to witness glimpses of the past or gain insights into the future, creating a unique form of divination.

### Nethereal Plane

The Nethereal Plane is the counterpart to the Ethereal Plane. Just like the Ethereal Plane, it contains echoes of events from the Material Plane, but often of a darker or more obscure nature. Skilled individuals can access these echoes to witness glimpses of the past or gain insights into the future.
