### Islander

Spoken in Urok as well as all of the West Isles and Mueras. Also spoken in Roule and the northwestern regions of Upoceax. 

### Orcish

Orcish is spoken by the orcs of northwestern Clueanda. 

### Gorathi

Gorathi is spoken primarily by natives of Gorath, but as Gorath grows, so does the influence of its langauge.

### Ylindian

Ylindian is spoken by much of Upoceax, the Free Isles, and western Aboyuinzu. 

### Minor Languages

### Elven

Many of the elves still speak their own dialects of Elven, which stemmed from Druidic. Most elves can roughly understand each other when speaking in their native elven tongue, if they have one.

### Dwarven

Unlike elven, dwarven tongues have mostly died out, as the dwarves pick up the languages of their neighboring trade partners. However, some locations still exist where various dialects of dwarven are still spoken.

### Countries of Aboyuinzu

Many of the countries here speak different langauges, that are only spoken within their country.

### Tribal States

Most tribal states speak languages that are only native to that region. 

### Deoric: The Language of Absolutes

Deoric was once spoken by the titans who long ago inhabited Alaria. It is the language of absolutes—things spoken in Deoric *must* occur, if there is power behind the words. Now, however, it is used by dark mages to perform powerful magic. The language is extremely complex, and takes centuries to learn, but unlocks great power.

This power comes from spiritual sacrifice, usually by killing a sentient creature and performing a ritual.
