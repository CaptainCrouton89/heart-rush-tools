## Planar Stack

Tags: cosmology

A planar stack is a collection of tightly grouped planes, usually holding strong connections to each other. 

A planar stack consists of a series of planes, clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, magic, and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a planar stack, to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.

### Major Planar Stacks

- Alaria
- Epyphiozath
- Instruxofinum

### Glyssen

Glyssen is a spherical ocean of whispers and insanity. Aberrant creatures roam across both the currents and time itself. No one has returned with their sanity intact.

### Klokas

Klokas is a vast void of empty space filled with huge demonic creatures floating through the skies. 

### Narglon

Completely dark, nothing can be seen in Narglon. Those who have returned have come back infected with the darkness itself. Like a horrible, infective liquid of nothingness.
