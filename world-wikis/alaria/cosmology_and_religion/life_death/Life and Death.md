## Life and Death

Tags: cosmology

A creature’s life is dictated by the health and union of their soul, shadow, and spirit. At the center of their being is their spirit, which is the spark of free will and personality that defines who they are. Wrapped on either side are the soul and shadow, the astral and malstaric counterbalances of the spirit, which together give life and movement to the spirit they are bound to. While still critical to life, they do not define who the person is.

#### The Soul

The soul is made of pure positive energy from Aurus, the White Sun. A long, faint strand of it stretches all the way back to the sun. It was created by Aurus. Only Alarian creatures are energized with a soul.

#### The Shadow

The shadow is made of pure negative energy from Nydus, the Black Sun. A long, faint strand of it stretches all the way back to the sun. It was created by Nydus. Only Alarian creatures are energized with a shadow.

#### The Spirit

One's spirit is made of pure ezz, pulled from the swirling mass throughout the planes. Living things with both thought and emotion all have some spirit-like core consisting mainly of ezz. Life-like things from other planar stacks may not have emotion, and will be "powered" by something other than a soul and shadow. For example, some life on other planar stacks is powered with Aether.

### Astral & Malstaric Thread

Binding the soul and shadow to the spirit is a creature's astral and malstaric thread. These threads are not metaphors—they are literal strands of binding energy that run through the Ethereal and Nethereal planes respectively.

- **Astral threads** pass through the Ethereal Plane, connecting spirits (in the Material Plane) to souls (in the Astral Plane).
- **Malstaric threads** pass through the Nethereal Plane, connecting spirits to shadows (in Malstaris).

If these threads are broken, the creature dies, and their newly freed soul and shadow float up and sink down to the Astral Plane and Malstaris respectively, while their spirit fades to Celestia.

### The Asymmetry of Death

The fates of soul, shadow, and spirit after death are fundamentally different:

**Souls** rise to the Astral Plane, where they persist for a time—sometimes centuries, sometimes millennia. Eventually, they drift back through to Astraeva, dissolving into Aurus's light to become raw essence once more. In time, they are drawn forth again as new souls for new lives. Souls *cycle*.

**Shadows** sink to Malstaris, where they persist for a time—particularly if they carry deep secrets. Eventually, they drift back through to Eindumor, dissolving into Nydus's darkness to become raw essence once more. In time, they are drawn forth again as new shadows for new lives. Shadows *cycle*.

**Spirits** fade to Celestia, where they persist only as long as their true name is remembered. When the last being who knew that name forgets it, the spirit *ends*. There is no Ezz reservoir, no cosmic return and renewal. The self—the personality, the free will, the *you* that made you distinct—simply ceases to exist. This is the true finality of death in Alaria.

This asymmetry matters. Your soul and shadow are borrowed cosmic essence—they were never truly "yours" to begin with, and they will go on to be part of countless other lives. But your spirit is *you*. When it is forgotten, you are gone. The universe continues with new souls and shadows drawn from the same sources, but the person you were will never exist again.

If the thread is not broken but still damaged, it can nevertheless have serious effects on the life of that being. It can make one weaker to effects that would dominate one's spirit, and having part of the thread break completely could cause your soul or shadow to leave completely, sapping one of most of their life and energy.

If a creature is missing its soul or shadow, its defenses against Deoric magic are drastically weakened, making it susceptible to death, mind control, or anything else the caster desires.

### Thread Magic

Those who work with the threads directly access the overlay planes:

- **Healers** who mend astral threads work through the Ethereal Plane, which is why soul-healing magic often feels luminous and clarifying.
- **Necromancers** who sever or manipulate malstaric threads work through the Nethereal Plane, which is why death magic feels cold and invasive—it is literally reaching into the substrate that holds a person together.
- **Diviners** perceive the vibrations that significant events send through the vast web of threads. The echoes of the past and the nascent tensions of the future are both readable in the thread-substrate.

### Beings In Between

Various names are given to the creatures with different combinations of soul, shadow, and spirit. 

- Revenants
- Ghosts
- Shades
- Undead
- Specters
- Liches
