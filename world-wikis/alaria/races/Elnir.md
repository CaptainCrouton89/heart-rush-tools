## Elnir

The Elnir were once druids who protected the wilds, but they have been corrupted by dark magic and a desire to *control* nature rather than serve it. Now, they are terrifying "mad scientists" of the natural world, splicing animals together and warping plants into rigid, unnatural shapes.

They view humanoids as mere biological clay to be molded. An Elnir might have the arm of a bear, the eyes of a hawk, or skin of bark, all grafted or grown through their twisted magic. They reside in deep forests where the trees grow in perfect, terrifying grids, and animals with too many legs or wrong numbers of eyes serve as their guardians.
