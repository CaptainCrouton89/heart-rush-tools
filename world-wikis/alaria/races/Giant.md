## Giant

Giants are huge, lumbering humanoids of limited intelligence but terrifying strength. They are divided into two main groups: Hill Giants and Gorgers.

**Hill Giants** are sedentary, living in sparsely populated communities where they herd massive sheep and throw boulders at intruders. They are territorial but can be reasoned with if one speaks their simple language and brings enough food.

**Gorgers** are nomadic scavengers, massive engines of consumption that roam the land eating everything in their path—entire herds of cattle, trees, and unlucky travelers. They are universally feared and reviled.

### Massive Strength

**Passive ability.**
Your strength is legendary. You can wield heavy weapons in one hand without penalty. Your unarmed attacks deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage and can affect structures. You have A2 on all might checks involving lifting, throwing, or breaking objects. When you hit a creature smaller than you with a melee attack, you can push them 10 feet in any direction.

### Tough Skin

**Passive ability.**
Your skin is like leather armor. You have +2 to all defense rolls against physical attacks. The damage threshold for taking wounds increases by 2 for you (you take wounds from 12+ damage instead of 10+).
