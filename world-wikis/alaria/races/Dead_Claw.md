## Dead Claw

The Dead Claw are a race of feline warriors residing in the mountainous region of Phaer Hom. They possess cat-like agility, retractable claws, and fur whose color determines their physical traits and social standing. Known for their ritual scarring and silent demeanor, they are the ultimate stalkers of the high peaks.

Legend says the Dead Claw possess nine lives, making them fearless in battle. They never cut their whiskers, which serve as sensitive sensory organs that can detect the slightest air currents. Their culture is one of quiet lethality, where a threat is rarely spoken but simply acted upon. Dead Claw society is organized into Prides, each led by a Pridekeeper whose word is law.

### Nine Lives

**Major ability.**
Death is not the end for you. When you would die, you may instead survive with 1 HP. You can use this ability a number of times equal to 9 minus the number of times you have already used it in your lifetime. Each use permanently reduces your maximum HP by 5. When you use this ability, you are stunned until the start of your next turn as your body miraculously knits itself back together.

### Whisker Sense

**Passive ability.**
Your whiskers can detect the slightest change in air pressure. You cannot be surprised, and you can navigate and fight effectively even in total darkness or when blinded. You have blindsight out to 10 feet. You have A2 on perception checks to detect hidden creatures or ambushes.
