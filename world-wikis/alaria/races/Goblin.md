## Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all raised together, with no knowledge of their specific mother. The brood-father, over the course of his lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen, who will mother the next brood-father—the first born son.

Most goblins live in communities around a single goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and friends are one's half-siblings. This can lead to bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict. Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Small
- **Height:** 2.5-3.5 feet
- **Weight:** 40-100 pounds

### Cooperative

**Passive ability.**
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or take the help action in combat, you provide two levels of advantage rather than one, and they may add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin, they gain three levels of advantage instead.

### Scalawag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature. They are viewed more as pests than as people by many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat similar to that of ants. However; living among Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are born into enormous broods, and are expected to defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will spend most of their lives doing just that, along with anything else they feel like doing. Besides the general wellbeing of the community, though, scalawags have few other obligations, and will sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.

Scalawag can be found across the mountains and scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are known for their incredible performers, parties, and oddly enough, philosophers.

#### Aspects

- Emotionally turbulent
- Impulsive and improvisational

#### Ankle biter

**Passive ability.**
Rules for moving through and climbing on creatures larger than yourself apply even if the creature is only one size larger than you. You have advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same space as a hostile creatures provides one level of cover from attacks from all other creatures.

### Etherweaver

Etherweavers get their name for their longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every goblin is born with an attunement to one of those elements.

Etherweavers are generally more reserved and cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value preparation, and are usually more conscientious, even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at protecting their broods using magic, and therefore require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a greater sense of individuality among the etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.

The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.

#### Aspects

- Level-headed
- Reflective and thoughtful

#### Etherweaver

**Passive ability.**
Choose and gain two attunements from the following list:

- Time
- Void
- Force
- Light
- Dark

### Coghead

The Cogheads are ingenious goblins who have embraced the marriage of flesh and machinery. Living within a massive hollowed-out machine in Kobuk, they have spent generations perfecting the art of mechanical augmentation, replacing or enhancing their natural body parts with intricate contraptions and gear-driven devices.

These goblins harbor a particular hatred for the Echean gnomes, viewing them as inferior tinkerers who lack the courage to truly commit to their craft. Where gnomes merely build external devices, Cogheads integrate machinery directly into their bodies, becoming living testaments to their engineering prowess.

#### Aspects

- Flesh is weakness, gears are strength
- Gnomes are inferior tinkerers

#### Tinkerer

**Passive ability.**
Through tinkering and contraption building, you have found a way to improve on your body's natural features. Choose one of the following modifications:

- **Spectacles:** Multi-lens glasses with infrared vision (90 feet), light inversion, and telescopic capabilities (10x magnification).
- **Rocket Boots:** Aether-powered boots that increase move speed by 10 feet and allow jumping 10 feet with 50-foot glide speed.
- **Multi-tool:** Replaced arm containing circular saw, knives, pliers, wrenches, torch, and lock picks. Grants advantage on tool-related skill checks.

You may spend 4 XP to gain additional modifications from this list.

### Darkling

The Darklings are pitch-black goblins who dwell in the shadowy realm of Lethos, their skin so dark it seems to absorb light itself. These unsettling creatures have adapted to perpetual darkness, subsisting on a diet of rodents and bats while developing an unnatural mastery over shadow itself.

Unlike other goblins, Darklings are genuinely frightening, their darkness attunement creating impenetrable shadows that only they can see through. They move like living nightmares through their underground lairs, and those who encounter them in the dark rarely live to tell the tale.

#### Aspects

- Child of eternal darkness
- Predator in the shadows

#### Umbral Mastery

**Passive ability.**
You have an advanced attunement to darkness. Darkness you create cannot be seen through by any creature except other Darklings, and cannot be dispelled except by magical light. You have darkvision out to 120 feet and can see perfectly in any darkness, magical or natural.

### Rudding

The Ruddings are small, mysterious goblins with beady red eyes who inhabit the otherworldly copper and brick temples of the Copper Hills. These enigmatic creatures are driven by an unrelenting sense of justice and vengeance, carefully tracking every slight and wrong committed against them or their kin.

Despite their vengeful nature, Ruddings are remarkably skilled Deoric enchanters who have domesticated the massive Desert Mammoths. They will pursue slow, methodical revenge against wrongdoers unless proper reparations are offered in the form of copper or copper jewelry, which they prize above all else.

#### Aspects

- Vengeance delayed is vengeance perfected
- Copper is the currency of justice

#### Blood Debt

**Passive ability.**
When a creature deals damage to you or you perceive them as having wronged you, you may mark them for vengeance as an action. You always know the general direction and distance to marked creatures within 10 miles. You have advantage on all attack rolls and skill checks made against marked creatures.

### Blitzling

The Blitzlings possess the strange and dangerous property of accumulating massive amounts of static electricity in their bodies before discharging it all at once in devastating electrical bursts. These energetic goblins inhabit the chain of hills south of the Dunes of Kunagi, in the settlement of Shyalaviin.

Their unique physiology makes them both fascinating and hazardous to be around, as they constantly crackle with barely contained electrical energy. When threatened or excited, they can release this stored power in spectacular and deadly displays.

#### Aspects

- Living lightning rod
- Electricity courses through me

#### Static Discharge

**Passive ability.**
You accumulate static charge throughout combat. At the start of each round, gain 1 charge point (maximum 3). As an action, you may discharge all stored charge, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per charge point to all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures wearing metal armor take double damage. You take half the total damage dealt.

### Mudzwiti

The Mudzwiti are tribal goblins who dwell in the dense Lyoki Ingi Ingi jungle, their bodies adorned with elaborate bone piercings and ritualistic scarification. These fierce warriors have formed a symbiotic relationship with the utahraptors that roam their jungle home, riding them into battle while wearing the skulls of fallen dinosaurs as helmets.

Their culture revolves around death and legacy, constructing incredibly elaborate tombs for their deceased leaders, complete with buried servants and accumulated riches. Their kings consume rare jungle plants that extend their lifespans dramatically, allowing them to accumulate vast wealth over centuries.

#### Aspects

- Dinosaur rider of the deep jungle
- Death builds the greatest monuments

#### Raptor Bond

**Passive ability.**
You gain the Beast Companion talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have). Your companion is a utahraptor with Medium size, a climb speed of 20 feet, and claw attacks (1d8 damage). If your raptor dies, you may spend a week in the jungle to bond with a new one. You have advantage on all checks related to dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures.

### Spine Goblin

The Spine Goblins are perhaps the most disturbing of all goblin subraces, afflicted with a leprosy-like disease that causes their bones to pierce through their skin. Their spinal columns protrude grotesquely from their backs, and rather than hide this deformity, they have embraced it by binding nails, spikes, and other sharp implements to their exposed bones.

These crude and malevolent creatures represent the darkest aspects of goblin nature, using their horrifying appearance and weaponized deformities to terrorize their enemies. They are among the most feared and reviled of all goblins, and for good reason.

#### Aspects

- My deformity is my weapon
- Pain has made me stronger

#### Bone Spikes

**Passive ability.**
Your exposed bones are fitted with sharp metal implements. Whenever a creature grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack, they take 1d4 piercing damage. You may use your bone spikes as ultralight piercing weapons. Additionally, whenever a creature deals damage to you with a melee attack while within 5 feet, they take 1d4 piercing damage from your spikes.

### Wydling

Wydlings, also known as icelings, are the frost-touched cousins of the goblin family tree. Born in the frozen wastes and glacial caverns of the far north, these pale blue goblins have adapted to survive in the harshest cold. Unlike their more communal relatives, Wydling broods are smaller and more nomadic, following the seasonal migrations of their prey across the tundra. Their razor-sharp icicle teeth have evolved to strip frozen meat from bones and crack through ice to reach fish below.

Wydling society values patience and cunning over the impulsiveness of their southern kin. They are master hunters and trackers, capable of waiting motionless in snowdrifts for hours before striking. Their long noses serve a practical purpose—warming frigid air before it reaches their lungs and detecting the faintest scents carried on arctic winds. While other goblins might gather in hundreds, Wydlings move in small hunting packs of extended family, each member knowing their role in the hunt.

Those Wydlings who venture south often find work as guides through mountain passes, ice sculptors, or surprisingly effective fishmongers—their natural affinity for cold keeping goods fresh far longer than normal.

#### Aspects

- Patient predator
- Cold pragmatism over warm emotions

#### Frostbite

**Passive ability.**
Your icy heritage grants you several adaptations. You are immune to the effects of freezing temperatures and take half damage from cold-based attacks. Your razor-sharp teeth count as ultralight piercing melee weapons. Additionally, when you deal damage with your bite, the bitten creature gains 2 level of slowed as numbing cold spreads from your icy fangs.

### Stravlar

The Stravlar are a sophisticated goblin subrace marked by extensive, embossed tattoos that cover their bodies. Their skin is either yellow with red tattoos or red with yellow tattoos—scholars still argue over which is the base color. These tattoos are not mere decoration but a living record of their family's history and achievements, inked with crushed mussel shells infused with fire magic.

They are fire-attuned scholars, merchants, and guild leaders who value knowledge and preservation above all else. A Stravlar treats physical scarring as a tragedy greater than death, for it erases their history. Their communities maintain vast oral and visual libraries, with the eldest members serving as living encyclopedias whose skin tells the stories of generations.

#### Aspects

- My skin is my story
- Fire in the ink

#### Ember Skin

**Passive ability.**
Your tattoos channel your innate fire magic, granting you a basic attunement to fire. Additionally, your inked skin can flare with protective heat—when a creature grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack, they take 1d4 fire damage. You can suppress or activate this heat at will.

#### Living Record

**Passive ability.**
Your tattoos and training give you an eidetic memory for text, symbols, and historical facts. You have A2 on all checks related to history, lore, or recalling information you have previously encountered. You can read any language you have spent at least an hour studying, though you cannot speak it without additional training.

### Aciabro

The Aciabro are a unique offshoot of goblin-kind, somewhat related to the Cogheads but distinct in their dark ingenuity. While Cogheads use aether and steam to power their creations, the Aciabro have turned to a more visceral source of energy: their own blood. These "cyborgs" of the goblin world replace their limbs and organs with terrifying machines that run on vital essence, making them formidable but perpetually teetering on the edge of exhaustion.

Specializing in invention that others would deem mad, they live in secluded workshops where the scent of oil and copper is overwhelming. They are driven by an obsessive need to upgrade themselves, viewing flesh as weak and fuel-inefficient.

#### Aspects

- Blood fuels the gear
- Invention over safety

#### Sanguine Engine

**Passive ability.**
Your mechanical augmentations are powered by your own life force. As an action, you may spend up to 10 HP to supercharge your systems. For each 2 HP spent, choose one benefit that lasts until the end of your next turn:

- Increase your movement speed by 10 feet
- Gain +1 to attack rolls
- Gain +1 to defense rolls
- Deal +1d4 damage with melee attacks

#### Jerry-Rigged Anatomy

**Major ability.**
You can quickly repair or modify your mechanical parts in the field. As an action, you may regain HP equal to your heart die roll, or immediately remove the slowed condition from yourself.

### Xibli

The Xibli are an aquatic offshoot of goblins inhabiting the islands around Melrox. They have blue skin, webbed hands and feet, and spiny backs. Unlike their land-bound cousins, they are excellent swimmers who live a semi-aquatic life in the intertidal zones.

They are freedom-loving hedonists who sleep on the beach and party in the waves. While they trade with outsiders, they view anyone who can't hold their breath for five minutes as lesser beings.

#### Aspects

- Slippery as a fish
- Tide-born

#### Amphibious

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe air and water equally well. You have a swim speed equal to your movement speed and can see clearly underwater. You suffer no penalties for fighting underwater, and your unarmed attacks deal +1d4 damage while submerged.

#### Slippery Escape

**Passive ability.**
Your skin secretes a slick coating that makes you difficult to hold. You have A2 on all checks to escape grapples or restraints. Additionally, creatures have D2 on attempts to grapple you.
