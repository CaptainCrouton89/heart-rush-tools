## Star Hag

Star Hags are ancient, malevolent beings born of starlight. They appear as wizened crones with eyes that shine like distant galaxies. They are hunted across Alaria for their body parts—eyes, claws, and spirits—which are powerful magical ingredients. This persecution has driven them to hate all other races.

They can read the stars to divine the future and use their gaze to pierce a mortal's soul, inflicting spiritual wounds that never fully heal. Star Hags live in isolated towers and cave systems, emerging only at night to hunt or gather components for their strange rituals. They are solitary by nature, viewing even other Star Hags with suspicion.

### Star Prophecy

**Passive ability.**
You can read the movement of the stars to gain insight into future events. Once per day while under an open night sky, you may spend 10 minutes in meditation to ask the GM one question about events that will occur within the next week. The answer will be truthful but cryptic, often requiring interpretation.

### Soul Pierce

**Major ability.**
You can focus your starlit gaze on a creature within 30 feet. They must make a CN 12 Presence saving throw or take 3d6 psychic damage that ignores armor and physical defenses. This damage cannot be healed by non-magical means—only magical healing or a full week of rest can restore HP lost to this ability. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
