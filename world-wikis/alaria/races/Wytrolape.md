## Wytrolape

The Wytrolape are white-furred giant apes residing in Kyorda. Normally, they are peaceful, intelligent beings who work as laborers in northern tribes. However, they are cursed by the moon. During the "War Moon" (when both moons are dark), they descend into a primal rage, becoming violent and uncontrollable.

They struggle constantly against this inner beast, seeking civilization as a way to tame their own nature. Many Wytrolape become monks, philosophers, or craftsmen, hoping that discipline and routine will help them control the rage within. Despite their efforts, every Wytrolape fears the War Moon—and fears what they might do when it rises.

### Vitals

### Moon Rage

**Passive ability.**
Under the War Moon (both moons dark, typically 2-3 days per month) or when reduced to below half your maximum HP, you must make a CN 12 Presence save at the start of each of your turns. On a failure, you enter a rage:

- You gain A2 on all attack rolls and might checks
- Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage
- You cannot distinguish friend from foe—you attack the nearest creature each round
- You cannot use abilities that require concentration or careful thought

The rage lasts until all nearby creatures are dead, unconscious, or out of sight, or until you succeed on a CN 15 Presence save (you can attempt this save once per round as a free action).

### Ape Strength

**Passive ability.**
You have a climb speed equal to your movement speed. You can wield heavy weapons with one hand and throw objects (or willing creatures) up to 60 feet as an action—thrown objects deal 2d6 damage to the target on a hit (Agility save CN 12 to avoid), and willing creatures land safely.
