## Troenka

The Troenka are cruel, wood-like beings that inhabit the deep forests of Ichneum and Tenekee. Indistinguishable from trees when they stand still, they ambush travelers not for food, but for the sheer sadistic pleasure of torture. They are strong, intelligent, and view themselves as the forest's punishment on intruders.

A Troenka can stand motionless for days, waiting for a victim to walk beneath its branches before striking. Their bark-like skin is resistant to most weapons, and their root-like tendrils can entangle and crush victims with terrifying strength. Some scholars believe they were once peaceful forest spirits, corrupted by centuries of watching their woods burned and cut.

### Tree Form

**Passive ability.**
As an action, you can take root and become indistinguishable from a normal tree. While in this form, you cannot move but are aware of your surroundings within 60 feet through your roots. You have +4 to defense rolls against all damage while rooted, and you automatically succeed on stealth checks to appear as a normal tree. You can end this form as a free action on your turn.

### Root Strangle

**Major ability.**
You can animate the roots around you to entrap your enemies. Once per combat, as an action, all creatures within 15 feet of you must make a CN 12 Agility saving throw or become grappled by roots. Grappled creatures take 2d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of their turns and can use their action to attempt a CN 12 Might check to break free.
