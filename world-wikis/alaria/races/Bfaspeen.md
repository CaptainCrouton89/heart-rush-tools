## Bfaspeen

The Bfaspeen are horrid, aquatic monstrosities that plague the Bejeweled Sea. With the lower body of a powerful eel and a torso dominated by mandibles and bulbous eyes, they are the stuff of sailors' nightmares. They live in strict matriarchal broods, where the males are subservient hunters who drag prey back to the deep lairs to be consumed.

They have a pathological lust for gold and shiny objects, often attacking ships not just for food, but to sink them and loot the wreckage. Bfaspeen are cruel and intelligent, capable of coordinating complex raids on merchant vessels. Their underwater hoards glitter with centuries of accumulated treasure, jealously guarded by the brood mothers.

### Eel-Tail Propulsion

**Passive ability.**
Your powerful tail grants you a swim speed of 60 feet. You can launch yourself out of the water up to 20 feet into the air. You can breathe both air and water. You suffer no penalties for fighting underwater.

### Mandible Crush

**Major ability.**
Your massive mandibles can snap through wood and bone alike. Once per combat, when you hit with a bite attack, you can choose to deal an additional 3d6 damage and destroy any non-magical armor, shield, or weapon the target is holding (target chooses which item if multiple). Against structures or objects, your bite deals double damage.
