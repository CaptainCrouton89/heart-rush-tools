## Ogre

Ogres are massive, powerful greenskins standing around seven to eight feet tall with small tusks and hairy bodies. Unlike the dull-witted giants they are sometimes confused with, ogres possess complex emotions and keen senses, though they are often ruled by their passions. An ogre's rage is legendary, but so is their capacity for loyalty and love.

Culturally, ogres mate for life but live in separate tribes divided by gender, reuniting only during mating seasons and festivals. They are deeply connected to nature and their tribal bonds, with elaborate rituals governing interactions between tribes. An ogre without a tribe is considered pitiable—a creature without purpose or protection.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Large
- **Height:** 7-8 feet
- **Weight:** 300-400 pounds

### Primal Senses

**Passive ability.**
Your senses are primal and sharp. You can track creatures by scent, detecting their presence within 30 feet even through obstacles. You have A2 on perception checks to detect hidden creatures, and you cannot be surprised while conscious.

### Silzar (Plains Ogre)

The Silzar are nomadic ogres who have mastered the art of mounted warfare on massive war mammoths. They roam the plains of Silwyn, their mounts serving as mobile artillery platforms mounted with massive cannons and ballistae. Gruff and patriarchal, they adhere to a strict code of honor that governs their nomadic lives.

The Silzar value their weapons above all else, treating them as sacred objects passed down through generations. A Silzar's cannon has a name, a history, and is considered an extension of the warrior's soul. To lose one's weapon to an enemy is a shame that can only be cleansed by reclaiming it or dying in the attempt.

#### Aspects

- Mobile artillery
- Code of the plains

#### Mammoth Artillery

**Passive ability.**
You are trained in the ways of mounted siege warfare. You suffer no penalties for firing ranged weapons while moving on a mount, and you can reload heavy ranged weapons (cannons, ballistae, heavy crossbows) as an interact action rather than a full action. You gain the Beast Companion talent as a racial ability (it does not count towards the number of talents you have). Your companion is a war mammoth with 40 HP, 30 move speed, and a trample attack dealing 1d10 damage. If your mammoth dies, you can bond with a new one after a month of mourning.

### Groyza (Swamp Ogre)

The Groyza are swamp-dwelling ogres who have adapted to the murky waters and dense vegetation of the southern marshlands. Their skin has taken on a greenish-brown mottled pattern that blends perfectly with their boggy homes, and their bodies have grown slightly leaner than their plains cousins—though still massive by any other race's standards.

The Groyza are master ambush predators, using the swamp's natural concealment to surprise prey and enemies alike. They are also skilled herbalists, brewing potent poisons and medicines from the unique flora of their wetland homes. Other races approach Groyza territory with extreme caution, for the swamps are full of hidden dangers—and the ogres are often the least of them.

#### Aspects

- The swamp provides
- Patient as a crocodile

#### Bog Stalker

**Passive ability.**
You are perfectly adapted to swamp environments. You can move through difficult terrain caused by mud, water, or vegetation without penalty, and you can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes. While in swamp or wetland terrain, you have A2 on stealth checks and your first attack against a creature that hasn't acted in combat deals an additional 1d8 damage.
