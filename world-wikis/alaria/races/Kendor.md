## Kendor

The Kendor are an ancient aquatic people whose grace and beauty are matched only by their mastery of courtly intrigue. Evolved from seahorses in the warm tropical seas, they have developed into bipedal beings who can thrive both in water and on land, though they vastly prefer their hidden underwater palaces. Their elongated, elegant forms move with hypnotic fluidity, and their iridescent scales shift color with their moods and intentions.

Kendor society revolves around elaborate courtship rituals, political maneuvering, and the cultivation of beauty in all its forms. Violence is considered the ultimate vulgarity—a last resort for those who lack the wit and charm to achieve their goals through more civilized means. Their hidden fortress-cities are marvels of coral architecture and bioluminescent gardens, accessible only to those who know the secret currents and can navigate the maze-like approaches.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium
- **Height:** 6-7.5 feet (including decorative fin crests)
- **Weight:** 140-200 pounds

### Aquatic Grace

**Passive ability.**
You can breathe both air and water, and suffer no disadvantage for skill checks or AD rolls made underwater. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet while both you and the target are underwater. On land, you must immerse yourself in water for at least 10 minutes during each long rest or gain a level of weakened that doesn't fade until you do so.

### Distribution & Diaspora

The Kendor are far more widespread than surface-dwellers realize. The three Kendrel Kingdoms of the Agreben Sea represent only the most visible concentration—the settlements that chose to engage with the surface world. Across the world's oceans, other Kendor communities exist in varying degrees of isolation.

**Why the concentration in Agreben?** Several factors:

- **Thermal requirements**: Kendor evolved in tropical waters and require warm temperatures to thrive. The Agreben Sea's shallow, sun-warmed continental shelf provides ideal conditions. Temperate and polar waters are physiologically hostile.
- **Bfaspeen pressure**: The eel-bodied Bfaspeen broods dominate much of the world's deep ocean, forcing Kendor into defensive enclaves along continental shelves where shallow water provides natural protection.
- **Surface-interaction bias**: Most Kendor communities refuse contact with "land-dwellers." The Kendrel Kingdoms are unusual in their willingness to trade with surface nations. Other communities exist but remain hidden.

**Known populations beyond the Kendrel Kingdoms:**

- **The Riptear Cendoriln**: Deep-ocean Cendoriln populations in the Riptear Sea (Terrenia) who maintain no contact with surface nations or even the Kendrel Kingdoms.
- **The Abyssal Enclaves**: Scattered Cendoriln communities throughout deep Aboyinzu, living in thermal vents and underwater cave systems.
- **Pelaendor Wanderers**: Nomadic individuals and small groups found throughout the world's warm coastal waters, often serving as intermediaries, translators, or advisors to surface nations.
- **The Silent Fortresses**: Rumors persist of hidden Kendrel cities in the Bejeweled Sea, far from any surface contact, whose inhabitants consider even Glador's isolationism dangerously cosmopolitan.

**Pelaendor in distant lands**: Individual Pelaendor serve as ambassadors, translators, and cultural advisors in port cities throughout Alaria. Permanent Pelaendor residents can be found in Adron (where they advise the naga court on maritime matters), several Middle Sea trading cities, and occasionally even in Ve. These individuals maintain loose ties to the Kendrel Kingdoms but operate independently, sending information home in exchange for the prestige of Kendrel backing.

### Relationship with Tritons

The Kendor and the Tritons of Vetral share ancient origins but have diverged profoundly over millennia.

**The Common Ancestry**: Both peoples trace their origins to the prehistoric aquatic civilizations that once flourished in what is now Adron. When the tritons fled Adron in distant prehistory (the reasons lost even to the naga who displaced them), not all underwater peoples went with them. The ancestors of the Kendor remained in warmer southern waters, evolving separately.

**Modern Relations**: Cool and distant. The two civilizations maintain formal diplomatic contact through Pelaendor intermediaries but view each other with mutual disdain:

- Tritons consider Kendor effete and cowardly—hiding behind reefs while Vetral fights the Bfaspeen directly, obsessing over courtship games while the real war for oceanic survival is being lost.
- Kendor consider tritons crude and militaristic—a theocracy of warriors who've forgotten that civilization means more than fighting. The triton obsession with "Old Lanes" and sovereignty claims strikes Kendor as unsophisticated posturing.

**The Bfaspeen Question**: Both peoples fight the Bfaspeen, but they don't coordinate. The Agreben Sea and Alrock Ocean are separated by vast distances, and neither civilization is willing to subordinate itself to the other's strategic priorities. Occasional proposals for alliance founder on questions of command, prestige, and fundamental cultural incompatibility.

**Trade**: Limited but present. Pelaendor traders occasionally reach Vetral-controlled waters, exchanging Kendrel luxury goods for triton forgecrab metal and deep-sea salvage rights. These transactions are strictly commercial—neither side pretends friendship.

### Kendrel (Court Kendor)

The Kendrel embody the highest ideals of Kendor society—masters of etiquette, romance, and social manipulation. Their scales shimmer with pearl-like iridescence, and they decorate themselves with cultivated coral jewelry and woven kelp garments of impossible intricacy. Every movement is a calculated dance, every word chosen for maximum impact.

In their hidden palace-fortresses beneath tropical reefs, the Kendrel engage in elaborate games of courtship and politics that can span decades. They view violence as beneath them, preferring to destroy enemies through social exile, romantic humiliation, or financial ruin. Many Kendrel who venture to the surface world become diplomats, matchmakers, or advisors to powerful nobles who value their supernatural understanding of social dynamics.

#### Aspects

- Master of courtly intrigue
- Violence is beneath me

#### Mesmerizing Presence

**Major ability.**
Your beauty and grace can stop conflicts before they begin. When combat would begin, you may use this ability before initiative is rolled. Each creature makes cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. Each creature that fails becomes unable to take hostile actions against you for the next minute unless you or your allies attack them first. Affected creatures may still defend themselves if attacked. This ability has no effect on creatures that are already in combat or have been in combat with you within the last hour.

### Cendoriln (Abyss Kendor)

Where the Kendrel embrace light and beauty, the Cendoriln have adapted to the crushing darkness of deep ocean trenches. Their scales are darker—deep purples, blacks, and midnight blues—with bioluminescent patterns they can control at will. The "nasty" reputation they've earned comes from their willingness to do what other Kendor won't: engage in violence when necessary, though they still prefer manipulation and fear to direct confrontation.

The Cendoriln's hidden fortresses lie in underwater caves and thermal vents, places where even other aquatic races fear to venture. They are master secret-keepers and blackmailers, trading in information that could topple kingdoms. Their courtship rituals involve elaborate displays of bioluminescence and tests of mental fortitude rather than the Kendrel's focus on beauty and charm.

**Diaspora**: Unlike the other subraces, Cendoriln have spread far beyond the Kendrel Kingdoms. Populations exist in the Riptear Sea, deep Aboyinzu, and scattered thermal vent systems throughout the world's oceans. These diaspora communities maintain no contact with surface nations and often refuse communication even with the Kendrel Kingdoms, considering themselves purer practitioners of Kendor tradition—uncorrupted by surface influence. The Riptear Cendoriln are particularly isolationist, and their existence is known only through rare Pelaendor encounters.

#### Aspects

- Secrets are currency
- I thrive where others fear to swim

#### Abyssal Intimidation

**Passive ability.**
You can control your bioluminescent patterns to unnerve and disorient. You have advantage on intimidation checks, and when you successfully intimidate a creature, they also gain one level of dazed. Additionally, in darkness or dim light, you can shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 10-feet beyond as a free action.

### Pelaendor (Wanderer Kendor)

Some Kendor have abandoned the hidden fortresses entirely, becoming nomadic wanderers who travel the ocean currents and occasionally venture onto land. The Pelaendor have adapted to life between worlds, their scales taking on sandy, mottled patterns that help them blend into various environments. They serve as the primary ambassadors between Kendor society and the surface world.

Unlike their fortress-dwelling kin, the Pelaendor have learned that sometimes violence, while regrettable, is necessary for survival. They maintain the Kendor appreciation for beauty and social grace but temper it with practicality. Many become traders, messengers, or guides, using their ability to navigate both underwater and terrestrial societies.

**Global presence**: Pelaendor can be found in warm coastal waters throughout Alaria, far beyond the Kendrel Kingdoms. Individual wanderers serve as advisors to surface courts, translators for maritime trade, and intermediaries between civilizations that would otherwise have no contact. The naga court of Adron has employed Pelaendor advisors for centuries; Middle Sea trading cities host small Pelaendor communities; even distant Ve has occasional Pelaendor visitors. These individuals maintain loose ties to the Kendrel Kingdoms, trading information and prestige, but operate with considerable independence.

#### Aspects

- Comfortable in any current
- Bridge between worlds

#### Adaptive Camouflage

**Major ability.**
Your scales can shift color and pattern to match your surroundings, and you can blend into crowds or natural environments with ease. As an action, you can become nearly invisible automatically succeeding on a check to hide and become obscured, even in bright light. If you move or attack, you lose this effect and are visible once more.

### Pelarian (Fire Kendor)

The Pelarians are an anomaly—aquatic beings with fire attunement. Generations of life among the volcanic vents of southern Pelaria have transformed them, creating a subrace that other Kendor find deeply unsettling. Their scales trend toward darker reds, oranges, and smoky blacks, and they literally steam when agitated.

The Pelarians have adapted not just physically but culturally. They maintain the Kendor appreciation for social grace but have developed a martial tradition that horrifies traditionalists. They distinguish between "aggression" (attacking the unwilling, which remains shameful) and "contest" (combat between consenting parties, which is honorable). This semantic distinction allows them to maintain armies, conduct duels, and wage defensive war while technically adhering to Kendor values.

Northern Kendor consider the Pelarians borderline heretics. The Pelarians consider the northern Kendor naive about survival in a dangerous world. Both are probably right.

**Origin theories**: Scholars debate whether the Pelarian adaptation is purely environmental (generations of exposure to volcanic heat and fire-element leylines) or reflects deliberate magical experimentation. Pelarian oral tradition speaks of ancestors exiled from ancient Glador for defending their homes when the nobility counseled retreat—but whether this exile caused the fire attunement or the adaptation came later remains unclear.

#### Aspects

- Forged in fire, tempered by water
- Violence has its place

#### Thermal Resilience

**Passive ability.**
Your body generates and tolerates extreme heat. You can survive in water temperatures up to boiling, suffer no ill effects from hot environments, and have resistance to fire damage. When you take fire damage, you may choose to absorb some of the heat—for the next minute, your melee attacks deal an additional 1d4 fire damage as steam vents from your scales. Additionally, when stressed or angry, you visibly steam; you have disadvantage on checks to conceal strong emotions.
