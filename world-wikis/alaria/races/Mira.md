## Mira

The Mira are a strange, mirror-skinned race with extreme sexual dimorphism and a rigid caste system. Their skin is reflective, like polished chrome or mercury, catching and throwing light in mesmerizing patterns.

- **Males** are huge, hulking brutes with natural armor, serving as soldiers and laborers.
- **Females** are faceless, slender beings with high magical aptitude, serving as mages and advisors.
- **Common (Third Gender)** are the balanced leaders, possessing traits of both but ruling over all.

Their society is one of absolute order, with each caste fulfilling their designated role without question. The Mira believe their reflection shows their true soul, and those whose reflection appears distorted are shunned as spiritually corrupt.

### Vitals

- **Size:** Medium (Large for Males)
- **Height:** Varies by caste
- **Weight:** Varies by caste

### Aspects

- Reflection of the soul
- Caste destiny is absolute

### Reflective Skin

**Major ability.**
Your mirrored skin can turn magic back on its caster. Once per long rest, when a spell or magical effect targets you, you may reflect it back at the source. The original caster becomes the new target of their own spell or effect. Alternatively, you can use this ability to blind all creatures within 30 feet who can see you for 1 round (no save).

### Caste Trait

**Passive ability.**
Choose your caste at character creation:

- **Male:** Your size is Large. You have +2 to defense rolls against physical attacks and A2 on all Might checks.
- **Female:** Your size is Medium. You have A2 on all checks involving magic, and elemental talents cost 2 less XP.
- **Common:** Your size is Medium. You have A2 on all Presence checks and can communicate telepathically with any Mira within 100 feet.
