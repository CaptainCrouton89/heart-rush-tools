## Frialve

The Frialve are a bird-like race residing in the sprawling jungle city of Bygos Shemazari. Their heads are dominated by massive beaks, and their arms are feathered, functioning as stunted wings. Though they cannot truly fly, they are agile jumpers and climbers, using their wings to glide between the massive trees of their homeland.

Their city is a low-density sprawl of nests and tree-homes stretching for hundreds of miles through the jungle canopy. They communicate through complex bird calls that can carry for miles through the forest, allowing them to coordinate hunts and warn of dangers across vast distances. To outsiders, the jungle seems empty—but the Frialve are always watching, always listening.

### Jungle Leap

**Passive ability.**
Your stunted wings allow you to make incredible leaps and control your descent. You can jump three times the normal distance (both horizontal and vertical), and you take no damage from falling if you are conscious. Additionally, you have a glide speed of 40 feet—for every 10 feet you fall, you can move 40 feet horizontally.

### Mimicry

**Passive ability.**
You can perfectly imitate any sound you have heard, from animal calls to specific voices. Creatures hearing your mimicry must succeed on a CN 15 Cunning check to recognize it as an imitation. You have A2 on deception checks that involve vocal imitation, and you can communicate simple messages to allies up to 1 mile away using your people's call language.
