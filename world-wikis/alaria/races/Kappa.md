## Kappa

The Kappa are massive, toad-like beings that dominate the criminal underbelly of Moigos. Resembling gigantic, toxic toads, they are often obese and sluggish, preferring to have others do their dirty work. They secrete a constant layer of mucous that keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery to hold.

Despite their appearance, they are shrewd, intelligent, and powerful. They run vast criminal syndicates, acting as mob bosses who trade in secrets, illicit goods, and favors. A Kappa never forgets a debt, and their patience is as vast as their appetites. To cross a Kappa is to invite a slow, methodical destruction of everything you hold dear.

### Mucous Skin

**Passive ability.**
Your skin oozes a slippery, mildly toxic slime. You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. You have A2 on checks to escape grapples, and any creature that grapples you or hits you with an unarmed attack must make a CN 10 Might saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute, suffering D2 on all checks as the toxin clouds their mind.

### Tongue Lash

**Major ability.**
Your tongue is a muscular whip that can extend 15 feet. As an action, you can use your tongue to:
- **Snatch:** Grab an unattended object weighing up to 20 pounds and pull it to your hand
- **Disarm:** Force a creature to make a CN 12 Might saving throw or drop one item they are holding
- **Grapple:** Make a grapple attempt against a creature within range. On success, you can pull them 10 feet toward you as part of the grapple
