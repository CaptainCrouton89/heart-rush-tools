## Gyv

The Gyv are the puppet masters of Iylovia, a race whose very presence makes others question their own thoughts. With their distinctive silver hair and grayish skin, these tall, lithe beings move through society like whispers of smoke. Born from the mingling of Zaelian elf and human bloodlines, they inherited something far more dangerous than either parent race possessed—the ability to subtly influence minds.

In Gyv society, direct confrontation is considered both crude and foolish. Why argue when you can make someone believe your position was their idea all along? This has created a culture of extreme paranoia where every conversation is a chess match and trust is a luxury none can afford. Even among themselves, the Gyv deal in shadows and schemes, using intermediaries and elaborate protocols to avoid direct mental manipulation.

### Society and Culture

The Gyv have built elaborate systems to function in a society where no one can trust anyone.

**Written communication** dominates important dealings. The Silver Tongue requires speech, so contracts, proposals, accusations, and even love letters happen on paper. A Gyv who insists on verbal negotiation is immediately suspect.

**Intermediaries** carry messages between anyone of consequence. You never deal directly with someone important—messages pass through chains of go-betweens, each assuming the others are compromised. Inefficient, but safer.

**Clean zones** exist in public spaces where speaking is forbidden. Markets use hand signals and written price boards. Council chambers have observation galleries where debates can be watched but not heard. Important conversations happen in writing, passed back and forth while sitting in the same room.

**Binding contracts** enforce every agreement of consequence through magic. A Gyv's word alone is worthless. If it's not bound, it didn't happen.

**Tested bonds** form through deliberate, acknowledged manipulation attempts. If you try to Silver Tongue me and I resist, and I try and you resist, then we know our relationship is genuine. These are the closest thing to real friendship Gyv possess—built on proven resistance, not assumed honesty.

### Social Classes

**Speakers** have mastered the art of manipulation. They navigate the web of schemes and come out ahead. In peacetime, they rule.

**The Marked** have voluntarily had their Silver Tongue ability magically suppressed or branded, sacrificing their heritage to be trustworthy. They serve as arbiters, witnesses, and message-carriers. Looked down upon, but necessary.

**The Mutes** have taken vows of silence, communicating only through writing and gesture. Often monks, scholars, or craftspeople tired of the endless games.

**The Deaf** are rare extremists who've deliberately deafened themselves to be immune to manipulation. It proves they cannot be compromised.

### The Crisis

Iylovia is losing a war to the Silzar of Silwyn, and Gyv culture is failing its greatest test.

The Silzar have developed countermeasures—ear protection, trumpeting war-mammoths, fighting at range with ballistae. On the open plains, where Gyv once ruled, their manipulation is useless. The Gyv have retreated to their forests, where close-quarters ambushes let them use their abilities, but they cannot coordinate an effective defense because they cannot trust each other.

Every military alliance is suspect. Every strategic decision is tangled in schemes. Some Gyv are certainly selling information to the Silzar, betraying their own people because that's simply what Gyv do. The same abilities that made them powerful are now destroying them.

To survive, they need to trust each other. But their entire culture makes trust impossible.
