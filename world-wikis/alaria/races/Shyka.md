## Shyka

The Shyka are tall, kobold-like reptilians with dragon snouts and reddish-brown scales. They harbor a burning hatred for dwarves, a trait bred into them by their dark patron, Rothogomos. They are fanatically loyal to their god, believing that he devours those who fail to conform to his will.

Wiry and fast, they fight in coordinated packs, overwhelming stronger enemies with sheer numbers and viciousness. Shyka society is strictly hierarchical, with priests of Rothogomos at the top and warriors just below. Those who displease the priesthood are sacrificed to their devouring god in elaborate rituals.

### Pack Tactics

**Passive ability.**
You fight best when your allies are close. You have A2 on attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally is within 5 feet of that creature. Additionally, you and your allies within 5 feet of each other can communicate tactical information as a free action through hisses and gestures that are difficult for outsiders to interpret.

### Draconic Sorcery

**Minor ability.**
You can channel a spark of Rothogomos's power. Spend 1 Rush Point to breathe a 15-foot cone of fire, dealing 2d6 fire damage to all creatures in the area (CN 12 Agility save for half). Alternatively, spend 1 Rush Point to harden your scales, gaining +2 to defense rolls until the start of your next turn.
