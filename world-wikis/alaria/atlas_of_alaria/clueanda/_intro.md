# Clueanda

Clueanda forms the frozen crown of northwestern Alaria. Twin mountain ranges define it: the east-west Nysanna Range hugging the polar edge, and the diagonal Kharvorn Mountains that sweep down toward the temperate Middle Sea. Between them lie the polar Northlands, the windswept Celedrim Plains, and countless fjords and glacial valleys. South of the Kharvorn range the climate softens enough to support bustling Middle Sea trade cities and the arid Westwilds coastline that faces the Tarkhon Strait.
