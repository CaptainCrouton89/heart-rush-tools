## Aqueandrekons

Tags: mountains

The Aqueandrekons are a sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned south of the Temple of Icefire and north of Gymlstik. The range is known for its sharp, dramatic peaks and the ancient ruins scattered throughout its valleys.

### Character

The Aqueandrekons are less heavily glaciated than the ranges to the north but remain treacherous. The peaks here are younger geologically, their edges still sharp rather than rounded by millennia of erosion. Rockslides are common, and the narrow valleys channel wind into cutting gales.

Few settlements exist in the Aqueandrekons proper. The goblin-dominated state of Gymlstik lies to the south, and its tunnel networks extend beneath parts of the range, but the surface remains largely wild. Travelers passing between the Temple of Icefire and the lands to the south must navigate the Aqueandrekons carefully—both for natural hazards and for things that hunt among the peaks.

### Caves of Nykthos

Deep in the eastern Aqueandrekons, carved into a mountainside that catches no direct sunlight, lie the Caves of Nykthos. These ancient ruins predate any known civilization in the region—their architecture suggests builders who found darkness comfortable and light painful.

The caves extend far into the mountain, their passages carved with geometric precision. The walls bear inscriptions in a language no living scholar has deciphered, and the deeper chambers contain what appear to be altars or focusing points for rituals long forgotten.

Something still dwells in the deepest reaches of Nykthos. Expeditions that venture too far report sounds of movement in the darkness, glimpses of shapes that don't match any known creature, and the unsettling sensation of being watched. Several expeditions have failed to return entirely. Those that do emerge often speak of dreams—vivid, recurring dreams of darkness and cold and something vast that waits.

The caves sit at no known leyline convergence, which makes their evident magical nature all the more disturbing. Whatever power lingers here, it predates the leyline system—or operates outside it entirely.

### Merrow's Keep

On the western slopes of the Aqueandrekons, overlooking Sorrow Lake, stand the ruins of Merrow's Keep. The fortress was built centuries ago by a lord whose name has been deliberately erased from all records—a punishment reserved for crimes so severe that even remembrance is forbidden.

The keep itself is intact but abandoned. Local legend claims that something the nameless lord summoned or created still inhabits the fortress, though no one has verified this for generations. Sorrow Lake below the keep is unnaturally still and deep, its waters dark enough that the bottom has never been seen.

Fishermen from the valleys to the west avoid Sorrow Lake entirely. They say the fish there taste wrong, and that things sometimes surface at night that shouldn't exist in freshwater.
