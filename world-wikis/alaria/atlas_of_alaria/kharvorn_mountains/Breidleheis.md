## Breidleheis

Tags: region, giants

A high mountain basin ringed by the Gül Mountains—Ngül to the north, Egül to the east, Sorgül to the southeast—forming the heartland of the Güli giants. The name means "Broad Pasture" in the giants' tongue, and for millennia this sheltered valley has been their home.

### The Basin

Breidleheis sits at elevation, protected from the worst lowland weather by the surrounding peaks. The basin floor is alpine meadow—tough grasses, hardy wildflowers, and scattered copses of wind-twisted pine. In summer, the meadows explode with color; in winter, they lie buried under snow that the giants consider merely inconvenient.

The basin supports enormous herds of aurochs and mountain sheep, tended by giant shepherds who have followed the same seasonal patterns for longer than human civilization has existed. The giants don't farm—they consider agriculture beneath them—but they've shaped the basin's ecology through selective hunting and herd management for so many generations that the distinction is academic.

### Giant Society

The Güli are mountain giants—fifteen to twenty feet tall, gray-skinned, patient, and proud. They live in extended clan groups of twenty to fifty individuals, each claiming traditional grazing territories within the basin. Disputes between clans are settled through ritualized contests: wrestling, stone-throwing, and the recitation of lineage (a giant who can trace their ancestry further back wins significant prestige).

**Filgerran II** rules as king from Gülheim, but his authority is more ceremonial than absolute. The clans govern themselves; Filgerran settles inter-clan disputes, leads in times of war, and represents the Güli to outsiders. He has held the throne for over two centuries and shows no sign of dying soon.

The giants worship mountain spirits and their own ancestors. Standing stones mark territorial boundaries and sacred sites throughout the basin. The largest concentration is at **Gülheim**, where the stones form a processional avenue leading to Filgerran's fortress.

### The Lowlanders

Humans and other small folk exist in Breidleheis on giant sufferance. A few mining operations (notably Stonetop Mines in the Egül Mountains) operate with explicit permission, paying tribute in refined metal. Traders occasionally visit the basin's edge, though venturing deeper requires a giant escort.

The giants view lowlanders with bemused condescension—useful insects, occasionally amusing, not worth the effort of exterminating. This attitude can shift quickly if a lowlander gives offense. The giants have long memories and longer arms.

### Threats

Breidleheis is remarkably peaceful by Alarian standards. The giants have no serious external enemies—Camaran and Adron both know better than to provoke them, and the mountains themselves deter casual invasion. Internal conflicts are ritualized and rarely lethal.

The greatest threat is complacency. Filgerran II has begun looking west toward Camaran, wondering if his people have grown soft in their isolation. Some younger giants share his restlessness. If the king decides to march, the lowlands will burn—but so far, he has not decided.

### Notable Locations

- **Gülheim**: Filgerran II's magical fortress, built to his scale alone
- **Stonetop Mines**: Human-giant joint mining operation in the Egül Mountains
- **Swinehead Forest**: Sacred hunting grounds in the southern basin
- **Lost Lake**: Forbidden waters in the Sorgül Mountains—the giants refuse to speak of what lies beneath
