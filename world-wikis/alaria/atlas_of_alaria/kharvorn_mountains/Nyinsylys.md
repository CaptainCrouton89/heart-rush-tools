## Nyinsylys's Domain

Tags: dragon territory

The glacial highlands between the Nirvanis Mountains and the Knives are claimed by the white dragon Nyinsylys. This desolate region of ice fields, frozen peaks, and howling wind serves as her hunting ground and lair.

See [Nyinsylys](../../bestiary/dragons/Nyinsylys.md) for details on the dragon herself.

### Character

Nyinsylys's domain is arguably the most inhospitable stretch of the northern Kharvorn. The glaciers here are ancient, the crevasses deep, and the weather lethal. Even the hardened Zwaeron avoid this region, preferring to route their caravans through the marginally less deadly Pelmar passes to the northeast.

The dragon has shaped her territory over centuries. Bones of enormous creatures litter the ice—some her kills, others ancient things that died here long before she arrived. Her lair is said to be deep within a glacier, accessible only through tunnels of ice that she can collapse at will.

### The Boundary

The southern edge of Nyinsylys's domain borders the Nirvanis Mountains with their Kyth spirits and protective statues. The two territories seem to acknowledge each other—the dragon does not hunt in the statue-fields, and the Kyth do not venture onto the glaciers. Whether this represents some ancient pact, mutual respect, or simply pragmatic avoidance remains unknown.
