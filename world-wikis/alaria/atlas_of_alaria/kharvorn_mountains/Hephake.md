## Hephake

A dwarven state in the southern Kharvorn Mountains, sharing a southeastern border with the state of Myorna. Hephake is known for its extensive silver mines and the pollution they produce.

### Phorysia

The capital city of Hephake, a major dwarven mining settlement with massive silver extraction operations. The city sprawls across multiple mountain levels, its architecture dictated by the seams of silver that honeycomb the surrounding rock. Smoke from refineries hangs perpetually over the lower districts.

### Agora

The third great city of Hephake, positioned in the western reaches of the kingdom along the trade routes to Camaran and Adron. Where Phorysia mines and Erebinthias guards, Agora trades. The city's markets handle goods flowing between the mountain kingdoms and the lowlands—dwarven metalwork heading down, grain and textiles heading up.

Agora's governor holds equal rank with Phorysia's, appointed directly by the king for acts of exceptional service. The current governor, Thorndin Silvervein, earned his position through a century of diplomatic work establishing trade agreements with the lowland nations. He is old, shrewd, and far more interested in profit than politics.

### Easthelm

A fortified town in the eastern passes, controlling the approaches from the Grey Mountains and Myorna beyond. Easthelm exists primarily to watch the Sivakr—Hephake does not trust their silver-skinned neighbors and their memory magic.

The town maintains a standing garrison and a network of watchtowers extending into the Grey Mountains. Relations with the Mnurvlyon are cautiously cordial; both peoples share a distrust of Myorna that occasionally translates into cooperation.

### Abaddan

A mining settlement in the central mountains, smaller than Phorysia but significant for its iron deposits. The Abaddan mines produce the base metal that Hephakean smiths transform into tools, weapons, and the infrastructure of the kingdom.

The town is rough, practical, and perpetually covered in ore dust. Workers cycle through on multi-year contracts, earn their pay, and leave. Few stay longer than they must—Abaddan lacks Phorysia's amenities or Agora's opportunities. It is a place for work, not life.

### Erebinthias

The second city of Hephake, positioned in the northern reaches of the kingdom near the border with Argysis. Unlike Phorysia's industrial character, Erebinthias is a military stronghold—the forward position from which Hephake watches its dragon-occupied neighbor.

The city sits in a defensible mountain valley, its walls thick and its garrison large. Before Argysis fell, Erebinthias was primarily a trade hub, managing commerce between the two dwarven kingdoms. Now it is a fortress, its merchants replaced by soldiers, its inns converted to barracks.

Erebinthias is also the staging point for expeditions to Wisewatch and beyond. Anyone seeking to approach Argysis—whether scholar, mercenary, or resistance sympathizer—passes through here first. The city's intelligence apparatus is extensive; the authorities know far more about events in Argysis than they officially admit.

### Two Brothers

A distinctive pair of peaks north of Erebinthias, visible for miles along the approaches to Argysis. The Two Brothers mark the traditional boundary between Hephake and Argysis—or what was Argysis before the dragon came.

According to legend, the peaks were once a single mountain split in two during a duel between dwarven princes. The losing prince fell into the chasm between them; his bones lie there still. Whether this is history or myth, the Two Brothers have become a pilgrimage site for those mourning Argysis's fall. Dwarves climb to the col between the peaks to leave offerings and pray for their cousins' liberation.

The dragon Rothogomos knows of this tradition and finds it amusing. He occasionally sends his agents to observe the pilgrims, ensuring none attempt anything more active than prayer.

### Traitor's Watch

A fortified watchtower northwest of Erebinthias, overlooking the approaches to Wisdom Creek and the ruins of Argysis beyond. The name dates to the conquest—supposedly, this is where Hephakean scouts first spotted smoke rising from Argysis and realized something was terribly wrong.

The original watchers failed to raise the alarm in time. Whether this was treachery, incompetence, or simply the chaos of disaster has never been determined. The survivors were executed regardless, and the tower was renamed as a permanent reminder of the cost of failure.

Today, Traitor's Watch is the forward observation post for Hephake's intelligence operations against Argysis. The garrison is small but highly trained, tasked with monitoring dragon movements, tracking refugees, and intercepting Rothogomos's agents before they reach Hephakean territory. Duty at Traitor's Watch is considered either a punishment or an honor, depending on who assigns it.

### Derivlia Lake

Located in the southern part of Hephake, Derivlia Lake has become severely poisoned by runoff from the silver mines of Phorysia. The water is toxic, killing most life and leaving the shores barren. The lake serves as a stark reminder of the environmental cost of Hephake's mining wealth, and the dwarves have made no efforts to clean it—silver production continues unabated, and the poison flows into the lake year after year.

### The Mountain Churches

Three ancient churches stand in the high passes of Hephake, built in the early days of the kingdom to sanctify the mountain roads and protect travelers. Each is dedicated to a different aspect of dwarven faith, and each has developed its own character over the centuries.

#### Church of Margia

The westernmost of the three, built at a crossroads where routes diverge toward Argysis and the Blueshale Peaks. The Church of Margia honors the forge-mother aspect of the dwarven faith—creation, craft, and the transformation of raw ore into works of beauty.

The church maintains a working forge, tended by priest-smiths who create sacred implements for temples throughout Hephake. Travelers can commission minor repairs or blessings for their equipment, and the smoke rising from the church's chimney is visible for miles on clear days.

Since the fall of Argysis, the Church of Margia has taken on a secondary role as a waystation for those traveling to Wisewatch. The priests ask no questions and offer no opinions on the dragon situation, but their doors are open to anyone with coin for the offering box.

#### Church of Nocci

Positioned in the central passes, the Church of Nocci serves the warrior aspect—honor in battle, protection of the weak, and the righteous fury of the defender. The church is part temple, part fortification, its walls thick enough to withstand siege.

A small garrison of temple knights maintains the church, sworn to protect travelers through the passes. Their mandate is defensive only—they will not pursue bandits or monsters beyond the church's immediate vicinity—but within their territory, they are formidable.

The Church of Nocci has grown increasingly militant since Argysis fell. Many of the knights believe they should march to liberate their cousins from dragon rule. The high priest counsels patience. The tension is visible.

#### Church of Agril

The easternmost church, closest to the Myorna border, honors the stone-father aspect—endurance, patience, and the slow wisdom that comes from centuries of contemplation. The Church of Agril is quiet where the others are active, its priests devoted to prayer, meditation, and the maintenance of genealogical records stretching back millennia.

The church houses the most complete archive of Hephakean lineages outside the capital. Families send representatives to update their entries, verify ancestry, and record births and deaths. The priests are meticulous, impartial, and utterly disinterested in politics—which makes them invaluable arbiters in inheritance disputes.

The Church of Agril also watches the Myorna border with quiet concern. The Sivakr's memory magic troubles the stone-father priests deeply. They have begun maintaining duplicate records in secret locations, just in case.
