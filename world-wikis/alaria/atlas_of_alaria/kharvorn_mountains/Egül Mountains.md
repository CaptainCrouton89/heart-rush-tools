## Egül Mountains

Tags: mountains, giants

The eastern arm of the Gül Mountains, separating the Breidleheis basin from the broader Kharvorn range. The Egül peaks are the tallest and most rugged of the Gül ranges, forming an imposing wall that has long protected the giants from eastern incursions.

### Geography

The Egül rise sharply from the basin floor, their eastern faces dropping in sheer cliffs toward the foothills below. Several passes cut through the range, but all are difficult—narrow, steep, and prone to rockslides. The giants prefer it this way.

### Nedgar's Castle

Deep within the Egül Mountains lie the ruins of **Nedgar's Castle**, an impossible structure built by a stone-attuned hermit mage whose name has been lost to time. The architecture defies normal construction—walls that curve inward, stairs that spiral through solid rock, chambers with no apparent entrance.

The mage is long dead, but his creations remain. Animated stone beings patrol the halls, neither hostile nor friendly, simply *present*. They respond to those with earth attunement, sometimes offering guidance, sometimes blocking passages, their logic inscrutable.

The castle contains **earth-stones**—concentrated geomantic crystals of significant value to those who practice stone magic. Reaching them requires navigating both the animated guardians and the structure's disorienting geometry. Few succeed.

### Stonetop Mines

On the western slopes of the Egül, where the mountains meet the Breidleheis basin, lies **Stonetop Mines**—a rare example of human-giant cooperation.

The operation began centuries ago, its origins now lost to time. The current arrangement is simple: human miners dig, extracting iron, copper, and occasional silver from the mountain's depths. Giants take first pick of the refined ore, leaving the remainder for the humans to trade or keep. Neither side remembers who proposed the deal or why the other agreed.

The human settlement at the mine entrance is cramped and rough—a few hundred souls living in buildings sized for humans but designed to withstand occasional giant visitors. **Filgerran II** considers the miners "useful insects" and extends nominal protection, meaning other giants generally leave them alone.

The arrangement's weakness is religious. The miners worship lowland gods; the giants expect acknowledgment of mountain spirits. So far, both sides pretend not to notice the tension. A zealous priest or an offended giant patriarch could shatter the peace overnight.
