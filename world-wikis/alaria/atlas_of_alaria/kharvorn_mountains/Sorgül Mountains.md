## Sorgül Mountains

Tags: mountains, giants, mystery

The southeastern arm of the Gül Mountains, curving down toward the broader Kharvorn range. The Sorgül are the wildest of the three Gül ranges—less settled, more dangerous, and home to things the giants prefer not to discuss.

### Geography

The Sorgül rise in jagged peaks, younger and sharper than their northern cousins. Deep glacial cirques bite into the mountainsides, some holding small lakes, others filled with permanent ice. The terrain is treacherous even by giant standards—loose scree, hidden crevasses, and sudden storms that sweep up from the lowlands.

### Swinehead Forest

At the southern edge of the Sorgül, where the mountains descend toward the Breidleheis basin, lies **Swinehead Forest**—a dense, ancient woodland named for the enormous boars that roam beneath its canopy.

The boars of Swinehead are massive—the smallest are pony-sized, the largest rival oxen. They are aggressive, territorial, and extraordinarily dangerous. For the Güli giants, they are sacred prey.

A young giant's first solo boar kill marks their passage to adulthood. The hunt is undertaken alone, with traditional weapons only—no magic, no assistance, no retreat. Success earns the tusks, which are carved into ritual objects worn for life. Failure means death or shame that never fades.

Lowlanders occasionally poach in Swinehead. The giants usually ignore this—humans hunting pigs is beneath notice. But anyone who kills a giant's marked prey, or worse, a breeding sow protected by clan law, faces summary execution. No trial, no appeal. Just a giant's boot.

### Lost Lake

High in the Sorgül cirques, hidden from casual view, lies **Lost Lake**—a dark, still body of water that the giants refuse to approach.

The lake has no outlet and no apparent source. Its surface is perfectly calm even in high winds. The water is cold beyond reason—lowlanders who have tested it report numbness within seconds, frostbite within minutes. Nothing lives in it. Nothing grows on its shores.

The giants will not speak of Lost Lake directly. Pressed, they say only that something sleeps beneath the water—something that was old when their ancestors first entered the basin. The giants' arrival disturbed it. Their songs drove it down. But songs are forgotten, and the sleeper is patient.

Those who camp near Lost Lake report dreams of drowning—of sinking through black water toward something vast and aware at the bottom. The dreams intensify each night. By the third night, most flee. Those who stay longer are never seen again. Search parties occasionally find their camps, gear undisturbed, no sign of struggle. The dreamers simply... aren't there anymore.

The giants have a saying: *The lake remembers everyone who forgets it.* They do not explain what this means.
