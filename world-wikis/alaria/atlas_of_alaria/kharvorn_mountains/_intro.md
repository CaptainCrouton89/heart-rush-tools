# Kharvorn Mountains

## Geography

A massive, imposing mountain range running east-west across the northern center of the western continent. The Kharvorn Mountains act as a natural barrier separating the frozen north from the temperate south. The peaks are white-capped with heavy snowfall, while the foothills transition into the brown and green of the lower lands. This range defines the climate boundary between two worlds.
