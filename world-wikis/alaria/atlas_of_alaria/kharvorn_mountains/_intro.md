# Kharvorn Mountains

## Geography

The Kharvorn Mountains are a massive diagonal range that defines the heart of Clueanda, running from the center-north down to the southeast and spanning roughly half the map. Unlike the east-west Nysanna Range to the north, the Kharvorn cuts diagonally across the continent, creating the fundamental division between the frozen northern reaches and the temperate lands of the Middle Sea.

### Position and Extent

- **Northwest terminus**: Meets the eastern tip of the Nysanna Range at approximately a 120-degree angle
- **Southeast terminus**: Ends near Adron, where the mountains give way to the coastal states of the Middle Sea
- **North**: The Celedrim Plains and their forests (Winterwood, Plutochranes) lie beyond the range
- **South**: The temperate Middle Sea region and its coastal kingdoms

### Climate Barrier

The Kharvorn acts as a critical climate boundary. North of the range lies perpetual winter—the frozen steppes of the Celedrim Plains. South of the range, the climate warms dramatically, supporting the agricultural lands and trading cities of the Middle Sea coast. The peaks are white-capped with heavy snowfall, while the foothills transition into the brown and green of the lower lands.

### Sub-Ranges

The Kharvorn comprises numerous distinct mountain ranges along its length, from northwest to southeast:

- **Pelmar Mountains**
- **The Knives**
- **Nirvanis Mountains**
- **Aquendrakons**
- **Gymelstik**
- **Argysis** (Winterwood Forest lies to its north)
- **Hephake**
- **Myorna** (Plutochranes Forest lies to its north)
- **Ngül**

## Notable Locations

### Egül Mountains

A sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned north of the giant-infested basin that lies between Camaran (to the west) and Adron (to the south). This region is remote and treacherous, avoided by most travelers.

#### Nedgar's Castle

Deep within the Egül Mountains stands the ruins of Nedgar's Castle—a collapsed fortress of impossible architecture. Nedgar was a reclusive hermit mage, famous throughout the realm for his paragon attunement to stone. He built a castle that defied the laws of physics and geology, with towers that twisted in impossible angles and walls that seemed to float without support.

When Nedgar died, the castle collapsed—as if his will alone had held the structure together. Now the ruins are inhabited by animated stone beings: golems, statues, and fragments of architecture that aimlessly walk the halls, endlessly performing tasks for a master who no longer exists.

The animated stone guardians will not permit anyone who lacks stone attunement to enter the ruins. Those who try are crushed by falling masonry or torn apart by stone hands. However, for those rare geomancers with stone attunement, the ruins are accessible—and within lie multiple earth-stones, crystals of concentrated geomantic power that Nedgar collected during his lifetime.

### Desert of One Million Shards

Northwest of Ta Minn lies the Desert of One Million Shards—a vast expanse of shattered glass stretching as far as the eye can see. The desert's surface glitters under the sun, beautiful and deadly in equal measure. Walking across it is treacherous, as the sharp glass edges can slice through boots and flesh alike.

At the center of the desert lies a massive crater containing a huge lake. In the middle of that lake rests Ulm—a colossal meteorite that struck in ancient times, creating both the crater and the lake. The impact also melted and scattered the surrounding rock into the endless field of glass shards that now defines the region.

#### Roclin Hills

In the foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains, northeast of the Desert of One Million Shards, lie the Roclin Hills. This region is named for the rocs—great, majestic birds that infest the area. The massive predators perch in the hills to roost after soaring over the desert and surrounding countryside all day hunting for prey. Travelers through the Roclin Hills risk attack from above, as the rocs are always hungry and unafraid of humanoid-sized meals.

### Temple of Icefire

North of Gymelstik (a goblin-dominated state) and south of the Aquendrakons mountains, at the convergence of water and fire leylines, stands the Temple of Icefire. This unique institution is dedicated to the study of ice and fire magic and their interaction—a discipline that produces seemingly impossible results.

Mages who study at the Temple of Icefire learn to create ice that burns and flames that freeze, manipulating the fundamental properties of these opposing elements. The temple's location at the leyline intersection allows practitioners to channel both water and fire magic simultaneously, creating paradoxical effects that defy conventional magical understanding.
