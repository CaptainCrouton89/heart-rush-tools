# Kharvorn Mountains

## Geography

The Kharvorn Mountains are a massive diagonal range that defines the heart of Clueanda, running from the center-north down to the southeast and spanning roughly half the map. Unlike the east-west Nysanna Range to the north, the Kharvorn cuts diagonally across the continent, creating the fundamental division between the frozen northern reaches and the temperate lands of the Middle Sea.

### Position and Extent

- **Northwest terminus**: Meets the eastern tip of the Nysanna Range at approximately a 120-degree angle
- **Southeast terminus**: Ends near Adron, where the mountains give way to the coastal states of the Middle Sea
- **North**: The Celedrim Plains and their forests (Winterwood, Plutochranes) lie beyond the range
- **South**: The temperate Middle Sea region and its coastal kingdoms

### Climate Barrier

The Kharvorn acts as a critical climate boundary. North of the range lies perpetual winter—the frozen steppes of the Celedrim Plains. South of the range, the climate warms dramatically, supporting the agricultural lands and trading cities of the Middle Sea coast. The peaks are white-capped with heavy snowfall, while the foothills transition into the brown and green of the lower lands.

### Sub-Ranges

The Kharvorn comprises numerous distinct mountain ranges along its length, from northwest to southeast:

- **Pelmar Mountains**
- **The Knives**
- **Nirvanis Mountains**
- **Aquendrakons**
- **Gymelstik**
- **Argysis** (Winterwood Forest lies to its north)
- **Hephake**
- **Myorna** (Plutochranes Forest lies to its north)
- **Ngül**
