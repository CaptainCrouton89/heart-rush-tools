## Argysis

Tags: mountains, dwarven, dragon territory

Argysis is a sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains that once housed one of the great dwarven kingdoms. It has been conquered by the black dragon Rothogomos, who now rules from the ruined capital of Othyndria. The population—mostly Shyka dwarves—have been brainwashed over generations to worship their conqueror as a savior.

### The Dragon's Domain

Rothogomos seized Argysis roughly two centuries ago, betraying his brother Tepheranos (who now rules Anarak to the south) to claim both the kingdom and its treasury. The dragon has transformed what was once a prosperous dwarven civilization into a militarized cult dedicated to his glory and focused on eventual revenge against his brother.

The surface of Argysis is dotted with abandoned holds, collapsed tunnels, and the ruins of what was once a thriving civilization. The dwarves who remain live in the functional portions of their ancestors' works, emerging only to serve Rothogomos's will.

### The Ruined Cities

Several major dwarven cities fell during Rothogomos's conquest and have never been reclaimed:

#### Othyndria

The former capital, now Rothogomos's lair. Othyndria was built around a natural spring—the source of Wisdom Creek—and its great halls once housed the treasures and archives of the Argysisean kings. Now it is a dragon's hoard, jealously guarded and rarely seen by any living creature except those summoned to serve.

The city's upper levels are destroyed, collapsed by dragon-fire during the conquest. The lower levels remain intact, filled with Rothogomos's accumulated wealth and whatever dark things have taken root in the centuries since.

#### Morphi

The second city of Argysis, Morphi was a center of learning and craft. Its great forges produced weapons and tools traded throughout the Kharvorn region. During the conquest, the city's defenders held out for nearly a year before Rothogomos simply buried them—collapsing the mountain passages and sealing the city with everyone inside.

Morphi is considered haunted. Those few who have found ways into the sealed city report that the forges still glow, that hammers still ring in the deep, and that the defenders never stopped defending—they simply stopped being alive.

#### Encaspius

The northern gatehouse of Argysis, Encaspius controlled access from the Celedrim Plains and the frozen north. It fell first during the conquest, caught unprepared by Rothogomos's sudden assault. The city is now truly abandoned—Rothogomos uses it only as a watchtower, stationing a small garrison to observe the northern approaches.

Of the three ruined cities, Encaspius is the most accessible and the least dangerous. Adventurers sometimes explore its empty halls, searching for treasures the dragon overlooked.

### Dryenthia Valley

The Dryenthia Valley cuts through the heart of Argysis, running roughly east-west between the mountain peaks. Before the conquest, this valley housed farms, orchards, and the small settlements that fed the great cities. Now it is largely abandoned—the population consolidated into defensible positions closer to Othyndria.

The valley floor is still fertile, but few dare work it. Rothogomos patrols his domain from above, and anything that catches his attention tends to be eaten.

### Wisewatch

At the headwaters of Wisdom Creek, overlooking the ruins of Othyndria from a safe distance, stands Wisewatch—a small fortification that predates even the Argysisean kingdom. The watchtower was built by an unknown people to observe the spring that would later become Othyndria's heart.

Now Wisewatch serves as a gathering point for those who oppose Rothogomos—scholars studying the old kingdom, Hephakean agents, dwarven resistance fighters, and mercenaries seeking to loot the ruins. The dragon knows of their presence but seems to find them amusing rather than threatening. So far.

### Pact of Barrik

The Pact of Barrik is a statue of two dwarven kings, standing back to back, one holding a battleax, the other holding a book. These corresponded to the Hephakean and Argysisean kings respectively.

The statues are said to imbue wisdom in those who spend time aroudn them. Children from both kingdoms would visit the statue, and princes would spend days in meditation around them. When Argysis was conquered by Rothogomos, this was no longer safe, and the tradition died out.

### Blueshale Peaks

A mountain range northwest of Argysis proper, positioned on an earth leyline.

#### Stormfather

In the Blueshale Peaks dwells Stormfather, an earth-attuned cyclops of tremendous power. Before Argysis fell to the dragon Rothogomos, Stormfather served as a counselor to the Argysisean dwarves, offering wisdom and aid in times of need.

Stormfather remains in the peaks, a powerful ally to those who can earn his favor. He will trade his help for gems and stories of the world—the more compelling the tale, the more willing he is to assist. Alternatively, those brave (or foolish) enough can challenge him to an arm-wrestling match. Victory earns his respect and aid, though few possess the strength to best a cyclops of his might.

### Winter Lake

A frozen lake in the northwestern reaches of Argysis, nestled in a high cirque near the sealed city of Morphi. Before the conquest, Winter Lake hosted the Argysisean ice-fishing festival—clans would gather each deep winter, drill through the ice, and compete for the largest catch. The winner received a blessing from the king and bragging rights until the next year.

Now the lake serves darker purposes. Rothogomos uses Winter Lake as a disposal site. Those who displease him—traitors, failed servants, anyone who catches his attention on a bad day—are dropped through holes in the ice. The dwarves have a phrase for it: *going to Winter Lake*. They say it quietly, like a prayer for the dead.

The lake never fully thaws, even in the brief mountain summer. Local whispers suggest the bodies have accumulated for so long that something has begun to coalesce in the cold water—not undead exactly, but a collective presence, a weight of frozen grievance pressing against the ice from below. The dragon finds this amusing. He sometimes flies low over the lake just to feel whatever is down there flinch.

### Mordon Basin

A wide, flat basin in the western reaches of Argysis, once home to the famed Mordon vineyards. The dwarves of Argysis adapted traditional winemaking to alpine conditions, producing a pale, sharp vintage called *frostbite wine* that was prized throughout the Kharvorn region and beyond.

Rothogomos burned the vineyards during the conquest. The terraced hillsides remain, overgrown with wild grapes that no one harvests. A few desperate souls occasionally try to reclaim a patch—make wine, sell it to smugglers, buy passage out of Argysis. Most are caught and made examples of. Some aren't.

The basin's strategic importance outweighs its agricultural value. Mordon is the widest flat ground in Argysis, the only place where a large army could muster or a dragon could land without folding his wings awkwardly. Rothogomos keeps it deliberately empty for this reason. If war comes with Anarak, Mordon Basin will be the staging ground.

### South Passage

The primary route connecting Argysis to Hephake and the lowlands beyond, a narrow defile cutting between towering peaks. A series of toll-gates and checkpoints line the passage, their stonework predating the dragon conquest by centuries.

Under Rothogomos, the passage is technically open but heavily surveilled. Everyone entering or leaving Argysis passes through checkpoints manned by brainwashed dwarven soldiers who report directly to the dragon. Tariffs are high, searches are invasive, and certain goods (weapons, maps, written materials) are forbidden entirely.

Smugglers use alternate routes: the goblin-controlled tunnels through Gymlstik (expensive but reliable) or the treacherous high passes where weather kills more travelers than bandits. Hephakean merchants grudgingly accept the official route's costs as the price of maintaining trade with their lost cousins.

The passage is also the most likely invasion corridor if Hephake ever decides to "liberate" Argysis—or if Rothogomos decides to expand south. Both possibilities keep the checkpoint garrisons alert and the fortifications maintained.

### Wisdom Creek

Wisdom Creek flows from the spring at Othyndria (the ruined capital, now home to Rothogomos the cruel dragon) down into the valley between Argysis and Hephake. The river earned its name from the great wisdom that once flowed from the Kings of Argysis when the dwarven kingdom was at its height.

The water flows northeast, eventually reaching Enros Lake, a large lake just south of the Jotun Hills—a mountain range stretching east-west from Winterwood in the west to the southwest edge of Konai Mora.
