## Ngül Mountains

Tags: mountains, giants

The northern arm of the Gül Mountains, forming the upper boundary of the Breidleheis basin. The Ngül range is the most heavily settled of the three Gül ranges, with the majority of Güli giant clans claiming traditional territories among its peaks and valleys.

### Geography

The Ngül are lower and more weathered than the central Kharvorn peaks, their slopes gentled by millennia of wind and ice. Deep valleys cut between the mountains, providing sheltered grazing land for the giant herds. The northern faces drop steeply toward the lowlands of Camaran and Adron.

### Giant Holdings

Most Güli clans maintain permanent winter lodges in the Ngül valleys—massive stone structures sized for giants, often built into cliff faces or around natural hot springs. Summer sees the clans disperse across the basin to follow their herds, but winter draws them back to ancestral territories passed down through generations.

The largest concentration of giants lives in the eastern Ngül, near Gülheim. Proximity to the king brings prestige (and obligations), making these territories the most contested in inter-clan politics.

### Tanim Oscurus

The western reaches of the Ngül overlook a region the giants call **Tanim Oscurus**—the Dark Grazing. This area, sloping down toward the lowlands, was once giant territory. Three centuries ago, something drove the clans out. The giants do not speak of what happened, but they no longer graze their herds there, and young giants are forbidden from descending the western slopes alone.

Lowlanders who have explored Tanim Oscurus report finding it unremarkable—empty grassland, a few ruins, nothing obviously wrong. But they also report feeling watched, and a persistent sense that they should leave before nightfall.
