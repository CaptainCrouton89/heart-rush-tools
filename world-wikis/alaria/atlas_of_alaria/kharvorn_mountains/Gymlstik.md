## Gymlstik

Tags: mountains, goblin territory

Gymlstik is a sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned between the Blueshale Peaks to the northwest and the Aqueandrekons to the southeast. Once a dwarven stronghold, it has been conquered by goblins and Cirthikin—large, burrowing, praying-mantis-like creatures—who have transformed the mountains into a vast underground domain.

### Geography

The surface of Gymlstik appears relatively normal—rugged mountain terrain with sparse vegetation, rocky slopes, and the occasional abandoned dwarven outpost. The true nature of the region lies beneath. The goblin and Cirthikin inhabitants have carved an enormous tunnel network that extends for hundreds of miles underground, connecting mines, hidden lairs, and underground fortresses in a labyrinthine system that no outsider has fully mapped.

The primary surface feature is the North Passage—a treacherous but navigable route through the mountains that connects the lands north of the Kharvorn to those in the south. Travelers using the North Passage must contend with goblin toll-collectors, rockslides, and the ever-present risk of Cirthikin ambush.

### The Surry Dwarves

When the goblins and Cirthikin conquered Gymlstik, the dwarven inhabitants were driven deeper underground rather than slaughtered outright. Over generations, these refugees have become the Surry dwarves—pale, twisted creatures barely recognizable as their ancestors. They survive in the deepest tunnels, scavenging what they can and avoiding their conquerors. Some say they've developed new abilities suited to absolute darkness; others claim they've simply gone mad.

The relationship between the surface goblins and the deep Surry is unclear. Some goblin tribes hunt them for sport; others trade with them for resources only the deep places provide.

### Gruthnik's Rest

At the northern edge of Gymlstik, where the mountains begin their descent toward the Temple of Icefire, lies Gruthnik's Rest—a flat-topped peak that serves as a waystation for those traveling the North Passage.

The "rest" was named for Gruthnik, a legendary goblin chieftain who supposedly achieved something no other goblin had: peaceful old age. According to goblin legend, Gruthnik was so cunning and so feared that no rival dared challenge him, and he died in his sleep at an age goblins consider impossibly ancient. His burial mound sits atop the peak, and goblins consider the location sacred—one of the few places in Gymlstik where travelers can camp without fear of attack.

The tradition holds, mostly. Goblin guides who lead travelers through the North Passage often camp at Gruthnik's Rest, and violence there is considered extremely bad luck. However, the Cirthikin recognize no such taboo, and their hunting parties sometimes ignore the sanctuary.

### Blueshale Approaches

The northwestern edge of Gymlstik borders the Blueshale Peaks, where the Stormfather—an earth-attuned cyclops of tremendous power—makes his home. The goblins give this border a wide berth. Whatever ancient understanding exists between the Stormfather and the mountain's other inhabitants, the goblins have learned not to test it.
