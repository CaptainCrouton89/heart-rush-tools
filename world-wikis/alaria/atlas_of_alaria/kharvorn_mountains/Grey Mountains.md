## Grey Mountains

Tags: mountains, Mnurvlyon

A sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains positioned between Hephake and Myorna, named for the perpetual overcast that shrouds their peaks. The Grey Mountains are sparsely populated, heavily forested at lower elevations, and home to things that prefer to avoid the attention of their more powerful neighbors.

### Geography

The Grey Mountains are mid-sized by Kharvorn standards—not as dramatic as the central ranges, but substantial enough to form a barrier between the dwarven and Sivakr territories. Dense pine forests climb the lower slopes, thinning to alpine meadows and bare rock above. The peaks rarely see direct sunlight; heavy cloud cover is the norm year-round, giving the range its name.

### The Mnurvlyon

The Grey Mountains' most notable inhabitants are the **Mnurvlyon**—a people born of ancient unions between mountain giants and Kharvorn dwarves. They stand eight to ten feet tall, broader and more heavily built than either parent race, with the durability of both.

The Mnurvlyon live in scattered steadings throughout the Grey Mountains, neither fully accepted by giants nor dwarves. They are taciturn, isolationist, and deeply suspicious of outsiders. Their settlements are built into mountainsides, part giant hall and part dwarven hold, sized for their unusual frames.

They mine, they forge, they keep to themselves. Trade with lowlanders is minimal and conducted at arm's length—literally, through window-slots in their steading walls. They have no interest in Hephakean politics, Myornan intrigues, or the broader conflicts of the world. They want only to be left alone.

This wish is not always granted. Both Hephake and Myorna have attempted to bring the Mnurvlyon into their spheres of influence. Both have failed. The half-giant-dwarves are too few to be worth conquering and too stubborn to be worth negotiating with.

### The Bears

The Grey Mountains are home to enormous cave bears—fourteen feet at the shoulder, territorial, and utterly unafraid of anything. The Mnurvlyon have reached an understanding with the bears over generations: certain valleys belong to the bears, certain valleys to the Mnurvlyon, and the boundaries are respected by both sides.

Outsiders who wander into bear territory rarely survive long enough to understand their mistake. The bears are not malicious—they are simply apex predators who do not distinguish between a lost traveler and a meal.

### The Howling

At night, especially during full moons, strange howls echo through the Grey Mountains. The Mnurvlyon bar their doors and refuse to discuss the matter. The few outsiders who have investigated report finding wolf tracks of unusual size, claw marks on trees at heights no natural wolf could reach, and occasionally, human belongings abandoned in the forest.

Whether the Grey Mountains harbor true werewolves, some other lycanthropic curse, or simply very large and very cunning wolves, the Mnurvlyon are not saying. They have clearly reached some accommodation with whatever hunts their mountains at night. Outsiders are not included in this arrangement.

### Relations

The Grey Mountains form a buffer zone between Hephake and Myorna—two powers that deeply distrust each other. Neither wishes to see the other control the passes through the Grey range, so both tacitly accept Mnurvlyon autonomy as preferable to the alternative.

The Mnurvlyon exploit this dynamic with quiet skill. They trade with both sides, favor neither, and ensure that any attempt at annexation would be more trouble than it's worth. Their isolation is a political choice as much as a cultural one.
