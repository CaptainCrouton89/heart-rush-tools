## Skyways

Tags: poi

### Key

**Light green**: Astral currents. Moving along these in the direction of the arrow does not require fuel.

**Light blue triangles**: Motorways. With only a couple hundred miles between astral currents, many merchants travel along these routes in order to get between major astral currents.

**Red triagles**: Skyports. These are skyports, at which it is easy to dock a skyship for long periods of time. Without a skyport, it is incredibly expensive to unload cargo.
