## Poum Titch

Tags: state, nation

A Scalawag goblin nation in southeastern Terrenia, wedged between the Green Mountains to the north, Aal Salma to the west, and the coastal waters of Whitefin Bay to the east. For generations, Poum Titch was known for its raucous festivals, its philosopher-poets, and its peculiar dual-capital system—a compromise that kept the peace between the coastal and inland Scalawag factions.

That peace is over.

### The Civil War

A massive civil war has erupted. The northern region has declared independence from the rest of the state, and what began as political grievance has become open slaughter. Armies are assembling. Villages burn. The roads are no longer safe.

The causes seem absurd to outsiders: disputes over festival rights, river toll allocations, and which capital gets to host the Philosopher's Congress. But beneath the theatrical grievances lie real fractures—northern Scalawags resent generations of taxation without representation, conscription quotas that fell disproportionately on their villages, and the perception that Tadinu's bureaucrats have grown fat while northern farmers starve.

The rebellion began when the northern council refused to send its tithe-wagons south. Tadinu sent tax collectors backed by armed escorts. The escorts never returned. Now the Stalking Fields run red, and both sides claim the other struck first.

### Settlements

#### Tadinu

The administrative co-capital of Poum Titch, an inland city of limestone warrens and bureaucratic complexity. While Lekia gets the festivals and the glory, Tadinu does the actual work of governance—tax collection, census-keeping, military logistics, and the endless paperwork of running a nation.

The city is built into and around soft limestone formations, with council chambers, treasuries, and archives carved directly into the pale rock. The Titch Council meets here in a natural amphitheater called the Hollow, where acoustics allow speakers to address hundreds without raising their voice.

The rebellion has cut Tadinu's northern trade roads. Food is rationed. The council debates endlessly while refugees crowd the southern districts. Some whisper that Tadinu's bureaucrats caused this war through decades of neglect; others insist the northern rebels are opportunists who smell weakness.

#### Lekia

The cultural co-capital, a coastal city on Whitefin Bay famous for its amphitheaters, festival grounds, and the Philosopher's Wharf—a long stone pier where Scalawag thinkers hold public debates, sometimes for days on end, drawing crowds who cheer arguments like sporting matches.

Lekia's harbor shelters fishing fleets and the ornate festival barges that carry revelers between coastal celebrations. The city's architecture favors open plazas and tiered seating, designed for performance and spectacle. Even the fish markets have stages.

The war has changed everything. Rebel-sympathizing ships blockade the harbor, strangling trade. The festival grounds have become refugee camps. The philosophers still debate on the Wharf, but now they argue about who deserves to die.

#### Goipin

A strategic crossroads city in the central region, where the Tyura River commerce meets overland trade routes. Before the war, Goipin was neutral ground—a place where northern and southern Scalawags did business without politics.

Rebel forces now occupy the city. It was here that the first blood of the civil war was spilled, when a tax dispute at the river wharves escalated into a massacre. The warehouses that once held trade goods now hold prisoners. Both capitals consider retaking Goipin essential to victory; neither has managed it.

#### Bobeitio

A southern city along the Mhunta River, the agricultural heart of loyalist Poum Titch. Grain barges from Bobeitio's irrigation networks feed Lekia and Tadinu both. The fields here are ancient, worked by the same Scalawag families for generations.

Since the war began, Bobeitio has become a loyalist stronghold and the primary supply depot for southern forces. Refugee camps have doubled the city's population. Food that once sold in markets now goes directly to army quartermasters. The farmers grumble, but they fear the northerners more than they resent their own government.

#### Uara

An eastern coastal town on Whitefin Bay, traditionally focused on fishing and salt-drying. Uara's Scalawags are more conservative than their western cousins—less interested in philosophy and festivals, more concerned with tides and catch yields.

Officially loyalist, Uara has avoided the worst of the fighting through geography and apathy. The town has become a smuggling hub, moving goods to both sides for anyone with coin. Some call this pragmatism; Tadinu's loyalists call it treason. So far, no one has forced the issue—Uara's fish and salt are too valuable to alienate.

### Geography

#### Ovuluria River

The lifeblood of Poum Titch—a major river flowing from the western highlands through the heart of the nation, connecting Tadinu to Lekia before emptying into Whitefin Bay. Control of the Ovuluria means control of trade, communication, and troop movement between the capitals.

Before the war, river traffic was constant: grain barges, passenger ferries, festival boats strung with lanterns. Now the river is contested. Loyalist patrols guard the southern stretches; rebel raiders strike from hidden coves. The fortress at Tuo, long abandoned, has become a flashpoint.

#### Tuo

A ruined fortress on the Ovuluria River, strategically positioned between Tadinu and the eastern territories. The fortress dates to an earlier age—some say pre-Scalawag, built by whatever people held this land before the goblins came.

Both sides want Tuo. Its walls still stand, its position commands river traffic, and whoever holds it controls the Ovuluria's middle reaches. Skirmishes have been fought in its shadow. So far, neither army has committed to a full siege. The ruins are said to be haunted, which gives even battle-hardened Scalawags pause.

#### Tyura River

A northern river flowing from the Green Mountains through rebel-held territory. The Tyura was once famous for its clarity—snowmelt from the mountains kept it cold and clean year-round. Micah Falls, where it tumbles over a 200-foot cliff face, was a pilgrimage site.

The rebels control the Tyura now. They've fortified the river crossings and collect tolls from anyone foolish enough to travel north. Rumor says they're diverting water to flood the Stalking Fields, turning the ancient battleground into a marsh.

#### Mhunta River

A southern river flowing through Bobeitio and the agricultural lowlands before reaching the coast. Warmer and slower than the Tyura, the Mhunta supports the irrigation networks that make southern Poum Titch the nation's breadbasket.

Loyalist forces patrol the Mhunta heavily. It's their supply line, their lifeline, the one river they cannot afford to lose. So far the rebels haven't pushed this far south—but if Goipin falls back into loyalist hands, the Mhunta will be the next target.

#### Mavriki River

An eastern river running through the hills toward Whitefin Bay. Less vital than the Ovuluria but still contested—whoever controls the Mavriki controls access to the eastern coast and the towns that depend on it.

The fighting here has been sporadic, more raids than battles. Both sides probe each other's positions, testing for weakness. The villages along the Mavriki have learned to hide when soldiers approach, regardless of which banner they fly.

#### Whitefin Bay

The major bay dominating Poum Titch's eastern coast, named for the silver-scaled whitefin fish that have sustained coastal communities for centuries. Whitefin is the primary protein source for most of the nation—smoked, salted, or fresh, it appears on every table.

The war has disrupted the fishing grounds. Naval skirmishes between loyalist and rebel vessels make open-water fishing dangerous. Catches are down. Prices are up. The coastal towns grow hungry, and hungry Scalawags grow desperate.

#### Stalking Fields

Open grasslands in the northwestern region, named for the tall grass that lets hunters—and warriors—stalk prey unseen. This has been Scalawag battleground for generations, a traditional place for armies to meet and settle disputes.

Ancient goblin burial mounds dot the fields, marking where previous conflicts ended. The current war has added fresh graves. Loyalist and rebel forces clash here regularly, neither able to hold the ground for long. The grass, they say, has turned red at the roots.

#### Troyt Loofos

A dense forest in the western reaches, known for its strange acoustics—sounds carry unpredictably, echoing from directions that make no sense. Some blame the trees; others whisper about fae influence or old magic sunk into the soil.

The rebels use Troyt Loofos for ambushes. Loyalist patrols enter and don't come out, or come out raving about voices in the trees. Military commanders have learned to go around rather than through. The forest has become a no-man's-land, belonging to neither side and dangerous to both.

#### Grayfang Mountains

Home to the Grayfang Goblins, a clan distinct from the Scalawags who use stone attunement to augment their teeth to enormous size. While many choose to enlarge their incisors into tusks, there's wide variation—some combine their front teeth into a single massive fang, others favor enlarged molars for crushing.

The Grayfangs have remained neutral in the civil war, watching from their mountain holds. Both sides have sent envoys seeking alliance. The Grayfangs have sent them back with polite refusals and not-so-polite warnings about what happens to armies that march through their territory.

#### Throatslit Mountains

Home to the Throatslit Murder Clan, descended from a single legendary goblin whose skill with knives became the foundation of an entire warrior tradition. The clan has ruled the mountain passes for generations through reputation alone—no army wants to fight knife-masters in terrain that favors ambush.

Like the Grayfangs, the Throatslits have stayed out of the civil war. Unlike the Grayfangs, they've been less polite about it. Envoys who push too hard don't return at all. Both sides have learned to route their armies elsewhere.

### What Will Go Wrong

The civil war will not end cleanly. Even if one side achieves military victory, the grievances that sparked the conflict will fester. Poum Titch faces:

- **Famine**: The war has disrupted planting, harvesting, and fishing. Winter will be brutal.
- **Refugee crisis**: Displaced Scalawags are flooding into Aal Salma, Windor, and even the Shacklands.
- **Intervention**: Outside powers may see opportunity in Poum Titch's weakness.
- **The fortress at Tuo**: Whatever haunts those ruins, both armies keep waking it up.
- **The Grayfangs and Throatslits**: Their neutrality has limits. Push them, and two veteran mountain clans enter a war that neither capital can afford to expand.
