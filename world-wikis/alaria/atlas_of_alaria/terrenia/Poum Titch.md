### Grayfang Mountains

Home to the Grayfang Goblins, goblins who use stone attunement to augment various teeth in their mouths to enormous size. Although many choose to enlarge their incisors, there is a wide range of teeth chosen, including versions where one's two front teeth are combined into a single, very large fang.
