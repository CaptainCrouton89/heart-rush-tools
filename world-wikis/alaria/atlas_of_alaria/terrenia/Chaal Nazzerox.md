### Mournful Wood

Extremely hazardous forest. You cry during the night, and your eyes seal shut as the tears solidify. People come out with tear stains crystalized down their fronts. Horrifying.

### Hagswood

A dark forest at the southwest tip of Chaal Nazzerox, home to a coven of hags who terrorize the surrounding waters.

#### Nightport

Hags from Hagswood leave from this eternally darkness-shrouded harbor. They venture out into the Strait of Curses when looking for prey or to communicate with the serpents that live there.

#### Strait of Curses

The waters south of Xabraedia and north of Hagswood are known as the Strait of Curses, named for the hags who prowl these treacherous waters. The strait is also inhabited by large, nasty serpents known as Silkwurms—creatures that can wrap entire ships in silk and knot them to the seafloor, dragging vessels and crews to their doom. The hags of Hagswood maintain an uneasy alliance with these serpents, communicating with them and occasionally working together to claim victims.
