## Chaal Nazzerox

Tags: state, nation

The largest state in Terrenia and one of its greatest horrors—an undead empire stretching from the western coast to the Crystal Mountains, ruled by the lich king Xynoth Azkonor. What was once a prosperous agricultural heartland is now a land of shambling dead, rotting cities, and the desperate living who serve or hide from their immortal master.

The empire is bounded by natural barriers on all sides: the sea to the west, the Crystal Mountains to the south, the Smokey Hills and their Firesworn defenders to the east, and the still-living states of northern Terrenia to the north. These barriers have contained the undead—for now. Xynoth's armies probe constantly for weakness, and his living servants work to build the navy that will let him break free.

Travel in Chaal Nazzerox is almost exclusively by river. The ground is soft, waterlogged, and refuses to hold roads. This has shaped the empire's geography—cities cluster along riverbanks, and whoever controls the waterways controls movement. The dead don't tire, but they're slow on soft ground. Barges are faster.

The land itself seems sick. Forests weep or frown. Hills are named for graves and bones. Lakes hold the drowned. Even the geography has absorbed the empire's nature, or perhaps it was always this way, and that's why Xynoth chose it.

### Central Forests

#### Mournful Wood

The largest forest in Chaal Nazzerox, sprawling across the north-central region between Deadman's Lake and the Grave Hills. The Mournful Wood earned its name through a phenomenon no scholar has adequately explained: those who sleep within its boundaries weep uncontrollably through the night. By morning, the tears have crystallized on their faces, sealing their eyes shut.

Victims emerge with tear-tracks of pale crystal running from their eyes to their chins—permanent if not carefully removed. Some have gone blind. Others have been found wandering the forest's edge with their entire faces encased, suffocated by their own sorrow.

The undead pass through the Mournful Wood without difficulty. They don't sleep. They don't weep. Whatever curse afflicts this place targets only the living, which makes it an effective barrier between the northern territories and the south. Refugees fleeing the capital must go around—adding days to their journey and increasing the chance of capture.

#### Spiritwood

A forest in the northeast where something has gone wrong with the natural order of death. Spirits linger here—not undead (those are shadow-bound corpses), but actual spirits, the consciousness and identity that should have faded to Celestia. They didn't. They stayed.

The spirits of Spiritwood are not friendly. They remember their deaths, their murderers, their betrayals. Some were killed by Xynoth's forces. Others died in the chaos before the empire consolidated. A few are older still, remnants of whatever people lived here before. They hate the living for still being alive and hate the undead for being a mockery of what they've become.

Even Xynoth's forces avoid Spiritwood. The spirits cannot be commanded—they have no shadows to bind—and they're vicious to anything that enters. The forest has become a de facto no-man's-land, dangerous to both sides of any conflict.

#### Frowning Forest

A twisted woodland in the east where the trees grow in downward-curving shapes, their branches drooping like disapproving brows. Local legend claims the forest watched something terrible happen and has worn the expression ever since.

The Frowning Forest is not actively hostile like Spiritwood or Mournful Wood—it's simply oppressive. The trees block light. Sound carries strangely. Travelers report the constant sensation of being observed and judged. Most pass through as quickly as possible, though "quickly" is relative when every path seems to curve back on itself.

Refugees have learned to use the Frowning Forest as a hiding place. The undead can navigate it, but they're slow and easily confused by the twisting paths. A living person who knows the routes can stay ahead of pursuit for days.

### Hills and Highlands

#### Grave Hills

The heart of Chaal Nazzerox's horror—a region of ancient burial grounds, mass graves, and earth that refuses to keep its dead. The Grave Hills are where Xynoth first raised his armies, drawing on centuries of accumulated corpses to build an unstoppable force.

The hills still produce. Fresh graves empty themselves within days. Bodies buried elsewhere sometimes claw their way toward the Grave Hills, drawn by whatever power saturates the soil. The living population learned long ago not to bury their dead here—they burn them instead, when they can, and scatter the ashes over water.

Some scholars believe the Grave Hills were cursed long before Xynoth arrived, that he simply recognized and exploited existing necromantic potential. Others argue he created the effect through sheer accumulated death. Either way, the hills remain the empire's most reliable source of new soldiers.

#### Hills of Deoria

Central highlands named for a kingdom that no longer exists. Deoria fell to Xynoth's first campaigns, its people scattered or enslaved, its cities reduced to ruins now picked over by the undead.

The Hills of Deoria are largely empty—depopulated by war and never resettled. Crumbling villages dot the slopes, their inhabitants long dead or fled. Cave systems riddle the rock, used by refugees hiding from undead patrols. The caves connect in ways the empire hasn't fully mapped, allowing the desperate to move unseen between regions.

Occasionally, someone emerges from the Hills of Deoria with pre-empire artifacts—jewelry, weapons, records of a nation that was. These fetch high prices among collectors willing to deal with goods from the undead lands.

#### Steed Hills

A rocky highland in the west where the Gray Citadel stands—one of the last holdout fortresses against the undead empire. The hills were once famous for horse-breeding, producing cavalry mounts prized across Terrenia. That tradition is extinct now; the horses were eaten during sieges or taken by the empire.

The terrain favors defense. Rocky outcrops, narrow passes, and poor footing make the Steed Hills difficult for shambling undead armies to traverse. The Gray Citadel was built here precisely because the land itself resists assault. So far, it has held.

#### Brevldorf Hills

Northeastern hills where scattered settlements still cling to existence by paying tribute to the empire. The people of Brevldorf learned early that resistance meant death—or worse, undeath in the lich king's armies. They chose survival.

Tribute takes the form of food, labor, and occasionally slaves. Villages that meet their quotas are left alone. Those that don't are made examples. The population has learned to hide their healthiest members when the collectors come, offering the old and sick instead. It's grim arithmetic, but it's kept them alive.

Resistance cells occasionally form in the Brevldorf Hills, young people who refuse to accept this existence. They rarely last long. The empire has informants everywhere, and the punishment for rebellion is applied to entire villages.

#### Prowling Hills

Southern highlands near the Crystal Mountains, where something hunts. Travelers report being stalked through the rocky terrain—not by undead, who are too clumsy for this landscape, but by something faster and more deliberate.

The most common theory is mountain predators descended from the Crystal ranges—cats, wolves, or something worse that found easy prey in the refugees trying to cross south. Others believe living resistance fighters use the Prowling Hills as a base, preying on empire supply convoys. A few whisper about older things, creatures that lived in these hills before humans came and resent all intruders equally.

Whatever prowls here, the undead armies have trouble in this terrain. Their shambling gait catches on loose rock, and they lack the awareness to spot ambushes until it's too late. The Prowling Hills remain unconquered—not because anyone defends them, but because the cost of conquest exceeds the value.

### Lakes and Waterways

#### Deadman's Lake

A lake in the north-central region, so named for the bodies that fill its depths. The drowned dead of Chaal Nazzerox sink to the bottom of Deadman's Lake and stay there—preserved by the cold, dark water, never rising as undead despite the empire's necromantic saturation.

Scholars have theorized about why. Perhaps the water blocks whatever signal animates the dead. Perhaps the lake predates Xynoth's influence and carries older protections. Perhaps the drowned simply can't find their way out of the depths. Whatever the reason, Deadman's Lake is one of the few places in the empire where a corpse stays a corpse.

This has made the lake perversely valuable. The living sometimes dispose of their dead here, preferring true death to the alternative. The empire disapproves—every corpse in the lake is a soldier denied—but enforcement is difficult. The lake is large, the shores are many, and the dead don't report who dropped them in.

Gorvul Mkayin sits on the lake's southern shore, built there specifically to control access.

#### Sethlund Lake

The largest of the three western lakes near Hagswood, Sethlund has become hag territory. The coven uses its waters for rituals, its shores for camps, and its depths for disposing of victims. Fishing boats haven't worked these waters in decades.

The lake's surface often carries an oily sheen—residue from hag magic or something fouler. Locals claim the water itself has become poisonous, that anyone who drinks it falls under the hags' influence. True or not, no one tests the theory voluntarily.

#### Seron Lake

The middle of the three western lakes, smaller than Sethlund but deeper. Something lives in Seron Lake's depths—something large enough to create waves on windless days and old enough that even the hags of Hagswood treat it with respect.

The creature (if it is singular) has never been clearly seen. Fishermen in the time before the empire reported glimpses of scaled coils, massive shadows passing beneath their boats. Now, with the lake abandoned, it presumably feeds on whatever falls or is thrown in. The hags are suspected of making offerings.

#### Jabok Lake

The smallest and southernmost of the western lakes, Jabok is nearly dry—a muddy depression that fills only during heavy rains. Before the empire, villages surrounded it; now only their foundations remain, visible when the water level drops.

Some say the villages drowned when the lake rose unexpectedly, their populations becoming its first residents. Others claim the empire drained the lake deliberately, exposing the villages to destruction, and that the water has never fully returned. The truth is likely more mundane—climate shifts, upstream damming—but in Chaal Nazzerox, every tragedy acquires supernatural explanation.

#### The Rivers

The empire's highways. With no roads and soft ground, all significant travel and transport moves by water.

**Melkron River**: The largest river, running roughly north-south through the heart of the empire. Controls access between the capital region and the southern territories. Heavily patrolled by undead barges.

**Yephrenzi River**: Northwestern river flowing out of Aal Salma territory. One of the few routes refugees use to escape north—dangerous, but faster than overland.

**Tozzelak River**: Northeastern river through Brevldorf Hills. Tribute barges use this route; so do slave transports.

**Matorkey River**: Eastern river flowing toward the coast. Less traveled, as it leads to more heavily controlled territory.

**Rojek River**: Northeastern tributary, connecting several highland settlements to the main river network.

**Caarl River**: Central river serving the agricultural regions—what agriculture remains. Grain barges still move on the Caarl, feeding the living population.

**Caarline River**: Southern tributary of the Caarl, running through the Prowling Hills region. Dangerous; convoys require heavy escort.

**Berrisund River**: South-central river connecting interior settlements. Subject to frequent raiding—whether by living resistance or something else is unclear.

**Pabacine River**: Southwestern river flowing toward Lutuya Sound. Used primarily by the hags and those foolish enough to trade with them.

**Segos River**: East-central river serving the Frowning Forest region. Notoriously difficult to navigate; the forest seems to move the riverbanks.

### Coastal Features

#### Hagswood

A dark forest at the southwest tip of Chaal Nazzerox, home to a coven of hags who terrorize the surrounding waters. The hags were here before the empire—they welcomed Xynoth's rise, seeing opportunity in chaos, and have carved out a domain within his domain.

The relationship between the lich king and the Hagswood coven is unclear. They're not his servants; hags answer to no one. But they're not his enemies either. Some arrangement exists—territorial, transactional, or simply mutual disinterest. The hags get their hunting grounds; Xynoth gets whatever the hags provide in exchange.

The forest itself is perpetually dim, its canopy blocking even midday sun. Paths shift between visits. Travelers who enter without hag permission rarely leave at all.

#### Nightport

A harbor on the coast of Hagswood, perpetually shrouded in unnatural darkness. The sun doesn't reach Nightport—not because of clouds or canopy, but because darkness has seeped into the air itself. Visitors report a pressure on their eyes, a thickness to the shadows that defies torchlight.

The hags of Hagswood use Nightport as their launching point for raids into the Strait of Curses. Their boats—if they can be called that—drift out from the harbor on nights when Nyxara hangs dark, hunting ships that stray too close to shore.

A few living traders deal with the hags through Nightport, exchanging goods for services or safe passage. These traders are universally distrusted elsewhere, but their prices for certain commodities can't be matched.

#### Strait of Curses

The waters south of Xabraedia and north of Hagswood are known as the Strait of Curses, named for the hags who prowl these treacherous waters. The strait is also inhabited by large, nasty serpents known as Silkwurms—creatures that can wrap entire ships in silk and knot them to the seafloor, dragging vessels and crews to their doom. The hags of Hagswood maintain an uneasy alliance with these serpents, communicating with them and occasionally working together to claim victims.

Ships that must cross the Strait of Curses do so quickly, in convoy if possible, and never at night. Even then, losses are common. The hags seem to know which ships carry valuable cargo—or valuable passengers.

#### Lutuya Sound

A southwestern bay where the empire's attempted shipbuilding efforts have repeatedly failed. Xynoth needs a navy to break free of his geographic containment, and Lutuya Sound has the deep water and sheltered anchorage to support one. The problem is the hags.

Every shipyard established in Lutuya Sound has been sabotaged, burned, or simply emptied of workers who vanished in the night. The hags apparently prefer their hunting grounds undisturbed by imperial naval traffic. Xynoth could force the issue—commit real resources to clearing Hagswood—but so far he's chosen to focus elsewhere. The standoff continues.

### Towns and Villages

The empire's smaller settlements—what remains of them. Most were thriving communities before Xynoth's rise; now they're labor camps, tribute stations, or empty ruins. The living population in these places exists to serve the empire's needs, nothing more.

**Zornos**: A northeastern town in the Brevldorf Hills, serving as a collection point for tribute from surrounding villages. The living elite here are tax collectors backed by undead enforcers.

**Myavis Kaalthox**: An eastern town near the Frowning Forest, known before the empire for its woodworkers. Now produces coffins and siege equipment. The irony is not lost on the remaining craftsmen.

**Sharyakax**: A town east of the Hills of Deoria, uncomfortably close to the Melthrayn holdout. Functions as a forward observation post, watching for activity from the city-state. The garrison here is more alert than most.

**Nomos**: A central town on the Caarl River, once a market hub. Now processes agricultural goods from the surrounding slave farms. The granaries here feed the living population of several cities.

**Lepox Naan**: A south-central town that processes slaves arriving from the north before distribution to work sites. The holding pens are larger than the living quarters.

**Myrth**: A southern town near the Prowling Hills, perpetually on edge. Whatever hunts in those hills sometimes ranges this far north. The undead garrison here has unusually high turnover.

**Moartos**: A southwestern town serving as a waypoint between Pyaal Faras and the interior. Travelers bound for hag territory pass through here—if they're foolish enough to go.

**Iagyax**: A southern agricultural town where slave labor works the last productive farmland before the Crystal Mountains. The fields here haven't failed yet, which makes Iagyax valuable.

**Kuyakov**: A southwestern town on the Pabacine River, marking the edge of hag-influenced territory. Residents here have learned to leave offerings at the forest's edge. It seems to help.

**Esaavos**: A southern town that once served as a rest stop for travelers crossing to the Crystal Mountains. Now it's a military supply depot for the endless southern campaigns.

**Housan**: A small town in the agricultural south, unremarkable except for its survival. The living here keep their heads down and meet their quotas. That's all anyone can do.

**Hasaag**: A southeastern town near Eyovlix, housing support personnel for the mountain campaigns. Smiths, leatherworkers, healers—the trades an army needs that the dead can't perform.

**Kaffyak**: A southwestern village near the coast, half-abandoned. Those who remain fish the coastal waters and try not to attract attention from Hagswood.

**Soryla Navys**: A southern village in the foothills, named for a river that dried up generations ago. The population dwindles each year as quotas claim more than births replace.

**Toffertine**: A coastal village on Lutuya Sound, caught between the empire's shipbuilding ambitions and the hags who sabotage them. Residents have learned to be useful to both sides—a precarious balance.

### What Will Go Wrong

Chaal Nazzerox is contained but not defeated. The empire will eventually:

- **Break out through the Crystal Mountains**: The passes are defended, but undead don't tire. Eventually, numbers will tell.
- **Build a navy**: Whether through Lutuya Sound, captured ships, or some other method, Xynoth will reach the sea.
- **Consume the holdouts**: The Gray Citadel and Melthrayn cannot resist forever. Every siege weakens them; every fallen defender becomes an enemy.
- **Find new sources of shadow**: The empire runs on animated corpses, and corpses run out. Xynoth needs fresh bodies from somewhere.
- **Fragment further**: Xynoth is a lich—his spirit fractures with each death and rebirth. Eventually, what remains may not be sane enough to rule.
