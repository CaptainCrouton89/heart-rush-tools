## Aal Salma

Tags: state, nation

An old and careful nation on Terrenia's northwestern coast, Aal Salma has survived centuries by trading with everyone and trusting no one. Its people are merchants, sailors, and cartographers—pragmatists who measure wealth in ships and alliances in contracts. Where the Scalawags of Poum Titch throw festivals, the Salmani sign agreements.

The nation is shaped by its geography: the sheltered waters of Masaad Takid in the north, the tiered capital overlooking Prison Bay in the south, and the great Whitewood forest running along its eastern border like a natural wall. Aal Salma has always been a buffer state—between the chaotic interior and the ocean, between northern Terrenia and southern, between what people want and what they can afford.

Now, with Poum Titch tearing itself apart next door, that careful neutrality is being tested. Refugees pour across the border. Both sides of the civil war send envoys seeking support. And in the halls of Hillat Abu Hizam, the old families debate whether to help their neighbors—and what such help might cost.

### Settlements

#### Hillat Abu Hizam

The capital of Aal Salma, an ancient port city built in concentric tiers above the cliffs of Prison Bay. Its name means "Belt-Town" in the old trade tongue—a reference to the defensive walls that ring the city like bands on a barrel, each built higher than the last as the city grew upward.

The lowest tier holds the harbor, shipyards, and warehouses. Middle tiers contain markets, guild halls, and the famous School of Charts—a cartographic academy whose maps command premium prices across Aboyinzu. The highest tier belongs to the old merchant families, whose compounds look down on everything below.

Hillat Abu Hizam has never been conquered. Its walls are strong, its harbor defensible, and its rulers have always been willing to pay tribute rather than fight—then outlast their would-be conquerors through patience and commerce. The current crisis in Poum Titch worries them. Wars are bad for trade, and desperate neighbors make dangerous ones.

#### Zamrat Aqabah

A northern port city on Masaad Takid, Aal Salma's second city and its moral opposite. Where Hillat Abu Hizam is regulated and respectable, Zamrat Aqabah is neither. Deals that can't be done in the capital get done here. Questions aren't asked. Paperwork gets lost.

The city's warehouses hold goods of uncertain provenance—salvage from wrecks that may not have been accidents, cargo that changed hands under duress, items that certain parties would prefer not be traced. The harbor masters take bribes openly. The city watch takes larger ones.

Since the Poum Titch civil war began, Zamrat Aqabah has swelled with Scalawag refugees. Some are genuine displaced persons; others are smugglers, spies, and war profiteers. The city's criminal economy has boomed. Hillat Abu Hizam pretends not to notice, as long as the tariff revenues keep flowing south.

### Geography

#### Masaad Takid

A broad, sheltered bay or inland sea on Aal Salma's northern coast—warm, shallow, and rich with life. Pearl divers work its sandy bottoms. Fishing boats crisscross its calm waters. Trade ships move between Zamrat Aqabah and smaller coastal towns without risking the open ocean.

The bay's inlets and coves have always sheltered smugglers and, occasionally, pirates. Aal Salma's navy patrols when it can, but Masaad Takid has too many hiding places to control completely. The authorities mostly focus on keeping the main shipping lanes clear and let the margins police themselves.

#### Whisper River

The primary waterway connecting Zamrat Aqabah to Hillat Abu Hizam, flowing south through the Hiska Wissa forest. Named for the way sound carries over its glassy surface—conversations on the water travel farther than they should, a feature that makes the river's boatmen famously tight-lipped.

Villages cluster along the Whisper's banks, farming the fertile floodplains and fishing its waters. The river is Aal Salma's internal highway, carrying goods, people, and information between its two cities. Control the Whisper, and you control the nation's circulation.

#### Hiska Wissa

The inhabited forest between Zamrat Aqabah and Hillat Abu Hizam, through which the Whisper River flows. Unlike the deeper forests to the south, Hiska Wissa has been tamed—its trees selectively logged, its clearings cultivated, its trails maintained by the villages that shelter beneath its canopy.

The forest provides timber, game, and mushrooms to both cities. Its communities are small but prosperous, benefiting from river trade while avoiding the crowding and politics of urban life. In times of invasion, the Hiska Wissa villages have traditionally melted into the trees, waiting out whatever army marches through.

#### Whitewood

A vast forest of silver-barked trees running north-south along Aal Salma's eastern border, forming a natural boundary with Poum Titch. The wood of these trees is pale, almost white, and prized for shipbuilding—light, strong, and resistant to rot.

Logging camps work the northern reaches, sending timber down to Zamrat Aqabah's shipyards. The deeper portions of the Whitewood remain wild and largely unexplored. Travelers who stray from the main trails report disorientation, strange silences, and the sense of being watched. Most stay on the roads.

The Whitewood has become the primary route for refugees fleeing the Poum Titch civil war. They emerge from the tree line starving and traumatized, with stories of violence that grow worse with each wave.

#### Ashen Hills

A range of dry, pale hills running through Aal Salma's interior, named for their ash-colored stone and thin, dusty soil. Little grows here except scrub grass and hardy thornbushes. The hills are hot in summer, cold in winter, and unpleasant year-round.

Despite their barrenness, the Ashen Hills hold value. Salt deposits in the eastern reaches supply Aal Salma's preserving industry. Ancient caves riddle the rock, used variously by hermits, outlaws, and—allegedly—pre-human cultures whose carvings still mark the deepest chambers. Miners and scholars both venture into the hills, though neither finds exactly what they're looking for.

#### Hiska Baatos

A coastal forest in the southern reaches, between the Ashen Hills and the sea. Less dense than the Whitewood, Hiska Baatos is lightly settled by fishing communities and charcoal-burners who supply fuel to Hillat Abu Hizam.

The forest has a reputation for unremarkability—it's simply there, neither beautiful nor dangerous, a place people pass through without remembering. Some find this suspicious. Most don't think about it at all.

#### Hiska Sobada

An uninhabited forest south of Hillat Abu Hizam, dense and dark despite its coastal position. Locals avoid it. The official reason is dangerous terrain—ravines, sinkholes, unstable ground. The unofficial reasons are vaguer and more varied.

Some say the forest is haunted by the spirits of prisoners who died in Vadu Inat and washed ashore. Others claim something older lives in the Sobada, something that was there before Aal Salma was founded. The capital's authorities dismiss these stories but have never attempted to survey or settle the forest. When asked why, they change the subject.

#### Bonecrunch Hills

A troll-infested range on Aal Salma's western border, home to numerous troll clans who've lived there longer than humans have sailed these coasts. The hills get their name from what happens to travelers who ignore the warnings.

Aal Salma maintains an uneasy truce with the trolls—humans don't settle the hills, trolls don't raid the lowlands. The arrangement mostly holds. Occasionally, brave or foolish merchants venture into troll territory to trade for bone-work and hides, commodities the trolls produce in abundance. These traders either return wealthy or don't return at all.

Some troll mercenaries have found employment in Aal Salma's less reputable enterprises. They're expensive, unreliable, and terrifying—which makes them perfect for certain jobs.

#### Prison Bay

A southern bay below Hillat Abu Hizam, guarded by the island fortress of Vadu Inat. The bay serves as the primary anchorage for Aal Salma's small but well-maintained navy—enough ships to patrol coastal waters and discourage casual piracy, not enough to project power beyond their own shores.

The bay's name comes from its most famous feature, visible from the capital's upper tiers: the dark silhouette of Vadu Inat, where Aal Salma sends those it wants forgotten.

#### Vadu Inat

The prison island at the mouth of Prison Bay, a black rock fortress that has held Aal Salma's most dangerous and valuable captives for over three centuries. Its name translates roughly as "the Final Ledger"—a merchant's term for accounts that will never be settled.

Vadu Inat holds three categories of prisoner: pirates captured in Salmani waters, political prisoners whose continued existence serves some purpose, and those whose crimes are too embarrassing for public trial. The categories sometimes overlap. Escape is considered impossible—the currents around the island are treacherous, the guards well-paid, and the sharks well-fed.

The prison's most famous feature is its silence. Vadu Inat has no torture chambers, no public executions, no dramatic cruelties. Prisoners simply... remain. They're fed adequately, housed in cells that are uncomfortable but not inhumane, and left alone. Years pass. Decades. The outside world forgets them. This, the Salmani believe, is worse than any physical punishment.

Some cells have held their occupants for lifetimes. The oldest prisoner, it's said, was there when the fortress was built—though that's surely legend. The guards don't discuss inmates with outsiders. The inmates don't discuss anything with anyone.

### What Makes Aal Salma Interesting

- **Pragmatic neutrality**: Aal Salma deals with everyone—pirates, slavers, revolutionaries—as long as they pay and don't make trouble in port.
- **The refugee crisis**: Scalawag refugees strain resources and test Salmani patience. Some want to help; others want the borders closed.
- **Vadu Inat's secrets**: Who's actually in that prison? What deals keep certain prisoners alive?
- **Hiska Sobada**: The forest everyone avoids. What's actually in there?
- **The troll truce**: It's held for generations. What happens when it breaks?
- **Maps and knowledge**: The School of Charts knows things other nations don't. They're very careful about who gets to learn them.

### What Will Go Wrong

Aal Salma's careful balance is eroding:

- **The Poum Titch war will spill over**. One side or the other will demand Aal Salma pick sides. Neutrality will become impossible.
- **Zamrat Aqabah is out of control**. The criminal economy is now larger than the legitimate one. Eventually, Hillat Abu Hizam will have to act.
- **The trolls are restless**. Something is pushing them out of the deeper hills. Raids have increased.
- **Vadu Inat holds someone important**. Sooner or later, someone will come to retrieve them—or silence them.
- **The Whitewood refugees carry more than trauma**. Disease, enemies, and secrets cross the border with them.
