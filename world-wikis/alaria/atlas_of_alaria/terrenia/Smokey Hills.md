## Smokey Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills south of Poum Titch, east of Aal Salma, and north of Chaal Nazzerox that have ceaselessly billowed smoke and ash for decades. The cause remains a mystery—theories range from massive forges inside the hills (operated by dwarves, goblins, or cyclops) to ongoing volcanic activity.

The hills are inhabited by the Firesworn, who have adapted to life amid the constant smoke and heat. The perpetual haze makes the region dangerous to navigate, and the true nature of what produces the endless smoke remains unknown.
