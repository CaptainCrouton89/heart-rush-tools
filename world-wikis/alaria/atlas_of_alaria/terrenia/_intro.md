# Terrenia

## Geography

Terrenia occupies the northwestern reaches of Aboyinzu, a region of temperate states stretching from the coast down to the Crystal Mountains. This is the gateway to the continent—the first landfall for ships crossing from the Shacklands or Free Isles, and the most "civilized" portion of Aboyinzu.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Coastal waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands; the Free Isles lie further west
- **East**: Transitions into Central Aboyinzu and the vast interior
- **South**: Bordered by the Crystal Mountains, which separate Terrenia from the southern regions
- **West**: Western coastline facing the open ocean

### States (North to South)

- **Aal Salma**: The northwesternmost state of Terrenia
- **Windor**: South of Aal Salma
- **Green Mountains**: A small mountain range separating Windor from Poum Titch
- **Poum Titch**: South of the Green Mountains
- **Chaal Nazaerox**: A massive state stretching from the east coast all the way to the west coast, positioned north of the Crystal Mountains. This is one of the largest political entities in Aboyinzu.

### Connection to Central Aboyinzu

East of Chaal Nazaerox lie Grustos and Quintas, two more states that serve as the transition zone between Terrenia and the interior regions around the Deadloop inner sea.
