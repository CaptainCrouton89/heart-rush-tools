## Windor

Tags: state, nation, region

Windor occupies the northern coast of Terrenia, a wedge of fertile lowland backed by the forested bulk of the Green Mountains. The land slopes from mountain foothills in the south down to a rocky coastline in the north, cut by rivers draining snowmelt toward the sea. It's a country of orchards and pastures, stone-walled villages, and distant peaks that always seem closer than they are.

The Windorf halflings who call this place home have shaped it into something comfortable—roads well-maintained, inns frequent, hedgerows trimmed. But the mountains loom. Smoke rises from unseen valleys. And every village within a day's walk of the treeline keeps its gates sturdy and its signal fires ready.

### Geography

**The Lowlands** stretch from the mountain foothills to the coast, a patchwork of small farms, orchards, and grazing land. Rivers wind through shallow valleys, powering mills and feeding irrigation channels. The soil is good here—dark and loamy in the river bottoms, stonier on the hillsides. Apple orchards are common, as are sheep and goats.

**The Coast** is rocky rather than sandy, with small fishing harbors carved into natural inlets. The water is cold year-round. Villages like Hanssevelde and Gorstraat work the sea for cod, herring, and crab, trading their catch inland for grain and goods.

**The Mountain Fringe** marks where farmland gives way to rocky slopes. Villages here—Vaken, Comines, settlements along the hill roads—live with one eye always on the heights. The air is thin and cold. And the trolls come down when they're hungry.

### Climate

Windor has cool summers and bitter winters. Snow blankets the mountains from mid-autumn through late spring, and the lowlands see their share of frost. Spring brings flooding as snowmelt swells the rivers. Autumn is the kindest season—harvest time, when the orchards hang heavy and the roads are dry.

Fog rolls off the coast on many mornings, especially in spring and autumn. The mountain passes become impassable by early winter and don't reliably open until late spring.

### Roads and Travel

The main road runs from Nylen northeast through Roye toward the Aal Salma border at Gorstraat. Secondary roads connect the lowland villages in a loose web. Most are dirt, muddy in spring, dusty in summer, frozen solid in winter.

Mountain roads are another matter. The passes into the Green Mountains are steep, winding, and treacherous even in good weather. Goat tracks and old mining roads push into the lower slopes, but few go deep. The Windorf don't encourage casual travel into troll country.

Travel times (on foot, good weather):
- Nylen to Roye: 2 days
- Nylen to Biesestraat: 1 day
- Nylen to Vaken: half a day
- Coast villages to Nylen: 2-3 days
- Any mountain pass: add half again the distance in time, and bring guards

### Settlements

#### Nylen (Capital)

The largest settlement in Windor sits where the main road from the south meets the primary pass into the Green Mountains. Nylen grew up around this crossroads—first as a waystation, then a market town, now the seat of the Council of Chairs.

The town spreads across both banks of the Tyarah River, connected by three stone bridges. The Council Hall dominates the eastern bank, a sprawling complex of meeting chambers, archives, and the Bureau of Fortune where luck-blessers train and ply their trade. The western bank holds the main market, the craftsman's quarter, and most of the inns.

Nylen has walls—not tall ones, but solid, maintained out of habit rather than immediate necessity. The trolls rarely come this far down. But the Windorf remember when they did.

#### Roye (Town)

The only other settlement large enough to call a town, Roye sits in the northeastern lowlands where several secondary roads converge. It serves as the market hub for the eastern villages and the coastal settlements, handling the fish trade that flows inland and the grain that flows out.

Roye is smaller than Nylen and less concerned with politics. The locals joke that Nylen talks while Roye works. The town has a reputation for practical folk who care more about getting things done than debating about it.

#### Villages

The remaining settlements are villages, ranging from a few dozen families to a few hundred. They cluster in three rough groups:

**Coastal Villages** (Hanssevelde, Gorstraat, Mazits): Fishing communities along the northern shore. Gorstraat handles most trade with Aal Salma. Hanssevelde is the largest fishing harbor. Mazits sits on a small peninsula, isolated but picturesque.

**Lowland Villages** (Biesestraat, Egelplas, Naast, Panottes, Gentbosch, Lavischois, Zalfen, Utsenstraat, Paperode, Bergwijk): Agricultural communities scattered across the farming country. Most are unremarkable in the best way—quiet, prosperous, boring. Biesestraat and Lavischois are the largest, serving as local market centers for surrounding farmsteads.

**Mountain-Fringe Villages** (Vaken, Comines, Aulnois, Schonburg, Hanset): Settlements along the forest edge where the lowlands meet the mountains. These are the frontline communities, the ones that see troll raids firsthand. They're more fortified than their lowland cousins—palisades, watch towers, gates that close at dusk. Vaken hosts a permanent Warden garrison. Schonburg has old walls from a previous era, when things were worse.

### Notable Features

#### The Tyarah River

The largest river in Windor, the Tyarah rises somewhere deep in the Green Mountains and flows northeast through Nylen before curving east toward the coast. It's navigable by small boats for much of its length, though rapids near the mountain foothills limit upstream travel.

#### Micah Falls

Where the mountains drop sharply toward the eastern lowlands, the Tyarah's tributaries cascade down in a series of waterfalls collectively called Micah Falls. The largest drop is nearly two hundred feet. The falls are visible from miles away on clear days, a white streak against the green mountainside. A small shrine to fortune stands at the base, maintained by travelers who survived the mountain crossing.

#### Clawsnatch Lake

A cold, deep lake high in the Green Mountains, Clawsnatch sits in a bowl-shaped valley surrounded by steep rocky slopes. The name comes from the claw-shaped peninsula that juts into the water from the western shore—or from something else, depending on who you ask.

The lake is remote, several days into the mountains, and few Windorf visit it willingly. Fishermen who've made the trip report excellent trout but an unsettling stillness. Something large lives in the depths. The Wardens don't deny it.

### Hazards

The obvious hazard is trolls—see the Green Mountains entry for details. Beyond that:

**Spring Floods**: The Tyarah and its tributaries overflow their banks most springs. Lowland villages are built on high ground, but roads wash out and fields flood.

**Mountain Weather**: The passes are deadly in winter and unpredictable in shoulder seasons. Blizzards can strike with little warning. Fog makes navigation treacherous.

**Wolves**: Common in the highlands, occasionally bold enough to threaten livestock in fringe villages. More nuisance than mortal danger, but they've killed travelers caught alone.
