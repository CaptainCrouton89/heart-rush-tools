## Alrock Ocean

Tags: region, ocean, ve

A vast ocean between Ve and the central continents, the Alrock is claimed entirely by the triton theocracy of Vetral—a claim no surface nation recognizes but few openly defy. The waters are contested, valuable, and dangerous: ancient shipping lanes weave between triton holy sites, Bfaspeen hunting grounds, and the rare surface islands that dot the expanse.

The Alrock's defining feature is the war beneath its surface. For generations, Vetral's tritons have fought the Bfaspeen broods for control of the deep. This conflict shapes everything above: shipping routes shift to avoid battle zones, insurance rates climb, and surface nations receive increasingly desperate diplomatic overtures from tritons who once considered them beneath notice.

### Vetral

The triton theocracy claims sovereignty over every drop of the Alrock. In practice, they control the central waters and enforce their "Old Lanes" system—ancient shipping routes that avoid sacred sites. Ships that follow the Lanes sail safely. Ships that stray have accidents.

Vetral is losing its war against the Bfaspeen. The Depths Conclave has begun reaching out to surface nations for alliance—something unthinkable a generation ago. So far, they've met mostly rejection.

See [Vetral](../../nations_and_powers/states/Vetral.md) for full details.

### Bfaspeik

The southern waters where the Bfaspeen broods lair. Warm volcanic vents heat the sea here, creating the thermal environment the eel-bodied horrors prefer. The water steams in places. The seabed glitters with centuries of sunken treasure.

Bfaspeik is not one territory but many—each major vent system claimed by a brood mother and her subservient males. Historically, the broods competed as much with each other as with outsiders. That's changing. Someone or something is organizing the matriarchs, coordinating their attacks against Vetral.

**The Hoards**: Every ship sunk in these waters for the past thousand years has been dragged down and picked clean. The brood mothers sit atop mountains of gold, gems, and artifacts they cannot use but pathologically covet. Some surface treasure hunters have made fortunes trading with Bfaspeen—but far more have become additions to the hoard.

**The Volcanic Labyrinth**: Beneath Bfaspeik, the seabed fractures into a maze of thermal vents, lava tubes, and superheated caverns. The Bfaspeen retreat here when pressed, into environments the tritons cannot survive. It's why Vetral has never managed to exterminate them.

### Keletus

The Lorean minotaur democracy occupying Apketrii island. Keletus produces the finest naval officers in the world—a fact that makes them valuable to everyone and allied to no one. King Varrosh maintains stubborn neutrality in the Vetral-Bfaspeik conflict, refusing both triton overtures and brood mother offers.

See [Keletus](../../nations_and_powers/states/Keletus.md) for full details.

### Apketrii

The mountainous island home to Keletus. The Diamondback Mountains run through its center, the Hallenfell range guards the northwest, and Blossom Valley provides the agricultural south. The southeastern peninsula—called the Long Reach—stretches toward Ve, its lighthouse towns watching the sea lanes.

The island's most mysterious feature is Hallenfell, where drowned ruins of a pre-minotaur civilization—the Kelemyr—emerge from cliff faces. Expeditions into the flooded halls rarely return.

### Shimmerpools

An area where pools of liquid light form and swirl among the waves. The luminescent water retains its glow for weeks after sun exposure. Alchemists and illusionists pay fortunes for Shimmerpool water—properly prepared, it produces the most potent illusions in the world.

The Shimmerpools drift. They're not a fixed location but a phenomenon that moves with currents no one fully understands. Ships that stumble into them report disorientation, lost time, and occasionally crew who step overboard convinced the glowing water is solid ground.

### Albersea Islands

A scattered archipelago in the northern Alrock. The islands are technically unclaimed—too far from Ve for easy governance, too remote for Vetral to care about. Various communities have settled here: refugees, pirates, hermits, and the occasional trading post.

#### Silver Grove

The largest Albersea island, named for the metallic-leafed trees that grow nowhere else. The leaves aren't actually silver, but they ring like bells when the wind blows. A small monastery maintains the grove, accepting pilgrims who wish to hear the "singing forest."

### Stonedrift

A navigational hazard and curiosity: a field of massive floating stones that drift through the central Alrock on unpredictable paths. The stones are porous volcanic rock, somehow light enough to float. Some are large enough to support vegetation. One supports a hermit's shack.

Ships navigate around Stonedrift carefully. The stones move slowly but unpredictably, and collisions are common. Some captains swear the stones deliberately block certain routes—as if they're herding ships toward something.

### Brightstone Mines

Underwater mines producing brightstone—crystal formations that emit brilliant, permanent light. The mines are deep, dangerous, and entirely triton-controlled. Vetral sells brightstone sparingly, keeping prices astronomical.

The stones are fragile as glass and must be harvested delicately. Broken brightstone goes dark permanently. This has led to elaborate underwater mining techniques and a lucrative smuggling trade in "cracked bright"—damaged stones that still glow faintly.

### Sunshatter Palace

A structure of impossible geometry hovering above the waves, home to a being called the Seahorse King—supposedly a god from another plane of existence. The Palace is the only place this entity can survive in Alaria; something about the intersection of sea, sky, and otherworldly geometry keeps it anchored to reality.

The Seahorse King grants audiences to those who reach the Palace, offering cryptic prophecies and occasionally material aid. What it wants in return is unclear. Visitors report that the interior of the Palace exists in more dimensions than the exterior suggests.
