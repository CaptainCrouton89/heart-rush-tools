### Bfaspeik

### Brightstone Mines

Underwater mines for brightstone—stones that give off brilliant light. Very hard to access, as the mines are deep underwater, and are somewhat fragile, like glass.

### Sunshatter Palace

Home to a seahorse/godking from another plane of existence. This is the only place they can survive.

### Keletus

A Lorean minotaur democracy known for producing the finest naval officers in the world. A new king is elected every decade with no restrictions on candidacy. Sailing is central to Keletan culture—minotaurs venture to sea in even the nastiest storms from a young age.

Relations between Keletus and Vetral are steadily deteriorating, as the Keletan king blatantly disregards Vetralian requests for cleared shipping lanes.
