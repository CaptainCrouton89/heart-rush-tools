# Northern Isles

## Geography

The Northern Isles are a broad, fragmented archipelago occupying the northeastern waters of Clueanda, scattered across the Ocean of Azeros. The island chain resembles the Canadian arctic archipelago—a wide, tall region of relatively large islands broken by narrow, icy straits and channels.

### Position and Extent

- **West**: The Frostmarch Peninsula forms the mainland anchor, transitioning from continental land into the island chain
- **South**: The Ocean of Azeros separates the isles from the Celedrim Plains coastline
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros extends beyond the islands toward the polar ice
- **East**: Open ocean

The Ocean of Azeros surrounds and permeates the archipelago, stretching from north of the Celedrim Plains across the entire top of this region.

### Climate

The islands are uniformly icy, though conditions worsen progressively toward the north. Even the southernmost islands remain frozen year-round, with ice floes clogging the channels between them. Navigation is treacherous—shifting pack ice, sudden storms, and the ever-present cold claim many ships.

### Major Islands

- **Pherezi Imnuttut**: The massive eastern landmass, roughly 1000 miles long, containing Blizrynthine, Giantfell, the Hills of Insanity, and the Timeless Wastes
- **Aknimchuk**: Northwestern volcanic island with the Ashy Mountains, Scheyolonae, and the only ice-free harbor in the archipelago
- **Potalaptuk**: Central island where Bzulakar's Keep dominates the landscape
- **Soki**: Island south of Potalaptuk
- **Friursus**: Northern island in the Iceberg Isles chain
- **Zemkachi**: Eastern island near Lightning Strait
- **Moon Dog**: Small island cluster in the central archipelago

### Seas and Straits

The Northern Isles are threaded with named bodies of water:

- **Whispering Sea**: The central waters of the archipelago, named for the unnatural quiet that Bzulakar's power has imposed—waves lap silently, and even storms seem muted here
- **Bruthweur Sea**: Eastern waters between the central islands and Pherezi Imnuttut
- **Iron Strait**: Southern passage connecting the Northern Isles to the Frostmarch Peninsula's northeastern waters
- **Lightning Strait**: Eastern passage near Zemkachi, known for sudden electrical storms
- **Passage of Hagol**: Western strait separating Aknimchuk from the mainland

### The Iceberg Isles

A chain of smaller, heavily glaciated islands stretching across the northern archipelago. These islands are essentially floating mountains of ice with rocky cores, calving massive icebergs into the surrounding waters. Navigation through the Iceberg Isles is nearly impossible—the shifting ice, hidden rocks, and freezing temperatures destroy most vessels that attempt it.

## Political Climate

The Northern Isles have no unified government and few permanent settlements. Power here is measured in individual might, not political organization:

- **Bzulakar** dominates the central archipelago through sheer magical supremacy. No one challenges him; no one could.
- **Gelnor** controls the Foggy Isles through ancient compact and fog-shrouded isolation
- **Pherezi Imnuttut** is essentially lawless—whatever creatures inhabit Giantfell and the Hills of Insanity answer to no authority
- **Aknimchuk's** small trading settlement operates on frontier justice and mutual necessity

The isles attract those who wish to disappear: exiles, criminals, mad wizards, and others who find civilization intolerable. They come here knowing they will likely die, preferring that to whatever awaits them elsewhere.

## What Makes It Interesting

The Northern Isles are a place of extremes and contradictions:

- Fire leylines creating infernos in frozen canyons (Blizrynthine)
- Time flowing wrong in the Timeless Wastes
- The most powerful lich on Alaria living in a 2-mile ice tower
- Volcanoes providing the only warmth for hundreds of miles (Aknimchuk)
- Magical amber washing up on frozen beaches
- A fog lich atoning for ancient sins in perpetual mist

For adventurers, the Northern Isles offer treasures and dangers found nowhere else—but the journey alone will kill most who attempt it.

## What Will Go Wrong

- Bzulakar decides to expand his influence beyond the isles
- Something stirs in the depths of the Timeless Wastes, where time has pooled strangely for millennia
- The Thermarifts of Blizrynthine grow unstable, threatening to crack Pherezi Imnuttut apart
- A new power arrives in the isles, challenging Bzulakar's dominion
- The creatures of Giantfell begin migrating south toward inhabited lands

## Notable Locations

### Bzulakar's Keep

In the very center of the Northern Isles stands [Bzulakar's](../../dramatis_personae/Bzulakar.md) domain—a 2-mile-high tower of permanently frozen ice where the ancient lich resides. His power has frozen the surrounding thousand-mile area and stilled the nearby seas to whispers. The tower is visible from much of the archipelago, a landmark and a warning.

### Foggy Isles

The most densely foggy islands in this half of the world. Home to an old Tuktuk named Gelnor who is paragon attuned to fog and water. Lives here eternally to atone for his sins (he's a lich, immortal).

On shore are giant hermit crabs that eat the algae off the rocks.

### Amber Coast

Located in Pherezi Imnuttut, the Amber Coast is a beach where beautiful amber minerals frequently wash ashore. These minerals possess magical properties, making them highly prized by mages and collectors. The constant flow of enchanted amber from the frozen depths creates a dangerous attraction—both for treasure seekers and the predators that hunt them along the icy shoreline.

### Blyzrynthine

A canyonland region in the north of Pherezi Imnuttut, bordered by the Hills of Insanity to the north and east, and the mountainous region of Giantfell to the south. A fire leyline passes through Blyzrynthine, superheating the canyons below.

#### Thermarift

Deep within the canyons of Crevakus in Blyzrynthine, huge fiery rifts tear through the ground. These Thermarifts are caused by the fire leyline running beneath the canyonlands, creating massive fissures that belch flame and superheated air. The ground far below in the canyon depths is covered with these fiery tears in the earth, making the deep canyons effectively impassable without magical protection from heat and flame.

### Timeless Wastes

Southwest of Blyzrynthine and west of Giantfell lie the Timeless Wastes—a frozen desert where time itself behaves strangely. Travelers cannot keep track of time accurately here; hours feel like days, days feel like hours, and aging progresses at unpredictable rates. Some emerge having aged decades in what felt like a day, while others spend what seems like weeks only to find mere hours have passed in the outside world. Everything about the Wastes feels wrong and disorienting, as if time itself has come unmoored from reality.

The River of Swords flows through the western Wastes—named not for any battle but for the way ice crystals form along its banks in blade-like formations that can slice through leather and flesh.

### Giantfell

The southern reaches of Pherezi Imnuttut are dominated by Giantfell—a mountainous region that earns its name. Giants dwell here, though what kind and how many remains unclear. Few explorers venture into Giantfell, and fewer return. Those who do speak of enormous shapes moving through the peaks, structures built for beings three times human height, and the constant threat of being stepped on by something that doesn't notice you.

The settlement of Themopolkrik clings to Giantfell's southern coast—a hardy fishing village that survives by staying beneath the giants' notice and fleeing to boats when that fails.

### Hills of Insanity

North and east of Blizrynthine, the Hills of Insanity roll across northeastern Pherezi Imnuttut. The name is not metaphorical. Something about this region affects the mind—travelers report auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and in severe cases, complete psychotic breaks. The effect worsens the longer one stays and doesn't fully fade for weeks after leaving.

Scholars have proposed various explanations: a curse from the early ages, contamination from the nearby Thermarifts, proximity to some buried entity, or simply the cumulative psychological toll of the Northern Isles finally manifesting. None have been proven. The hills remain largely unexplored, as expeditions tend to turn on themselves before accomplishing anything.

### Potalaptuk

The central island of the Northern Isles, forever in the shadow of Bzulakar's Keep. The 2-mile ice tower dominates the landscape so completely that the island barely has an identity beyond "the place where the lich lives." The ice around Potalaptuk never melts, never shifts—Bzulakar's power holds it perfectly frozen, a demonstration of control that extends for hundreds of miles in every direction.

No one lives on Potalaptuk who hasn't been permitted by Bzulakar. What that permission requires, and why anyone would seek it, are questions best left unasked.
