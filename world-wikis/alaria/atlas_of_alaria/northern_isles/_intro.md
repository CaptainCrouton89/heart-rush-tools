# Northern Isles

## Geography

The Northern Isles are a broad, fragmented archipelago occupying the northeastern waters of Clueanda, scattered across the Ocean of Azeros. The island chain resembles the Canadian arctic archipelago—a wide, tall region of relatively large islands broken by narrow, icy straits and channels.

### Position and Extent

- **West**: The Frostmarch Peninsula forms the mainland anchor, transitioning from continental land into the island chain
- **South**: The Ocean of Azeros separates the isles from the Celedrim Plains coastline
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros extends beyond the islands toward the polar ice
- **East**: Open ocean

The Ocean of Azeros surrounds and permeates the archipelago, stretching from north of the Celedrim Plains across the entire top of this region.

### Climate

The islands are uniformly icy, though conditions worsen progressively toward the north. Even the southernmost islands remain frozen year-round, with ice floes clogging the channels between them. Navigation is treacherous—shifting pack ice, sudden storms, and the ever-present cold claim many ships.

### Major Islands

- **Imnuttut**: The large white island in the most northeastern region—one of the largest landmasses in the archipelago
- **Pherezi**: A major island in the chain
- **Aknimchuk Island**: Located in the north, notable for its small range of active volcanoes—rare sources of heat in this frozen realm

### Bzulakar's Keep

In the very center of the Northern Isles stands [Bzulakar's](../../dramatis_personae/Bzulakar.md) domain—a 2-mile-high tower of permanently frozen ice where the ancient lich resides. His power has frozen the surrounding thousand-mile area and stilled the nearby seas to whispers. The tower is visible from much of the archipelago, a landmark and a warning.

### Foggy Isles

The most densely foggy islands in this half of the world. Home to an old Tuktuk named Gelnor who is paragon attuned to fog and water. Lives here eternally to atone for his sins (he's a lich, immortal).

On shore are giant hermit crabs that eat the algae off the rocks.

### Amber Coast

Located in Pherezi Imnuttut, the Amber Coast is a beach where beautiful amber minerals frequently wash ashore. These minerals possess magical properties, making them highly prized by mages and collectors. The constant flow of enchanted amber from the frozen depths creates a dangerous attraction—both for treasure seekers and the predators that hunt them along the icy shoreline.

### Blyzrynthine

A canyonland region in the north of Pherezi Imnuttut, bordered by the Hills of Insanity to the north and east, and the mountainous region of Giantfell to the south. A fire leyline passes through Blyzrynthine, superheating the canyons below.

#### Thermarift

Deep within the canyons of Crevakus in Blyzrynthine, huge fiery rifts tear through the ground. These Thermarifts are caused by the fire leyline running beneath the canyonlands, creating massive fissures that belch flame and superheated air. The ground far below in the canyon depths is covered with these fiery tears in the earth, making the deep canyons effectively impassable without magical protection from heat and flame.

### Timeless Wastes

Southwest of Blyzrynthine and west of Giantfell lie the Timeless Wastes—a frozen desert where time itself behaves strangely. Travelers cannot keep track of time accurately here; hours feel like days, days feel like hours, and aging progresses at unpredictable rates. Some emerge having aged decades in what felt like a day, while others spend what seems like weeks only to find mere hours have passed in the outside world. Everything about the Wastes feels wrong and disorienting, as if time itself has come unmoored from reality.
