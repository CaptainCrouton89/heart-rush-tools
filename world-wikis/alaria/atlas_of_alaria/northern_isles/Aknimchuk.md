## Aknimchuk

Tags: island, volcanic

Aknimchuk is the largest island in the northwestern Northern Isles, notable for being one of the few places in the archipelago where volcanic activity provides heat in an otherwise frozen realm. The island is divided into two distinct regions: the volcanic south and the frozen north.

### Geography

Aknimchuk stretches roughly 200 miles from north to south, separated from the mainland by the Passage of Hagol to the west and facing the open waters of the Northern Isles to the east. The island's southern half is dominated by the Ashy Mountains—an active volcanic range that provides the only natural warmth for hundreds of miles. The northern half, Scheyolonae, remains frozen year-round like the rest of the archipelago.

Smokey Bay cuts into the island's southern coast, its waters warmed by underwater volcanic vents. Ships that can navigate this far north sometimes shelter here, the only harbor in the Northern Isles where ice doesn't threaten to crush hulls.

### The Ashy Mountains

The Ashy Mountains are a range of active volcanoes running across central Aknimchuk. Unlike the fire-leyline heat of Blizrynthine far to the east, these are natural volcanoes—mountains of stone and fire that have been erupting for millennia. The peaks constantly emit smoke and ash, giving the range its name and leaving a grey pallor over the southern half of the island.

The volcanic activity creates a microclimate where life can survive. Hardy shrubs and mosses grow on the lower slopes, and hot springs dot the valleys between peaks. Strange creatures make their homes here—things that have adapted to the heat and cannot survive in the frozen wastes beyond.

#### Tomb of Angi

High in the Ashy Mountains, carved into the side of a dormant peak, lies the Tomb of Angi. Angi was a fire mage of tremendous power who lived centuries ago, choosing this volcanic island as her final resting place. The tomb is said to contain her accumulated knowledge of fire magic, along with whatever treasures she gathered in her long life.

The tomb is guarded by fire elementals and constructs of living magma—Angi's final creations, still loyal to their dead mistress. Expeditions have attempted to breach the tomb; few have returned, and none have reached its heart.

### Scheyolonae

The northern half of Aknimchuk, beyond the reach of volcanic warmth, is called Scheyolonae—a frozen expanse of tundra and ice that matches the rest of the Northern Isles in its brutality. The contrast between Scheyolonae and the volcanic south is stark; travelers moving north can feel the temperature drop degree by degree as they leave the mountains' influence.

#### Iceburn Lakes

A cluster of lakes in central Scheyolonae, the Iceburn Lakes are named for the peculiar sensation experienced by those who touch their waters—a burning cold that seems to freeze and scald simultaneously. The lakes never fully freeze despite the temperatures, and their waters glow faintly blue on moonless nights.

Local legend claims the lakes are the tears of a frost giant who died here in the early ages of the world. Whether true or not, the waters have unusual properties. Alchemists prize Iceburn water for certain cold-based concoctions, and some mages believe the lakes sit atop a minor convergence of water and ice magical energies.

#### Salamander Cave

Despite its name suggesting fire creatures, Salamander Cave in northern Scheyolonae is home to ice salamanders—pale, cold-adapted amphibians the size of large dogs that breathe frost rather than flame. The caves extend deep into the frozen earth, and the salamanders have carved out an extensive network of tunnels.

The ice salamanders are not aggressive unless provoked, but they fiercely defend their territory. Their frost breath can freeze exposed flesh in seconds, and they hunt in packs. Travelers who stumble into their caves rarely emerge.

### Smokey Bay

The southern bay of Aknimchuk, warmed by underwater volcanic vents, is the only reliably ice-free harbor in the Northern Isles. Ships from the south sometimes make the dangerous journey here to trade with the few hardy souls who have made Aknimchuk their home.

A small settlement—more trading post than town—clings to the shores of Smokey Bay. The inhabitants are a mix of outcasts, exiles, and those strange enough to prefer the volcanic island's isolation to civilization elsewhere. They trade in volcanic minerals, Iceburn water, and information about the Northern Isles for those foolish enough to venture further into the archipelago.
