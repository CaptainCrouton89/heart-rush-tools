# Rimihuica

Rimihuica dominates the center of Alaria. The Tarkhon-controlled strait guards its northern approach, which then spills into the Dunes of Kunagi and other desert badlands. Farther south the land rapidly shifts into lethal jungles, cloud-wrapped mountain chains, and the volatile Emerald Coast. The continent ends in the lawless Shacklands, where slave markets and pirate kings hold sway. Rimihuica is a study in contrasts—deserts, jungles, and frontier states separated by mountain walls and storm-lashed coastlines.
