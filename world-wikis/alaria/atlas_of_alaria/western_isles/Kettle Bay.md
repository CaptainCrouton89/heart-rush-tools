## Kettle Bay

Tags: bay, geography

A sheltered natural harbor at the base of the Cliffs of Shondromos—calm waters surrounded by honeycombed cliffs riddled with caves. An excellent anchorage if you don't mind what might be watching from the cave mouths.

### Geography

Kettle Bay is a roughly circular body of water, perhaps three miles across, partially enclosed by the Cliffs of Shondromos:
- **North**: The cliff faces and their cave openings
- **East**: More cliffs, curving around the bay
- **South**: The bay's entrance, opening to the Shattered Sea
- **West**: The outer Shondromos cliffs

The bay is deep enough for large vessels, sheltered from storms, and would be perfect harbor—except for the caves.

### The Caves

The Shondromos honeycomb opens into Kettle Bay through dozens of waterline cave mouths. Some are small openings barely visible above the waterline. Others are tall enough to sail a ship through, leading into the maze beyond.

**What Comes Out:**

- Smuggler vessels moving cargo after dark
- Small boats carrying supplies to cave-dwellers
- Guide services heading to or from cave expeditions
- Occasionally, things that no one wants to identify

**What Goes In:**

- Ships seeking shelter from storms (despite the risks)
- Merchants meeting contacts who prefer discretion
- Explorers attempting to map the cave system
- People who want to disappear

### The Anchorage

Ships anchoring in Kettle Bay follow unwritten rules:
- Post guards watching the cave mouths
- Anchor in the bay's center, away from the cliff faces
- Don't investigate unusual sounds from the caves
- Leave before dark if possible

These precautions exist because vessels that don't follow them occasionally have problems—crew members gone missing, cargo disturbed, or worse.

### No Government

Kettle Bay belongs to no one. It's technically in waters claimed by various powers, but no one enforces authority here. Ships anchor at their own risk; disputes are settled by those involved; and the caves provide escape routes for anyone who needs to disappear quickly.

This makes the bay useful for activities that don't survive official scrutiny. Black markets operate on anchored ships. Negotiations happen between parties who can't meet openly. Information changes hands for appropriate prices.

### The Guide Services

Several independent guides operate out of Kettle Bay, offering access to the Shondromos caves:

**Services Available:**
- Outer cave tours (relatively safe)
- Smuggling route access (expensive)
- Deep cave expeditions (dangerous, guides won't go far)
- Recovery operations (finding people or cargo lost in the caves)

The guides know the outer caves well. They maintain relationships with cave-dwellers who tolerate guided visitors. They also know when to turn back—the deeper caves are beyond their expertise, and they've seen what happens to those who push too far.

### What Brings People Here

- **Shelter**: Storm refuge for ships that can't reach safer harbors
- **Discretion**: Business that can't happen in public ports
- **Access**: Gateway to the Shondromos cave system
- **Freedom**: A place with no authorities and few rules
- **Disappearance**: Exit point for those who need to vanish
