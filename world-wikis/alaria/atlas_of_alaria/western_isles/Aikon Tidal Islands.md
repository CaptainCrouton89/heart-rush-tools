## Aikon Tidal Islands

Tags: archipelago, geography

A chain of low-lying islands north of Sheîr where the tides reshape reality twice daily. At high tide, only scattered peaks rise above the water. At low tide, a vast expanse of land emerges—temporary territory that the Aikon people have learned to use.

### Position

The Aikon Tidal Islands stretch across the waters north of Sheîr:
- **South**: Sheîr and its scattered islands
- **East**: The Xibli Islands
- **North**: Open water toward Phyndarr Sound
- **West**: The Shattered Sea proper

The islands sit on an unusually shallow shelf—deep enough to submerge at high tide, shallow enough to drain almost completely at low tide.

### The Tidal Rhythm

The transformation is dramatic. At high tide, the Aikon Islands are a scattered archipelago—perhaps twenty visible peaks rising from the sea, separated by channels of varying depth. At low tide, a single connected landmass emerges, miles across, with the former peaks now hills on a temporary plain.

The exposed seabed is firm sand and rock, walkable and even farmable in the brief windows between tides. The Aikon people have built their entire civilization around exploiting these windows.

Tidal cycles follow Alaria's moons—primarily Nyxara, whose 23-day cycle determines the extreme tides. During certain lunar alignments, the low tides expose even more land; during others, the high tides submerge peaks that are normally safe.

### The Aikon People

The inhabitants of these islands are humans who've adapted their entire way of life to the tidal rhythm. They call themselves the **Tidewalkers**, and their culture revolves around precise knowledge of when the waters will rise and fall.

**Permanent Settlements**: The peak islands hold the only permanent structures—stone buildings that can withstand submersion during extreme high tides. These are home bases, sleeping quarters, and storage for valuables.

**Tidal Farms**: At low tide, the Aikon work the exposed seabed. They plant fast-growing crops in the nutrient-rich sand, harvest shellfish from exposed beds, and collect materials deposited by the retreating water. Everything must be gathered before the tide returns.

**Tidal Paths**: The Aikon have memorized paths across the exposed seabed—routes that are safe to walk at various stages of the tidal cycle. Walking the wrong path at the wrong time means drowning.

**The Tide-Counters**: A specialized class of Aikon who track lunar cycles, predict tidal extremes, and announce the safe windows for different activities. Getting this wrong means death; the Tide-Counters are revered and rigorously trained.

### The Twice-Daily Migration

Aikon life involves constant movement. As the tide retreats, people stream down from the peaks onto the exposed land. They work frantically—farming, gathering, traveling between peaks that are islands at high tide but connected at low. As the tide returns, everyone climbs back to safe ground.

This happens twice every day. The Aikon have been doing it for centuries.

Children learn the rhythm before they can walk. Visitors find it exhausting and terrifying. The Aikon find it normal.

### What the Tides Reveal

The exposed seabed isn't just mud and sand. The tides reveal:

- **Tidal Gardens**: Cultivated beds of shellfish, seaweed, and fast-growing vegetables
- **The Shipwreck Fields**: Wrecked vessels from centuries of navigation errors, slowly being absorbed by the sand
- **The Old Roads**: Stone paths laid down by Aikon ancestors, now maintained and extended
- **The Drowned Ruins**: Structures from before the Aikon arrived—no one knows who built them or why they're underwater now

### The Drowned City

At the lowest extreme tides—occurring only a few times each year—parts of an ancient city emerge from the seabed. Carved stone walls, broken columns, the remnants of what might have been temples or palaces.

The Aikon don't build there. They don't linger there. They believe the Drowned City belongs to whoever lived there before, and that staying too long invites their attention.

Some outsiders have tried to excavate during extreme low tides. None have returned with anything valuable. Some haven't returned at all.

### Navigation

Sailing through the Aikon Islands requires precise tidal knowledge. Channels that are navigable at high tide become impassable shallows at low tide. Routes that are open at low tide are underwater at high tide. Ships have run aground in waters that seemed deep enough, only to find the tide was falling.

The Aikon offer pilot services—guides who know exactly which routes are safe when. The fees are reasonable. The alternative is losing your ship.

### What Brings People Here

- **Tidal Harvests**: The exposed seabed produces unique materials—shells, plants, minerals deposited by the sea
- **Safe Passage**: Aikon pilots guide ships through the treacherous tidal channels
- **The Drowned City**: Treasure hunters who think they can explore during extreme low tides
- **Curiosity**: Scholars studying the tidal adaptation, the Drowned City, or the unique ecology
