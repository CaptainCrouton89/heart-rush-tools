## Phyndarr Sound

Tags: sea, geography

The major waterway connecting the northern Western Isles to the Iron Sea and mainland coast—a broad channel of relatively calm water between the Shattered Sea's chaos and the deeper ocean. Every ship traveling north-south through this region passes through Phyndarr Sound.

### Geography

Phyndarr Sound runs roughly northwest-southeast, bounded by:
- **East**: The mainland coast and Sheîr's territory
- **West**: Migos and the outer islands of the Shattered Sea
- **North**: The Iron Sea
- **South**: The entrance to the Shattered Sea proper

The Sound is roughly 80 miles long and 15-30 miles wide—broad enough for safe navigation, sheltered enough to avoid the worst weather.

### Why It Matters

Phyndarr Sound is the primary shipping lane for northern Western Isles commerce:

**North-South Trade**: Goods moving between the Iron Sea (and Clueanda beyond) and the Shattered Sea pass through the Sound. This includes Tarkhon trade, Knova supplies, and everything bound for the southern Western Isles.

**Coastal Access**: The Sound provides the easiest approach to the mainland coast. Sheîr's territory borders it; traders heading to Tarkhon often transit through here.

**Weather Shelter**: Ships fleeing storms in the Iron Sea or Shattered Sea can reach the Sound's calmer waters. Several anchorages along the route offer emergency shelter.

### Navigation

The Sound is well-charted compared to the Shattered Sea's chaos. Main channels are clearly marked; pilots are available for hire at both ends.

**Navigation Points:**

- **The Northern Gate**: Where the Sound meets the Iron Sea. Deep water, strong currents during certain tides, but manageable for experienced captains.

- **The Narrows**: A pinch point roughly midway through the Sound, where the channel contracts to perhaps five miles. This creates faster currents and limits maneuvering room.

- **The Southern Mouth**: Where the Sound opens into the Shattered Sea. Here the orderly channels dissolve into the archipelago's maze—pilots are essential beyond this point.

### Control Points

Several powers maintain presence along the Sound:

**Sheîr** controls the eastern shore. Ships using the Sound technically pass through Sheîr's waters and are subject to inspection. In practice, Sheîr collects tolls from foreign vessels but doesn't interfere with commerce that might enrich them.

**Iypos** on Migos controls the western approach. Their harbor serves ships entering or leaving the Sound—a natural resupply point.

**Knova** maintains no territorial claim but their ships patrol the northern entrance. The triton patrol the waters below.

**The Foggy Isles** lie near the Sound's eastern edge. Ships passing close report fog banks drifting into the channel—the Veilkeepers extending their influence, or just natural weather.

### The Sound as Neutral Zone

Despite multiple powers claiming various parts of the Sound, actual conflict here is rare. Everyone depends on the channel for trade; disrupting it would hurt the disruptor as much as their enemies.

This creates an informal agreement: the Sound is for commerce, not warfare. Pirates are hunted by whoever catches them. Disputes are settled at port, not at sea. Ships of hostile nations pass each other without incident.

This arrangement holds because the alternatives are worse. If the Sound becomes a war zone, trade collapses and everyone loses.

### Hazards

The Sound is safer than the Shattered Sea but not without dangers:

**The Narrows Currents**: During certain tides, the Narrows generates currents strong enough to carry ships into rocks. Pilots time their transits carefully.

**Storm Channeling**: The Sound's shape can focus storms, creating locally intense weather even when surrounding areas are calm.

**Fog Drift**: Mist from the Foggy Isles occasionally fills parts of the channel. Usually natural; occasionally not.

**Pirates**: Less common than in the Shattered Sea, but the Sound's predictable routes make ambush easier. Successful pirates don't last long—too many powers want the channel safe.

### Notable Locations Along the Sound

- **The Watchfires**: A series of signal towers along the eastern shore, maintained by Sheîr to guide ships and warn of threats
- **Shelter Bay**: A natural harbor on the western side, neutral ground where ships can anchor during storms
- **The Narrows Light**: A lighthouse at the channel's tightest point, maintained by whoever remembers to fund it
- **Ghost Anchor**: An anchorage near the northern gate where ships sometimes report seeing vessels that aren't there—probably fog and light playing tricks

### What Brings People Here

Everyone passing between the northern and central Western Isles comes through Phyndarr Sound. It's not a destination—it's a corridor. The question isn't whether to use it, but how fast you need to pass through and how much you're willing to pay for safe passage.
