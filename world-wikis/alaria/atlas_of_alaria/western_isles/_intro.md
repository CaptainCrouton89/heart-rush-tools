# Western Isles

## Geography

The Western Isles occupy the waters between Clueanda to the north and Rimihuica to the south, marking the edge of the known world to the west. At its heart lies the Shattered Sea—a chaotic archipelago of hundreds of tiny islands, atolls, and shoals that makes navigation treacherous. The region serves as a buffer zone between the great continental powers, home to independent states, pirate havens, and mysterious island cultures.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Stratlan Sea**: The deep, empty ocean to the far west—the true edge of the known world
- **Western Sea**: The southwestern waters
- **Iron Sea**: Northern waters, between the islands and Clueanda
- **Sea of Merchants**: Eastern waters separating the islands from the Tarkhon Empire
- **Sea of Sharks**: Southern waters below the central archipelago

### The Shattered Sea (Central)

The heart of the Western Isles is this chaotic archipelago—hundreds of distinct islands, atolls, and shoals packed into treacherous waters. Navigation here requires expert knowledge; the maze of islands has claimed countless ships.

### Northern Region

**Cliffs of Syquindonos**: A rugged coastline forming the northern edge of the island region, featuring dramatic cliffs.

**Kettle Bay**: A bay nestled into the northwest coast.

**Kinova**: A significant island territory in the northeast, marked by settlements.

**Iron Sea**: The body of water to the north, separating the Western Isles from the Westwilds of Clueanda.

**Knova**: A state in the center of the region, one of the more established political entities in the Shattered Sea.

**Bynu Island Tribes**: West of Knova, a collection of tribal island communities.

**Siren Islands**: Northwest of the Bynu Island Tribes, notorious islands with their namesake dangers.

### Eastern Shore (Tarkhon Frontier)

The eastern edge of the Western Isles meets the westernmost holdings of the Tarkhon Empire:

- **Sheîr**: A Tarkhon state jutting westward into the Shattered Sea
- **Kabir**: Northeastern Tarkhon territory
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: South of Gissemari

These represent the southwestern frontier of the Tarkhon Empire.

### Southern Region

**Stokos**: A state south of the Sea of Merchants.

**Sea of Sharks**: The waters between Stokos and the Ember Isles, notorious for their dangers.

**Ember Isles**: A cluster of islands in the southwest, shrouded in white mist—likely volcanic activity or magical fog. These islands glow with an inner heat.
