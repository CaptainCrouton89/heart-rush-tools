## Tollgate

Tags: city, state, nation

A fortified city-state occupying a strategic island at the mouth of Phyndarr Sound—the self-proclaimed "Gatekeepers of the North." Tollgate charges tolls on ships passing between the Iron Sea and the Shattered Sea, and backs the claim with enough military force to make it stick.

### Position

Tollgate sits on a small, rocky island at the northern entrance to Phyndarr Sound:
- **North**: The Iron Sea and routes to Clueanda
- **South**: Phyndarr Sound, leading to the Shattered Sea
- **East**: The Cliffs of Syquindonos and the mainland coast
- **West**: Open water toward Migos

The island controls the bottleneck between the Iron Sea and everything south. Ships can bypass Tollgate, but the alternative routes add days of dangerous sailing.

### The Gatekeepers

Tollgate's inhabitants call themselves Gatekeepers, and they take the role seriously. For three centuries, they've collected tolls from ships passing through "their" waters and used the wealth to build fortifications that make their small island nearly unassailable.

**Population**: ~5,000

The population is almost entirely dedicated to three functions:
- **Collection**: Managing the toll system, inspecting cargoes, processing payments
- **Defense**: Maintaining the fortress and its garrison
- **Services**: Feeding, housing, and entertaining sailors who stop (or are stopped)

### The Toll System

Every ship passing through the northern approach to Phyndarr Sound owes Tollgate a toll. The rates are:
- Based on cargo value (assessed by Tollgate inspectors, who are notoriously generous to themselves)
- Higher for foreign vessels, lower for those with standing agreements
- Payable in coin, goods, or services

Ships that try to run the strait without paying are pursued by Tollgate's patrol vessels. Those caught face confiscation of cargo, imprisonment of crew, or worse. The Gatekeepers make examples of runners to discourage future attempts.

**The Protection Argument**: Tollgate claims the tolls fund defense of the strait against pirates. This is partially true—Tollgate does hunt pirates who threaten shipping. Critics note that Tollgate's definition of "piracy" conveniently excludes Tollgate's own forced toll collection.

### The Fortress

The island is essentially one massive fortification. Stone walls ring the harbor; towers command views in every direction; artillery positions can target any ship in range.

**Notable Features:**

- **The Gate Towers**: Paired fortifications at the harbor entrance that can close with chains and fire on anything approaching
- **The Toll House**: Where ships report, cargoes are assessed, and payments are processed
- **The Lookout**: Highest point on the island, with views across the northern approaches
- **The Garrison Quarters**: Housing for the soldiers who enforce Tollgate's claims

The fortress has never fallen to assault. Blockades have been attempted; Tollgate has enough stored supplies to outlast them.

### Government

Tollgate is ruled by the **Gatemaster**—a hereditary position that combines military command, tax authority, and judicial power.

**Current Gatemaster**: **Lord Brennan Toll**, whose family established Tollgate's toll system three centuries ago and has held power ever since. He's sixty-two, practical, and entirely focused on maintaining the revenue stream that keeps Tollgate powerful.

The Toll family name isn't coincidental—they took it when they established the gatekeeping system, and they've never let anyone forget it.

### The Navy

Tollgate maintains a small but effective patrol fleet:

**Size**: ~15 warships plus support vessels

The ships are built for speed and intimidation rather than extended combat. Their job is to catch runners, escort paying customers, and project force across the strait.

Tollgate's captains are experienced at pursuit and boarding. They train constantly because their livelihoods depend on maintaining the toll system.

### International Relations

Everyone hates Tollgate. Everyone also uses Tollgate's services.

**Sheîr** considers Tollgate an upstart competitor for strait control. They've proposed joint administration; Tollgate refuses to share.

**Iypos** maintains good relations—Tollgate sends toll revenue south for supplies, and Iypos appreciates a customer who pays reliably.

**Knova** tolerates Tollgate because disrupting the strait would hurt Knova's own trade. They've made clear that any attack on Tollgate shipping would invite response.

**Tarkhon** has threatened to "resolve the Tollgate problem" repeatedly. So far, the cost of conquering a fortified island has exceeded the benefit of eliminating the tolls.

### What Brings People Here

- **Necessity**: Ships traveling north-south pay the toll or take dangerous alternate routes
- **Services**: Tollgate offers resupply, repairs, and rest for those who've paid their way
- **Employment**: The Gatekeepers hire sailors, soldiers, and specialists
- **Negotiation**: Establishing standing agreements that reduce future toll rates
- **Espionage**: Various powers want intelligence on who's shipping what through the strait
