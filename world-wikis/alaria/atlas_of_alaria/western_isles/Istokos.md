## Istokos

Tags: state, nation

A southern island nation in the Western Isles, home to the Chargon—an eel race that has rejected their aquatic heritage in favor of land-dwelling and bloodline magic. The architecture, culture, and geography of Istokos all reflect this strange inversion: a sea people terrified of the sea.

### Position and Borders

Istokos occupies a cluster of islands in the southern Shattered Sea:
- **North**: The Sea of Merchants and Sheîr's southern reaches
- **West**: Open water toward the Sea of Sharks
- **South**: The Sea of Sharks and the Islands of Gold
- **East**: Distant view of Mueras and the Rimihuica coast

The islands are positioned south of the main Shattered Sea chaos, in calmer but still treacherous waters. Reefs and shoals make navigation difficult for outsiders; Chargon pilots—all commoners who can risk water exposure—guide foreign ships.

### Terrain and Climate

**The Islands**

Istokos consists of one large central island and perhaps thirty smaller ones. All are volcanic in origin, with steep rocky shores giving way to jungle interiors. Fresh water is abundant—streams and springs feed the islands, though the nobility avoids contact with even fresh water when possible.

The climate is tropical: warm year-round, with a monsoon season that tests the Chargon's elaborate rain-protection systems. Humidity is constant and oppressive to visitors; the Chargon seem unbothered.

**The Waters**

The seas around Istokos are warm, clear, and full of life. Fish schools are massive. Coral reefs ring the larger islands. This was once a paradise for aquatic hunters—and some part of the Chargon still yearns for it.

Currents between islands are dangerous. The Chargon know them perfectly, but foreign ships regularly run aground on unmarked shoals.

### Kargak

The capital city covers most of the main island's northern coast. Built by a people desperate to stay dry, Kargak is an architectural marvel of paranoia.

**Notable Features:**

- **The Dry Palace**: Central complex where the nobility conducts all business. Elaborate drainage, covered walkways, and sealed chambers keep seawater permanently excluded. The Tasting ceremonies occur in specially designed pools that can be drained and refilled with imported freshwater.

- **The Covered Streets**: During monsoon season, fabric awnings extend across every street in the noble quarter. Commoners walk in the rain; nobles never feel a drop.

- **The Piers of Exchange**: The waterfront where trade occurs. Nobles negotiate from covered platforms; goods are transferred by commoners who can afford to get wet. Foreign merchants find the arrangement baffling.

- **The House Compounds**: Each noble house maintains a sealed estate. Some haven't allowed outside water within their walls in generations.

### The House Islands

Surrounding the main island, smaller islands serve as noble house domains:

**Murk Isle**: Home estate of House Murk, the ruling bloodline. The island is perpetually shrouded in mist—not natural fog, but a manifestation of their Sight Beyond magic. Visitors see only what the Murk want them to see.

**Spark Reef**: House Spark's territory. The surrounding waters are dangerous—the Spark have seeded the reef with creatures that carry electrical charges. Unauthorized swimmers die.

**Coil's Shadow**: House Coil claims a small island that seems to have more caves and passages than its size should allow. Assassins train here in infiltration and escape.

**Slick Stone**: House Slick's domain, a steep rocky island with no safe landing points. Their bloodline lets them climb surfaces no one else can reach.

**The Depths**: House Depths controls an island with extensive underground complexes. They've excavated for generations, following structural weaknesses only they can sense.

### The Commoner Islands

Southern islands house the commoner Chargon—those without bloodline magic. These islands lack the elaborate water-protection systems of the noble territories. Commoners fish, sail, and dive freely. Some nobles consider them contaminated; others consider them pitiable.

The largest commoner settlement is **Wetside**—a fishing village that deliberately inverts noble customs. Buildings are open to rain. Streets flood during storms. Residents swim regularly. The name is both description and defiance.

### The Abandoned Reefs

Southwest of Istokos lie reefs that the Chargon inhabited in their aquatic days. Ruins of underwater structures are visible at low tide—carved coral, shaped stone, the remnants of a civilization that chose to abandon its home.

The reefs are forbidden to nobility. Commoners sometimes dive there, seeking artifacts or simply connecting with their past. Some never return. Whether they die, flee, or simply choose to stay beneath the waves, no one knows.

### Navigation and Approach

Foreign ships approaching Istokos must stop at designated anchorages and request pilots. Chargon commoners guide vessels through the reef channels—and charge substantial fees.

The waters are deliberately unmapped. Charts show only the approved approach routes. Anyone attempting to navigate independently risks reefs, currents, and (rumor claims) creatures that the Spark have modified to attack intruders.

**Approach Points:**
- **The Welcome Reef**: Official anchorage for trading vessels. Commoner pilots available for hire.
- **The Dry Dock**: Where ships undergo inspection before nobles will approach them. Wet decks are dried; any standing water is removed.
- **Kargak Harbor**: The main port, but nobles never set foot on the actual docks.

### The Sea of Sharks Connection

Istokos sits at the northern edge of the Sea of Sharks—those shark-infested waters that even experienced sailors avoid. The Chargon's rejection of the sea makes them uniquely willing to trade across these waters; they simply refuse to fall in.

Some speculate the Chargon originally fled to these islands because the sharks would discourage anyone from following them into the water. If so, the strategy worked—and continues to work.

### What Brings People Here
