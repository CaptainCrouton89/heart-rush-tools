## Cliffs of Shondromos

Tags: cliffs, geography

A secondary cliff formation west of the Cliffs of Syquindonos—smaller but equally treacherous, marking where the Stratlan Sea meets the Western Isles. The Shondromos cliffs are known for their honeycombed structure: thousands of sea caves riddle the rock, creating a maze that smugglers, cultists, and stranger things call home.

### Geography

The Cliffs of Shondromos extend along the northwestern edge of the Western Isles:
- **North**: The transition to the Cliffs of Syquindonos
- **South**: The Shattered Sea and the Bynü Islands beyond
- **East**: The northern Western Isles and Kettle Bay
- **West**: The empty Stratlan Sea

The cliffs are lower than Syquindonos—rarely exceeding 300 feet—but what they lack in height they make up in complexity. The rock here is softer, more prone to erosion, riddled with passages that have been carved by water and time.

### The Honeycomb

The Shondromos cliffs are famous for their caves—not a few scattered openings but thousands of them, penetrating deep into the rock, connecting in ways no one has fully mapped.

**Cave Characteristics:**

- Multiple entrances at different levels, some underwater at high tide
- Internal passages that connect distant openings
- Chambers large enough to hold ships, if you know how to reach them
- Collapses and dead ends that change the layout over years

The honeycomb makes the cliffs simultaneously dangerous and valuable. Dangerous because navigation is nearly impossible without local knowledge. Valuable because the caves can hide anything.

### Who Lives Here

**The Smugglers**

Several smuggling operations use the Shondromos caves as bases. Ships slip in through underwater entrances, unload in hidden chambers, and emerge from different openings after their cargo has been moved overland. Customs inspectors from Jüt and Sheîr hate the place.

**The Cultists**

Various religious groups have claimed Shondromos caves over the years. Some worship sea gods, performing rituals where saltwater meets stone. Others have darker purposes. The isolation and secrecy attract those who don't want witnesses.

**The Hermits**

Not everyone in the caves is criminal or insane. Some are simply people who want to be left alone—refugees, exiles, philosophers who prefer solitude. They maintain their caves, fish for food, and avoid everyone.

**The Others**

Persistent rumors claim something else lives in the deeper caves—creatures that predate human arrival, entities drawn to the darkness, or simply very large predators that have learned the maze better than any person. Explorers occasionally don't return. Whether this is cave hazards or something hunting them, no one can prove.

### Kettle Bay

The cliffs partially enclose **Kettle Bay**—a body of water that would be an excellent harbor if it weren't surrounded by the honeycomb.

The bay is calm, sheltered from storms, with good anchorage. It's also riddled with cave openings at waterline, any of which might contain smugglers, cultists, or worse. Ships anchoring in Kettle Bay post guards constantly.

Despite the risks, the bay sees regular use. Ships needing shelter from storms, traders meeting contacts who prefer discretion, and explorers planning cave expeditions all pass through.

### The Deep Caves

Beyond the waterline openings, the Shondromos honeycomb extends into true caves—dark passages that haven't seen light in centuries.

**What Explorers Have Found:**

- Freshwater sources deep underground
- Mineral deposits including some valuable metals
- Ruins of unknown origin—carved chambers that predate human presence
- Bones of creatures that no longer exist
- Carved symbols in languages no one recognizes

**What Explorers Haven't Found (Yet):**

- The legendary "Heart of Shondromos"—supposedly a massive central chamber connecting all the caves
- The "Deep Dwellers"—whatever lives in the parts no one returns from
- Any reliable map of the full system

### Getting In

Accessing the Shondromos caves requires:
- Local knowledge (hired guides work the area, for steep fees)
- Appropriate boats (small enough to navigate cave passages)
- Courage or foolishness (the distinction is unclear)

The easiest approach is through Kettle Bay, where several guide services operate. These guides know the outer caves well; the deeper areas, they avoid.

### What Brings People Here

- **Smuggling**: Moving goods outside official channels
- **Research**: Scholars studying the caves, the ruins, or the creatures
- **Worship**: Religious groups with purposes best conducted in darkness
- **Hiding**: People who need to disappear more thoroughly than the Foggy Isles provide
- **Exploration**: Those who need to know what's in the depths
