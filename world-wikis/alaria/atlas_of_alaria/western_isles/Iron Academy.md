## Iron Academy

Tags: poi, school

The greatest combat school in Alaria, and the de facto capital of Knova. The Academy isn't just located in Knova—it IS Knova. The institution and the nation are one and the same.

### The Fortress

The Iron Academy is built into the central peak of Knova's main island. Stone walls reinforced with iron plate give the fortress its distinctive metallic sheen. The structure rises in tiers from the harbor to the peak, each level containing training facilities, dormitories, armories, and forges.

The main gate faces the harbor—a massive iron portal that has never been breached. Attackers would have to pass the triton patrols, navigate the treacherous approach, breach the harbor defenses, and climb the terraced walls. No one has ever come close.

### The Hierarchy

Rank at the Academy is determined by combat record. Students advance through tiers by winning matches against peers and superiors. Faculty earn their positions through demonstrated excellence. The Commandant holds supreme authority because no one has defeated them.

**Current Commandant: Irontide Vesk**

A massive, scarred veteran who killed a deep-sea serpent in single combat. He's held the position for twenty-three years (his second tenure—he lost it once, spent eight years rebuilding his skills, then reclaimed it). The beast's skull hangs in the central courtyard as proof of his prowess.

Vesk rules from the Iron Throne—literally a chair forged from weapons taken from defeated challengers over the Academy's four-century history.

### Training

Students master multiple combat disciplines before specializing. Sword, spear, axe, bare hands, thrown weapons, shields—the Academy produces complete fighters, not specialists. Training is brutal, injury is common, and death isn't unheard of.

The annual Iron Tournament draws observers from across Alaria. Victory in the tournament guarantees employment anywhere. Even showing well attracts recruiters from noble houses, mercenary companies, and royal guards.

### The Compact

The Academy's greatest asset is its relationship with the triton. Under an agreement dating back 350 years, triton warriors receive free training in exchange for defending Knova's waters. This has produced generations of elite triton fighters—and ensures the Academy is effectively impregnable.

**Tide-Captain Muravel** leads the current triton contingent. She's trained three generations of her people here and maintains the compact with religious devotion.
