## Islands of Gold

Tags: island, geography

The southernmost archipelago of the Western Isles—fantastically rich in gold and utterly deadly to reach. The waters here are prowled by colossal stone creatures that walk the seafloor, using the rocky spires on their backs to snare ships before devouring the crews.

### Position

The Islands of Gold occupy the southwestern extreme of the Western Isles:
- **North**: The Sea of Sharks and Teku's territory
- **East**: Distant view of Mueras and the Rimihuica coast
- **South**: The Seacleft Coast (Rimihuica)
- **West**: The open Solemn Sea

The islands sit at a convergence of warm and cold currents, creating waters that are rich in sea life—which feeds the creatures that make the Islands of Gold so deadly.

### The Walking Reefs

The true danger of the Islands of Gold isn't the islands themselves—it's what lives in the waters around them.

**The Seafloor Giants** are colossal creatures of living stone. They walk on the ocean bottom, unable to swim but tall enough that the rocky spires growing from their backs break the surface. From above, these spires look like small islands, reefs, or rocky outcroppings.

They're not.

The Giants are predators. They position themselves in shipping lanes, wait for vessels to approach what looks like a reef or island, and then move. Ships that run aground on a Giant's back find themselves lifted, tilted, and dragged underwater as the creature dives to feed.

**Characteristics:**
- Heights ranging from 60 to over 200 feet
- Stone bodies covered in barnacles, coral, and other sea growth that makes them indistinguishable from natural rock
- Rocky spires on their backs that grow over decades
- Movement speed of perhaps a mile per hour—slow, but they don't need to chase their prey
- Intelligence unclear—they hunt, they position themselves strategically, but whether they think is debated

### The Gold

The islands and surrounding seabed are phenomenally rich in gold. Veins run through every significant landmass. Gold dust settles in the sand. The creatures themselves sometimes have gold deposits visible in their stone flesh.

The gold exists because of ancient volcanic activity that pushed mineral-rich magma up through the seafloor. The same geological forces that created the gold may have created—or attracted—the Giants.

### Hunting Grounds

The Giants don't roam randomly. They stake out territories, usually near shipping lanes or the approaches to actual islands. Their hunting grounds create a maze—some routes are patrolled by Giants, others are temporarily safe, and the pattern shifts as the creatures move.

**Known Hunting Grounds:**
- **The Graveyard**: The densest concentration of Giants, named for the wrecks visible in the shallows. At least a dozen Giants patrol this area.
- **Golden Approach**: The most direct route to the richest islands—and the most heavily hunted.
- **The Shallows**: Where Giants that prefer smaller prey congregate. Ships sometimes survive here; crews rarely do.

### The Treasure Hunters

Despite the danger—or because the danger keeps competition down—treasure hunters attempt the Islands of Gold regularly. They launch from Teku, from Mueras, from anywhere a ship and crew can be assembled.

**Strategies That Sometimes Work:**
- **Speed runs**: Fast ships sprinting through Giant territory before the creatures can react
- **Disguise**: Coating hulls with substances that make ships "taste" like stone to Giant senses
- **Sacrificial escorts**: Multiple ships traveling together, accepting that some will be lost
- **Underwater approach**: Swimming or diving to the islands, avoiding ships entirely
- **Giant-reading**: Hiring specialists who claim to predict Giant movements

Most expeditions fail. The successful ones bring back enough gold to fund ten more attempts—which perpetuates the cycle.

### The Islands Themselves

The actual islands—the ones that don't move—are volcanic rock covered in sparse vegetation. They're accessible only by evading the Giants long enough to reach shore.

**What's There:**
- Surface gold deposits that can be gathered without mining
- Abandoned camps from previous expeditions—some with supplies, others with bones
- Caves that might contain richer deposits, or Giant lairs, or both
- The remains of a pre-human civilization that apparently lived here before the Giants arrived

### The Ruins

On the largest island, ruins of unknown origin emerge from the jungle. Carved stone buildings, broken statues, inscriptions in no known language. Whoever built this was here before the Giants—or possibly before the gold.

The ruins are architecturally impossible for humans—doorways too tall, stairs at wrong proportions, carvings depicting creatures that don't exist. Some scholars believe a giant race (not the walking reefs, something else) lived here in ancient times.

What happened to them is unclear. Whether they created the Seafloor Giants, or the Giants destroyed them, or something else happened entirely—no one knows.

### Survival Tips

From the few who've returned:
- The Giants sense vibration. Quiet ships survive longer.
- They hunt more actively at certain times—possibly related to tides or feeding cycles.
- A ship caught on a Giant's back has seconds to cut free before going under.
- The Giants ignore things that don't move. Playing dead sometimes works.
- If you reach an island, the Giants don't come ashore. You're safe on land—until you try to leave.

### What Brings People Here

- **Gold**: Enough wealth to retire on, if you survive
- **The Ruins**: Scholars seeking knowledge of the pre-human civilization
- **Giant Materials**: Stone from the Giants has unusual properties—but killing one is nearly impossible
- **Challenge**: Some people need to prove they can survive what kills everyone else
- **Desperation**: Those who have nothing to lose and everything to gain
