## Iypos

Tags: city, state, nation

The dominant city-state on the island of Migos—a trading hub built on the lower slopes of Mount Iypos, controlling the only significant harbor on the largest island in the northern Western Isles.

### Position

Iypos occupies the southeastern coast of Migos, where Harbor Bay provides the only accessible anchorage on the island. The city climbs the mountain slopes in terraces, from the waterfront markets to the upper districts where the wealthiest families build their compounds.

### The City

**Population**: ~15,000

Iypos is built vertically. The waterfront handles commerce—docks, warehouses, markets, taverns for sailors. Above that, craftspeople and traders live in stacked buildings connected by staircases and rope bridges. Higher still, the wealthy maintain compounds with views across the harbor. The temple district occupies a plateau partway up Mount Iypos.

**Notable Features:**

- **The Long Docks**: Extending into Harbor Bay, capable of handling dozens of ships simultaneously
- **The Terrace Markets**: Commercial district climbing the lower slopes in stepped levels
- **The Rope Ways**: Networks of bridges and lifts connecting different city levels
- **The Upper Compounds**: Wealthy family homes built for defensibility as much as comfort
- **Temple of the Mountain**: Where the city's patron spirits (mountain and sea) are honored together

### Government

Iypos is ruled by the **Harbor Council**—representatives from the trading families that have dominated commerce for generations. Council seats are bought, inherited, and occasionally murdered for.

**Current Harbor Master**: **Theodras Vane**, a merchant prince who's held power for eighteen years by being slightly more competent and slightly less corrupt than his rivals. He maintains neutrality in regional conflicts because taking sides would be bad for business.

The Council controls:
- Harbor access and fees
- Trade agreements and tariffs
- The city militia
- Relations with the Vethrani mountain folk

What the Council doesn't control: the mountains. The Vethrani govern themselves and consider Iypos a convenient market, not a government.

### Economy

Iypos exists because of geography. Every ship traveling between the Iron Sea and the central Shattered Sea benefits from stopping here for supplies, repairs, or rest. The harbor charges fees; the merchants sell goods; the city profits.

**Major Industries:**
- **Maritime services**: Repairs, resupply, crew hiring
- **Trade brokerage**: Connecting buyers and sellers across the Western Isles
- **Mountain goods**: Processing and exporting what the Vethrani bring down
- **Information**: Iypos merchants know shipping routes, cargo values, and who's doing business with whom

### The Vethrani Relationship

The mountain folk tolerate Iypos because it's useful. They bring highland products—rare herbs, mountain furs, minerals—to trade for lowland goods they can't produce. They use Iypos merchants to sell to the outside world.

But they don't consider themselves part of Iypos. They maintain separate identity, separate governance, and separate territory. The Council knows better than to claim authority over the mountains.

**The Arrangement:**
- Vethrani can trade freely in designated market areas
- Iypos provides coastal defense that benefits the whole island
- Neither side interferes in the other's internal affairs
- Both sides unite against external threats

This works because both sides benefit. When it stops working, Migos will tear itself apart.

### Military

Iypos maintains a professional militia focused on harbor defense and keeping order in the city. They're adequate for pirates and street crime; they couldn't hold the mountains against the Vethrani and don't try.

**Militia Size**: ~800 regulars plus reserves

The real military value of Migos is the mountains themselves. Any invader who takes the harbor still has to deal with the Vethrani—and no one has ever managed that.

### Politics

Iypos practices aggressive neutrality. They trade with everyone, ally with no one, and avoid taking sides in conflicts that might disrupt commerce.

**Current Tensions:**
- Sheîr wants closer ties (Iypos suspects this means eventual absorption)
- Knova wants training access to the mountains (the Vethrani refuse)
- Various powers want preferential trade arrangements (Iypos offers the same terms to everyone)

Harbor Master Theodras navigates these pressures by being useful to everyone and committed to no one. This makes Iypos valuable and frustrating in equal measure.

### The Temple of the Mountain

The city's main religious site honors both the mountain spirits (Vethrani tradition) and sea spirits (coastal tradition). This dual worship reflects Iypos's position between two worlds.

The temple maintains:
- Priests from both traditions working together
- Neutral ground where Vethrani and city folk meet as equals
- Weather prediction services valuable to sailors and mountain travelers alike
- Funeral rites that satisfy both cultures

The Temple's priests have diplomatic immunity in Vethrani territory—one of the few groups that can move freely through the mountains.

### What Brings People Here

- **Trade**: The major commercial hub for the northern Western Isles
- **Supplies**: Ships traveling between the Iron Sea and Shattered Sea stop for resupply
- **Mountain Access**: The only reasonable approach to Migos's interior (if the Vethrani allow it)
- **Information**: Iypos merchants know what's happening across the region
- **Neutrality**: A place to do business without political entanglement
