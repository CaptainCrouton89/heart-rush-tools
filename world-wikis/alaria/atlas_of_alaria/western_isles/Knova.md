## Knova

Tags: state, nation

An archipelago in the northern Western Isles, south of the Iron Sea. Famous as the home of the Iron Academy—the greatest combat school in Alaria—and its sister institutions Seatower and Blackwater.

### Position and Borders

Knova occupies a cluster of rocky islands in the northeastern Shattered Sea:
- **North**: The Iron Sea, leading to Clueanda's Westwilds
- **South**: The Shattered Sea proper, toward the Drifting Isles
- **East**: Open water leading to Sheîr and the Tarkhon coast
- **West**: The Foggy Isles and deeper Shattered Sea

The archipelago sits at a natural crossroads—ships traveling between the Iron Sea and the Sea of Merchants often pass within sight of Knova's fortresses. This makes it valuable for trade and dangerous for enemies.

### Terrain and Climate

The islands are volcanic remnants—steep-sided, rocky, with little arable land. What they lack in farmland they make up in mineral wealth: iron deposits run through every major island, with copper and tin in the smaller outcroppings.

The climate is temperate maritime with frequent storms. Fog rolls in without warning. The waters between islands hide rocks that have claimed countless ships—the triton patrols know safe passages that outsiders don't.

### The Main Island

The largest island rises sharply from the sea, its central peak dominated by the **Iron Academy fortress**. The harbor is a narrow channel between two spurs of rock, easily blocked and heavily defended. Behind the fortress, the mountainside is terraced with training grounds, dormitories, and forges.

The fortress itself is built from local stone reinforced with iron—the walls have a metallic sheen in sunlight. The main gate faces the harbor; smaller gates lead to training grounds and the mine tunnels that honeycomb the mountain's interior.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Serpent Skull**: A massive sea-serpent skull displayed in the central courtyard—trophy of Commandant Vesk's legendary kill
- **The Iron Throne**: The Commandant's seat, forged from weapons taken from defeated challengers
- **The Deep Forges**: Smithies built into the mountain, using natural heat vents for metalworking
- **The Proving Grounds**: Terraced training areas where students fight for advancement

### Seatower Island

West of the main island, **Seatower** rises from a rocky spire overlooking the main shipping lanes. The fortress commands views in every direction—nothing approaches without being spotted.

The island is smaller and steeper than the main island, with almost no flat ground. Buildings cling to the rock face, connected by stairs and rope bridges. The harbor is barely a notch in the cliffs, accessible only in calm weather.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Watch**: An observation platform at the fortress's peak, staffed day and night
- **The War Room**: A vast chamber with sand tables, ship models, and maps covering every known coast
- **Signal Towers**: A network of fire signals connecting Seatower to the other fortresses

### Blackwater Island

North of the main island, **Blackwater** takes its name from the dark, deep waters of its harbor. The island sits lower than its neighbors, with a more accessible coastline—though "accessible" is relative in Knova.

The fortress here is less imposing than the Iron Academy but more practical. Libraries, archives, supply warehouses—Blackwater stores knowledge rather than showcasing strength.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Archives**: Records of campaigns, supply calculations, and strategic analyses dating back centuries
- **The Charting Halls**: Where students learn terrain analysis and logistics planning
- **The Black Harbor**: Deep anchorage where supply ships dock, protected from storms

### The Lesser Islands

Dozens of smaller islands dot the archipelago:

- **The Training Rocks**: Bare outcroppings used for survival exercises and punishment details
- **The Iron Veins**: Mining islands, pocked with tunnels and served by work crews
- **Garrison Points**: Small fortified positions watching approach routes
- **The Proving Ground**: An island used for final examinations—students are dropped there with minimal equipment and must survive, fight, or reach extraction points

### The Triton Waters

The sea around Knova belongs to the triton. Their patrols are constant and deadly—any ship approaching without permission faces warriors rising from the depths to investigate.

The triton maintain underwater camps in the deeper waters between islands. They know every current, every rock, every safe passage. This knowledge is Knova's greatest defense.

**Undersea Features:**
- **The Deep Barracks**: Triton living quarters carved into underwater cliff faces
- **The Hunting Grounds**: Waters where triton warriors practice combat
- **The Serpent's Grave**: Where Commandant Vesk killed the great sea-serpent—triton consider it sacred

### Navigation

Approaching Knova without a guide is suicide. The waters between islands hide rocks that don't show on standard charts. Currents shift unpredictably. And the triton don't warn intruders before attacking.

Legitimate visitors request permission from Sheîr or arrange escort through official channels. The triton will meet authorized ships at designated points and guide them through safe passages.

Unauthorized approaches end one of two ways: the rocks get you, or the triton do.
