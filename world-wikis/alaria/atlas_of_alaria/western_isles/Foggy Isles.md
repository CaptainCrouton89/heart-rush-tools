## Foggy Isles

Tags: archipelago, geography

A cluster of islands perpetually shrouded in thick fog, positioned between Knova and the mainland coast. The fog isn't natural—it's maintained by the **Veilkeepers**, a secretive order who use the islands as a sanctuary for those who need to disappear.

### Position

The Foggy Isles occupy waters near the coast, northeast of Knova:
- **South**: Open water toward Knova and the Shattered Sea
- **East**: The mainland coast
- **North**: The Iron Sea
- **West**: Phyndarr Sound

The islands sit where warm southern currents meet cold northern waters—conditions that would produce some natural fog. The Veilkeepers have enhanced this dramatically.

### The Fog

The mist surrounding these islands is thick enough to get lost in within a hundred feet of shore. It muffles sound. It diffuses light. Ships entering the fog banks find their compasses unreliable and their crews disoriented.

The fog extends roughly five miles from the outermost islands, creating a zone of navigational confusion that keeps casual visitors away. The Veilkeepers control the mist—they can thin it to allow passage or thicken it to blind intruders.

**Properties of the Fog:**
- Reduces visibility to arm's length in the densest areas
- Absorbs sound, making communication difficult
- Creates illusions at the edges—shapes that might be islands or might be nothing
- Affects magical detection and scrying

### The Veilkeepers

The order that maintains the fog and controls access to the islands. Their origins are unclear—they might be an offshoot of a mainland mystery cult, practitioners of a specialized fog magic, or simply people who discovered the islands' natural properties and learned to enhance them.

**What They Offer:**
- Sanctuary for those fleeing enemies, laws, or pasts
- Absolute discretion—the Veilkeepers don't ask questions
- Protection through obscurity—finding someone in the Foggy Isles is nearly impossible
- Time—the fog affects perception of duration; stays feel shorter than they are

**What They Require:**
- Payment in goods, services, or secrets
- Respect for island rules
- Acceptance that leaving is harder than arriving
- Never revealing the islands' secrets to outsiders

### The Sanctuary Population

The Foggy Isles shelter perhaps two thousand permanent residents—people who came to hide and chose to stay. They include:

- Political refugees from a dozen nations
- Criminals too dangerous or valuable to extradite
- Researchers pursuing forbidden knowledge
- Lovers whose relationships are illegal elsewhere
- People who simply wanted to disappear

The residents form loose communities across the islands, maintaining lives in the perpetual mist. Some never want to leave. Others are waiting for enemies to die, situations to change, or debts to be forgotten.

### Island Geography

The fog makes mapping difficult, but the Veilkeepers know perhaps eight significant islands and many smaller ones:

**The Welcome Isle**: Where new arrivals are processed. The fog is thinnest here—a courtesy for those adjusting to life in the mist.

**The Deep Sanctuary**: The largest island, where most permanent residents live. The fog is thickest here; finding someone on Deep Sanctuary without a guide is impossible.

**The Keeper's Hold**: Where the Veilkeepers maintain their headquarters and train new members. Access is restricted.

**The Exchange**: A market island where residents trade goods and services. The fog is managed to allow limited visibility—enough to do business, not enough to identify anyone.

**The Forgotten**: A smaller island where the Veilkeepers send those who've broken the rules. Not a prison exactly—just a place where the fog is so thick you can't find your way out.

### Navigation

Entering the Foggy Isles requires a guide. The Veilkeepers post contacts in major ports—Sheîr, Knova, coastal towns—who can arrange passage for appropriate payment.

The approach involves following a guide ship through the fog. The guide knows safe channels; following at the correct distance is essential. Ships that lose the guide are lost in the fog, sometimes for days, often forever.

Leaving requires similar arrangements. The fog doesn't just keep people out—it keeps people in. Residents who haven't arranged departure find themselves sailing in circles, eventually returning to the islands they tried to leave.

### The Fee

The Veilkeepers accept various payments:
- Gold and valuables (straightforward)
- Skills and labor (craftspeople, warriors, specialists)
- Secrets (information valuable to the Veilkeepers' obscure purposes)
- Service (a term of years working for the order)

The more dangerous your enemies, the higher the fee. Hiding from a jealous spouse costs less than hiding from an empire.

### What Brings People Here

- **Refuge**: People who need to disappear completely
- **Recruitment**: Organizations seeking to hire from the island population
- **Research**: Scholars studying fog magic or the Veilkeepers' methods
- **Retrieval**: Those trying to find someone hidden in the fog (rarely successful)
- **Trade**: Goods that move better outside normal channels
