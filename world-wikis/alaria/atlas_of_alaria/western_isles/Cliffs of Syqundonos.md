## Cliffs of Syquindonos

Tags: cliffs, geography

A dramatic wall of stone marking the northern boundary of the Western Isles—sheer cliffs rising hundreds of feet from the Iron Sea, carved by millennia of waves and wind. The cliffs are as much barrier as landmark, separating the island region from the mainland coast beyond.

### Geography

The Cliffs of Syquindonos stretch for roughly sixty miles along the northern edge of the Western Isles region:
- **North**: The Iron Sea
- **South**: The Shattered Sea and the island maze
- **East**: The mainland coast and routes to Tarkhon
- **West**: Open water toward the Stratlan Sea

The cliffs range from 200 to over 500 feet high—sheer faces of dark stone that seem to grow directly from the sea. There are no beaches at their base, only rocks and churning water.

### Formation

The cliffs are the exposed edge of a volcanic plateau—the same geological forces that created the Western Isles. Where the plateau meets the Iron Sea, it simply ends in a vertical face.

The stone is primarily basalt, dark gray to black, columnar in places where ancient lava cooled in distinctive hexagonal patterns. Wind and wave have carved caves, arches, and grottos into the lower sections, but the upper cliffs remain stark and unbroken.

### Navigation Hazard

The Cliffs of Syquindonos have claimed countless ships over the centuries. The dangers include:

**Limited Visibility**: Fog collects at the cliff base, hiding the rocks until it's too late.

**Unpredictable Currents**: The meeting of Iron Sea and Shattered Sea waters creates swirling currents that can push ships toward the rocks.

**No Shelter**: Ships caught in storms along this coast have nowhere to hide. The cliffs offer no harbors, no anchorages, no beaches to run aground safely.

**Cliff Collapse**: Sections of the cliff face occasionally break away, sending massive rock falls into the sea. Ships below have been crushed.

### The Watchfires

Several watchtowers stand along the cliff top, maintained by various powers to warn ships away from the rocks. The towers burn fires at night and fly flags during dangerous weather.

**Key Stations:**

- **Syquindonos Light**: The eastern lighthouse, marking the approach to Phyndarr Sound
- **The Western Watch**: Warning station at the cliffs' western extent
- **Fog Station**: Manned during frequent fog events to sound horns warning ships away

Maintaining these stations is expensive. Various nations have funded them over the years; currently Sheîr handles the eastern lights and Tollgate funds the western ones. Neither wants ships wrecking on "their" cliffs.

### The Cliff-Dwellers

A small population of hardy folk lives atop the cliffs, maintaining the watch stations and harvesting resources:

**Seabird Colonies**: The cliff faces host massive colonies of nesting seabirds. Their eggs, meat, and feathers are valuable; collectors rappel down the cliff faces to reach the nests.

**Cliff Fishing**: Some communities fish from the cliff top, lowering lines hundreds of feet to the waters below.

**Storm Salvage**: After bad weather, salvagers search the waters at the cliff base for wreckage that might contain valuable cargo.

The cliff-dwellers are insular and suspicious of outsiders. They answer to no government, pay no taxes, and prefer to be left alone.

### The Sea Caves

At the cliff base, erosion has carved an extensive network of sea caves. Most are only accessible by boat, and then only in calm weather.

**What's Inside:**

- Smuggler hideouts (several powers use the caves to move goods quietly)
- Nesting sites for rare creatures that prefer the darkness
- Ruins of unknown origin—carved chambers that suggest someone lived here before the caves flooded
- Persistent rumors of treasure hidden by pirates, refugees, or ancient civilizations

Exploring the caves is dangerous. Tides flood some chambers rapidly; others collapse without warning; and the creatures nesting inside don't appreciate visitors.

### Strategic Value

The cliffs prevent land assault on the Western Isles from the north. Any army wanting to invade would need to either sail around or somehow descend 500-foot cliff faces while defending against attacks from above.

This has never been attempted seriously. The cliffs are too formidable, the alternatives too practical. The Cliffs of Syquindonos remain what they've always been: a barrier, a hazard, and a boundary.
