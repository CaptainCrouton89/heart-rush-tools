## Dragon's Teeth

Tags: island, geography

A group of islands in the Western Isles.

A region of more, treacherous terrain. Extremely sharp rocks made of obsidian stick up from the water, which can shred a boat, and definitely your body. Mysterious currents surround the area, and the Qorgath lives somewhere in its murky depths, guarding her hatch of Erzqin.

The Erzqin also patrol the waters, slaying and destroying those who dare to enter.
