## Sheîr

Tags: state, nation

A sprawling island kingdom on the eastern edge of the Western Isles, where the Shattered Sea meets the Tarkhon coast. Home to the Bledreon Islanders—sailors with dual-lid eyes who've worked these waters for centuries.

### Position and Borders

Sheîr occupies the transitional zone between the Western Isles and Tarkhon:
- **East**: The Tarkhon coast and Sea of Merchants
- **West**: The Shattered Sea and Drifting Isles
- **North**: Phyndarr Sound, leading toward Knova
- **South**: Open water toward Istokos and the Dolphin Islands

The kingdom claims a small mainland strip (where the capital sits) plus dozens of islands spreading westward into the Shattered Sea. The boundary between "Sheîr islands" and "independent islands" is mostly theoretical—islanders acknowledge borders when convenient and ignore them otherwise.

### Terrain and Climate

**The Mainland Strip**

A narrow coastal territory running along the Tarkhon border. Rolling hills give way to rocky coastline. The capital city occupies the best natural harbor; smaller settlements dot the coast where fishing is good.

The climate is Mediterranean—warm, dry summers and mild winters. The mainland grows olives, grapes, and grain. It's more productive than most of Sheîr's territory.

**The Islands**

The islands vary wildly. Some are lush with timber and fresh water. Others are bare rock with nothing but seabirds. The larger islands support permanent communities; the smallest serve as fishing camps, hideouts, or navigational hazards.

Most islands are volcanic remnants—steep-sided with narrow beaches. The waters between them are treacherous, full of reefs and currents that the Bledreon know by heart and outsiders learn the hard way.

### Phyndarr Sound

The northern waters between Sheîr and the route to Knova. Phyndarr Sound is relatively calm compared to the Shattered Sea proper—wide enough for easy sailing, sheltered from the worst storms.

This makes the Sound a major trade route. Ships traveling between Tarkhon and the northern Western Isles pass through here. Sheîr collects tolls, offers pilots, and occasionally raids vessels that haven't paid proper respect.

### The Seat

Sheîr's capital city sits on the mainland coast, built around a natural harbor. Stone walls enclose the old city; newer districts sprawl along the waterfront and into the hills behind.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Driftwood Palace**: Royal residence, named for the throne carved from ancient ship timbers
- **The Raptor Pens**: Walled compounds where noble families breed and train their mounts
- **The Harbor Quarter**: Dense waterfront district where mainland trade meets island commerce
- **The Treaty Stone**: A ceremonial marker where the Ghost Treaty with the Neferati was signed

The Seat feels more Tarkhon than Western Isles—orderly streets, formal architecture, mainland customs. Island Bledreon visit for trade but rarely stay longer than necessary.

### The Inner Ring

The islands closest to the mainland, within a day's sail of the Seat. These islands are most influenced by capital politics—their elders attend court, their ships carry official cargoes, their communities acknowledge the king's authority (mostly).

**Notable Islands:**
- **Thornback**: Largest of the Inner Ring, with a proper town and shipyards
- **Salt Haven**: Major fishing center, supplies much of the capital's food
- **The Twins**: Two islands flanking the main approach to the Seat's harbor—heavily fortified

### The Drift

The central island clusters where traditional Bledreon culture survives strongest. Here the king is a distant concept, elders rule absolutely, and freedom means answering to no one you don't choose.

The Drift is hard to navigate for outsiders. Islands shift in fog and storm; the Bledreon know the waters, but charts are deliberately vague. This is both defense and privacy—the Drift's people don't want visitors.

**Notable Features:**
- **Elder Kresh's Hall**: Unofficial capital of the island faction, on an island whose name outsiders aren't told
- **The Gathering Rocks**: Natural amphitheater where island elders meet during disputes
- **Storm-Singer's Shrine**: Sacred site where Bledreon pray before dangerous voyages

### The Far Reach

The westernmost islands, barely connected to Sheîr's government at all. These communities acknowledge the king exists, pay no taxes, and handle their own affairs completely. Some are barely distinguishable from independent pirate havens.

The Far Reach borders the true Shattered Sea. Sailors here navigate waters where maps fail and magic interferes with compasses. Only the most experienced Bledreon captains operate this far out.

### The Dolphin Islands

Southwest of Sheîr proper, the Dolphin Islands are sacred to the triton. Thousands of dolphins breed in these warm, protected waters. Triton warriors come to bond with the dolphins they'll ride into battle.

The islands are strictly forbidden to surface vessels. Ships that enter without permission face the wrath of the entire triton nation. Sheîr enforces this prohibition—partly out of respect, partly because they can't afford to antagonize the triton.

### Navigation and Trade

Sheîr controls the eastern approach to the Western Isles. Ships traveling from Tarkhon to the Shattered Sea either pass through Sheîr's waters or take much longer routes.

This gives Sheîr significant leverage. They charge tolls, offer pilots for treacherous passages, and maintain the best charts of local waters. Captains who cooperate sail safely. Captains who don't... don't.

**Major Routes:**
- **The Merchant's Run**: From The Seat through Phyndarr Sound toward Knova and beyond
- **The Drift Passage**: Through the central islands—fast but dangerous without local guidance
- **The Southern Track**: Around Sheîr's islands toward Istokos and the Sea of Sharks

### What Brings People Here

- **Trade**: The Seat is the gateway between Tarkhon and the Western Isles
- **Ships**: Bledreon shipyards produce the best vessels in the region
- **Passage**: Pilots and charts for the Shattered Sea
- **Mercenaries**: Bledreon sailors and raptor cavalry for hire (at premium prices)
- **Smuggling**: The islands offer countless places to hide goods and ships
