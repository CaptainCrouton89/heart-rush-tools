## Migos

Tags: island, geography

The largest single island in the northern Western Isles—a mountainous landmass that rises dramatically from Phyndarr Sound. Home to the city-state of Iypos and a population of independent-minded mountain folk who've never been successfully conquered.

### Position

Migos dominates the northern Shattered Sea:
- **South**: The Whisper Isles and the Murmuring Isles
- **East**: Phyndarr Sound and routes toward Sheîr
- **North**: The Iron Sea and the Cliffs of Syquindonos
- **West**: Open water toward the Dragon's Teeth

The island sits at the intersection of major shipping lanes—anything traveling between the Iron Sea and the central Shattered Sea passes within sight of Migos.

### Terrain

Migos is mountainous. The central peaks rise over 8,000 feet, snow-capped year-round. Steep valleys cut through the highlands, and the coastline alternates between sheer cliffs and narrow beaches.

The mountains make the interior nearly impassable for outsiders. Paths exist, but they're controlled by the mountain communities who know them. Armies that have tried to march into the interior have gotten lost, ambushed, or simply frozen in the high passes.

**Key Geographic Features:**

- **Mount Iypos**: The highest peak, sacred to the mountain folk. The city of Iypos is built on its lower slopes.
- **The Knife Ridge**: A mountain spine running north-south, dividing the island in half
- **The Harbor Bay**: The only significant natural harbor, where Iypos controls all maritime access
- **The Cloud Forest**: Mid-elevation jungle perpetually shrouded in mist

### Climate

The coast is temperate maritime—comfortable, rainy, suitable for farming. The mountains are brutal: extreme cold, sudden storms, conditions that kill the unprepared.

This creates a divided population. Coastal people live like typical Western Isles inhabitants. Mountain people live in a different world entirely—one that's made them hard, proud, and very difficult to conquer.

### The Mountain Folk

The interior of Migos is inhabited by communities that have resisted outside control for as long as anyone remembers. They call themselves the **Vethrani**, and they've developed a culture adapted to the extreme environment.

**Characteristics:**
- Extended family groups controlling specific valleys and passes
- Economy based on herding, highland agriculture, and controlling mountain trade routes
- Warrior culture—every adult can fight, raiding between families is traditional
- Deep distrust of coastal people and outsiders generally
- Oral tradition maintaining grudges and alliances for generations

The Vethrani have no central government. Families cooperate or conflict based on shifting alliances. Attempting to unite them under outside rule has been tried repeatedly and failed every time.

### The Coastal Strip

The narrow coastal areas, especially around Harbor Bay, are more accessible and more integrated with the Western Isles economy. The city of Iypos dominates this zone—collecting fees from everyone who wants to use the harbor, trading with whoever pays, and maintaining a wary relationship with the mountain interior.

The coastal population includes:
- Iypos citizens (traders, craftspeople, sailors)
- Foreign merchants with long-term residency
- Vethrani who've left the mountains for coastal life (often considered traitors by their families)
- Workers from across the Western Isles

### Strategic Importance

Migos's position makes it valuable:
- **The harbor** controls access to major shipping routes
- **The mountains** provide lookout positions visible across the northern Shattered Sea
- **The resources** include timber, mountain herbs, and minerals that don't exist elsewhere

Multiple powers have tried to take full control of Migos. None have succeeded. The mountains defeat armies; the harbor defeats blockades; the Vethrani defeat occupation.

### The Migos Problem

Every regional power wants Migos, and no one can have it.

- Knova has tried to establish training facilities in the mountains—the Vethrani drove them out
- Sheîr has tried to claim the harbor as a vassal state—Iypos refused and the Vethrani threatened war
- Various mainlanders have attempted conquest—the mountains ate their armies

The result is that Migos remains independent by default. Iypos trades with everyone but aligns with no one. The Vethrani ignore everyone except those foolish enough to enter their territory.

### What Brings People Here

- **Trade**: Iypos is a major commercial hub for the northern Western Isles
- **Mountain Products**: Herbs, minerals, and crafts available nowhere else
- **Passage**: Ships transiting between the Iron Sea and Shattered Sea stop for supplies
- **Refuge**: The mountains can hide people who don't want to be found
- **Challenge**: Some adventurers want to see if they can cross the interior and survive
