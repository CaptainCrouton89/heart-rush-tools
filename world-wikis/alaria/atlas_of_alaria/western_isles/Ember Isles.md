## Ember Isles

Tags: archipelago, geography

A volcanic island chain in the southwestern Western Isles, where the earth still burns and ancient Neferati experiments left scars that haven't healed. The islands glow with inner heat, shrouded in steam and ash, home to things that thrive in fire.

### Geography

The Ember Isles stretch across the southwestern Shattered Sea:
- **North**: The central Shattered Sea
- **East**: The Sea of Sharks
- **South**: Open water toward distant continents
- **West**: The deep Stratlan Sea

The archipelago consists of perhaps thirty volcanic islands, ranging from tiny smoking rocks to substantial landmasses. All are geothermally active to some degree—hot springs, steam vents, occasional lava flows.

### The Fire Below

The Ember Isles sit on an active volcanic zone. The earth here is thin; magma pushes close to the surface. This creates:

**Hot Springs**: Found on every island, ranging from pleasantly warm to instantly lethal

**Steam Vents**: Columns of superheated steam that erupt unpredictably, sometimes with enough force to strip flesh from bone

**Lava Flows**: Slow-moving rivers of molten rock that occasionally breach the surface, destroying everything in their path

**Unstable Ground**: Areas where the surface can collapse without warning into magma chambers below

The volcanic activity makes the Ember Isles simultaneously dangerous and valuable. The heat powers unique ecosystems; the minerals deposited by volcanic action are found nowhere else.

### Firefell

The largest and most infamous location in the Ember Isles is **Firefell**—the ruins of the Neferati colony of Pyrathes, which collapsed into the volcanic chambers it was exploiting five centuries ago.

Firefell draws treasure hunters, scholars, and Kingdoms of Fire agents seeking lost Neferati knowledge. Most don't return. The ruins are guarded by fire elementals and worse things born in the catastrophe.

### The Inhabited Islands

Despite the dangers, several islands support small populations:

**Ember Harbor**: The closest thing to a safe port in the Ember Isles. Built on a relatively stable island with natural hot springs that have been channeled for domestic use. Population ~500, mostly supporting expedition staging.

**The Forges**: An island where smiths exploit geothermal heat for metalworking. The volcanic forge produces weapons and tools of unusual quality. Access is restricted; the smith-masters guard their techniques.

**Ash Garden**: A community of druids and naturalists studying the unique life forms that thrive in volcanic environments. They're strange people who've adapted to living alongside fire.

### Volcanic Ecology

The Ember Isles host life forms found nowhere else—plants and creatures that have evolved to survive in volcanic conditions:

**Fire-Adapted Plants**: Vegetation that tolerates extreme heat, grows in volcanic soil, and sometimes burns constantly without dying

**Thermal Creatures**: Animals that live in hot springs, near lava flows, or in the superheated caves beneath the surface

**Fire Elementals**: Whether native or drawn here by the concentrated elemental energy, fire elementals are common in the Ember Isles—especially around Firefell

### Navigation

Sailing the Ember Isles requires caution:

**Steam Banks**: Volcanic steam creates dense fog that can appear suddenly, hiding islands and navigation hazards

**Hot Water**: Some areas have water temperatures high enough to damage hulls or kill swimmers who fall overboard

**Unpredictable Eruptions**: Islands can become suddenly dangerous as volcanic activity shifts

**Ash Fall**: During active periods, volcanic ash can blanket ships, damaging sails and choking crews

Most vessels approaching the Ember Isles hire local pilots who know which areas are currently safe. "Currently" is the operative word—conditions change.

### What Brings People Here

- **Firefell**: Treasure, knowledge, or Kingdom of Fire business in the Neferati ruins
- **The Forges**: Commissions for volcanic-forged weapons and tools
- **Research**: Studying volcanic ecology, fire elementals, or Neferati history
- **Minerals**: Volcanic deposits include valuable metals and gems
- **Healing**: Some hot springs have medicinal properties (others are just hot enough to cook you)
