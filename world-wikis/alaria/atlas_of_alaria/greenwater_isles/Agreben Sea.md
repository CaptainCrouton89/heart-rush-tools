## Agreben Sea

Tags: sea, geography, greenwater-isles

The northern waters of the Greenwater Isles archipelago—a warm, teal-colored sea bounded by Mueras to the north, Atriik to the east, and the great island of Urok to the south. The Agreben is contested territory: the elegant reef-cities of the Kendrel Kingdoms line the eastern continental shelf, while Bfaspeen broods lair in the deeper waters to the west and south.

### Geography

The Agreben Sea occupies roughly 400 miles east-to-west and 300 miles north-to-south. The waters are shallow along the eastern edge where the continental shelf supports Kendrel civilization, deepening rapidly toward the center and west into trenches that Bfaspeen favor.

**North Agreben**: The northern reaches of the sea, where cooler currents from the Darkened Coast meet warmer tropical waters. Mueras's fragmented coastline creates complex navigation.

**The Eastern Shelf**: Shallow, warm waters perfect for coral reef cultivation. Home to the three Kendrel Kingdoms—Flurin, Glador, and Pelaria—arranged north to south along the coast.

**The Central Deep**: Open water too deep for permanent Kendrel settlement, patrolled by Bfaspeen hunting parties. Merchant ships crossing between the western islands and the eastern kingdoms travel in convoys or not at all.

**The Volcanic South**: Where Pelaria's thermal vents begin, the water temperature rises sharply. This zone is contested between Pelarian forces and Bfaspeen broods, with neither side holding permanent advantage.

### The Kendrel Kingdoms

Three Kendrel states occupy the eastern Agreben, collectively known as the Kendrel Kingdoms despite their distinct governments and occasional rivalry:

**Flurin** (north): The cosmopolitan gateway, handling most trade with surface nations. See [Flurin](Flurin.md).

**Glador** (center): The traditional heartland, largest and most insular of the three. See [Glador](Glador.md).

**Pelaria** (south): The volcanic kingdom, fire-attuned and militarized. See [Pelaria](Pelaria.md).

The kingdoms maintain formal alliance against external threats (primarily Bfaspeen) while competing fiercely in trade, prestige, and the elaborate courtship-politics that define Kendrel society.

### Western Islands

Several smaller islands dot the central and western Agreben, outside Kendrel territory:

**Crab Island**: Volcanic island hosting the city-state of Blackport—a notorious pirate haven controlled by the retired Nyolci captain Bridger Blindeyes. Black lavarock bluffs give the port its name. Ships seeking to cross the central Agreben often stop here, whatever their opinion of the management. See [Blackport](Blackport.md).

**Prophecy Island**: North of Crab Island, a volcanic island with a grim history. Colonists built a thriving settlement here, believing the island a divine gift. Two years later, the volcano erupted, burying everything. The ruins of Zyquirk village remain visible among hardened lava flows. See [Zyquirk](Zyquirk.md).

**Smokestack Island**: An active volcanic island east of Prophecy Island, wreathed in perpetual steam and smoke. Home to a reclusive pyromancer who has built a dungeon-complex into the volcano itself. Locals give it wide berth.

### The Bfaspeen Threat

The deeper Agreben waters host multiple Bfaspeen broods—eel-bodied monstrosities with mandibles, bulbous eyes, and a pathological lust for gold. They live in strict matriarchal groups, raiding ships for treasure and dragging prey to their underwater lairs.

The Kendrel have fought the Bfaspeen since before recorded history. Glador maintains purely defensive positions. Pelaria conducts active operations against brood-mother lairs. Flurin provides intelligence and tries to stay out of direct fighting. The conflict has no end in sight—but it's also what keeps the three kingdoms cooperating despite their differences.

### Navigation

**The Eastern Route**: Following the continental shelf from Flurin south to Pelaria, this is the safest passage through the Agreben. Kendrel patrols keep Bfaspeen activity suppressed, and the shallow waters make ambush difficult.

**The Central Crossing**: Direct routes between the western islands and eastern kingdoms cross deep water. Bfaspeen hunting parties make this dangerous. Merchant convoys form regularly at Blackport; individual ships take their chances.

**The Northern Passage**: Skirting the Darkened Coast toward Mueras. Avoids Bfaspeen but brings other hazards—the supernatural shadow that shrouds Mueras's eastern waters breeds strange creatures and stranger currents.

### What Travelers Should Know

- Surface vessels are generally safe in Kendrel-controlled waters, but should follow established routes and not anchor in unknown locations overnight.
- The Kendrel are friendly to trade but have elaborate social protocols. Causing offense—especially through violence—can result in permanent exclusion from all three kingdoms.
- Blackport asks no questions and offers no guarantees. It's useful, not safe.
- The central deep is genuinely dangerous. Don't cross alone, don't carry visible treasure, and don't assume help is coming if something goes wrong.
- Pelarian waters are too hot for normal swimming. Visitors need magical protection or specialized equipment.
