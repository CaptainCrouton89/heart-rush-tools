## Gulf of Norag

Tags: bay, sea, geography

A warm, shallow gulf where the Greenwater Isles meet the mainland coast of the Ishnit Jungles. The gulf's waters shift from the characteristic teal of the Greenwater archipelago to murky green near shore, where jungle rivers dump silt and organic matter into the sea.

### Character

The Gulf of Norag is beautiful and treacherous in equal measure. Coral formations create a maze of shallow channels that only experienced pilots can navigate safely. The waters teem with life—brilliantly colored fish, sea turtles, and hunting sharks that follow the fish. Above the waterline, jungle-covered headlands plunge directly into the sea, offering few natural harbors.

The gulf's primary danger isn't the reefs or the sharks. It's what watches from shore.

### Demortik Bay

The western arm of the Gulf of Norag curves around a jungle cape topped by Demonwatch—a darkstone palace visible from miles out to sea. Sailors call this inlet Demortik Bay, a corruption of "demon-tide bay," and avoid it religiously.

The waters here are unnaturally still. Fish avoid the bay. Even sharks turn away at its mouth. Local Naruaghin believe the demons confined to Demonwatch have poisoned the water with their presence—not literally toxic, but spiritually tainted. Whether true or superstition, vessels that anchor in Demortik Bay report crew nightmares, equipment failures, and occasionally crew members who walk into the water and don't return.

The bay would make an excellent harbor if anyone were foolish enough to use it.

### Strategic Significance

The Gulf of Norag represents an untapped trade route. Ships traveling between the Greenwater Isles and the western mainland currently swing wide around the Ishnit coast, adding days to their journey to avoid the gulf's dangers. A safe passage through the gulf—and more critically, a friendly port on its shores—would cut significant time from the voyage.

No one controls the gulf. The Naruaghin tribes don't build ships. The Dwelyn of Enapay maintain no naval presence. The waters are technically unclaimed, which means they belong to whoever's willing to fight for them.

Merchant houses have discussed establishing a trading post, but the combination of Demonwatch's curse, the warring tribes, and three territorial dragons within striking distance has deterred every attempt.

### Navigation Hazards

**The Coral Maze**: Shallow reefs extend miles from shore, with channels that shift seasonally as storms rearrange the coral. Local knowledge is essential.

**Jungle Rivers**: The Ishtar River and several smaller waterways dump fresh water and debris into the gulf, creating unpredictable currents and reducing visibility near shore.

**Weather**: Sudden tropical squalls blow in from the open sea with little warning. The gulf's shallow waters become violent chop in heavy weather.

**Dragons**: Both Pythalomos and Senwyn the Agonizer hunt over the gulf waters. Ships are generally too small to interest them, but "generally" provides cold comfort when a green dragon shadow passes overhead.

### Settlements

No permanent settlements exist on the Gulf of Norag's shores. The nearest civilization is **Lise**, capital of Enapay, located inland along the Ishtar River delta where the jungle gives way to the Green Wilds. Naruaghin fishing camps dot the coast temporarily, abandoned when the tribes move or when dragon activity increases.

Ambitious merchants occasionally anchor in the gulf's eastern reaches, trading with whatever Naruaghin are willing to approach. These transactions are tense, brief, and conducted with weapons visible on both sides.
