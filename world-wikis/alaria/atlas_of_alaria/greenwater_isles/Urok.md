## Urok

Tags: island, geography

A large island in the Greenwater Isles.

### Kameesi Jungle

The Kameesi Jungle dominates the northwestern peninsula of Urok—a dense, ancient rainforest where the canopy closes so thick that twilight persists even at midday. The air hangs heavy with moisture and the copper-sweet smell of rotting vegetation. This is Zelle territory, and outsiders who enter uninvited rarely leave.

The jungle teems with venomous life: serpents that drop from branches, frogs whose skin kills on contact, insects that burrow beneath flesh to lay eggs. But the true danger is the Zelle themselves—crimson-winged pixies who view every stranger as either threat or sacrifice.

#### Sovia River

The Sovia winds through the heart of Zelidian territory, flowing northeast from the jungle interior toward the coast. All five Zelidian settlements cluster along its banks, connected by the river's dark waters. The Zelle travel it by leaf-boat and wing, and its currents carry offerings downstream to wherever the jungle-spirits wish to receive them.

Outsiders sometimes attempt to navigate the Sovia to reach Zelidian markets. Most are intercepted within hours. The fortunate are merely turned away. The rest feed the river's hungry gods.

#### Iirmos

Once the capital of Zelidia, Iirmos now stands empty—a wound in the jungle where the canopy refuses to close. The city's bone-white spires still rise above the treeline, visible for miles, but no Zelle has set foot there in centuries.

The High Priestesses do not speak of what happened. The jungle remembers.

What is known: the priestesses of Iirmos attempted a great blood-working, a ritual to permanently ward Zelidia from all outsiders. They sacrificed not individuals but entire villages of captives, channeling more blood than had ever been offered. Something answered—but it was not the jungle-spirits they knew.

The ritual tore open a passage to somewhere else. What came through consumed Iirmos in a single night. The survivors fled to what is now Glezamos, and the High Priestesses sealed the city behind wards of a different kind: wards meant not to keep things out, but to keep something in.

The jungle has grown strange around Iirmos. Trees bend away from the ruins. Animals fall silent within a mile of its walls. Those who approach report hearing voices—not screaming, but welcoming. Inviting them inside. Promising they'll never need to leave.

#### Zelidia

The state of Zelidia encompasses all Zelle settlements along the Sovia River. See the full state entry for details on its theocratic government and blood-sacrifice religion.

##### Glezamos

The current capital of Zelidia sprawls across both banks of the Sovia, connected by bridges woven from living vines. Glezamos was built hastily after the fall of Iirmos, and its architecture still carries that desperate, improvised quality—structures that grew organically around the needs of refugees rather than following any grand design.

The Temple of the Hungry Canopy dominates the city's center, where the High Priestesses conduct their sacrifices and commune with the jungle-spirits. Foreign delegations (the rare few permitted to live) are received in the Bleeding Court, an open plaza where the stones are permanently stained rust-red.

##### Nox

The easternmost Zelidian village, closest to the coast and to outsiders. Nox serves as the reluctant interface between Zelidia and the outside world—a shadow-market where non-pixies can trade under heavy restriction. Transactions occur at night (hence the name), conducted through intermediaries, with the actual Zelle traders remaining unseen in the darkness above. Weapons are forbidden. Lights are forbidden. Those who break the rules simply vanish.

##### Katat

An agricultural village upriver from Glezamos, where the Zelle cultivate the jungle's bounty: fruits that induce prophetic dreams, fungi that enhance blood-magic, flowers whose nectar is essential for pixie reproduction. Katat's fields are tended by thralls—outsiders who wandered too close and now serve without will or memory.

##### Sookap

A fishing village where the Sovia widens into lazy pools. Sookap's fishers harvest river-creatures for food and ritual use, including the sacred blood-eels whose consumption is required for High Priestess initiation. The village also maintains the ritual boats used to send offerings downstream.

##### Yift

The village closest to Glezamos, practically a suburb of the capital. Yift's artisans produce the material culture of Zelidian religion: ritual blades, wing-paints in sacred patterns, sacrificial implements, and the bone-chimes that hang throughout every Zelle settlement. Yift's workshops never fall silent.

### Phalkrene Mountains

The Phalkrene range runs north-south through the center of Urok's northwestern peninsula, separating Thrallwood to the west from Chitinwood to the east. The mountains are old and worn, their peaks rounded by millennia of tropical rain, but they remain formidable—dense with fog, treacherous with sudden drops, and home to things that prefer not to be found.

The range's most striking feature is visible from miles away: a colossal skull embedded in the mountainside, its eye sockets glowing faintly at night. This is Pyonokraus.

#### Pyonokraus

A city-state built into the skull of a dead titan. See the full state entry for details on its curse and inhabitants.

#### Vainye River

The Vainye descends from the Phalkrene heights, fed by mountain springs and perpetual mist-rain. Its waters run cold even in the tropical heat—cold enough that locals say the river remembers winter from somewhere else.

The Vainye flows past Pyonokraus before disappearing into the mountains' western slopes, eventually emerging to feed Thrallwood's swamps. Those who drink from it near the city report strange dreams: visions of a world with four suns, of beings with too many arms, of purposes that span centuries. Whether this is the titan's memory bleeding into the water or the Ayblek's alien influence remains unclear.

### Thrallwood

The western slopes of the Phalkrene Mountains drain into Thrallwood—a swamp-forest that stretches to Shamerei Bay. The trees here grow from standing water, their roots tangled into vast platforms of rotting vegetation. Mist rises perpetually from the warm, stagnant pools.

Something old claims Thrallwood. Not a god, not a spirit—something from the same age as the titan whose skull became Pyonokraus. Perhaps it served that titan once. Perhaps it was the titan's enemy. Whatever it was, it bound this place to its will, and that binding has outlasted the binder.

Every creature in Thrallwood serves. The beasts move in patterns too regular to be natural, patrolling routes they've walked for centuries. Birds call at precise intervals. Insects swarm in geometric formations. Even the plants seem to reach toward intruders with coordinated purpose.

The compulsion is contagious. Those who linger in Thrallwood begin to feel the pull—an urge to walk a certain path, to guard a certain tree, to wait for instructions that never come. The longer one stays, the harder it becomes to leave. After a few days, the victim stops wanting to. After a week, they forget they ever wanted anything else.

Thralls wander the forest still: humans, gnomes, beasts, all moving in silent service to a master that may be dead, sleeping, or simply elsewhere. They do not speak. They do not acknowledge outsiders. But they will stop anyone from reaching whatever lies at Thrallwood's heart.

### Chitinwood

East of the Phalkrene Mountains, the forest floor crunches underfoot. Chitinwood takes its name from what covers everything: the shed exoskeletons, the gnawed remains, the living shells of countless giant beetles.

This is not a civilization. There is no hive-mind, no beetle-society, no alien intelligence to negotiate with. Chitinwood is simply an ecosystem—one where beetles the size of horses are the dominant life form. Rhinoceros beetles that can gore through trees. Stag beetles whose mandibles shear through bone. Bombardier beetles that spray caustic chemicals. And countless smaller varieties that swarm, burrow, devour.

The beetles aren't aggressive by nature; they're simply beetles, doing what beetles do. But everything in Chitinwood has adapted to them. Predators have evolved chitin-cracking jaws. Prey have developed shells of their own. The trees grow thick, corky bark. Even the birds have beak-plates that can pry larvae from wood.

Travelers can pass through Chitinwood, but they must move carefully. Disturbing a beetle's territory, stumbling into a mating display, or simply smelling like food can trigger swarming behavior. The forest floor is littered with the picked-clean skeletons of those who made mistakes.

Chitin itself is valuable—beetle-plate armor, tool components, alchemical ingredients. Hunters from Pyonokraus occasionally venture into the edges of the forest to harvest, but they never go deep. Something larger lives in Chitinwood's interior. No one has seen it clearly. They've only found the shells it leaves behind—each one the size of a building.

### Shamerei Bay

The western coast of the peninsula curves inward to form Shamerei Bay, where Thrallwood meets the sea. The bay takes its name from Shamerei the Defiant—a merchant captain who, according to legend, refused to pay tribute to Zelidia and attempted to establish a trading post on these shores.

The Zelle made an example of her. They did not kill her quickly. They did not kill her crew at all—instead, they released them to spread word of what happens to those who defy the pixie kingdom. The captain's bones were woven into a warning-marker that still stands at the bay's entrance, preserved by blood-magic against rot and time.

No ships anchor in Shamerei Bay now. The waters are safe enough—calm, deep, well-sheltered from storms. But the warning remains, and sailors give the bay a wide berth. Only smugglers and the truly desperate make landfall here, hoping to slip into Thrallwood and reach... something. Whatever they're looking for, they rarely find it.

### Anemone Sound

South of Chitinwood, the coast opens into Anemone Sound—named for the vast colonies of sea anemones that carpet its shallow floor. These are not ordinary anemones. The largest specimens stretch twenty feet across, their stinging tentacles capable of paralyzing a whale.

The anemones have made the sound nearly impassable. Ships that enter find their hulls gripped by tentacles, their crews snatched from the decks. The water itself seems to reach upward. Only shallow-draft vessels piloted by those who know the safe channels can navigate through, and that knowledge is jealously guarded.

Something feeds the anemones—something that wants the sound protected. The waters beyond the colonies are strangely clear, almost crystalline, and divers who've made it through report structures on the seafloor: walls, columns, what might be roads. No one has explored them. No one has returned from trying.

### Deadwater Bay

At the peninsula's southern tip, Deadwater Bay earns its name. Nothing lives here. The water is clear—too clear, sterile as glass. No fish swim in it. No seaweed clings to its rocks. No barnacles grow on the few wrecks that have drifted in. Even bacteria seem absent; corpses that wash into the bay do not rot. They simply... remain.

The effect extends several hundred yards from shore. Sailors who must pass through report an oppressive silence, a sense of being watched, and a wrongness they can't articulate. Some claim the water itself feels different—heavier, more reluctant to move.

No one knows what killed Deadwater Bay, or what keeps it dead. The Zelle avoid it. Pyonokraus ignores it. Even Thrallwood's compulsion seems to have no interest in this stretch of coast. Whatever happened here was thorough, and whatever lingers here is patient.

### Hurtzsh River

The Hurtzsh flows southeast through Chitinwood, eventually emptying into Anemone Sound. Its waters run murky with beetle-waste and decaying chitin, giving it a brackish, faintly metallic taste. The river serves as a natural highway through the beetle-forest—most creatures avoid the water, making it safer than the forest floor.

Rafts can navigate the Hurtzsh, though the journey is unpleasant. The smell is memorable. The sound of beetles clattering on the banks is constant. And occasionally, something large surfaces to investigate the disturbance before submerging again.

### Andestro River

The Andestro winds through the southern reaches of the peninsula, fed by streams from the Phalkrene Mountains' lower slopes. Warmer and slower than the Vainye, it meanders through marshland before reaching the coast near Deadwater Bay.

The river is navigable but eerie. As it approaches Deadwater Bay, the wildlife along its banks grows sparse, then absent. Fish become scarce. Birds stop calling. The last few miles flow in absolute silence, the Andestro's waters growing clearer and more lifeless as they near their destination. Locals call this stretch the "Dying Mile," and avoid it.

### Tethryn Mountains

The Tethryn range rises in northwestern SW Urok, younger and sharper than the worn Pearly Mountains to the south. These peaks still show volcanic origins—black basalt cliffs, hot springs steaming in high valleys, and soil rich enough to support terraced farms where little else would grow. The range runs roughly east-west, creating a natural barrier between the coastal lowlands around Phiona Bay and the interior plateau where the Thyogres River begins its long journey south.

The Tethryns are most famous for what sits atop them: Xi Chin, the Timekeeper city, whose white marble towers are visible from ships in the Gulf of Xoth on clear days. The mountains' height and the clarity of their air make them ideal for astronomical observation—a fact the city's founders recognized millennia ago.

Several rivers originate in the Tethryn heights. The Pteyalune flows north toward Deadwater Bay, its waters growing colder and more lifeless as they approach that cursed shore. The Freolian drains the eastern slopes, flowing southeast toward the Pearly Mountains—it's the main water-road connecting Xi Chin's region to the interior. The Expation River tumbles down the western face toward Phiona Bay, named (locals claim) by exiles from some forgotten conflict who settled its fertile banks.

#### Xi Chin

The Timekeeper city rises from a high plateau in the central Tethryns, its marble architecture stark white against the dark volcanic stone. See the full state entry for details on its astronomical traditions, the Great Clocktower, and the Chroniclers' Compact that guarantees its neutrality.

From a distance, Xi Chin appears to glow at dawn and dusk—the marble catching the light when the surrounding peaks have fallen into shadow. Pilgrims, students, and diplomats make the climb along the Wister Road, a switchback path carved into the mountainside over centuries. The journey takes three days from the coast, or two if you're young and foolish enough to push through the night.

#### Wister Valley

East of Xi Chin, the mountains open into Wister Valley—a high bowl of terraced farms and scattered villages that feeds the Timekeeper city. The valley's volcanic soil grows grain, vegetables, and the famous Wister apples, small and tart, that ferment into a cider prized across the Greenwater Isles.

But Wister Valley serves more than agriculture. Its orientation creates a natural corridor for observing specific star-rises, and ancient standing stones—predating Xi Chin itself—mark astronomical positions that the Chroniclers still use for their most precise calculations. Some scholars believe Xi Chin was built where it was specifically because of Wister Valley's sight-lines.

The valley folk are a mix of humans and dwarves whose families have worked this land for generations. They're proud, practical, and suspicious of the marble-city intellectuals who depend on their harvests but rarely deign to visit. "Xi Chin counts the stars," goes a local saying, "but Wister counts the sacks of grain."

### Pearly Mountains

The Pearly Mountains arc across SW Urok's midsection, older and more weathered than the Tethryns to the north. Millennia of tropical rain have rounded their peaks into soft shapes that gleam pale gray in certain light—hence the name. The range separates the northern forests and river valleys from the southern territories where Xoth holds sway.

These mountains are riddled with caves. Some are natural limestone formations carved by underground rivers. Others show signs of ancient habitation—smooth walls, carved steps, chambers that once held purpose. The deepest caves connect to tunnel systems that run beneath the entire range, linking to whatever lurks below Maun and Wisgarrd.

The Pearly Mountains' western extent reaches almost to the coast, sheltering Phiona Bay from southern storms. Their eastern slopes descend into the Pyrgion Forest and Xoth territory. In between, the Thyogres River has carved a pass that serves as the main route between the northern and southern halves of SW Urok.

The Myestrones—"hundred streams" in an old trade tongue—drain the northern faces, eventually feeding the Freolian River. The Vyandrik and Prelapon rivers flow west toward Phiona Bay, their valleys dotted with villages that have maintained independence by being too poor and too remote for anyone to bother conquering.

#### Shenchen Forest

At the southwestern extent of the Pearly Mountains, where the slopes descend toward Tyberoskos, lies Shenchen Forest—a place travelers learn to avoid.

The forest grows dense and dark here, ancient trees closing overhead like a canopy of grasping fingers. Among them stand the ruins of what was once a monastery-fortress: pagoda towers strangled by vines, meditation gardens gone to wilderness, training yards where the stones still show sword-cuts centuries old. This was the home of the Order of the Falling Leaf.

The Order were Uline Dwarven warrior-monks who rejected the daemon-pacts that were spreading across southeastern Urok—the covenant that would eventually unite diverse peoples into the theocratic state of Xoth. While others embraced the Seven Patrons' power, the Order sought enlightenment through martial perfection—not divine blessing, but the precise, almost artistic discipline of the sword-saint. For generations they trained in isolation, developing techniques that blended combat and meditation into something approaching transcendence.

When the growing covenant demanded the Order's submission, the masters refused. They knew they could not win a war, and they would not flee. Instead, they performed a final ritual. The students were sent away—some say to found what would become Maun's martial tradition, carrying the Order's philosophy to a new home. The masters remained, binding their souls to their armor in a rite that cost them their lives but granted them eternity.

Now they stand eternal vigil. The armor moves without flesh inside it, animated by spirits that remember only duty. They patrol paths that have been overgrown for centuries. They guard shrines whose gods may no longer exist. They attack intruders without warning, without mercy, and without any degradation of the skills they mastered in life. A Falling Leaf guardian is worth a dozen ordinary soldiers—and there are hundreds in Shenchen Forest.

What do they guard? The Order's sacred texts remain in the monastery's deepest vaults—philosophical treatises on death, discipline, and transcendence that Xoth has long sought to destroy. Some scholars believe the texts contain techniques for resisting daemonic influence, which would explain Xoth's interest. Others think the monastery hides something older, something the Order was built to protect. The guardians ensure no one gets close enough to find out.

### Xoth

The theocratic nation of Xoth dominates southeastern Urok—a multi-racial covenant-state bound by shared worship of the Seven Patrons rather than blood or ancestry. See the full state entry for details on its religion, government, and the daemon-aided military that makes its neighbors nervous.

Xoth's territory spans diverse terrain: sacred forests, fertile plains, harsh desert, and a long coastline. The landscape shapes the faith as much as the faith shapes the landscape; every region has its patron, every feature its religious significance.

#### Umlas

The holy capital rises from the central plains where the original covenant was struck. Seven great temples—one for each patron—ring a central plaza dominated by the Hall of Convergence where the Hierophancy meets. The Temple of Theros faces east, catching the dawn; the Temple of Petranos is half-buried, its lower levels extending deep into the earth; the Temple of Lykanos stands at the crossroads where the major pilgrimage routes meet.

Umlas isn't the largest city on Urok, but it may be the most orderly. Streets follow a geometric pattern radiating from the central plaza. Buildings are constructed to last centuries. The constant sound of bells marks the hours and calls the faithful to prayer. Visitors describe the city as beautiful but unsettling—too quiet, too clean, too *watched*.

The population hovers around forty thousand, swelling during major festivals when pilgrims arrive from across Xoth. Most residents work in temple administration, craft production, or services for the endless stream of visitors. The truly devout seek positions in Umlas; living in the holy city is itself a form of worship.

#### Kumi Wood

North of Umlas, Kumi Wood stretches from the foothills of the Pearly Mountains to the coast near the Bay of Lords. This ancient hardwood forest is sacred to both Petranos and Kethros—the earth that grows the trees and the craft that shapes them.

Every tree felled in Kumi Wood requires ritual permission. Foresters must petition the local temple, specifying which tree, for what purpose, and offering appropriate thanks to Petranos for the gift. This sounds like bureaucratic obstruction, but it actually ensures sustainable harvesting. Kumi Wood has been producing exceptional timber for centuries and shows no sign of depletion.

The wood itself is prized across Alaria. Kumi hardwood takes stain beautifully, resists rot, and—when worked by Xothic craftsmen invoking Kethros—holds minor enchantments well. Instruments made from Kumi wood are particularly valued; some say they never go out of tune.

Settlements in Kumi Wood tend to be small and focused on forestry or woodcraft. Ku'or, the largest, serves as the administrative center for lumber operations and hosts a major temple to Kethros.

#### Dunes of Tithonius

Northeast of Kumi Wood, where the forest gives way to scrubland and then to sand, lie the Dunes of Tithonius—a desert that shouldn't exist.

The rest of Urok is tropical or temperate. The Dunes are arid, harsh, and strange. Scholars have proposed various explanations: ancient magical catastrophe, a curse from a forgotten god, residual effects from whatever created Deadwater Bay to the north. None are confirmed. The Xothic explanation is simpler: Theros claimed this land, burning away everything soft, leaving only truth.

The dunes are named for Tithonius, a figure from the time before the covenant. The stories disagree on who he was—a prophet, a king, a demon, a god. What's consistent is that he's *gone*, his works buried beneath the sand, his name surviving only as a geographic label.

Ruins beneath the dunes predate the covenant by unknown centuries. The Hierophancy has excavated some, found others by accident, and suspects more remain hidden. What they've uncovered includes architectural styles no Xothic scholar recognizes, inscriptions in no known language, and artifacts that sometimes... do things. The temples keep these finds secure and don't discuss them publicly.

The living population is sparse. Ascetics seek visions in the deep desert, claiming Theros speaks more clearly where distractions are few. Military units train here, learning to fight in brutal conditions. Herders graze animals at the dunes' edges. The few permanent settlements—Iphikrates, Gryllus—serve as supply points and temples for those passing through.

#### Pyrgion Forest

Western Xoth, between the Siddaneas River and the heartland, is dominated by Pyrgion Forest—dense woodland that serves as the buffer between the covenant and non-Xothic territories.

Pyrgion is frontier country. The settlements here—Aegicoros, Deru'or, Fonirisxes, Hippasus—are devout but practical, accustomed to dealing with outsiders who haven't taken the covenant. Trade flows through; so do travelers, refugees, and occasionally missionaries heading in both directions.

The Meilaenias River provides the main route through Pyrgion, navigable for most of its length. River towns handle much of the traffic between Xoth and the western city-states. The temples in these towns are well-funded—Lykanos blesses trade, and the traders repay him generously.

The forest itself is less sacred than Kumi Wood—no special rituals for timber harvest, no particular patron claiming it. But it's still Xothic territory, and the settlements maintain temples to all Seven. Travelers passing through will find the faith omnipresent even in the frontier.

#### The Central Plains

Between Kumi Wood, the Dunes, Pyrgion, and the coast lies the heartland: rolling plains of farmland and pasture dotted with temple-towns and connected by pilgrimage roads.

This is where most Xothic live. The soil is fertile, the climate mild, the Petranos-blessed irrigation systems well-maintained. Farming families work the land as their ancestors did, punctuating labor with prayer and marking the seasons with festivals. It's ordinary life, made extraordinary by constant divine presence.

The plains settlements—Speusippos, Hippotas, Qo'koven, Sicule'os, and dozens of smaller towns—are administrative and religious centers for the surrounding farms. Each hosts temples to all Seven, though different towns emphasize different patrons based on local needs. Speusippos is known for its Kethros temple and craft guilds; Hippotas maintains the largest Makhros shrine outside Umlas and trains many Theophoroi.

Roads connect everything. The Xothic don't just maintain roads for trade—pilgrimage is a religious duty, and every citizen is expected to visit Umlas at least once. The routes are sacred paths, marked with shrines to Lykanos at crossroads and rest stations where travelers can pray and resupply.

#### Stepsidae Peninsula

Southeastern Xoth extends into the Stepsidae Peninsula—drier, rockier, more isolated than the heartland. The settlements here (Eos, Phryne, Perdik'kias, and smaller villages) are self-reliant communities of herders and fishers.

Some say Stepsidae is where the most fervent Xothic live. Away from Umlas's sophistication and the plains' comfort, faith becomes harder, purer. The peninsula's temples are austere; its priests are strict; its people are suspicious of soft mainlanders who've never struggled for their devotion.

This reputation isn't entirely fair—Stepsidae has its moderates too—but it's not entirely wrong either. The peninsula produces more than its share of zealots, Theophoroi, and priests who rise high in the Hierophancy. When Xoth needs something done without hesitation or mercy, Stepsidae volunteers.

The Gulf of Xoth defines the peninsula's western coast; the Bay of Lords curves around its northern edge. Fishing villages work both waters, and a small shipbuilding industry in Eos produces vessels that carry Xothic goods across the Greenwater Isles.

#### Rivers of Xoth

**Meilaenias River**: The main artery through Pyrgion Forest, flowing from the Pearly Mountains' eastern slopes toward the coast. Navigable for most of its length, it carries trade between Xoth and the western territories. Temple-towns cluster along its banks.

**Tipholes River**: Flows through northern Xoth, skirting the edge of Kumi Wood before reaching the coast near the Bay of Lords. Smaller than the Meilaenias but important for lumber transport—logs float downstream from Kumi harvesting sites to coastal mills.

**Siddaneas River** (upper reaches): The Siddaneas marks Xoth's western boundary, but its upper reaches flow through Xothic territory before heading south. See the fuller description in the Rivers of SW Urok section.

#### The Settlement Hierarchy

Xothic settlements follow a clear hierarchy:

**Umlas** stands alone as the holy capital—seat of the Hierophancy, center of the faith, destination for all pilgrims.

**Sacred Cities** (Ku'or, Speusippos, Hippotas, Qo'koven, Sicule'os, Gryllus, Iphikrates) each host major temple complexes and serve as regional administrative centers. Each Sacred City has particular significance—a connection to sacred history, a notable shrine, or an important institutional function.

**Temple-Towns** (dozens across the territory) maintain resident priesthood and serve as religious and civic centers for surrounding villages. A temple-town has temples to all Seven, though some may be small shrines rather than full structures.

**Villages** have minimal religious infrastructure—perhaps a shared shrine, visited periodically by priests from the nearest temple-town. Villagers travel to temple-towns for major rituals and festivals.

The road network connects these layers. Pilgrimage routes link villages to temple-towns, temple-towns to Sacred Cities, and Sacred Cities to Umlas. The geography of Xoth is the geography of faith.

### Tyberoskos

South of the Pearly Mountains, where the land descends toward the coast, Tyberoskos spreads across rolling hills of limestone and clay. This is not a forest that welcomes travelers. The ground is treacherous—riddled with sinkholes that open without warning, swallowing the unwary into darkness. The trees have adapted with vast root systems that grip the unstable earth, their canopy so thick that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight.

Two peoples call Tyberoskos home, bound together by necessity and lunar rhythm.

#### The Weretigers

The weretigers of Tyberoskos are not monsters—most of the time. For twenty-two days of the month, they live as humans do: hunting, trading, raising families in scattered camps throughout the forest. They're suspicious of outsiders but not hostile, willing to guide travelers through safe paths for fair payment.

Then the new moon comes.

When Nyxara goes dark, the weretigers lose themselves. The transformation is involuntary and total—not just physical but mental. They become apex predators driven by instinct, hunting anything that moves with terrible efficiency. Even their own families are not safe; weretiger camps scatter before the new moon, individuals isolating themselves to minimize the carnage.

The change lasts three nights. When Nyxara's first sliver returns, the weretigers wake—often miles from where they started, sometimes covered in blood they pray isn't human. They've learned to live with this curse, but they've never learned to cure it. Some say it came from a Zelidian blood-ritual gone wrong, others that it's punishment from a tiger-god for some ancient transgression. The weretigers themselves don't speak of origins. They simply endure.

#### The Qipi

The Qipi are gnomes—but barely. Standing less than a foot tall, they're the smallest of the gnomish peoples, with gray skin that blends into limestone and enormous dark eyes adapted to underground life. They live in the sinkholes that pock Tyberoskos, carving tiny cities into the vertical walls: miniature towers, thread-thin bridges, gardens of phosphorescent fungi.

From above, a Qipi sinkhole looks like nothing—a dark hole in the forest floor, maybe thirty feet across. Climb down (if you can fit in the handholds carved for Qipi fingers), and you'll find a civilization. The largest sinkholes house thousands, their walls honeycombed with dwellings, their floors converted to underground lakes stocked with blind fish.

The Qipi have an arrangement with the weretigers. When the new moon approaches, the gnomes retreat underground and seal their sinkholes with stone caps—too heavy for a transformed weretiger to move, too snugly fit to offer purchase for claws. They wait in darkness until the danger passes. In exchange, during the safe twenty-two days, weretiger hunters protect Qipi trading expeditions to the surface and escort their merchants to markets in Maun and Wisgarrd.

It's not friendship. The weretigers are terrified of what they might do to the tiny gnomes during transformation; the Qipi are pragmatic enough to know they need protection. But generations of mutual dependence have built something like trust. When a Qipi elder speaks of "our great friends above," there's genuine warmth beneath the irony.

#### The Suverain River

The Suverain flows through western Tyberoskos, its course determined by the same limestone geology that creates the sinkholes. The river disappears underground in several places, emerging miles later, making navigation unreliable. Local guides know which stretches are safe for boats and which will swallow you into darkness.

### Maun

A dwarven city-state on the southern coast of SW Urok, famous for its School of Music and Theater. Maun sits where the Maun River empties into Beauty Bay, its harbor busy with ships carrying students, graduates, and the instruments they craft. See the full state entry for details on its martial traditions, mandatory service requirements, and the mysterious Ghost who haunts its halls.

The city is as much heard as seen—music drifts from every quarter, students practicing at all hours, the sounds of a hundred instruments blending into a constant, ever-shifting symphony. Visitors either fall in love with Maun or flee within a day. There is no middle ground.

### Wisgarrd

A dwarven city-state inland from Maun, built into the foothills where the Pearly Mountains descend toward the coast. Wisgarrd is home to the School of Jewelry, where master craftsmen teach the art of gem-cutting and, to select students, the secrets of magical enchantment. See the full state entry for details on its curriculum, the legendary Book of Gems, and its complicated relationship with Maun.

The Peonie River flows past Wisgarrd's walls, its banks thick with the flowering plants that give the river its name. Jewelers draw inspiration from the blooms; some say no Wisgarrd piece is complete without at least one element borrowed from the peonie's form.

### South Reach

The southern coast of SW Urok curves from Beauty Bay to the Gulf of Xoth, a stretch of shoreline that serves as the region's maritime gateway. South Reach isn't a political entity—no city-state claims it, no nation governs it—but rather a geographic term for the coastal strip and its scattered settlements.

Most traffic flows through **Threshold**, a rough harbor town at the midpoint of the coast. Threshold exists because it's useful: ships need somewhere to resupply, travelers need somewhere to rest, and merchants need somewhere to conduct business away from city-state tariffs. The town has all the vices sailors expect and all the services travelers need, governed loosely by a council of ship captains and innkeepers who agree on exactly one principle: Threshold stays neutral, or Threshold dies.

The Mneri River reaches the sea here, its mouth forming a natural harbor that Threshold has exploited for generations. Fishing villages dot the coast to either side, their catches feeding both the town and the trade ships that stop for provisions.

### Phiona Bay

The western coast of SW Urok curves inward to form Phiona Bay, a broad shallow anchorage sheltered by the Pearly Mountains' western extent. The bay takes its name from Saint Phiona, a healer-priestess who, according to legend, walked across its waters during a great plague three centuries past. She touched the sick in every fishing village along the shore, and by morning the plague had broken. Whether miracle or myth, the bay is considered blessed water by many sailors.

Phiona Bay is treacherous for the unwary. Sandbars shift with the seasons, submerged rocks lurk where charts say clear water should be, and the currents run strange near the river mouths. Local pilots know the channels; outsiders founder. The fishing villages along the shore make good money guiding merchant ships to safe anchorage—and salvaging those that didn't pay for guidance.

The Vyandrik River empties into the bay's northern reach, wide and slow and navigable for shallow-draft vessels. The Prelapon joins it from the south, faster and prone to seasonal flooding. Together they drain most of the Pearly Mountains' western slopes, carrying silt that builds the sandbars and makes the bay's navigation so unpredictable.

On feast days commemorating Phiona's Walk, small boats with candle-lit shrines drift across the bay after sunset. Some say the candles burn for days without going out. Others say that's just good wax and wishful thinking.

### Beauty Bay

South of Tyberoskos, where the Maun River meets the sea, Beauty Bay earned its name honestly. Something about the water's mineral content—runoff from the limestone sinkholes upstream—combined with the angle of the Pearly Mountains creates sunsets of extraordinary color. Oranges and purples that seem impossible, light that paints the water like oil on canvas.

Artists from Maun have painted Beauty Bay for centuries. Some claim watching the sunset from its shores inspires creativity; others say that's romantic nonsense, but they keep coming back anyway. The bay has become part of Maun's identity—the School of Music holds outdoor performances in a natural stone amphitheater on the eastern shore, timing finales to coincide with the sunset's peak.

The same minerals that color the light make the bay's water unsuitable for drinking but excellent for certain dye-making processes. Maun's theatrical costumes are famous partly for colors that can't be reproduced elsewhere—the bay's gift to the city that celebrates it.

### Drunken Forest

East of Wisgarrd, between the city-state and Xoth's western territories, the Drunken Forest earns its name with every step. The trees grow wrong here. Not just tilted but spiraling, looping, growing horizontally for yards before shooting upward at impossible angles. Root systems twist back on themselves. Branches reach down instead of up. The forest looks like it was planted by a giant who couldn't walk straight.

Walking through the Drunken Forest induces vertigo. The wrongness of the trees confuses the eye; the brain insists "up" is somewhere it isn't. Prolonged exposure—more than a few hours—causes genuine disorientation. Travelers have been found wandering in circles, convinced they were walking straight, their sense of direction completely scrambled.

No one knows why. Theories range from a leyline intersection beneath the soil to buried titan-bones leaking residual magic to a collapsed temple dedicated to a god of madness. The Qipi claim the forest "drank something bad from the earth" and leave it at that. No one's dug deep enough to find the truth—the disorientation makes sustained work impossible.

The forest serves as a natural buffer between Wisgarrd and Xoth's Pyrgion Forest territory. Neither side has tried to tame it; neither side needs to. Anyone attempting to march an army through the Drunken Forest would arrive with soldiers too dizzy to fight.

Timber from the forest is prized for decorative work—the natural spirals are genuinely beautiful, and furniture-makers pay well for Drunken wood. Harvesters work in short shifts, retreating before the disorientation takes hold. They mark their paths with rope and never work alone.

### The Rivers of SW Urok

SW Urok is defined by its waterways. The mountains catch rain; the rivers carry it to the sea; and along those rivers, civilization clusters.

#### Northern Rivers

**Pteyalune River**: Flows north from the Tethryn Mountains toward Deadwater Bay. Cold, clear water that grows increasingly lifeless as it approaches that cursed shore. Fish swim the upper reaches; the lower river is sterile. Locals believe the Pteyalune once flowed warm and full of life before "something happened" to the bay. Now it carries that death upstream, a little further each generation.

**Freolian River**: The main water-road from Xi Chin's region southeast toward the interior. Named for the Freolian family, merchant-explorers who first mapped its navigable stretches. Good fishing, moderate current, lined with trading posts. If you're traveling from the Tethryn Mountains to the southern city-states by water, you start on the Freolian.

**Myestrones**: Less a river than a network—"hundred streams" in an old trade tongue. The Myestrones drain the Pearly Mountains' northern faces, dozens of creeks and brooks converging into tributaries that eventually feed the Freolian. Locals navigate by knowing which stream leads where; outsiders get lost within hours.

#### Western Rivers

**Vyandrik River**: The major western artery, flowing from the Pearly Mountains into Phiona Bay. Wide, slow, navigable for much of its length. Fishing villages cluster at its mouth, and shallow-draft boats can travel surprisingly far inland—nearly to the mountain foothills in the wet season.

**Prelapon River**: Joins the Vyandrik from the south, draining the Pearly Mountains' western slopes. Faster current, prone to dramatic seasonal flooding. The name means something like "after the washing"—supposedly named for a legendary flood that "washed away the old and left behind the new." The Prelapon's floods are destructive but fertilizing; the river-valley farms produce the best yields in SW Urok.

**Expation River**: Flows down the western coast into Phiona Bay from the north. Local legend claims the name is a corruption of "Expatriate's River"—named by exiles from some forgotten conflict who settled its banks rather than return home. The exiles are long gone, absorbed into the fishing villages, but the name persists.

#### Central Rivers

**Thyogres River**: The great central artery of SW Urok. The Thyogres rises in the highlands between the Tethryn and Pearly ranges, flows south through the mountain pass, skirts the eastern edge of Tyberoskos, and eventually reaches the sea near South Reach. It's the primary trade route through the interior—wide, deep, and slow enough for heavy cargo vessels. Control of Thyogres River traffic has been fought over for centuries; currently, no single power dominates, and tolls are collected by whoever holds the nearest bank.

**Suverain River**: Flows southward through western Tyberoskos, parallel to the Thyogres but smaller and wilder. The name suggests "sovereign"—perhaps once a boundary between territories now forgotten. The Suverain disappears underground in several places, a product of Tyberoskos's limestone geology, making it unreliable for navigation.

#### Southern Rivers

**Peonie River**: Flows past Wisgarrd toward the coast, clear water over a rocky bed, famous for the flowering plants that grow thick along its banks. The peonies bloom in late spring, carpeting the riverbanks in pink and white. Wisgarrd's jewelers have drawn inspiration from the flowers for centuries—peonie motifs appear in their oldest and most traditional designs.

**Maun River**: The river that gives Maun its name—or perhaps Maun gave the river its name; scholars argue. Either way, the city straddles it, connected by bridges of increasing architectural ambition as you move from the outskirts toward the School. The Maun is shallow enough to ford in places but deep enough for small boats, making the city a natural crossroads.

**Mneri River**: Southwest of Maun, reaching the sea at Threshold. Smaller and wilder than its neighbors, with rapids in its upper reaches that make navigation difficult. The name is old, its meaning forgotten—possibly derived from a language that predates the current inhabitants.

#### Eastern River

**Siddaneas River**: Flows along the eastern edge of SW Urok, marking the approximate boundary with Xoth territory. The river is less a border than a convenient reference point—Xoth's influence extends somewhat west of it, and independent settlements exist somewhat east. But when locals say "across the Siddaneas," they mean "in Xoth's sphere," and they lower their voices when they say it.

### Bay of Lords

A bay on Urok.

### Nekanzi Jungle

The northeastern peninsula of Urok, dominated by dense rainforest split by the Firespine—a surface breach of the Yolus fire leyline. Home to the Neka gnomes, a confederacy of five villages (Tyunigogo, Hyhi, Kanamazi, Yanayazi, and Sygozoki) who have built their culture around negotiating with the fire spirits that emerge from the leyline. The Neka are territorial but trade through Tyunigogo with outsiders, offering fire-resistant materials and distinctive flame-touched metalwork from Sygozoki's spirit-powered forges.

See the full entry in [Nekanzi Jungle](Nekanzi%20Jungle.md) for details on the villages, the Firespine, and Neka society.

### Stepsidae

A steppe region on Urok.
