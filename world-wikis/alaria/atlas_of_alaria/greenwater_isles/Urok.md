## Urok

Tags: island, geography

A large island in the Greenwater Isles.

### Kameesi Jungle

The Kameesi Jungle dominates the northwestern peninsula of Urok—a dense, ancient rainforest where the canopy closes so thick that twilight persists even at midday. The air hangs heavy with moisture and the copper-sweet smell of rotting vegetation. This is Zelle territory, and outsiders who enter uninvited rarely leave.

The jungle teems with venomous life: serpents that drop from branches, frogs whose skin kills on contact, insects that burrow beneath flesh to lay eggs. But the true danger is the Zelle themselves—crimson-winged pixies who view every stranger as either threat or sacrifice.

#### Sovia River

The Sovia winds through the heart of Zelidian territory, flowing northeast from the jungle interior toward the coast. All five Zelidian settlements cluster along its banks, connected by the river's dark waters. The Zelle travel it by leaf-boat and wing, and its currents carry offerings downstream to wherever the jungle-spirits wish to receive them.

Outsiders sometimes attempt to navigate the Sovia to reach Zelidian markets. Most are intercepted within hours. The fortunate are merely turned away. The rest feed the river's hungry gods.

#### Iirmos

Once the capital of Zelidia, Iirmos now stands empty—a wound in the jungle where the canopy refuses to close. The city's bone-white spires still rise above the treeline, visible for miles, but no Zelle has set foot there in centuries.

The High Priestesses do not speak of what happened. The jungle remembers.

What is known: the priestesses of Iirmos attempted a great blood-working, a ritual to permanently ward Zelidia from all outsiders. They sacrificed not individuals but entire villages of captives, channeling more blood than had ever been offered. Something answered—but it was not the jungle-spirits they knew.

The ritual tore open a passage to somewhere else. What came through consumed Iirmos in a single night. The survivors fled to what is now Glezamos, and the High Priestesses sealed the city behind wards of a different kind: wards meant not to keep things out, but to keep something in.

The jungle has grown strange around Iirmos. Trees bend away from the ruins. Animals fall silent within a mile of its walls. Those who approach report hearing voices—not screaming, but welcoming. Inviting them inside. Promising they'll never need to leave.

#### Zelidia

The state of Zelidia encompasses all Zelle settlements along the Sovia River. See the full state entry for details on its theocratic government and blood-sacrifice religion.

##### Glezamos

The current capital of Zelidia sprawls across both banks of the Sovia, connected by bridges woven from living vines. Glezamos was built hastily after the fall of Iirmos, and its architecture still carries that desperate, improvised quality—structures that grew organically around the needs of refugees rather than following any grand design.

The Temple of the Hungry Canopy dominates the city's center, where the High Priestesses conduct their sacrifices and commune with the jungle-spirits. Foreign delegations (the rare few permitted to live) are received in the Bleeding Court, an open plaza where the stones are permanently stained rust-red.

##### Nox

The easternmost Zelidian village, closest to the coast and to outsiders. Nox serves as the reluctant interface between Zelidia and the outside world—a shadow-market where non-pixies can trade under heavy restriction. Transactions occur at night (hence the name), conducted through intermediaries, with the actual Zelle traders remaining unseen in the darkness above. Weapons are forbidden. Lights are forbidden. Those who break the rules simply vanish.

##### Katat

An agricultural village upriver from Glezamos, where the Zelle cultivate the jungle's bounty: fruits that induce prophetic dreams, fungi that enhance blood-magic, flowers whose nectar is essential for pixie reproduction. Katat's fields are tended by thralls—outsiders who wandered too close and now serve without will or memory.

##### Sookap

A fishing village where the Sovia widens into lazy pools. Sookap's fishers harvest river-creatures for food and ritual use, including the sacred blood-eels whose consumption is required for High Priestess initiation. The village also maintains the ritual boats used to send offerings downstream.

##### Yift

The village closest to Glezamos, practically a suburb of the capital. Yift's artisans produce the material culture of Zelidian religion: ritual blades, wing-paints in sacred patterns, sacrificial implements, and the bone-chimes that hang throughout every Zelle settlement. Yift's workshops never fall silent.

### Phalkrene Mountains

The Phalkrene range runs north-south through the center of Urok's northwestern peninsula, separating Thrallwood to the west from Chitinwood to the east. The mountains are old and worn, their peaks rounded by millennia of tropical rain, but they remain formidable—dense with fog, treacherous with sudden drops, and home to things that prefer not to be found.

The range's most striking feature is visible from miles away: a colossal skull embedded in the mountainside, its eye sockets glowing faintly at night. This is Pyonokraus.

#### Pyonokraus

A city-state built into the skull of a dead titan. See the full state entry for details on its curse and inhabitants.

#### Vainye River

The Vainye descends from the Phalkrene heights, fed by mountain springs and perpetual mist-rain. Its waters run cold even in the tropical heat—cold enough that locals say the river remembers winter from somewhere else.

The Vainye flows past Pyonokraus before disappearing into the mountains' western slopes, eventually emerging to feed Thrallwood's swamps. Those who drink from it near the city report strange dreams: visions of a world with four suns, of beings with too many arms, of purposes that span centuries. Whether this is the titan's memory bleeding into the water or the Ayblek's alien influence remains unclear.

### Thrallwood

The western slopes of the Phalkrene Mountains drain into Thrallwood—a swamp-forest that stretches to Shamerei Bay. The trees here grow from standing water, their roots tangled into vast platforms of rotting vegetation. Mist rises perpetually from the warm, stagnant pools.

Something old claims Thrallwood. Not a god, not a spirit—something from the same age as the titan whose skull became Pyonokraus. Perhaps it served that titan once. Perhaps it was the titan's enemy. Whatever it was, it bound this place to its will, and that binding has outlasted the binder.

Every creature in Thrallwood serves. The beasts move in patterns too regular to be natural, patrolling routes they've walked for centuries. Birds call at precise intervals. Insects swarm in geometric formations. Even the plants seem to reach toward intruders with coordinated purpose.

The compulsion is contagious. Those who linger in Thrallwood begin to feel the pull—an urge to walk a certain path, to guard a certain tree, to wait for instructions that never come. The longer one stays, the harder it becomes to leave. After a few days, the victim stops wanting to. After a week, they forget they ever wanted anything else.

Thralls wander the forest still: humans, gnomes, beasts, all moving in silent service to a master that may be dead, sleeping, or simply elsewhere. They do not speak. They do not acknowledge outsiders. But they will stop anyone from reaching whatever lies at Thrallwood's heart.

### Chitinwood

East of the Phalkrene Mountains, the forest floor crunches underfoot. Chitinwood takes its name from what covers everything: the shed exoskeletons, the gnawed remains, the living shells of countless giant beetles.

This is not a civilization. There is no hive-mind, no beetle-society, no alien intelligence to negotiate with. Chitinwood is simply an ecosystem—one where beetles the size of horses are the dominant life form. Rhinoceros beetles that can gore through trees. Stag beetles whose mandibles shear through bone. Bombardier beetles that spray caustic chemicals. And countless smaller varieties that swarm, burrow, devour.

The beetles aren't aggressive by nature; they're simply beetles, doing what beetles do. But everything in Chitinwood has adapted to them. Predators have evolved chitin-cracking jaws. Prey have developed shells of their own. The trees grow thick, corky bark. Even the birds have beak-plates that can pry larvae from wood.

Travelers can pass through Chitinwood, but they must move carefully. Disturbing a beetle's territory, stumbling into a mating display, or simply smelling like food can trigger swarming behavior. The forest floor is littered with the picked-clean skeletons of those who made mistakes.

Chitin itself is valuable—beetle-plate armor, tool components, alchemical ingredients. Hunters from Pyonokraus occasionally venture into the edges of the forest to harvest, but they never go deep. Something larger lives in Chitinwood's interior. No one has seen it clearly. They've only found the shells it leaves behind—each one the size of a building.

### Shamerei Bay

The western coast of the peninsula curves inward to form Shamerei Bay, where Thrallwood meets the sea. The bay takes its name from Shamerei the Defiant—a merchant captain who, according to legend, refused to pay tribute to Zelidia and attempted to establish a trading post on these shores.

The Zelle made an example of her. They did not kill her quickly. They did not kill her crew at all—instead, they released them to spread word of what happens to those who defy the pixie kingdom. The captain's bones were woven into a warning-marker that still stands at the bay's entrance, preserved by blood-magic against rot and time.

No ships anchor in Shamerei Bay now. The waters are safe enough—calm, deep, well-sheltered from storms. But the warning remains, and sailors give the bay a wide berth. Only smugglers and the truly desperate make landfall here, hoping to slip into Thrallwood and reach... something. Whatever they're looking for, they rarely find it.

### Anemone Sound

South of Chitinwood, the coast opens into Anemone Sound—named for the vast colonies of sea anemones that carpet its shallow floor. These are not ordinary anemones. The largest specimens stretch twenty feet across, their stinging tentacles capable of paralyzing a whale.

The anemones have made the sound nearly impassable. Ships that enter find their hulls gripped by tentacles, their crews snatched from the decks. The water itself seems to reach upward. Only shallow-draft vessels piloted by those who know the safe channels can navigate through, and that knowledge is jealously guarded.

Something feeds the anemones—something that wants the sound protected. The waters beyond the colonies are strangely clear, almost crystalline, and divers who've made it through report structures on the seafloor: walls, columns, what might be roads. No one has explored them. No one has returned from trying.

### Deadwater Bay

At the peninsula's southern tip, Deadwater Bay earns its name. Nothing lives here. The water is clear—too clear, sterile as glass. No fish swim in it. No seaweed clings to its rocks. No barnacles grow on the few wrecks that have drifted in. Even bacteria seem absent; corpses that wash into the bay do not rot. They simply... remain.

The effect extends several hundred yards from shore. Sailors who must pass through report an oppressive silence, a sense of being watched, and a wrongness they can't articulate. Some claim the water itself feels different—heavier, more reluctant to move.

No one knows what killed Deadwater Bay, or what keeps it dead. The Zelle avoid it. Pyonokraus ignores it. Even Thrallwood's compulsion seems to have no interest in this stretch of coast. Whatever happened here was thorough, and whatever lingers here is patient.

### Hurtzsh River

The Hurtzsh flows southeast through Chitinwood, eventually emptying into Anemone Sound. Its waters run murky with beetle-waste and decaying chitin, giving it a brackish, faintly metallic taste. The river serves as a natural highway through the beetle-forest—most creatures avoid the water, making it safer than the forest floor.

Rafts can navigate the Hurtzsh, though the journey is unpleasant. The smell is memorable. The sound of beetles clattering on the banks is constant. And occasionally, something large surfaces to investigate the disturbance before submerging again.

### Andestro River

The Andestro winds through the southern reaches of the peninsula, fed by streams from the Phalkrene Mountains' lower slopes. Warmer and slower than the Vainye, it meanders through marshland before reaching the coast near Deadwater Bay.

The river is navigable but eerie. As it approaches Deadwater Bay, the wildlife along its banks grows sparse, then absent. Fish become scarce. Birds stop calling. The last few miles flow in absolute silence, the Andestro's waters growing clearer and more lifeless as they near their destination. Locals call this stretch the "Dying Mile," and avoid it.

### Pearly Mountains

A mountain range on Urok's southwestern tip.

#### Shenchen Forest

At the southwestern tip of the Pearly Mountains, north of the Tyberoskos forest, lies the Shenchen Forest—an eerie woodland inhabited by ancient samurai suits of enchanted armor. These dark knights stand eternal vigil over ruined shrines and temples, their armor animated by old magic. The forest grew up around and atop the ruins, but the guardians remain, still defending the sacred sites they were bound to protect centuries ago.

Approaching the ruins means facing these spectral sentinels, whose skill with blade and bow has not diminished with the passing years. They attack intruders without warning or mercy, their movements as precise and deadly as the day they were first enchanted.

### Xoth

A state on Urok.

### Tyberoskos

A forest on Urok near the Pearly Mountains, inhabited by weretigers who are deadly on the new moon but peaceful otherwise. The forest is also home to the Qipi—a very small race of gnomes who live in huge sinkholes where they've built small cities. A couple of these sinkhole settlements exist throughout the forest, hidden beneath the canopy.
