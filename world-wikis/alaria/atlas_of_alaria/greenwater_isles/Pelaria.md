## Pelaria

Tags: region, kendrel, greenwater-isles

The volcanic kingdom. Pelaria occupies the southern reaches of the eastern Agreben Sea, where underwater volcanic vents have created an environment that would kill ordinary Kendrel—and forged a people adapted to thrive in it.

### Geography

Pelaria stretches across the volcanic ridge marking the southern edge of the Agreben's continental shelf. The seafloor fractures into a maze of thermal vents, lava tubes, and superheated caverns.

**The Thermal Waters**: Water temperatures range from warm to scalding depending on proximity to active vents. Mineral-rich plumes color the currents in reds and oranges. Only Pelarian Kendrel—with their fire attunement and thermal adaptation—can survive here comfortably.

**The Vent Fortresses**: Settlements are built into volcanic formations that serve as natural defensive positions. The superheated waters create barriers that enemies cannot easily cross.

**The Southern Edge**: Where Pelarian territory meets the open Agreben and the Bfaspeen-infested waters beyond. Heavily fortified, perpetually contested.

### Major Settlements

- **Saphinia** (capital): Built into an ancient volcanic cone, from warm shallows to near-boiling depths. Population ~12,000.
- **Brilina**: Northern border village, relatively cool, transition zone for visitors.
- **Osirey**: Western settlement, most productive mineral vents.
- **Purine**: Eastern village, deepest and hottest vents, Cendoriln-dominated.
- **Levirus**: Central town, Steam Shaper training center.
- **Naurey**: Southern outpost facing the open Agreben.
- **Coralona**: Southernmost settlement, early warning station.

### Character

Pelaria has diverged significantly from traditional Kendrel culture. The fire-attuned population practices metalwork, maintains a standing military (the Ember Guard), and conducts active operations against Bfaspeen broods. The northern kingdoms find this deeply unsettling. Pelarians find the northern kingdoms naive.
