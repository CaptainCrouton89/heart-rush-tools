## Flurin

Tags: region, kendrel, greenwater-isles

The northernmost of the three Kendrel Kingdoms, occupying a chain of barrier islands and submerged reef-cities along the eastern edge of the Agreben Sea. Where its sister kingdoms turn inward, Flurin faces outward—toward Atriik, toward trade, toward the surface world.

### Geography

Flurin stretches roughly 120 miles north to south, a scattered constellation of coral atolls, volcanic islets, and deeper reef-fortresses. The continental shelf here is relatively shallow, allowing the cultivated reef architecture that defines Kendrel civilization. Surface settlements serve as interface points for air-breathing traders; the true cities sprawl beneath the waves in lattices of coral and bioluminescent gardens.

**Northern Waters**: Cool currents from North Agreben create comfortable temperatures for standard Kendrel. The border with Mueras's Darkened Coast brings occasional strange phenomena—darker-than-normal waters and unusual creatures drifting south.

**Eastern Edge**: Just thirty miles from Atriik's coast, making Flurin the natural gateway between Kendrel civilization and surface trade.

**Southern Border**: The Passage Gardens mark the transition to Glador—coral sculptures maintained by both kingdoms as a symbol of unity.

### Major Settlements

- **Azulora** (capital): Spiral of coral towers rising from a submerged volcanic cone. Population ~8,000.
- **Watalina**: Surface-accessible trade port, primary interface with Atriik.
- **Ashenia**: Northern fishing village near the Darkened Coast.
- **Voltunis**: Southern border town at the Passage Gardens.

### Character

More cosmopolitan than Glador, more commercially-minded than Pelaria. Flurin has developed extensive infrastructure for air-breathers and maintains the closest relationships with surface nations. The Pelaendor subrace dominates, their practical pragmatism suited to constant dealings with outsiders.
