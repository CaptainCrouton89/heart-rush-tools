## Glador

Tags: region, kendrel, greenwater-isles

The heart of the Kendrel Kingdoms—oldest, largest, and most stubbornly traditional. Glador occupies the central archipelago of the eastern Agreben Sea, a maze of reef-fortresses and coral palaces where the ancient customs of Kendrel society are preserved in amber-like perfection.

### Geography

Glador sprawls across roughly 200 miles of the Agreben's eastern waters, from the Flurin border in the north to Pelaria's volcanic reaches in the south. The continental shelf here is broad and shallow, perfect for cultivated reef architecture.

**The Reef Cities**: Underwater forests of giant kelp alternate with open plains of cultivated coral. The reef-cities are vertical complexes, with different depth-layers serving different social functions.

**The Trenches**: Deep channels cut through the shelf, providing natural defenses against Bfaspeen incursions. These have been cultivated over millennia to channel attacks into defensive kill zones.

**The Surface Islands**: Scattered volcanic islets provide the minimal surface presence Glador maintains—mostly for receiving foreign visitors who cannot survive underwater.

### Major Settlements

- **Delphran** (capital): The Abyssal Throne's seat, largest Kendrel city anywhere. Vertical complex descending through five depth-layers. Population ~25,000.
- **Aquicada**: Northern gateway, handling traffic with Flurin.
- **Telune**: Northern village with the famous Oracle Pools.
- **Liculvia**: Eastern settlement, quietly handles surface trade.
- **Thautias**: Central town, famous for memory coral artisans.
- **Caecadis**: Southern border town where disputes with Pelaria are resolved.
- **Neptusia**: Deep-water Cendoriln village.

### Character

Insular, refined, and utterly convinced of its own superiority. Glador is Court Kendrel territory—the iridescent-scaled aristocrats who elevated social manipulation to art form. Violence remains the ultimate obscenity; all conflicts are resolved through social pressure, reputation warfare, and (when necessary) quiet Cendoriln intervention.
