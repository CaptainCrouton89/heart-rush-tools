# Greenwater Isles

## Geography

The Greenwater Isles are a tropical archipelago lying between Upoceax to the west and south, and Rimihuica to the north and east. The region is dominated by the great island of **Urok** at its center, surrounded by a ring of seas, straits, and smaller island states. Bright teal waters, coral reefs, and lush green vegetation characterize this perpetually warm region.
