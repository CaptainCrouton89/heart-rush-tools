## Nekanzi Jungle

Tags: jungle, urok, neka, fire-leyline

The Nekanzi Jungle covers the northeastern peninsula of Urok—a dense, humid rainforest split down its center by the Firespine, a raw wound in the earth where the Yolus fire leyline breaches the surface. This is Neka territory, home to the dark-skinned, fire-attuned gnomes who have claimed these lands since before human ships first reached the Greenwater Isles.

The jungle itself is typical of Urok's tropical interior: canopy so thick that the forest floor lives in perpetual green twilight, air heavy enough to drink, and wildlife that treats anything smaller than itself as food. What makes Nekanzi distinct is the heat. Not the humid warmth common to all Urok jungles, but a dry, mineral heat that radiates from the ground itself near the Firespine. Plants here have adapted to periodic burning—fire-blooms that only seed after their parent plant ignites, ash-trees with bark like charcoal that regenerates from within, fungi that fruit in the wake of flames.

The Neka have adapted too. Five villages dot the jungle, loosely confederated by kinship and shared tradition. Two sit directly on the Firespine; three do not. This geographic divide shapes everything about Neka society.

### The Firespine

A jagged fissure tears through the Nekanzi Jungle from north to south, following the path of the Yolus fire leyline where it runs close to the surface. The Neka call it the Firespine because it resembles exactly that—the exposed vertebrae of something colossal and long-dead, glowing with residual heat.

The fissure varies in width from a few feet to gaps wide enough to swallow a house. Smoke seeps from the narrower sections. The wider gaps exhale gouts of flame at irregular intervals, and the rock along the edges glows dull red even in daylight. The temperature near the Firespine runs twenty degrees hotter than the surrounding jungle, and the air tastes of sulfur and hot stone.

Fire spirits emerge here. Not constantly, but frequently enough that the Neka have developed an entire tradition around managing them. Most are minor elementals—flickering humanoid shapes, serpents of living flame, floating motes of malicious heat. Occasionally something larger pulls itself from the fissure. The Neka don't discuss those incidents with outsiders.

The leyline's power makes fire magic significantly more potent within a mile of the Firespine. Neka fire-speakers can accomplish workings here that would exhaust them elsewhere. Foreign pyromancers who've visited (the few who were permitted) describe it as intoxicating—and dangerous. The power comes easily, but it doesn't want to stop.

#### The Buried Serpent

Neka oral tradition holds that the Firespine is literally what it appears to be: the spine of a titanic fire-serpent struck down in the first age of the world. They call it Yolu-Kazyn, the Burning One Who Fell. Whether this is mythology, corrupted history of an actual entity, or simply a convenient explanation for the leyline's existence, the Neka treat it as foundational truth.

According to the stories, Yolu-Kazyn was neither good nor evil—it simply was, as fire simply is. It burned across the world until something (the stories vary: a rival titan, a coalition of gods, its own hubris) brought it low. It fell into the sea and the land rose around it, but it never truly died. Its spine still glows. Its blood still burns. And its children—the fire spirits—still emerge from the wound, confused and hungry, looking for their parent.

The Neka see themselves as inheritors of this legacy. They didn't slay Yolu-Kazyn; they weren't even born yet. But they've made peace with its remains, learned to speak to its children, and earned the right to carry fire in their blood.

### Neka Society

The Neka are a confederacy, not a nation. No single chief or council rules all five villages. Instead, decisions affecting the whole jungle require consensus between representatives—traditionally, at least one from a leyline village and one from a shadow village.

This distinction matters. The two villages built on the Firespine (Hyhi and Sygozoki) are called "hot" villages—their residents live closer to the fire spirits, tend toward spiritual vocations, and claim deeper attunement to flame. The three villages away from the leyline (Tyunigogo, Kanamazi, and Yanayazi) are called "cool" villages—their residents are hunters, traders, and the practical backbone of Neka survival.

Neither type is superior. The Neka philosophy of balance—what they call *Zyka-Mend*, roughly "the feeding of two fires"—holds that hot and cool must coexist. A jungle of only flame would be ash. A jungle without flame would choke on its own growth. The tension between the village types is considered healthy, even necessary.

#### Leadership and Law

Each village governs itself through a council of elders, with one elder typically recognized as "first voice" for external matters. These positions aren't hereditary—they're earned through demonstrated wisdom, usually over decades. Young Neka who show promise are informally apprenticed to current elders, but there's no guarantee of succession.

Inter-village disputes go to *Moot*—a gathering of representatives at a neutral location (traditionally a clearing called the Ash Circle, roughly equidistant from all five villages). Moots are rare, called only for matters that affect multiple villages: territorial disputes, responses to outside threats, marriages that would shift village populations significantly.

Neka law is oral, memorized by specialists called *tongue-keepers* who can recite precedents going back generations. The law emphasizes restoration over punishment—a wrong must be made right, and the wrongdoer must do the making. Exile is the ultimate sanction, reserved for those who cannot or will not restore balance. Exiles are not killed; they're simply no longer Neka. The jungle usually handles the rest.

#### Fire-Speakers

The Neka's racial fire attunement manifests in everyone to some degree—resistance to heat, comfort near flame, an intuitive sense of fire's moods. But some develop the gift further. These are the fire-speakers: those who can communicate with fire spirits, negotiate safe passage through the Firespine's emanations, and channel the leyline's power for greater workings.

Fire-speakers aren't priests, though outsiders often mistake them for such. They don't worship fire spirits—they bargain with them. Every interaction is a negotiation. Spirits want fuel, attention, freedom to burn. Fire-speakers offer controlled outlets: ritual fires, burnt offerings, designated burn-zones in the jungle. In exchange, the spirits refrain from random destruction and sometimes provide services: lighting forges, clearing land, or defending against threats.

The relationship is tense. Fire spirits aren't malicious, but they aren't benevolent either. They're fire. They want to burn. A fire-speaker's job is to give them enough burning to keep them satisfied without losing the jungle entirely. When negotiations fail—and they do, every few generations—villages burn. The Neka accept this as the cost of living where they do.

#### Outsiders and Trade

The Neka are territorial but not isolationist. They trade with the outside world, but on their terms. Tyunigogo serves as the designated point of contact—foreigners are not permitted to travel freely through Neka lands, but they can wait at Tyunigogo's cooling zone for Neka traders to come to them.

What the Neka offer: rare jungle materials (fire-resistant woods, medicinal plants that grow only near the leyline, the shells of fire-adapted insects), Sygozoki's flame-touched metalwork, and guide services through the jungle for those with legitimate business on the other side.

What the Neka want: metal (they have little ore), salt, textiles, and news. Despite their isolation, the Neka are curious about the outside world. Traders who bring interesting stories often get better prices than those who bring only goods.

What the Neka won't trade: fire-speaker services, access to the Firespine, anything that would give outsiders power over the leyline. Attempts to acquire these have ended badly for the would-be acquirers.

### The Five Villages

#### Tyunigogo

*"Where the Fire Meets the Sea"*

The northeastern-most Neka settlement, Tyunigogo occupies a strip of coastline where the jungle thins enough to see the sky. It's the only village with direct access to the Shriyen Passage, the strait separating Urok from Rimihuica's Ishnit Jungles, and this geography has shaped its character entirely.

Tyunigogo is the gateway. All legitimate trade with the outside world passes through here. Foreign ships anchor in the small natural harbor, their crews confined to the "cooling zone"—a cleared area at the beach's edge where the jungle's heat gives way to sea breeze. Neka traders come down to meet them, transactions are conducted, and the foreigners leave. Those who try to proceed further without escort are turned back. Those who try repeatedly disappear.

The village itself sits a quarter-mile inland, invisible from the shore. Its structures are typical Neka construction: platforms built into the canopy, connected by rope bridges, with fire-pits at strategic locations that serve as both light sources and spiritual anchors. The coastal Neka of Tyunigogo are considered the most worldly of their people—they've learned fragments of foreign languages, understand outside currencies, and have developed a merchant's instinct for value.

But they haven't softened. Tyunigogo's elders remember why the cooling zone exists: a foreign expedition three centuries ago that tried to claim the harbor for a trading post. The expedition's fate became a teaching story. The Neka don't discuss details with outsiders, but the cooling zone's boundary stones are made from ship timbers.

**Hooks:**
- Foreign traders seeking rare goods must negotiate Tyunigogo's protocols
- Smugglers try to bypass the village through Swindle Sound—with mixed results
- Occasionally, something from across the Shriyen Passage washes up on shore

#### Hyhi

*Named for the hiss of steam*

Hyhi sits on the Firespine at the point where steam vents mix with a natural spring, creating a perpetual curtain of hot mist that shrouds the village. It's the spiritual heart of the Neka—home to the largest concentration of fire-speakers and the site of the most important negotiations with fire spirits.

The village is built around a gap in the Firespine where the fissure widens into something like a bowl. Steam rises from pools of water heated by the leyline below. Fire spirits emerge here more frequently than elsewhere, but they emerge... calmer. The Neka believe this is because Yolu-Kazyn's heart lies beneath Hyhi, and the spirits that emerge are closest to their parent's original nature before it was wounded.

Whether this is true or not, Hyhi's fire-speakers have the highest success rate in negotiations. Spirits bound here tend to honor their bargains longer. The village has become the default location for difficult bindings—when another village needs a particularly powerful or stubborn spirit contained, they bring it to Hyhi.

Life in Hyhi is strange by outside standards. The mist makes visibility perpetually poor. Residents navigate by sound and heat-sense as much as sight. Conversations happen in low voices because the steam carries sound unpredictably. Fire-speakers spend hours in meditation at the bowl's edge, communing with whatever responds. The village feels dreamlike, liminal, not entirely present in the material world.

Non-fire-speakers live here too—someone has to hunt, cook, maintain structures—but they tend to be quieter, more contemplative than Neka elsewhere. Long exposure to the mist changes people. Not physically, but in disposition. Hyhi natives move slowly, speak carefully, and seem to listen to things others can't hear.

**Hooks:**
- Fire-speakers from Hyhi are occasionally willing to negotiate with outsiders' fire-related problems—for appropriate compensation
- The bowl is rumored to grant visions to those who meditate there, but the visions aren't always survivable
- Something has been emerging from the steam lately that isn't quite a fire spirit

#### Kanamazi

*"Those Who Walk Without Light"*

Northwestern Kanamazi is the furthest village from the Firespine's influence, nestled in deep jungle where the canopy blocks even the leyline's glow. This is hunter territory—the Neka here are beast-masters, trackers, and the closest thing the confederacy has to a military force.

Kanamazi's hunters know the deep jungle better than anyone. They track prey through absolute darkness using sound, smell, and the animal-mimicry that all Neka possess but Kanamazi residents have elevated to art. A Kanamazi hunting party can coordinate across miles of jungle using calls indistinguishable from natural wildlife—and their prey never realizes they're being herded until it's too late.

The village takes its name from its residents' comfort with darkness. While other Neka maintain fire-pits throughout their settlements, Kanamazi keeps theirs minimal. Residents move through their village at night without light, navigating by memory and subtle cues. They claim this keeps them sharp, prevents dependence on the Firespine's gifts, and reminds them that survival doesn't require flame—only skill.

This philosophy creates occasional tension with the hot villages. Kanamazi elders have been known to suggest that Hyhi and Sygozoki have grown soft, too reliant on spirit-bargains to solve problems that could be handled with a spear. The hot villages counter that Kanamazi has forgotten what makes the Neka special, that they might as well be any other jungle tribe. The arguments are old, familiar, and generally resolved by the next Moot—but the underlying tension persists.

Kanamazi also handles the confederacy's security. When something dangerous enters Neka territory—foreign expeditions, escaped beasts from elsewhere on Urok, creatures displaced by the leyline's fluctuations—Kanamazi hunters deal with it. They're not warriors in the organized military sense, but they're extremely good at making problems disappear into the jungle.

**Hooks:**
- Kanamazi hunters occasionally hire out as guides, but only for purposes they approve of
- The deep jungle beyond Kanamazi holds things even the hunters avoid
- A recent hunt went wrong—the hunting party hasn't returned, and the elders are considering asking for outside help

#### Yanayazi

*"Water-That-Remembers-Fire"*

Southwestern Yanayazi sits where the Scheleur River runs closest to the Firespine before turning west toward the sea. The river runs warm here—not hot enough to harm, but noticeably above the temperature of normal water. The Neka of Yanayazi have built their lives around this peculiarity.

Yanayazi is the fishing village, though "fishing" understates what they do. The Scheleur's warmth supports species found nowhere else—heat-adapted fish, crustaceans that cluster around thermal vents, amphibians that bask in the warm shallows. Yanayazi fishers have developed specialized techniques for harvesting these creatures, some of which are valuable to outside alchemists and gourmands.

The village is also the confederacy's connection to the western interior. The Scheleur is navigable by small craft, and Yanayazi traders pole their way upriver to deal with other Urok peoples—carefully, given the jungle's dangers, but profitably enough to justify the risk. They're the most mercantile of the Neka, with a practical streak that sometimes frustrates the more traditional villages.

Yanayazi's relationship with the Firespine is complicated. They're close enough to feel its influence but not close enough to produce many fire-speakers. Instead, they've developed their own spiritual tradition around the warm river. They believe the Scheleur carries Yolu-Kazyn's blessing outward—that the heat in the water is the serpent's gift to lands too far from the spine to receive fire directly. River-prayers before fishing expeditions are common, and Yanayazi mourning rituals involve releasing the deceased's ashes into the current to be carried toward the sea.

**Hooks:**
- Yanayazi traders can arrange passage upriver for those with legitimate business—and sufficient payment
- The warm-water species occasionally include things that shouldn't exist
- Something upstream has been fouling the water, and the village wants to know what

#### Sygozoki

*"Burning Without End"*

Southern Sygozoki is the forge-village, built directly on the Firespine at a point where the fissure's heat is most consistent and controllable. This is where the Neka make things—tools, weapons, art—using techniques that blend conventional smithing with fire-spirit negotiation.

Sygozoki's forges don't use bellows. They don't need to. Fire-speakers maintain ongoing agreements with spirits bound to each forge, ensuring steady, controllable heat that mundane fuel couldn't match. The smiths—called *char-hands* for the permanent discoloration their work leaves—shape metal in temperatures that would kill an unprotected worker, relying on their racial fire resistance and additional spirit-bargains for protection.

The results are distinctive. Sygozoki metalwork has a rippled, flame-pattern finish that can't be replicated elsewhere, and the metal itself holds heat longer than it should. Weapons made here don't burn their wielders, but they burn everything else—a Sygozoki blade drawn across flesh leaves cauterized wounds. The most valued pieces have spirits bound into them permanently, granting minor magical properties that vary by the smith and the spirits involved.

This is also the most dangerous village for outsiders. The spirits here are more active, more present, more *hungry* than those at Hyhi. Sygozoki's fire-speakers maintain control through constant negotiation and regular offerings, but the balance is precarious. Visitors who don't understand the protocols—who carry too much flammable material, who speak disrespectfully of fire, who simply look like they might be good fuel—tend to attract attention. The villagers will try to intervene. They don't always succeed.

Sygozoki has burned twice in living memory. Both times, the village was rebuilt within a year, slightly differently, slightly more attuned to the spirits' preferences. The Neka here accept this as part of their arrangement. They get to work with fire in ways no one else can. Sometimes fire works with them back, in ways they didn't intend. The forge-gift and the forge-price are the same thing.

**Hooks:**
- Sygozoki weapons are valuable trade goods, but acquiring one requires negotiating with the char-hands directly
- A smith has bound something into a blade that they shouldn't have, and now the blade is missing
- The spirits have been restless lately—demanding more offerings, honoring bargains less reliably

### Scheleur River

The Scheleur rises somewhere in the jungle's interior—the Neka claim to know its source but don't share that information—and flows southwest before curving west to empty into the sea south of Urok's main landmass. For most of its length it's a typical jungle river: brown water, overhanging vegetation, things with teeth lurking beneath the surface.

But where it passes within a few miles of the Firespine, the Scheleur changes character. The water warms. The color shifts from brown to a faintly reddish tinge (mineral content from the heated groundwater, probably, though the Neka have other explanations). The species living in this stretch are found nowhere else—adapted to temperatures that would kill their relatives downstream.

Yanayazi claims stewardship of the warm stretch, but the river is technically accessible to all Neka. Fishing rights are governed by informal traditions rather than strict law, which occasionally causes friction when a Kanamazi hunting party takes fish that Yanayazi considers theirs. These disputes rarely escalate beyond angry words—the confederacy has larger concerns—but they're a persistent minor irritation.

The river is navigable by small craft from Yanayazi to the coast. Larger vessels can't handle the shifting channels and submerged debris. Foreign cartographers named it the Scheleur; the Neka simply call it *Yolu-Mazi*, "fire's vein."

### Swindle Sound

Southeast of the Nekanzi Jungle, where the coastline curves inward, lies the body of water that foreign sailors call Swindle Sound. The name comes from bitter experience: treacherous currents, hidden reefs, and sandbars that seem to shift between voyages have wrecked dozens of ships over the centuries. Captains who thought they'd found a shortcut around Tyunigogo's tolls discovered instead why the Neka don't bother patrolling these waters.

The Neka call it *Zend-Kulam*, roughly "the patient water"—patient because it waits for ships to make mistakes, then collects them. They don't fish here; the currents make small craft as vulnerable as large ones. Occasionally valuable salvage washes up on the jungle's southeastern beaches, but more often it's just wreckage and bodies.

Smugglers still try. Some even succeed—there are channels through the sound that skilled pilots can navigate, though the knowledge is closely held and expensive. The Neka are aware of this traffic and largely ignore it. Anything that makes it through Swindle Sound and into the jungle still has to deal with the jungle, and the Neka would rather let the sound do the filtering than waste hunters on patrol duty.

**Hooks:**
- A ship carrying something valuable went down in the sound—someone might pay well for its recovery
- A smuggler claims to know a safe route through and is selling passage
- Something in the sound has started actively hunting ships rather than just waiting for wrecks
