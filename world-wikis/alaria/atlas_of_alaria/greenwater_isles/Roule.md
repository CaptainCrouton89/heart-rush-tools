## Roule

Tags: island, state, nation, geography

A broad peninsula and island chain in the southern Greenwater Isles, Roule is the heartland of halfling colonial power. Rolling golden plains give way to prosperous farmland, bustling port cities, and—at the center of it all—a dark forest the halflings have never managed to tame. The air smells of honey and salt. Red-roofed towns dot the countryside connected by well-maintained roads, and halfling merchants speak of Roule as civilization's triumph over wilderness. They don't speak of who lived here before.

The halflings arrived three centuries ago. Within two generations, a plague had swept through the indigenous human population, killing nine in ten. The survivors fled into the interior forest. The halflings called it providence and built their empire on the emptied land. Today, Roule is wealthy, orderly, and profoundly unwilling to discuss its founding.

### Arins Plains

The agricultural heart of Roule stretches across the northern and central regions—endless fields of grain, orchards, and most importantly, the flower farms that drive Roulean wealth. Taberthine blossoms (pale blue, faintly luminescent at dusk) produce honey that sharpens the mind, prized by scholars and merchants across Alaria. Zindwatt flowers (deep crimson, almost black at the center) yield a honey that induces gentle euphoria, technically regulated but freely available to those with coin.

The plains are beautiful in a manicured way. Windmills turn constantly—Roule is never without wind—and the halfling estates sprawl white and comfortable amid their holdings. The laborers in the fields are a mix of halfling smallholders, contracted workers, and slaves. Slavery in Roule is "modest," they'll tell you. A small household staff. Domestic service. The Honey Lords don't discuss the field crews.

The wind shapes everything here. Buildings are low and sturdy. Trees grow bent. Halflings greet each other with "fair winds," and the worst curse you can level is to wish someone "still air."

### Murderwood

At the center of Roule squats a forest the halflings pretend doesn't exist. On maps, it's simply unlabeled green. In conversation, they call it the Murderwood, the Dreadwood, or simply "the interior." Official Roulean policy holds that it's undeveloped wilderness with dangerous fauna. Everyone knows this is a lie.

The forest is dense, old-growth, and wrong. Trees grow too close together. The canopy blocks all but the dimmest light. Sounds carry strangely—or don't carry at all. Halfling logging expeditions entered the Murderwood for decades after colonization. They stopped when the expeditions stopped coming back.

The truth, known to historians and denied by the Honey Lords, is that survivors of the plague fled here. What they became in three centuries of isolation, hatred, and desperation is unclear. Some say they're simply humans who know the forest intimately and kill halflings on sight. Others whisper of pacts with old things in the deep woods, of people who aren't quite people anymore. The Roulean military has attempted "pacification campaigns" four times. The forest has never been pacified.

The halflings have learned to leave it alone. A rough border of abandoned farms and warning signs marks where civilization ends. Travelers are advised to take the long way around. Those who enter uninvited rarely return, and those who do won't speak of what they saw.

#### Kyullyuk

In the heart of the Murderwood, the survivors built a town. Kyullyuk appears on no Roulean map, but sailors sometimes trade with hooded figures at hidden coves, and those figures speak of a settlement deep in the forest where the old ways continue.

The people of Kyullyuk are the descendants of those who fled the plague. They call themselves the Velani—"the remaining"—and they have not forgotten what the halflings did. Three centuries have transformed them. They know the forest as intimately as their own bodies. They've made accommodations with whatever else lives in the Murderwood. And they wait.

Kyullyuk itself is said to be built in the trees and beneath them, a vertical town of rope bridges and root-cellars that can vanish at a moment's notice. The Velani trade with outsiders only rarely, and only for iron and salt. They kill halflings without exception. Whether they could ever emerge from the forest in force—whether they'd want to—is a question that haunts Roulean military planners who are too honest to accept the official story.

### Hakö Lake

A clear, cold lake in the northeastern interior, Hakö is Roule's largest freshwater body and the source of the Hanli River. Fishing villages dot its shores, and wealthy halflings maintain summer estates on the southern bank where the views are best. The lake is deep—deeper than anyone has successfully measured—and local folklore holds that something lives at the bottom.

The previous inhabitants considered Hakö sacred. Roulean developers have found carved stones on the lakebed during construction projects, which are quietly disposed of. A ruined temple complex on the eastern shore has been converted into a fashionable resort, its original purpose carefully unmentioned.

### Ezcelmez Lake

Smaller and shallower than Hakö, Ezcelmez Lake sits near Ovabasi in the agricultural heartland. Its waters are warm and silty, fed by dozens of small streams running off the surrounding flower fields. The honey produced from Ezcelmez-area flowers is considered the finest in Roule—something in the water, they say.

The lake is heavily worked. Barges carry flower harvests to processing facilities on the shore. Fish farms crowd the shallows. Nothing sacred remains here; Ezcelmez is purely commercial, and the halflings prefer it that way.

### Hanli River

The Hanli flows from Hakö Lake southwest through the Arins Plains before emptying into the Inside Passage near Karamehmetler. It's the main commercial artery of interior Roule—flat-bottomed barges carry grain, honey, and goods between the lake towns and the coast.

The river is slow, wide, and reliable. Floods are rare. Halfling engineers have straightened its course in several places, and locks allow navigation around the few elevation changes. Towns along the Hanli are prosperous and dull, the kind of places where nothing interesting ever happens and the residents prefer it that way.

### Bay of Roule

The great southern bay that gives Roule its naval power and commercial reach. Sheltered from the worst storms by the eastern peninsula, the Bay of Roule offers deep anchorage and calm waters. Teldib dominates the bay's northern shore, but fishing villages and minor ports scatter along the coastline.

The bay is heavily patrolled. Roulean naval vessels run regular circuits, and privateering is punished by imprisonment or worse. The message is clear: these waters belong to Roule, and Roule protects its interests.

#### Sunbeam Prison

Visible from anywhere on the bay—a shimmering pillar of light rising from the waves. The Sunbeam Prison floats where light and force leylines intersect in the Roule Channel, a marvel of magical engineering and a warning to anyone who might challenge Roulean authority.

The prison is not made of stone or iron, but of beams of solidified light bound together by force magic. These sunbeams create a perfect cage—impenetrable, unbreakable, and impossible to approach without authorization. The prison requires constant magical maintenance to sustain the leyline convergence, employing a permanent staff of mages who rotate monthly to avoid burnout.

Inmates include pirates, political prisoners, and those the Honey Lords want forgotten. Sentences are measured in decades. Escape is theoretically impossible—the light-walls burn flesh, and the waters below are patrolled by bound water elementals. The prison is Roule's most visible display of power and its most closely guarded secret. What happens inside is not discussed.

### Roule Channel

The waterway south of Roule proper, connecting the Bay of Roule to open ocean. The Channel is where light and force leylines intersect beneath the waves—the phenomenon that enables Sunbeam Prison and creates unusual magical conditions for any vessel passing through.

Ships report compasses spinning, minor enchantments flickering, and an oppressive sense of being watched. The Roulean navy has learned to navigate these effects, but foreign vessels sometimes struggle. Whether this is natural leyline interference or deliberate magical manipulation is unclear.

### Inside Passage

The sheltered waterway between Roule and the western islands, including Nylos. The Inside Passage offers calm sailing and protection from open-ocean storms, making it the preferred route for coastal traders and fishing fleets.

Roule controls the Passage absolutely. Naval checkpoints at both ends inspect vessels, collect tariffs, and turn away anyone deemed undesirable. Nylos fishing boats must obtain Roulean permits. Smugglers use hidden coves and night sailing, but the penalties for getting caught are severe.

### Fairn Passage

The northern sea lane connecting Roule to the broader Greenwater Isles and beyond. Fairn Passage sees heavier traffic than the Inside Passage—merchant vessels bound for Xoth, Urok, and distant ports.

The passage is named for Admiral Fairn, who established Roulean naval supremacy here two centuries ago by sinking a Xothian fleet. Relations with Xoth have never recovered. Today, Roulean and Xothian vessels maintain careful distance when passing, and naval "incidents" occur with enough regularity to keep both sides on edge.

### Fozyader

The capital of Roule sprawls along the northeastern coast where the Arins Plains meet the sea. White stone buildings with red tile roofs climb gentle hills, and the harbor is a forest of masts. This is where the Honey Lords meet, where colonial policy is made, and where Roule's wealth accumulates in counting houses and vaults.

The city is beautiful in the way wealthy places often are—clean streets, manicured parks, impressive public buildings. The Parliament of Flowers convenes in a domed hall at the city's heart, though real power rests with the merchant councils that meet in private clubs nearby. Halfling society here is elaborate and status-obsessed, with subtle gradations of rank indicated by hat styles, flower pins, and seating positions at public events.

Fozyader's darker business happens in the Harbor District and the warren of streets behind the main markets. Slave auctions occur in private courtyards. Captains can be hired for any cargo, no questions asked. The city watch is efficient but selective about what it sees.

Foreign visitors find Fozyader welcoming on the surface—good food, comfortable inns, polite conversation. But there's a coldness beneath the hospitality, a sense that outsiders are being assessed for usefulness. The halflings smile, and the smiles don't reach their eyes.

### Kabilcuz

The oldest port in Roule, Kabilcuz on the northwestern coast is where halfling colonists first made landfall three centuries ago. The original harbor has been rebuilt several times, but locals insist on showing visitors the "First Stone"—a weathered boulder supposedly touched by the first halfling to step ashore.

The city trades heavily on its history. Museums display colonial artifacts. Tour guides explain (with careful omissions) how the brave settlers tamed a wilderness. There's a performative quality to Kabilcuz's identity, as if the city is constantly trying to justify what happened here.

Beneath the historical theater, Kabilcuz is a working port. Shipyards line the harbor's edge. Fishing fleets depart before dawn. The city's craftspeople are known for fine woodworking, particularly furniture and musical instruments made from Murderwood timber—harvested, they insist, only from the forest's edge.

### Samandoken

The western port of Samandoken faces the Inside Passage and serves as Roule's administrative center for Nylos. Government officials, tax collectors, and military officers rotate through here before deployment to the subjugated islands. The city has a transient quality—people are always coming or going, and long-term residents are outnumbered by those passing through.

Samandoken is where Nylos resistance fighters are tried and sentenced. The courthouse is the city's largest building, deliberately imposing. Executions happen in the public square. The message to any Nylosi who might be watching is clear.

Despite its grim official function, Samandoken has a lively merchant quarter. Goods from Nylos—fish, pearls, worked coral—flow through here on their way to Roulean markets. The prices are set in Samandoken, and Nylosi sellers have no leverage to negotiate.

### Teldib

The great port on the Bay of Roule, Teldib is the commercial and naval heart of southern Roule. The harbor can accommodate hundreds of vessels; the naval yards employ thousands. This is where Roule's military power is built, maintained, and deployed.

The city divides into three distinct zones: the Naval Quarter (restricted, bristling with uniforms and checkpoints), the Merchant District (chaotic, profitable, smelling of fish and spices), and the Estates (quiet, wealthy, overlooking the bay). The Sunbeam Prison is visible from anywhere in Teldib, a constant reminder of what happens to those who cross Roulean authority.

Teldib's admiral is technically subordinate to the Parliament of Flowers, but in practice the naval command operates with considerable autonomy. The current admiral, a halfling woman named Tessara Brightwater, is said to have ambitions beyond the military.

### Recnaf

On the southern shore of the eastern peninsula, Recnaf is Roule's quietest city—a sheltered harbor town more focused on fishing than politics. The city lacks Fozyader's grandeur, Teldib's military importance, or Kabilcuz's historical pretensions. Locals consider this a virtue.

Recnaf's fishing fleet is the largest in Roule, and the city's markets supply much of the nation's seafood. The work is hard, the people are practical, and outsiders who put on airs are quietly mocked. There's a stubbornness here that the other cities lack—Recnaf was settled by colonists who wanted distance from halfling high society, and that independence persists.

The city maintains informal trade relationships with communities the Honey Lords would prefer not to acknowledge. Fishing boats sometimes return with cargo that didn't come from the sea. The city watch asks few questions. Recnaf takes care of its own.

### Tezina

The city closest to Murderwood, Tezina exists in the forest's shadow—sometimes literally, when the afternoon sun falls behind the treeline. The city is smaller than its coastal counterparts and markedly less prosperous. Young halflings from Tezina tend to leave for opportunities elsewhere. Those who remain have their reasons.

Tezina serves as the staging ground for any official business involving the forest—which is to say, almost none. The last "survey expedition" departed fifteen years ago and never returned. The city maintains a token garrison, but the soldiers spend their time drinking and avoiding the forest's edge.

What Tezina does have is information. Travelers, hunters, and those who've glimpsed the forest's secrets pass through here. The city's taverns are full of stories—most of them lies, but occasionally something true slips through. Anyone seriously interested in Murderwood starts their research in Tezina.

### Ovabasi

Near Ezcelmez Lake in the agricultural heartland, Ovabasi is the center of Roule's honey industry. The processing facilities here handle the majority of Taberthine and Zindwatt production, and the city smells permanently of sweetness and flowers.

The Honey Lords maintain their most impressive estates around Ovabasi, competing to display wealth through architecture, gardens, and elaborate social functions. This is where Roulean high society performs itself most intensely—balls, salons, and garden parties where the real business of the nation is conducted over honeyed wine.

The workers who actually produce the honey live in dormitories outside the city proper. Their conditions vary by employer, but none would be called comfortable. Ovabasi's beauty is built on labor that prefers to remain invisible.

### Kilik

The most forward outpost of Roule as it ventures into Rakite. Kilik is a new town, barely two decades old, carved out of grassland that the colonists insist was empty.

The town provost has heard troubling reports from farmers—discoveries of charcoal in the soil, stone foundations beneath the grass, the remains of old campfires. The official position is that these are natural formations or ancient ruins. But the farmers aren't stupid, and some have started asking uncomfortable questions about who lived here before.

Kilik represents everything complicated about Roulean expansion. The colonists are ordinary halflings seeking opportunity, not monsters. They genuinely believe they're building something good. And they're building it on land that belongs to someone else, refusing to see what's directly in front of them.
