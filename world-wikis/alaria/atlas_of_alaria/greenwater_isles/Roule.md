The most forward outpost of Roule as it ventures into Rakite. The town provost has heard stories from some farmers of the discovery of charcoal on the ground—a sure sign of other people already here.

### Roule Channel

A waterway south of Roule, where light and force leylines intersect beneath the waves.

#### Sunbeam Prison

At the intersection of light and force leylines in the Roule Channel stands one of the most unusual prisons in all of Alaria. The Sunbeam Prison is not made of stone or iron, but of beams of solidified light bound together by force magic. These sunbeams create a perfect cage—impenetrable, unbreakable, and visible from miles away as they shimmer above the water. The prison requires constant magical maintenance to sustain the leyline convergence, making it both a marvel of magical engineering and a constant drain on resources.
