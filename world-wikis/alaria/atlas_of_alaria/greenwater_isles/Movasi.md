## Movasi

Tags: island, state, nation, geography, pilgrimage, psychedelic

A large island in the southeastern Greenwater Isles, Movasi is covered almost entirely by the **Dream Jungle**—a bioluminescent forest where the boundary between waking perception and something deeper grows dangerously thin. The island is home to the **Velwey**, a reclusive society of dwarves who've built their civilization around the jungle's psychedelic properties and the sacred Pool of Names at their capital.

Pilgrims travel from across the known world to undergo the Velwey ritual: a guided psychedelic journey that can reveal one's **true name**—the magical identity that persists into the afterlife. For those who fear the permanent death that comes when spirits are forgotten in Celestia, Movasi offers something priceless: the chance to learn what name their followers must speak to keep them alive beyond death.

### Geography

Movasi lies between the **Gulf of Norag** to the northeast and the **Sea of Spiders** to the southeast. The island stretches roughly 200 miles across—large enough to lose yourself in, small enough that the jungle's influence reaches every corner.

**Telugai Bay** curves along the southern coast, offering the only reliable anchorage. The waters here run unusually calm; dissolved compounds from the island's runoff sedate the marine life and dull the currents. Ships approaching Movasi often report crews growing drowsy, dreaming vividly even while awake. Experienced captains warn passengers to stay topside until they've docked at Holik.

The coastline is ringed by a narrow band of conventional tropical vegetation—mangroves, palms, beaches of gray-white sand. This buffer zone lasts perhaps a mile before the Dream Jungle begins.

### The Dream Jungle

The jungle that covers Movasi's interior defies easy description. The canopy runs purple-green rather than the expected tropical emerald, shot through with bioluminescent veins that pulse faintly even in daylight. At night, the forest glows.

**The Pods**: Every tree hosts clusters of fist-sized pods that emit soft purple and green light. These pods contain the concentrated psychoactive compounds that make Movasi unique. Cracked open, the sap inside can be refined into the sacramental preparations the Velwey use in their rituals. Left intact, the pods simply breathe their contents into the air.

**Ambient Effects**: Walking through the Dream Jungle induces mild dissociation even without consuming anything. The air itself carries enough psychoactive pollen and spore-matter to alter perception. First-time visitors often describe feeling watched, sensing presences at the edge of vision, hearing voices that might be their own thoughts spoken aloud. Experienced travelers learn to distinguish hallucination from reality. Most of the time.

**The Deep Jungle**: Farther from the coast, the effects intensify. The pods grow larger, the glow brighter, the boundary between inner experience and outer reality harder to locate. The Velwey have mapped safe routes through this terrain, but unguided travel is strongly discouraged. People who wander into the deep jungle without preparation sometimes emerge changed. Sometimes they don't emerge at all.

### Settlements

#### Holik

The only port town, built on the southern coast where Telugai Bay offers shelter for ships. Holik exists as a buffer between the outside world and the Dream Jungle proper—a place for pilgrims to arrive, acclimate, and prepare before venturing inland.

The architecture here is deliberately mundane: stone foundations, timber frames, thatched or tiled roofs. Nothing glows. The Velwey built it this way intentionally, a concession to visitors who need solid ground before facing what comes next.

**The Quarantine Period**: New arrivals must spend at least three days in Holik before proceeding inland. This isn't bureaucratic delay—the jungle's ambient effects can overwhelm the unprepared, inducing psychotic breaks in those who encounter the full intensity without gradual exposure. Holik's lower concentration allows visitors to adjust.

**Services**: Licensed brokers connect pilgrims with appropriate Velwey priest-guides. Apothecaries sell preparation compounds (to ease the transition) and clarity tonics (to resist the jungle's effects for those who'd rather stay sober). Merchants offer everything a pilgrim might need and several things they probably don't.

**The Sober Quarter**: A district where clarity tonics are dispensed freely and the buildings are sealed against outside air. Sailors who refuse to sleep on Movasi stay here, conducting their business quickly and departing before their defenses fail.

**The Returnees**: Some who complete the pilgrimage never leave Holik. They linger at the docks, helping new arrivals, offering advice no one asked for. Something about the ritual changes people, and not everyone finds their way back to who they were before.

Population: ~4,000 (fluctuates with pilgrim traffic). Majority non-Velwey: humans, halflings, elves.

#### Moura

The capital, built around the **Pool of Names**—the sacred site where pilgrims undergo the ritual to learn their true name. Moura sits in the west-central interior, deep enough in the jungle that the ambient effects are constant but not overwhelming.

**Velwey Architecture**: The city is built *in* the trees rather than beneath them. Platforms and structures of woven vines, crystallized dream-matter, and shaped wood spiral up through the canopy, connected by rope bridges and spiral stairs. The buildings breathe with soft purple-green light. Walls shimmer with half-seen images—not decorations, but residue from generations of dreaming.

**The Pool of Names**: At the city's heart lies a still, dark body of water. The Pool predates the Velwey—they found it when they first came to Movasi, studied its properties, built their civilization around it. The surface reflects nothing. The depth is unknown. Some say it connects to something deeper than water.

The ritual itself takes days of preparation: fasting, guided lesser trips, confession of all names the pilgrim currently knows. On the final night, the pilgrim drinks the prepared sacrament and submerges alone. What they experience in the dark water varies. Most emerge knowing their true name. Some emerge knowing other things. A few don't emerge at all—the Pool claims perhaps one in fifty pilgrims, their bodies never recovered.

**The Confidentiality Architecture**: The Velwey designed the ritual so that priest-guides never learn the pilgrim's name. They prepare you, stabilize you, guide you to the threshold—but the moment of revelation happens in a space they cannot access. You submerge alone. What you hear in the dark is between you and whatever answers.

This is why pilgrims trust the Velwey: not because they're virtuous, but because the ritual makes betrayal impossible.

**The Speaking Houses**: After emerging from the Pool, pilgrims often need to speak their name aloud—to commit it to memory, to practice forming the sounds, to share it with chosen witnesses. The Speaking Houses are private chambers where this can happen safely, warded against eavesdropping by any means.

Population: ~12,000 (mostly Velwey, plus transient pilgrims and support staff).

#### Dreftwaf

A meadow in the northern interior where the jungle thins to swampy grassland. The Velwey maintain this as a **preparation site**—where pilgrims spend the days of fasting and preliminary rituals before they're ready for the Pool.

The clearing exists because the Velwey deliberately suppress the jungle's growth here, creating a space of lower psychedelic intensity. Simple treehouse accommodations dot the meadow's edges. The atmosphere is quiet, contemplative, anxious—everyone here is waiting for something that will change their life.

**The Lesser Journeys**: Priest-guides conduct preliminary rituals here, using diluted preparations to help pilgrims practice navigating altered states. These "lesser trips" are training for what the Pool will demand.

**The Confessionals**: Before facing the Pool, pilgrims must confess every name they know—their own common name, the names of family, friends, enemies, gods they worship. This isn't religious penance; it's preparation. The ritual works better when the mind is cleared of other names.

Population: ~800 permanent (Velwey priests and support staff), plus 200-400 transient pilgrims.

#### Trusiin

A meadow in the east-central interior, another swampy clearing where the jungle's intensity lessens. Trusiin serves as the **integration site**—where pilgrims go *after* the Pool to process what they learned.

Learning your true name is one thing. Deciding what to do with it is another.

**The Weight of Knowledge**: A true name is power—and vulnerability. Anyone who knows your true name can command you through Deoric magic, puppet you like a marionette. But if no one knows your true name when you die, your spirit will eventually fade from Celestia into permanent oblivion.

The priests at Trusiin help pilgrims navigate this paradox. Who do you tell? How do you tell them? What bindings or oaths might protect you? Some pilgrims resolve these questions in days. Some take weeks. Some never leave—they learned their name and realized they have no one in the world they trust enough to share it with.

**The Memorial Stones**: At the meadow's center stand dozens of carved stones, each bearing a true name spoken by a pilgrim who had no one else to tell. Whether the stones remember, whether the jungle remembers, whether speaking your name to the swamp counts as being known—the Velwey don't say.

Population: ~600 permanent, plus 100-300 transient pilgrims.

#### Banguna

A small village east of Moura, in a clearing near the jungle's edge. Banguna is where the **harvesters** live—the workers who cultivate, collect, and process the jungle's psychedelic bounty.

**The Cultivation Fields**: The villagers maintain controlled growing areas where specific pod varieties are encouraged. Different strains produce different effects; the sacramental preparation used in the Pool ritual requires precise combinations.

**The Processing Houses**: Raw pod-sap must be refined before use. The Processing Houses are workshops where this happens—drying, filtering, combining, aging. The work is skilled and dangerous. Errors can produce preparations that kill, or worse.

**The Workers**: Banguna's population is mixed: some Velwey, many humans and elves hired for their steady hands and expendable minds. The workers here are constantly exposed to psychoactive residue. They see things others don't. They're not always sure what's real. Turnover is high.

Population: ~1,200.

#### Kung

An isolated village in the southwest interior, far from the pilgrim routes. Kung is home to **the skeptics**—people who don't trust the Velwey's monopoly on truth.

**The Old Ways**: Before the Velwey formalized the Pool ritual, people sought their true names through longer, harder methods: solo journeys into the deep jungle, days of fasting and exposure, communion with the plants without priestly intermediaries. Kung's residents practice these older techniques.

They claim their methods are purer—that the Pool ritual has been optimized for throughput rather than truth. The Velwey call them reckless mystics risking their minds for ideology.

**The Results**: Occasionally someone from Kung emerges from a solo journey with what might be their true name. Or might be something else they found in the deep jungle, wearing the shape of a name. The uncertainty is the point, they say. Truth shouldn't come with a guarantee.

Population: ~400.

#### Solis

A marked location on the remote northeast peninsula, deep in jungle that grows differently than the rest of the island. The pods here glow amber instead of purple-green. The trees twist into older, stranger shapes. The Velwey don't go to Solis. They don't forbid it, exactly. They just don't discuss it.

**What's There**: Ruins. Structures that predate the Velwey, built by something that understood true names before the dwarves arrived. The Velwey founding stories say they "discovered" the Pool and "were called" to Movasi. Solis suggests a different history—that something was here first.

**The Seekers**: Occasionally a pilgrim, unsatisfied with what the Pool revealed (or having received no answer at all), makes the trek to Solis. Most don't return. The few who do seem changed—not damaged, necessarily. Just different. They don't talk about what they found.

**The Rumor**: Something lives at Solis. Something with a true name that cannot be spoken by mortal mouths—a name that predates language itself. Whether this is metaphor or literal, no one outside the peninsula knows.

The Velwey do not discuss Solis with pilgrims. Questions about it are politely deflected. Insistence is met with silence.

Population: Unknown.
