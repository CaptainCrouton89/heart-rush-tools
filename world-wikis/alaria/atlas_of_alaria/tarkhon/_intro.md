# Tarkhon

## Geography

The Tarkhon Empire straddles the critical strait between Clueanda and Rimihuica, controlling territory on both continents and dominating the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. This strategic position has made Tarkhon one of the most powerful political entities in the region.

### Position and Extent

#### On Rimihuica (Southern Holdings)
- Extends from the strait southward to the northern shoreline of the Eronia Range
- Controls the coastal lands north of the great mountains that separate it from Westrim and the Dunes of Kunagi

#### On Clueanda (Northern Holdings)
- Controls the states of **Kerwin**, **Enymu**, and **Nektuna** along the southern coast
- These territories lie west of the Middle Sea proper, along the strait

#### Southwestern Holdings (Western Isles Frontier)
- **Sheîr**: Juts westward into the Shattered Sea
- **Kabir**: Northeastern territory facing the Sea of Merchants
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: Southernmost of the western holdings

### The Tarkhon Strait

The empire's lifeblood—a narrow, due-west passage connecting the Middle Sea to the open ocean beyond the Western Isles. This chokepoint means all maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world must pass through Tarkhon-controlled waters.

### Terrain

The Tarkhon heartlands are temperate and green—rolling hills and fertile plains with easy access to the ocean. This is hospitable land that supports both civilization and agriculture, a stark contrast to the desert and jungle that lies south of the Eronia Range.
