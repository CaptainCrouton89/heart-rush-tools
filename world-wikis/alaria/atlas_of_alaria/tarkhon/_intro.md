# Tarkhon

## Geography

The Tarkhon Empire straddles the critical strait between Clueanda and Rimihuica, controlling territory on both continents and dominating the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. This strategic position has made Tarkhon one of the most powerful—and most resented—political entities in the region.

### Position and Extent

#### On Clueanda (Northern Holdings)
- **Nektuna**: The imperial heartland, controlling the northern shore of the strait
- **Enymu**: Agricultural state east of Nektuna
- **Kerwin**: Halfling kingdom in the far northeast, nominally tributary
- **Astrelle**: Vassal state of Nektuna
- **Vogenfeld**: Uline dwarf settlements in the northern mountains, guarding the passes against Hedroscobb
- **Murth**: Dual-capital state of Rhea scholars and human merchants

#### On Rimihuica (Southern Holdings)
- Extends from the strait southward to the northern shoreline of the Eronia Range
- Controls the coastal lands north of the great mountains that separate it from Westrim and the Dunes of Kunagi

#### Southwestern Holdings (Kingdoms of Fire)
- **Kabir**: Northeastern Neferati kingdom facing the Sea of Merchants
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: Southernmost of the western holdings
- **Yaif**: Western Neferati kingdom

### The Tarkhon Strait

The empire's lifeblood—a narrow passage connecting the Middle Sea to the open ocean beyond. This chokepoint means all maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world must pass through Tarkhon-controlled waters.

Tarkhetan, the capital, sits directly on the strait. Its massive navy and fire-mage garrison ensure that every ship pays tribute. Those who refuse are burned.

### Terrain

The Tarkhon heartlands are temperate and green—rolling hills and fertile plains with easy access to the ocean. This is hospitable land that supports both civilization and agriculture, a stark contrast to the desert and jungle that lies south of the Eronia Range.

To the north, the land grows drier as it approaches Kerwin and the volcanic Fireknife Mountains. To the south, the Eronia Range marks the boundary between Tarkhon territory and the lands beyond—mountains that were cleared of hostile inhabitants two centuries ago by Klor the Blood Lord.

### The Wurmspine

The massive mountain range that forms Tarkhon's northern frontier, separating the empire from the orcish Wildwood and stretching from the coastal regions in the west to the steppes in the east. The Wurmspine is not a single chain but a complex system of interconnected ranges, peaks, and highland regions.

**Major components of the Wurmspine:**
- **Vogenfeld**: The Uline dwarf settlements controlling the main passes against Hedroscobb
- **Murth**: The dual mountains of Mt. Disyus and Mt. Arn, home to Rhea scholars and human merchants
- **Wurn Mountains**: Eastern alpine range home to the Stone Men
- **Fireknife Mountains**: Volcanic range northeast of the Wurn, marking Kerwin's border
- **Freedom's Way**: Mountain passes and highlands west of Vogenfeld
- **Silver Hills**: Rolling mineral-rich highlands
- **Mt. Thryke**: Major peak in Morgnor's Cradle territory
- **Morgnor's Cradle**: Dragon-ruled mountains northwest of Thespia
- **Hills of Nowhere**: Remote highland region
- **Kobuk**: Mountain territory home to surviving Coghead goblins
- **Hills of Hellion**: Treacherous peaks along the range's edge

The Wurmspine serves as both barrier and boundary—protecting Tarkhon from northern invasion while defining the limits of imperial influence. Control of the Wurmspine passes has determined the fate of empires; the dwarves of Vogenfeld have held these passes for centuries, though their loyalty grows strained as Tarkhon forgets its obligations.

## Political Climate

Tarkhon is an empire held together by profit rather than loyalty. Subsidiary states receive preferential trade terms in exchange for fealty, tribute, and cooperation. This arrangement works as long as Tarkhon remains wealthy and powerful—but it means every member is constantly calculating whether the benefits still outweigh the costs.

The current ruler, **King Selron II**, governs from Tarkhetan. His authority is absolute in the core territories but fades rapidly with distance. The Kingdoms of Fire act as a bloc. The dwarven city-states answer to the First Brotherhood as much as to Tarkhon. And Kerwin's immortal king has outlived every emperor for five centuries.

The empire's great symbol is the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame in Tarkhetan's cathedral. The torch was lit when the Neferati founders established the city six centuries ago, kindled from sacred fire they brought north from Yaif. It has burned there ever since, symbol of an empire that has changed hands but never broken.

## What Makes It Interesting

- **The Chokepoint Empire**: Tarkhon's entire economy depends on controlling the strait. If an alternative route opened—overland, magical, or otherwise—the empire would collapse. This makes Tarkhon both desperate to maintain control and paranoid about anything that might threaten it.

- **The Immortal Witness**: King Ulyas of Kerwin remembers the Neferati emperors, the founding families, the old bargains that bound the empire together. He was ancient when Tarkhon was young. His existence is an embarrassment to imperial narratives—he knows things the current dynasty would prefer forgotten, and he has no reason to keep their secrets.

- **The Necessary Monster**: Klor the Blood Lord cleared the southern mountains through systematic genocide. Tarkhon honors him as a hero. The descendants of those he killed—scattered across neighboring lands—remember differently.

- **The Conditional Loyalty**: Every subsidiary state is one bad trade deal away from reconsidering membership. The Kingdoms of Fire negotiate as a bloc. The dwarven cities have their own allegiances. Even loyal Enymu could be turned with the right pressure.

## What Will Go Wrong

- **The Kingdoms of Fire Departure**: If the four Neferati monarchies decided to leave together, Tarkhon would struggle to stop them. Something might push them over the edge—a new trade deal, an insult from Tarkhetan, a better offer from elsewhere. Queen Khalira of Wadiyah is already preparing for something.

- **The Alternative Route**: Someone could discover (or create) a way around the strait. A canal, a portal, a mountain pass, a magical transport network. The moment trade can bypass Tarkhon, the empire dies.

- **Ulyas's Choice**: The immortal king has been playing along for five centuries because it was convenient. If he decided to stop—if he actively opposed the empire—Kerwin's strategic position and his personal power could cause real problems.

- **The Northern Collapse**: Vogenfeld's dwarves have held the northern passes for centuries, but Tarkhon has forgotten to pay them. If the dwarves withdraw—or worse, help the orcs through their secret tunnels—six orcish tribal states from Hedroscobb could sweep south. The orcs have been fighting each other for generations, but if they ever unite, nothing stands between them and Tarkhon except increasingly resentful dwarves.
