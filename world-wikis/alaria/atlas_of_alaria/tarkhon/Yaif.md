## Yaif

Tags: state, nation

The westernmost of the Kingdoms of Fire, and the oldest. Home to the Flame of First Fire, the Temple of Origins, and the ancient traditions that define Neferati identity. If the other kingdoms are the children of fire, Yaif is the mother.

### Position and Borders

Yaif occupies the western portion of the Neferati peninsula:
- **East**: Kabir
- **South**: Gissemari
- **North and West**: The Sea of Merchants and open ocean

The coastline is dramatic—volcanic cliffs dropping into deep water, with natural harbors carved by ancient lava flows. The interior rises toward a central volcanic plateau where the Temple of First Fire stands.

### The Flame of First Fire

At Yaif's heart burns the oldest of the Eternal Flames—the **Flame of First Fire**. According to Neferati tradition, this is the original flame from which all others were kindled, burning since before the world had names.

The flame burns in the **Temple of First Fire**, a massive structure carved from volcanic rock on the central plateau. The temple complex includes:
- The Flame Chamber itself (accessible only to priests and monarchs)
- The Hall of Origins (where the founding of Tarkhon is commemorated)
- The Archive of Ashes (containing records written in fire on treated stone)
- Living quarters for the priests who tend the flame

The Evertorch in Tarkhetan was lit from this flame six centuries ago. This is the core of Yaif's claim—and the Neferati's claim—to Tarkhon itself.

### Terrain and Climate

Hot and arid, even by Neferati standards. The volcanic soil is rich but water is scarce. Agriculture depends on careful irrigation from the few rivers that flow from the central highlands.

The landscape is dominated by dark volcanic rock, ancient lava flows now weathered into strange formations, and the ever-present heat that rises from the ground. Visitors from cooler climates find Yaif nearly unbearable. The Neferati find it comfortable.

### Capital: Ashenheart

Yaif's capital is built into the slopes of an extinct volcano, its buildings carved from the same dark stone that surrounds it. The architecture is ancient—some structures predate recorded history—and the streets follow paths worn by thousands of years of feet.

**Population**: ~40,000

Ashenheart is a city of temples, shrines, and sacred sites. More priests per capita than any other city in Tarkhon. The spiritual heart of Neferati culture.

The city is quieter than outsiders expect. Where other Neferati kingdoms burn bright with passion and innovation, Yaif burns steady with tradition and memory. The fire here is ancient, patient, eternal.

### Queen Seraphel

The ruler of Yaif is **Queen Seraphel**, who has sat the throne for sixty-three years—longer than any other current Neferati monarch.

Seraphel is old by Neferati standards—nearly eighty—but her mind remains sharp and her patience is legendary. She has seen kings rise and fall in Tarkhetan, watched empires rise and fall beyond the sea, and waited while the Kingdoms of Fire debated their future.

**Appearance**: Withered but dignified. Her red skin has faded to a deep rust, her horns have grown long and curved, and her eyes hold the weight of decades. She moves slowly but deliberately.

**Philosophy**: Seraphel believes in patience. The Neferati founded Tarkhon. The Neferati will reclaim it. But not through war or ultimatums—through time. Humans burn fast and die young. The Neferati can wait them out.

**Role in the Council**: The voice of caution. When Queen Khalira demands action, Seraphel reminds her that action taken too soon is worse than no action at all. When King Rashaan counsels accommodation, Seraphel warns that accommodation becomes surrender if it goes too far.

### The Priesthood of First Fire

Yaif's most powerful institution isn't the throne—it's the priesthood that tends the Flame of First Fire.

The **High Priest of Origins** holds a position nearly equal to the queen's. The priesthood controls access to the flame, interprets sacred traditions, and advises on matters of spiritual significance. No major decision in Yaif is made without their blessing.

Current High Priest: **Ashvareth**, an ancient Neferati who claims to have personally witnessed the founding of Tarkhon. Whether this is true or exaggeration is debated. Either way, his authority is unquestioned.

### Culture

Yaif is traditional where other Neferati kingdoms are innovative. The people here value:
- Continuity with the past
- Proper observance of ritual
- Patience and long-term thinking
- Sacred duty over personal desire

This doesn't mean Yaif is stagnant—Neferati passion still burns here. But it's directed toward preserving and perfecting traditions rather than creating new ones.

Fire dancing in Yaif follows ancient forms. The fire ceremonies are conducted exactly as they were a thousand years ago. Innovation is welcome, but only if it honors what came before.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Character**: Ceremonial and defensive

Yaif maintains a significant military force, but it's oriented toward defending the sacred sites rather than projecting power. The **Temple Guard** is an elite force dedicated to protecting the Flame of First Fire—they would fight to the death before allowing any threat near it.

In any conflict, Yaif would be the last kingdom to fall. The terrain favors defense, the population is dedicated, and the prospect of losing the First Fire is unthinkable.

### The Question of the Evertorch

More than any other kingdom, Yaif feels the loss of the Evertorch.

The flame in Tarkhetan was kindled from Yaif's fire. When Neferati priests visit Tarkhetan, they can tell—the Evertorch burns with the same light as the Flame of First Fire. It's a piece of Yaif, stolen and never returned.

Queen Seraphel has never publicly demanded the Evertorch's return. But the priesthood of Yaif holds detailed records of exactly how the flame was taken, exactly who took it, and exactly what promises were made. Those promises have not been kept.

Someday, Yaif intends to collect.

### Relationship with Other Kingdoms

**With Kabir**: Respectful but distant. Yaif finds Kabir's commercial focus vulgar; Kabir finds Yaif's traditionalism stifling.

**With Gissemari**: Friendly. The artists of Gissemari often seek Yaif's blessing for their works, and Yaif appreciates beauty that honors tradition.

**With Wadiyah**: Tense. Queen Khalira's radicalism alarms Yaif's conservative establishment. Seraphel has spent considerable effort restraining Wadiyah's impulses.

**With Tarkhon**: Cold. Yaif remembers everything. They participate in the empire because the alternative is worse, but they've never forgiven the Severance and never will.
