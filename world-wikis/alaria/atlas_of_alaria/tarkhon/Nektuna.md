## Nektuna

Tags: state, nation

The imperial heartland of the Tarkhon Empire, controlling both shores of the Needle—the strait's narrowest point and the key to everything.

### Position and Borders

Nektuna occupies the central position in Tarkhon's territory:
- **North**: Enymu (agricultural tributary)
- **South**: The strait itself, with Astrelle (vassal) on the opposite shore
- **West**: Pyris Island (controlled territory)
- **East**: The broader Tarkhon Passage, narrowing toward Eros

The Needle—where Tarkhetan faces Torsnerhun fortress across the narrowest water—is the geographic heart of Tarkhon's power.

### Terrain and Climate

Warm Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot, dry summers. The land rises from the harbor in a series of hills, each topped with fortifications or noble estates. Olive groves and vineyards cover the slopes outside the city walls.

The coastline alternates between rocky cliffs and protected harbors. Tarkhetan occupies the best natural harbor on the strait, which is why it became the capital.

### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire, built on hills overlooking the Needle. From the palace walls, you can see clear across to Torsnerhun fortress on the Astrelle shore.

The city is divided into districts by elevation and wealth:

**The Old City** — The highest hills. Noble estates, the royal palace, the great cathedral where the Evertorch burns. Wealth, power, and ancient blood.

**The Middle City** — Lower slopes. Merchant houses, guild halls, the homes of successful craftsmen. Where business happens and fortunes are made.

**The Waterfront** — Along the harbor. Warehouses, shipyards, tenements, taverns, brothels. Craven make up the majority. The smell of fish, tar, and humanity.

**The Undercity** — Tunnels, cellars, forgotten passages beneath the streets. Smugglers, thieves, and things that don't like sunlight.

### The Evertorch Cathedral

The great cathedral at Tarkhetan's heart, where the Evertorch has burned without interruption for six centuries. The flame is the empire's holiest symbol—emperors are crowned in its light, the most binding oaths are sworn before it.

The cathedral is also a center of fire magic. Ritual work occurs here, sustained by both the Evertorch's power and the fire leyline running beneath the Old City.

What the human clergy don't like to discuss: the Evertorch is a Neferati creation, lit by Neferati hands, sustained by Neferati traditions. The Kingdoms of Fire haven't forgotten.

### The Fire Leyline

A leyline of fire runs beneath Tarkhetan, concentrated under the Old City. Children born here sometimes manifest fire attunement—and those who do are claimed by the Firemage Corps.

The Corps' Citadel of Flames sits on the leyline's strongest point, training mages who can burn ships from the city walls.

### Besnoumeru

Nektuna's second city, built on a **time leyline**. The Oracle Merchants born here can sense market changes before they happen—not prophecy, but an instinct for timing that has made Besnoumeru almost as wealthy as Tarkhetan.

The city has an eerie calm. Nobody rushes. The merchants already know what's coming.

### Pyris Island

A moderate-sized island southwest of the strait. Home to the Pyrisi—stocky, hardy folk descended from human-dwarf interbreeding over centuries. They're farmers and fishers who want to be left alone.

The island includes a town and several villages in the north, supporting a modest population that pays taxes and provides sailors for the navy.

### Fort Tenze (Ruined)

On Pyris's eastern coast stand the ruins of Fort Tenze, guardian of a secondary chokepoint. The fortress has been abandoned for nearly three centuries, ever since the **Severance**—the civil war that ended Neferati rule.

During the Severance, Fort Tenze's garrison sided with the Neferati faction. When they lost, something went wrong. The fortress burned with unnatural fire that left the stones themselves twisted. The wrongness never left.

Three attempts to rebuild have failed. Workers suffer accidents, disappearances, madness. Equipment fails. Stones won't set. People hear whispers, see figures in their peripheral vision, dream of burning.

The crown has stopped trying. Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, but nobody stays long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

### The Harbor

Tarkhetan's harbor is the busiest port in the region. Ships from across Alaria arrive and depart at all hours, their cargoes taxed, inspected, and sent onward.

The harbor is protected by both geography (natural breakwaters, defensible approaches) and magic (firemages on the walls can burn any hostile fleet). This combination makes Tarkhetan's harbor essentially unassailable by naval attack.

### The Needle

The narrowest point of the Tarkhon Passage—perhaps half a mile of water between Tarkhetan's walls and Torsnerhun fortress on the Astrelle shore.

Nothing passes the Needle without Tarkhetan's permission. Firemages on both shores can burn ships attempting to run the strait. The navy patrols constantly. Even if a ship somehow slipped through, the fortresses further east would catch it.

This chokepoint is everything. Tarkhon's wealth, power, and existence depend on maintaining absolute control of the Needle.

### Relationships

**With Astrelle**: Vassal state across the Needle. Astrelle hosts Torsnerhun fortress, making it strategically vital. The current Duchess Ysmera is also the queen's aunt—family ties complicate the overlord-vassal relationship.

**With Enymu**: Loyal tributary to the north. Provides food, conscripts, and access to the Stone Forest border. The honorable kings of Enymu have never given Nektuna trouble.

**With Kerwin**: Distant and nominal. King Ulyas pays tribute but effectively governs himself. He's been ruling longer than Nektuna's current dynasty has existed.

**With the Kingdoms of Fire**: Complex. They're nominally tributary but act as a bloc. They remember founding the empire the humans now rule. The relationship is stable but fragile.
