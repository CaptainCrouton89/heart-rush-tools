## Fleimrut Mountains

Extremely treacherous. Underground fire-geysers are all over the place. Lots of caves, equally treacherous.

### The Fleimrut Awakening

The fire-geysers that dominate the mountain range are fed by a Yolus leyline that has never achieved stability. This volatile magical current has made the Fleimrut a zone of perpetual fire hazard, but in 2500 SD, the situation escalated catastrophically.

In what scholars and locals call "The Fleimrut Awakening," the geysers erupted with unprecedented violence. Since then, Emberlords and Cinder Swarms pour from the vents with alarming frequency, turning the mountains into an active war zone between the physical and elemental planes. The eruptions continue with unpredictable intensity, making travel through the region increasingly dangerous.

### Fire-Trolls & Elemental Symbiosis

Home to a large population of fire-trolls—trolls attuned to fire and shaped by the mountain's hostile environment. Over generations, these creatures have developed a strange symbiosis with the fire elementals that emerge from the unstable Yolus leyline.

Rather than being destroyed by these entities, fire-trolls have learned to coexist with them, developing an unusual cultural and biological relationship. They function as intermediaries between the physical and elemental realms, brokering uneasy peace in the mountain's violent landscape. However, this symbiosis has also made them valuable—and dangerous—as both allies and weapons in the hands of those who understand how to negotiate with them.
