## Midton

Tags: island, geography

A small, rocky island in the eastern Tarkhon Passage, home to Ekfusy fortress and little else.

### Geography

Midton sits south of Enymu, where the Tarkhon Passage begins to widen toward the Middle Sea. The island is small—perhaps ten miles long and five wide—with rocky coastlines and sparse vegetation.

The terrain is unremarkable: low hills, scrubby grass, a few wind-twisted trees. No natural harbors worth mentioning. The only significant structure is Ekfusy fortress on the northern shore.

### Population

Midton has no real population. A fishing hamlet of perhaps fifty souls clings to the southern coast, their ancestors presumably stranded here generations ago and too stubborn to leave. They catch fish, curse the wind, and avoid the soldiers.

The fortress garrison adds another 200, but they don't count—they're temporary, rotating in and out on tours of duty, counting the days until they can leave.

### Strategic Value

Midton's only importance is its position. Ships entering the Tarkhon Passage from the east must pass within sight of the island. Ekfusy fortress watches for hostile fleets, pirates, or smugglers.

In practice, this matters less than it should. The Needle catches everything. By the time ships reach Midton's longitude, they've already been taxed and documented at Tarkhetan. Ekfusy exists mostly as insurance—a backup that rarely proves necessary.

### Conditions

Life on Midton is miserable. The island offers nothing: no entertainment, no women, no opportunities. The fishing hamlet resents the garrison. The garrison resents being here. The wind blows constantly.

Supply ships visit monthly, weather permitting. Mail is slow. News from Tarkhetan arrives weeks late. For the soldiers stationed here, Midton might as well be another world.

### The Blessing in Disguise

Some find Midton's isolation appealing. No politics. No intrigues. No one watching, no one caring. For men with pasts they'd rather forget, Midton offers anonymity.

The garrison doesn't ask questions. Do your job, keep your head down, serve your time. Whatever you're running from, it won't follow you here.
