## Wurn Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

Part of the greater Wurmspine range, the Wurn Mountains form Enymu's northern border. Home to the Stone Men—a human subculture whose gray, rock-hard skin marks generations of elemental exposure. Switzerland vibes: alpine meadows, dramatic peaks, isolated valleys, and a people who want to be left alone.

### Geography

The Wurn Mountains rise sharply from Enymu's northern farmlands, their peaks reaching high enough for permanent snow. The range extends roughly east-west, creating a natural barrier between the settled lands of Tarkhon and the territories beyond.

The mountains are dramatic but not impassable. Several valleys cut through the range, providing routes for trade and (occasionally) invasion. The Stone Men control these passes, collecting tolls from travelers and turning back those they don't like.

### Climate

Alpine conditions prevail above the tree line: harsh winters, brief summers, unpredictable weather. Snow can fall any month of the year in the highest reaches.

The lower valleys are more temperate—cold in winter but capable of supporting grazing and limited agriculture. This is where most Stone Men settlements are located.

### The Stone Men

The Stone Men are a human subculture who have lived in the Wurn Mountains for countless generations. Their most distinctive feature is their skin: gray, rough, and hard as rock—a result of prolonged elemental exposure that has become hereditary.

**Appearance**: Gray skin with a texture like weathered stone. Otherwise human in form, though often stocky and powerfully built. Their eyes are usually pale—gray, blue, or occasionally colorless.

**Culture**: The Stone Men are serious, blunt, and pragmatic. They say what they mean, mean what they say, and find lowlander habits of politeness and indirection baffling. Why waste words?

They value self-sufficiency, physical endurance, and keeping their word. Hospitality is sacred—once you're under a Stone Man's roof, they'll die to protect you. But earning that hospitality requires proving you're worth the effort.

**Lifestyle**: Primarily pastoral—sheep and goats graze the alpine meadows, providing wool, milk, and meat. Limited farming in the valleys produces hardy grains and vegetables. Trade with lowland Enymu provides metals, tools, and luxuries.

### Settlements

Stone Men communities are scattered through the mountain valleys, typically consisting of stone houses clustered around a central meeting hall. Populations are small—a few hundred people is a large village.

Notable communities include:

- **Grayhaven**: The largest Stone Men settlement, positioned to control the main pass between Enymu and the territories beyond. Perhaps 800 residents.
- **High Watch**: A fortress-village overlooking the northern approaches. The Stone Men here consider themselves guardians against whatever lies beyond the mountains.
- **The Old Stones**: A ring of standing stones predating human settlement, considered sacred by the Stone Men. They gather here for important ceremonies and disputes.

### Relations with Enymu

The relationship between the Stone Men and lowland Enymu is... complicated.

**Trade**: Regular, though not warm. Stone Men bring wool, cheese, and mountain herbs to lowland markets. They buy metal tools, grain, and the occasional luxury. Both sides benefit, but neither pretends to like each other.

**Trouble**: Occasionally, Stone Men bands raid lowland farms—usually young warriors proving themselves, sometimes organized groups seeking wealth. Enymu's army responds, there's fighting, eventually negotiation. This cycle has repeated for centuries.

**Mutual Suspicion**: Lowlanders find Stone Men unsettling—their gray skin, their bluntness, their alien customs. Stone Men find lowlanders soft, dishonest, and overly concerned with appearances. Neither opinion is entirely unfair.

**Stability**: Despite the friction, neither side wants war. The Stone Men can't conquer the lowlands; Enymu can't pacify the mountains. They've settled into an uneasy coexistence punctuated by occasional violence.

### The Old Stones

A ring of massive standing stones in the central mountains, predating any known civilization. The Stone Men consider this site sacred, gathering here for important ceremonies, dispute resolution, and the election of their informal leaders.

Lowland Enymese are not welcome at the Old Stones. Those who have trespassed have been turned back—forcefully if necessary. What exactly happens at Stone Men ceremonies is unknown to outsiders.

Some scholars believe the Old Stones are connected to the titan crystals in the Stone Forest. The Stone Men neither confirm nor deny this.

### What Lies Beyond

The Wurn Mountains form the northern boundary of Tarkhon's sphere of influence. Beyond them lie:

- Territories not claimed by any major power
- Eventually, the lands leading toward Hedroscobb and the six orcish tribal states
- Vogenfeld's dwarven defenders, watching the northern frontier

The Stone Men consider themselves the first line of defense against whatever might come from the north. This is partly why they maintain warrior traditions despite their pastoral lifestyle. They remember times when things came down from beyond the mountains.

### Wildlife

The Wurn Mountains support diverse alpine wildlife:
- Mountain sheep and goats (both wild and domesticated)
- Eagles and other raptors
- Mountain lions and wolves
- Bears in the lower forests
- Various "strange mountain animals" that the Stone Men speak of but lowlanders rarely see

The Stone Men have their own names for creatures that appear in no lowland bestiary. Whether these are real or legendary is unclear to outsiders.
