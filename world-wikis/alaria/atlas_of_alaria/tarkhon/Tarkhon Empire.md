## Tarkhon Empire

Tags: state, nation, empire

The dominant empire of the Tarkhon region, controlling the critical strait between the Middle Sea and the western ocean.

### The Evertorch

In Tarkhetan's great cathedral burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting centuries ago. The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing the empire's eternal dominion and unbroken continuity.

The flame burns without fuel, without maintenance, without apparent source. Scholars have studied it for generations without understanding how it works. Some believe it's fed by a leyline. Others think it's a divine gift. A few whisper that something was sacrificed to light it, and that sacrifice is what keeps it burning.

The torch was originally lit in Tarkha—now a provincial capital in Kerwin—before being ceremonially moved to Tarkhetan when the seat of power shifted. This transfer remains controversial among those who believe the torch belongs in its original home.

### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire, built on the northern shore of the strait. Tarkhetan is a city of extremes—fabulous wealth alongside desperate poverty, gleaming palaces beside rotting slums, merchant princes who could buy kingdoms and beggars who will never own anything.

The city's power comes from position, not production. Every ship that passes through the strait pays tribute. Every merchant who wants access to Tarkhon markets pays fees. The city produces little itself but takes a cut of everything that moves through.

King Selron II rules from the great palace overlooking the strait. His court is a nest of intrigue—lords from across the empire jockeying for position, merchants buying influence, and spies from every neighboring power watching for weakness.

### The Strait

The narrow passage connecting the Middle Sea to the western ocean. Ships can cross it in hours, but those hours pass under the watchful eyes of Tarkhon's navy and the burning gaze of its firemages.

The strait is everything. Without it, Tarkhon is just another middling power. With it, Tarkhon controls half the world's trade. This makes the empire both fabulously wealthy and desperately paranoid. Any threat to the strait is an existential threat to the empire itself.

### Leylines

Tarkhon's territory contains several important leylines:

- **Fire Leyline**: Runs through Nektuna and Tarkhetan, producing the firemages who serve as the empire's elite military asset
- **Time Leyline**: Runs through Besnoumeru, enabling the city's famous merchants to anticipate market changes before they happen
- **Yolus Leyline**: Runs through the Fleimrut Mountains, unstable and dangerous, responsible for the Fleimrut Awakening

### The Imperial Legacy

Tarkhon was not always a maritime empire. Centuries ago, it was a land empire centered on Tarkha, expanding through conquest and diplomacy. The Evertorch burned in Tarkha. The emperor ruled from Tarkha. The empire's heart was in Tarkha.

Then maritime trade exploded in importance, and suddenly the strait mattered more than land. Nektuna rose. The capital moved. The torch was transferred. The empire's character changed—from territorial ambition to commercial exploitation.

The old Tarkhon is gone. But its echoes remain in Tarkha's faded grandeur, in the Evertorch controversy, in the immortal king who remembers when things were different.
