## Kerwin

Tags: state, nation

The northeastern territory of the Tarkhon Empire—though "territory" implies more control than Tarkhon actually exercises. Kerwin is a land of rolling farmland and quiet villages, ruled by an immortal halfling king who predates the empire by centuries.

### Position and Borders

Kerwin occupies the northeastern corner of Tarkhon's claimed territory, bounded by:
- **West**: Enymu and the broader Tarkhon heartland
- **Northwest**: The Fireknife Mountains (volcanic, dangerous)
- **East and South**: Sparsely populated frontier lands

The region sits at the edge of imperial attention—far enough from the strait to be strategically unimportant, close enough to be claimed.

### Terrain and Climate

Kerwin is semi-arid but fertile enough for farming. The land rolls gently from the Fireknife foothills in the northwest down toward the coastal lowlands. Summers are hot and dry; winters are cold but brief. Rain comes in spring and autumn, enough to sustain wheat, barley, and extensive sheep pastures.

The landscape has a faded grandeur—roads too wide for their traffic, bridges built for armies that never came, the bones of imperial ambition overgrown with wildflowers.

### Tarkha

The capital of Kerwin—an ancient city that predates Tarkhon itself.

Tarkha was already old when the Neferati came north. The halflings had built it for their own purposes: wide avenues for their festivals, great plazas for their markets, a palace for kings who expected to rule forever. When Tarkhon absorbed Kerwin five centuries ago, the empire's architects found a city that needed no improvement.

Tarkha is grander than most expect from a halfling city. The halflings built it for a king who expected to rule forever, and the architecture reflects those ambitions. Visitors from Nektuna find the scale disorienting—everything built for importance, inhabited by people who don't care about importance at all.

The palace still functions as seat of government. King Ulyas rules from a modest chamber in one wing while the rest of the building gathers dust. He's been here longer than the empire has existed. The halflings find Tarkha perfectly comfortable. Ulyas finds it home.

### The Fireknife Mountains

A volcanic range along Kerwin's northwestern border, marking the boundary between settled land and wilderness. The Fireknife peaks smoke constantly, their slopes scarred by ancient lava flows and dotted with hot springs. Travel through the mountains is possible but dangerous—paths shift, vents open without warning, and the rock itself is unstable.

The halflings avoid the Fireknife. They tell stories of spirits in the peaks, of travelers who entered and never returned, of lights that move against the wind. These stories are probably exaggerated.

King Ulyas travels into the Fireknife once a year. He takes prisoners and criminals with him. He returns alone. The halflings have learned not to ask questions.

### The Copper Hills

Low hills west of Tarkha, their ruddy soil rich with copper ore. The mining town of **Chykum** extracts enough copper to supply Kerwin's modest needs and trade surplus to Tarkhon merchants.

The hills are older than the halflings—older than Tarkhon. Ancient mine shafts riddle the deeper hills, their origins unknown. Halfling miners occasionally break through into these old workings. They find strange tools, stranger carvings, and sometimes things best left undisturbed. A sensible miner seals such discoveries and moves on.

### Da Sharma

The southern region of Kerwin, where farmland gives way to sheep pastures and the influence of Tarkha fades. Da Sharma is insular, traditional, and faintly suspicious of outsiders—including halflings from northern Kerwin.

The people here maintain old shrines to spirits that predate Tarkhon, predate Kerwin, predate perhaps the halflings themselves. They light candles on certain nights, leave offerings at certain stones, and speak certain names only in whispers. When asked about these practices, they smile and change the subject.

### Settlements

Kerwin's towns are modest affairs—farming communities, market villages, waypoints on roads that once carried imperial traffic. Notable settlements include:

- **Sharmatenu**: The largest town after Tarkha, a market center for the central farmlands
- **Chykum**: Mining town in the Copper Hills
- **Hebbythus**, **Nehemiter**, **Hebmu**: Agricultural villages along the main road
- **Clynisi**, **Ankbalen**: Eastern frontier settlements
- **Dlesy**, **Cuntzam**: Da Sharma communities
- **Kastorbekt**, **Akhzubdet**: Southern towns near the border with wilder lands

### Relationship to Tarkhon

Kerwin is nominally part of the Tarkhon Empire. In practice, this means:
- Kerwin pays modest tribute to Tarkhetan
- Tarkhon merchants travel freely through Kerwin
- Kerwin acknowledges the emperor's theoretical sovereignty

What it does not mean:
- Tarkhon troops garrison Kerwin
- Tarkhon laws supersede Kerwin customs
- Tarkhon has any real say in Kerwin's governance

King Ulyas agreed to this arrangement five centuries ago. He has outlived every emperor since. Periodically, ambitious officials in Nektuna suggest bringing Kerwin more firmly under imperial control. These officials tend to have short careers.

### The Neferati Memory

Ulyas remembers the Neferati founders—the fire-blooded conquerors who came north and built Tarkhetan. He remembers when they negotiated Kerwin's entry into the empire, promising autonomy in exchange for tribute. He remembers their emperors, their court intrigues, their slow dilution into humanity.

He also remembers the Severance—the civil war that ended Neferati rule. Kerwin stayed neutral, which is why it still exists. Ulyas watched both sides burn each other while his halflings tended their sheep.

Now humans hold the throne, and they've forgotten most of what Ulyas remembers. He hasn't told them. He hasn't decided if he ever will.
