## Astrelle

Tags: state, nation

A vassal state of Nektuna, occupying the southern shore of the Tarkhon Passage directly across from the imperial capital. Astrelle's strategic position—hosting two of the empire's most critical fortresses—gives it leverage far beyond its size.

### Position and Borders

Astrelle occupies the northern coast of the Rimihuica continent, facing Nektuna across the strait:
- **North**: The Tarkhon Passage (water)
- **South**: The Eronia Range foothills
- **West**: Territories leading toward the Kingdoms of Fire
- **East**: The passage widening toward the Middle Sea

The state is essentially a coastal strip, its importance entirely derived from its position across from Tarkhetan.

### Political Status

Astrelle was absorbed into Nektuna's orbit roughly two centuries ago through a combination of marriage alliances and economic pressure. The absorption was peaceful—Astrelle's rulers recognized they couldn't resist Tarkhon's power and negotiated the best terms they could.

The current arrangement makes Astrelle a vassal state:
- Self-governing in internal matters
- Subordinate to Tarkhetan in foreign policy
- Required to host and support imperial fortresses
- Required to provide troops for imperial defense

In exchange, Astrelle receives preferential trade terms and protection. Whether this is a fair bargain depends on who you ask.

### Duchess Ysmera

The current ruler of Astrelle is **Duchess Ysmera**, a shrewd woman in her sixties who has navigated vassal politics for three decades.

Ysmera's niece, **Vethira**, is married to King Selron II—making the duchess both vassal and family to the crown. This creates awkward dynamics. Is she representing Astrelle's interests at court, or is she there to keep Astrelle in line? Both, probably.

Ysmera walks a careful path: loyal enough to avoid imperial displeasure, independent enough to maintain Astrelle's dignity. She advocates for her people where she can and accepts what she cannot change.

### Torsnerhun Fortress

The most prestigious military posting in Tarkhon, directly across the Needle from Tarkhetan itself.

Torsnerhun and Tarkhetan together control the Needle—the narrowest point of the strait. Firemages on both shores can burn any ship attempting to run the passage without permission. The two fortresses work in coordination, their fires overlapping to create an impassable barrier.

**Garrison**: ~500 elite soldiers, including a significant firemage detachment. The best equipment, the best training, the best officers.

**Posting**: Torsnerhun is where careers are made. Officers assigned here are on the rise—they've distinguished themselves and are being groomed for higher command. The competition for posting is fierce.

**Commander**: **General Halric Vance**, a decorated veteran in his fifties. Loyal to the crown, respected by his troops, and aware that his position makes him a political figure whether he likes it or not.

### Sharvatunis Fortress

The eastern guardian of the Tarkhon Passage, watching the approaches from the Middle Sea.

Sharvatunis sits on Astrelle's eastern coast, positioned to intercept any fleet approaching from the east before it reaches the Needle. It's the first line of defense against naval threats from the Middle Sea kingdoms.

**Garrison**: ~300 soldiers, professional but not elite. Adequate equipment, adequate training. Good enough for a posting that rarely sees action.

**Posting**: Sharvatunis is neither prestigious nor punishing—it's simply a solid, respectable assignment. Officers serve their terms, do their jobs, and move on. Nothing exciting happens, but nothing terrible either.

**Commander**: **Captain Mira Solent**, a career officer in her forties. Competent, unambitious, and content to run a well-maintained fortress until retirement.

### Terrain and Climate

Similar to Nektuna—warm Mediterranean climate, rocky coastline, olive groves and vineyards on the hillsides. The land rises toward the Eronia Range in the south, becoming rougher and less populated as elevation increases.

### Population

Astrelle is primarily human, with smaller populations of Craven and others. The people are culturally similar to Nektuna—same language, same customs, same religion centered on the Evertorch—but they maintain a distinct identity as Astrellans rather than Nektunans.

There's a quiet resentment of vassal status among some Astrellans, particularly the old noble families who remember independence. But most have adapted. The trade benefits are real. The alternative—defiance—would be catastrophic.

### Economy

Astrelle's economy is largely agricultural—olives, wine, grain—supplemented by fishing and minor trade. The fortresses bring some economic activity, but the real money flows through Tarkhetan across the water.

Astrellans complain that they do the work while Nektuna takes the profit. This is largely true. But they also acknowledge that without Nektuna's protection, someone else would take both the work and the profit.

### The Awkward Position

Astrelle hosts two of the empire's most critical fortresses. This gives Duchess Ysmera leverage—Tarkhon needs Astrelle's cooperation to maintain control of the strait.

But it also makes Astrelle a permanent military zone. Imperial troops are always present. Imperial officers report to Tarkhetan, not to the duchess. In theory, Astrelle governs itself. In practice, the fortresses are imperial territory that happens to be surrounded by Astrellan land.

If Astrelle ever seriously considered independence, those fortresses would turn inward very quickly.
