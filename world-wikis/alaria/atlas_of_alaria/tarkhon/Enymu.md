## Enymu

Tags: state, nation

A state in Tarkhon, bordering Nektuna to the east.

### Stone Forest

On the border between Enymu and Nektuna stands the Stone Forest—an entire forest made of stone, including all of its wildlife. Every tree, every leaf, every creature within has been turned to stone by ancient magic.

Entry to the forest is forbidden by a pact long forgotten, agreed to by both Enymu and Nektuna. In the roots of the stone trees lie strange crystals known as titan crystals. When touched by sentient beings, these crystals ring out at a frequency only titans can hear—a sound that may cause Hykravones (slumbering titans) to stir. The pact exists to ensure no one disturbs the forest and risks waking these ancient powers.
