## Enymu

Tags: state, nation

The breadbasket of Tarkhon—a farming state that feeds the empire but sees little of the wealth. Bordered by the forbidden Stone Forest to the west and the Wurn Mountains to the north.

### Position and Borders

Enymu occupies the northeastern portion of Tarkhon's core territory:
- **West**: Nektuna (and the Stone Forest on the border)
- **North**: The Wurn Mountains (home to the Stone Men)
- **East**: Frontier territories, eventually leading to Kerwin
- **South**: The Tarkhon Passage (Midton Island and Ekfusy fortress lie offshore)

The state is landlocked except for a small coastal stretch in the southeast, which provides limited access to the passage but no significant harbors.

### Terrain and Climate

Temperate continental climate—warm summers, cold winters, and reliable rainfall that makes the land excellent for farming. The central lowlands are almost entirely cultivated, a patchwork of grain fields, vegetable plots, and pastures.

The terrain rises gradually toward the Wurn Mountains in the north, with rolling hills and sheep pastures in the foothills. The eastern reaches are more forested, providing timber for construction and fuel.

### Aldrichold

The capital of Enymu, sitting at the junction of the Greenway (the main road to Tarkhetan) and the river that waters the central farmlands.

Aldrichold is more large town than true city—perhaps 15,000 people, mostly involved in administration, trade, and supporting the royal household. The palace is a fortified manor house, comfortable but not grand. The Aldric kings have never seen the point of showing off.

The town has a central market, several temples (including one to the Evertorch, modestly attended), guild halls for the craftsmen, and warehouses where grain is stored before shipment to Nektuna.

### The Stone Forest

The western border between Enymu and Nektuna is marked by one of Alaria's great mysteries: an entire forest transformed into stone.

Every tree stands petrified in perfect detail—bark, branches, leaves, all gray stone. Animals caught in the transformation remain frozen: birds mid-flight, deer mid-leap, a bear eternally rising on its hind legs. The forest is silent except for wind through stone branches.

**The Forbidden Zone**: Entry to the Stone Forest is forbidden by ancient pact between Enymu and Nektuna. No one remembers exactly when the pact was made or why. Everyone knows the rule: stay out.

**The Titan Crystals**: In the roots of the stone trees grow crystalline formations that ring at a frequency only titans can hear. If disturbed by sentient touch, these crystals might wake the **Hykravones**—slumbering titans buried deep beneath the earth.

**The Wardens**: Enymu's Stone Wardens patrol the forest's borders, turning away anyone who approaches. They don't enter the forest themselves. They just make sure no one else does.

**The Pressure**: Scholars from Tarkhetan want access. They call the pact "superstition." High Warden Gellert and Lord Councillor Beren have refused. But King Selron has been pressuring King Aldric, and Aldric trusts Selron...

### The Wurn Mountains

The northern border of Enymu is defined by the Wurn Mountains—a range of peaks inhabited by the **Stone Men**, a human subculture with gray, rock-hard skin from generations of elemental exposure.

The Stone Men are serious, blunt, and pragmatic. They keep to themselves in their high valleys, herding sheep and goats, trading occasionally with lowland Enymu. Relations are generally peaceful but not warm—the Stone Men find lowlanders soft, and lowlanders find Stone Men unsettling.

Occasionally, trouble comes down from the mountains: bandits using the peaks as refuge, monsters driven from their lairs, or raids by Stone Men bands who've decided the lowlands have something worth taking. Enymu's army handles these problems, but the northern frontier is never entirely quiet.

### The Greenway

The main road connecting Enymu to Tarkhetan and the rest of Tarkhon. Well-maintained by Enymese standards (which means passable but not paved), the Greenway carries most of the grain, wool, and livestock that flows from Enymu to Nektuna's markets.

Traveling the Greenway, you pass through the heart of Enymu's farmland: villages every few miles, fields stretching to the horizon, the occasional fortified manor house where local lords administer their lands.

### The Craven Communities

Enymu's substantial Craven minority lives throughout the state, but several towns have particularly large populations:

- **Stoneheart Vale**: Named for the noble family that rose from Craven commoners, this town in the eastern hills is majority Craven and proud of it.
- **Borderwatch**: A town near the Stone Forest staffed largely by Craven Stone Wardens.

Unlike in Nektuna, Craven here face no legal discrimination. They farm, trade, serve in the army, and even hold noble titles. Craven from Nektuna sometimes emigrate for better treatment.

### Relationship with Nektuna

Enymu is loyal to Tarkhon—but that loyalty shouldn't be mistaken for enthusiasm.

The relationship is fundamentally exploitative. Enymu produces; Nektuna profits. Enymu's grain feeds Tarkhetan's population, but Nektuna's merchants set the prices. The wealth flows out, and the Enymese see little return.

King Aldric IV maintains the relationship because:
1. He genuinely believes King Selron is his friend
2. His ancestors accepted these terms
3. The alternative—defiance—seems worse

His advisors are less naive. Lord Councillor Beren handles most negotiations with Tarkhetan precisely because he doesn't trust Nektuna's envoys. Marshal Kira Stoneheart maintains Enymu's military at respectable strength because she knows that respect requires capability.

For now, Enymu remains loyal. But younger Enymese are asking questions. And someday, King Aldric will learn what Selron really thinks of him.

### Points of Interest

**The Grain Exchange**: A large warehouse complex in Aldrichold where Enymu's harvest is collected, graded, and sold to Nektuna's merchants. The prices set here determine whether Enymese farmers prosper or merely survive.

**The Old Stones**: A ring of standing stones in the northern hills, predating human settlement. The Stone Men consider it sacred. Local Enymese avoid it.

**The Warden's Tower**: High Warden Gellert's headquarters, overlooking the Stone Forest from a safe distance. Contains generations of records about the forest—and the one ancient text that explains why entry is forbidden.
