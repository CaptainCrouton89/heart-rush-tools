## Vogenfeld

Tags: state, nation

The northern shield of Tarkhon—three Uline dwarf settlements in the Wurmspine Mountains between the empire and the orcish hordes of Hedroscobb. For centuries, the dwarves have held the passes. For centuries, they've watched the Wildwood. And for decades now, they've wondered why they bother.

### Position and Borders

Vogenfeld occupies a stretch of mountains at Tarkhon's northern frontier:
- **North**: The Wildwood and the orcish territories of Hedroscobb (Glivornax most directly)
- **South**: Open land leading to Tarkhon proper
- **East**: The Wurn Mountains and Stone Men territory
- **West**: More mountains, eventually leading to Murth

The position is strategic—the passes through these mountains are the only practical route for armies moving between Hedroscobb and Tarkhon. Control the passes, and you control the invasion route.

### Terrain and Climate

The surface is harsh alpine terrain—jagged peaks, narrow passes, treacherous in winter. Snow lies on the highest peaks year-round. The passes are barely navigable even in summer.

The dwarves don't live on the surface. They live *in* the mountains, in vast tunnel complexes carved over millennia. The tunnels maintain comfortable temperatures year-round, ventilated by the elaborate chain-operated air systems that give Uline dwarves their nickname.

### The Three Settlements

**Atlangsow** — Western, largest (~5,000)

Built into a mountain overlooking the main pass between Tarkhon and the Wildwood. The great gates of Atlangsow have never fallen to enemy assault. The tunnels extend miles into the mountain, with forges, living quarters, mushroom farms, and endless passages.

The Council of Thanes meets here most often. Thane Gorveth, the eldest of the three thanes, makes his home in the deep chambers.

**Kaisa** — Central (~4,000)

Smaller on the surface, but Kaisa's tunnels extend furthest north. Secret passages emerge in the Wildwood itself, allowing scouts to observe orc movements without being seen.

Kaisa produces the best scouts and the most aggressive warriors. Thane Brunhild leads from here, always pushing for more patrols, more intelligence, more action.

**Glashof** — Eastern (~3,000)

Controls the eastern approaches where the Vogenfeld range meets the Wurn Mountains. Glashof maintains contact with the Stone Men—not allies exactly, but neighboring mountain peoples who understand each other.

Thane Keldris rules here, the youngest of the thanes and increasingly vocal about Vogenfeld's grievances.

### The Pass of Oaths

The main route through the mountains, overlooked by Atlangsow's gates. This is where the Vogenfeld Pact was sworn five centuries ago—where dwarven thanes and Tarkhon's representatives agreed that Vogenfeld would guard the north in exchange for tribute and honor.

Stone monuments line the pass, carved with the names of dwarves who died holding this ground. Thousands of names. Generations of sacrifice.

The monuments are maintained perfectly. The dwarves remember, even if Tarkhon has forgotten.

### The Tunnel Networks

The official maps show the main passages—routes for trade, travel, and defense. These are impressive enough: miles of tunnels connecting the three settlements, forges and armories, living quarters and meeting halls.

The unofficial maps show much more.

Secret tunnels extend in every direction. Emergency passages connect the settlements through routes no enemy would find. Hidden exits emerge throughout the mountains—some facing south toward Tarkhon, others facing north toward the Wildwood.

The northern tunnels are the most sensitive. Some emerge miles into orc territory, allowing scouts to gather intelligence. Others could theoretically be used to guide armies through the mountains, bypassing the defended passes entirely.

The dwarves don't talk about what those northern tunnels could be used for. But everyone knows they exist.

### The Patrols

Every day, Vogenfeld sends patrols into the Wildwood's edge. Small groups of warriors, moving quietly, watching for signs of orcish movement.

They look for:
- Unusual gatherings of orc warriors
- Signs that tribal conflicts have paused
- Any indication of coordination between the six great tribes
- Evidence that someone is trying to unite Hedroscobb

These patrols are dangerous. Orcs hunt the southern Wildwood too. Dwarves die every year on patrol duty. Their names go on the monuments.

Tarkhon doesn't know about the patrols. Tarkhon doesn't ask. Tarkhon has forgotten why the patrols matter.

### The Council of Thanes

**Thane Gorveth of Atlangsow** (eldest)

Over two hundred years old, Gorveth remembers when Tarkhon still paid proper tribute. He remembers his grandfather's stories of the last great invasion. He counsels patience because he's seen what orc armies can do and knows that Vogenfeld's duty is real, regardless of Tarkhon's failures.

But patience has limits. Even Gorveth's.

**Thane Brunhild of Kaisa**

One hundred seventy years old, Brunhild is a warrior-thane who has personally led patrols into the Wildwood. She argues that Tarkhon must be reminded of Vogenfeld's value—through negotiation if possible, through demonstration if necessary.

She's not advocating abandonment of the Pact. Not yet. But she's laying the groundwork for what comes if Tarkhon continues to ignore them.

**Thane Keldris of Glashof** (youngest)

Only ninety years old, Keldris represents a generation that has never seen orcish invasion. He knows the duty intellectually but doesn't feel it in his bones like the elders do.

Keldris asks the question others won't: If Tarkhon has broken the Pact, why should Vogenfeld honor it? Why should dwarves die for an empire that doesn't remember them?

He's been spending time in the deep tunnels lately. The northern ones.

### The Orcish Threat

North of Vogenfeld lies **Hedroscobb**—the Wildwood, an endless forest inhabited by six great orcish tribal states and countless smaller bands.

The six great tribes:
- **Hedroscobb** — Directly north, the black orcs with their corrosive iron armor; the closest and largest threat
- **Glivornax** — Beyond Hedroscobb to the northwest, the most diplomatically sophisticated; they guard the healing waters
- **Tarn** — North-central, controlling a stretch of the Grand Tolkarsus river; spirit warriors who are nearly impossible to kill
- **Uhionai** — Far northwest, the tree-bound orcs of Ryunimir Forest who become trees when they die
- **Grieb** — Northeast, the lakemen who answer to a hag queen; nobody attacks them and nobody talks about why
- **Shazuihn** — Eastern forest edge, the boar riders who raid everyone constantly

These states have warred among themselves for as long as anyone remembers. Territory, resources, honor, ancient grudges—the reasons change but the fighting continues.

This constant warfare is why Tarkhon has been safe. If the orcs ever stopped fighting each other, if they ever united, their combined strength would be overwhelming.

Recent reports from Vogenfeld patrols are concerning. Some tribal conflicts have paused. Unusual gatherings have been observed. Something is happening in Hedroscobb.

It might be nothing. The orcs have had would-be unifiers before.

But if it's not nothing, Vogenfeld will be the first to know. And the first to fall.

### Relationship with Tarkhon

The relationship is broken but not yet severed.

Vogenfeld still receives tribute from Tarkhetan—but the payments are a fraction of what they once were, delivered with contempt rather than gratitude. Young officials in Tarkhetan openly question why the empire pays "those mountain dwarves" at all.

The dwarves still patrol, still watch, still maintain the passes. But the question of how long this continues grows louder every year.

Three possible futures:
1. Tarkhon remembers its obligations, restores proper tribute, and the alliance continues
2. Vogenfeld withdraws to its tunnels, lets the patrols lapse, and waits to see what happens
3. Vogenfeld decides that if Tarkhon won't pay for protection, perhaps someone else will

The third option is unthinkable. Until recently, it was unthinkable.

### What Lies Beneath

The Uline didn't just fight surface threats. The monsters of the deep—shadereavers and worse—have always threatened the tunnels.

Vogenfeld's warriors train against these creatures as much as against orcs. The iron blades and hammers they carry are designed for close-quarters tunnel fighting, for enemies that come from below as well as above.

This means Vogenfeld's forces are uniquely versatile. They can fight on the surface in mountain terrain. They can fight underground in absolute darkness. They can hold positions that other armies couldn't reach.

If Vogenfeld ever turned those skills against Tarkhon rather than for it, the results would be devastating.

But that's unthinkable.

Isn't it?
