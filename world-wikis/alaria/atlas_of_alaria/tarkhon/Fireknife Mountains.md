## Fireknife Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

Part of the greater Wurmspine range, the Fireknife is a volcanic segment along the northwestern border of Kerwin, marking the boundary between settled Tarkhon territory and the wild lands beyond. Dangerous, unstable, and largely avoided by sensible travelers.

### Geography

The Fireknife range rises sharply from the rolling farmland of Kerwin, its peaks jagged and asymmetrical—the result of volcanic activity that has never fully ceased. The mountains smoke constantly, venting sulfurous gases from countless fissures. At night, the peaks sometimes glow red where magma approaches the surface.

The range is not as tall as some mountain chains, but what it lacks in height it makes up for in hostility. The rock is unstable, prone to sudden collapses and rockslides. Hot springs bubble in unexpected places, sometimes scalding and sometimes merely warm. Paths that were safe last month may be impassable now.

### Climate and Hazards

The Fireknife creates its own weather. Warm air rising from volcanic vents meets cooler air from the surrounding lands, producing unpredictable fog, sudden rainstorms, and occasionally ash falls when a vent becomes particularly active.

Known hazards include:
- **Sudden venting**: Fissures can open without warning, releasing superheated gas or magma
- **Unstable ground**: What looks like solid rock may be thin crust over hollow chambers
- **Toxic air**: Some valleys collect poisonous gases in concentrations that kill without warning
- **Hot springs**: Range from pleasantly warm to instantly lethal, often indistinguishable until tested

### The Shrine

Somewhere deep in the Fireknife is a shrine—old, hidden, and hungry. King Ulyas of Kerwin travels there once a year with prisoners and criminals. He returns alone.

No one else has found the shrine and returned to speak of it. Whether this is because the shrine is well-hidden or because it doesn't allow witnesses is unclear.

The halflings of Kerwin tell stories about the shrine, though they're careful about when and where. Something waits there. Something that predates Tarkhon, predates Kerwin, predates perhaps the halflings themselves. It requires blood to continue existing. Ulyas has been paying that price for nearly nine centuries.

### Wildlife

The Fireknife supports a harsh ecosystem of creatures adapted to volcanic conditions. Fire-resistant insects, heat-tolerant reptiles, and occasional fire elementals can be found on the slopes. Nothing large survives here—the environment is too hostile for creatures that can't find shelter from sudden venting.

### Travel

Travel through the Fireknife is possible but inadvisable. A few passes exist that are relatively stable, but "relatively" is doing heavy lifting. Guides who know the current state of the paths can be hired in Kerwin, though they charge substantial fees and refuse to go too deep.

No roads cross the Fireknife. Anyone who needs to reach the lands beyond goes around.

### Relationship to Other Volcanic Ranges

The Fireknife is sometimes confused with the Fleimrut Mountains to the south, which share some volcanic characteristics. However, the Fleimrut is fed by an unstable Yolus leyline and has experienced recent catastrophic eruptions (the Fleimrut Awakening). The Fireknife has no known leyline connection and maintains a more consistent—if still dangerous—level of activity.
