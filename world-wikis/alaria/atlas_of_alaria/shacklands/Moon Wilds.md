## Moon Wilds

Tags: jungle, dangerous, frontier

The Moon Wilds are where Gorath's conquest ends. West of the Poison Hills, beyond the Myublin River, stretches a jungle that has defeated every attempt to tame it. The legions that march in rarely march out. The settlers who try to establish outposts are found weeks later—or never found at all. Something lives in the Moon Wilds that Gorath cannot conquer, cannot assimilate, and barely understands.

The empire claims this territory on maps. The territory disagrees.

### Geography

The Moon Wilds occupy Gorath's western interior, a vast stretch of jungle running from the Poison Hills to the coast. The terrain is similar to the Jungles of Titania in composition—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, seasonal flooding—but somehow *worse*. The trees grow taller here, blocking more light. The vegetation is denser, more aggressive. And the wildlife... the wildlife is a problem.

The Myublin River serves as the practical border between controlled Gorath and the Wilds. East of the Myublin, the empire maintains patrols and outposts. West of it, they maintain prayers and a healthy respect for what they cannot defeat.

The jungle floor is perpetually dark, even at midday. Bioluminescent fungi and insects provide the only light in many areas, casting everything in pale blues and greens that give the region its name. When the actual moons are full, their light sometimes penetrates the canopy in scattered patches—the only times the forest floor sees natural illumination.

### The Vexlings

The Moon Wilds' most dangerous inhabitants are neither animal nor humanoid in any conventional sense. The Gorathi call them **Vexlings**—a name that captures their most terrifying ability without describing what they actually are.

#### Appearance

Vexlings roughly resemble a grotesque fusion of goblin and spider. They stand three to four feet tall on six multi-jointed legs, with two smaller manipulator limbs near what might be called a head. Their bodies are covered in coarse, dark hair that blends perfectly with the jungle shadows. But it's the face—or what serves as one—that soldiers remember in their nightmares.

Six eyes arranged in two rows of three, each eye a different size and seeming to focus independently. The eyes glow faintly in darkness, a pale silver-white that's often the first—and last—warning of a Vexling's presence. Below the eyes, mandibles frame a mouth full of needle-like teeth, constantly working even when the creature is still.

They move with unsettling fluidity, equally comfortable on the ground, climbing trees, or hanging inverted from branches. They make almost no sound when they want to be silent.

#### The Trance

What makes Vexlings uniquely dangerous is their gaze. Meeting the eyes of a Vexling—all six of them—induces a hypnotic state that soldiers describe as "falling into silver." The victim stops moving, stops resisting, stops doing anything except staring as the Vexling approaches.

The trance isn't instantaneous; it takes several seconds of eye contact to take hold. But in the dense jungle, where Vexlings can appear suddenly from any direction, those seconds are hard to find. Veterans learn to fight with eyes averted, focusing on peripheral vision, but this dramatically reduces combat effectiveness.

The trance breaks when eye contact breaks—if a companion physically shoves a victim, if the Vexling looks away, or if the victim somehow finds the will to wrench their gaze aside. The latter is rare; most victims report feeling peaceful, even welcomed, as the trance deepens.

Those who fall fully into the trance and aren't rescued simply... follow. The Vexlings lead them deeper into the jungle. What happens after that, no one has returned to report.

#### The Blood

Vexlings bleed silver-white ichor that is catastrophically corrosive. A single drop on exposed skin causes severe chemical burns. A splash can eat through leather armor in seconds. Saturating contact—falling into a pool of it, being sprayed by a dying Vexling—is typically fatal.

This makes killing Vexlings almost as dangerous as fighting them. Soldiers have learned to use spears and polearms, keeping distance when striking, and to never, ever finish a Vexling with a blade at close range. The victory over a Vexling has cost more than one soldier their hands, their face, or their life.

The blood remains corrosive for approximately an hour after leaving the body, then neutralizes into a harmless silvery residue. Some alchemists have tried to collect and preserve it—results have been universally disastrous.

#### Behavior and Intelligence

Vexlings were once thought to be animalistic—dangerous predators, but predators nonetheless, operating on instinct. Recent encounters have challenged this assessment.

They now hunt in coordinated groups, with individuals taking specific roles: scouts, flankers, trance-inducers, and strikers. They set ambushes in locations soldiers must pass. They target officers and mages first. They retreat when outmatched, regroup, and attack again at a more advantageous moment.

Something is organizing them. Whether one of their kind has risen to unusual intelligence, some external force is directing them, or they've always been this smart and simply chose to reveal it now—no one knows. The empire's scholars argue; the soldiers who face them don't care about the explanation, only the result.

Some reports suggest the Vexlings have a language—chittering vocalizations that seem to carry meaning, repeated patterns that coordinate behavior. Other reports describe strange structures deep in the Wilds: webbed domes, tunnel systems, what might be nests or might be something more deliberate. No expedition sent to investigate these sites has returned.

### The Campaign

Emperor Veramus has committed three legions to conquering the Moon Wilds over the past decade. The campaign has been, by any honest assessment, a disaster.

The jungle negates Gorath's tactical advantages. Legions can't maintain formation in dense vegetation. Supply lines stretch impossibly thin. The Vexlings don't hold territory that can be conquered—they fade into the jungle, wait for the legions to establish camps, then attack at night when the trance is hardest to avoid.

Casualty rates exceed thirty percent per deployment. Worse, many "casualties" aren't confirmed dead—they simply vanish, tranced and led away to unknown fates. This damages morale more than straightforward death; soldiers fear the Wilds in a way they don't fear enemy armies.

Current strategy focuses on containment rather than conquest. Outposts along the Myublin maintain watch for Vexling incursions into "civilized" Gorath. Patrols respond to sightings. The deep Wilds themselves are effectively ceded.

This represents an unacceptable failure by Gorathi standards—the Eternal March is supposed to advance, not stall. Veramus faces growing pressure to either achieve a breakthrough or acknowledge defeat. Neither option appeals.

### The Myublin River

The Myublin winds through the Moon Wilds before crossing into Gorathi territory, eventually joining the larger river system that drains toward the coast. Along the border stretch, the empire maintains a string of watchtowers and small forts.

The river itself is dangerous to navigate—rapids, submerged obstacles, and the ever-present threat of Vexling attack from the banks. Few Gorathi willingly travel the Myublin deeper into the Wilds. Those who must typically travel by night, hoping darkness and quiet passage will let them slip past unnoticed.

The river serves as a practical boundary not because it's impassable—Vexlings cross it regularly—but because it provides a defensible line where the empire can concentrate forces. Fighting Vexlings in the Wilds is suicide. Fighting them on cleared ground near the river is merely dangerous.

### Mysteries

The Moon Wilds hold secrets that Gorath has never uncovered:

**The Source**: Where do Vexlings come from? Are they natural creatures, magical constructs, or something else entirely? Their complete absence from any other region of Alaria suggests they're native to the Wilds specifically—but why here and nowhere else?

**The Purpose**: Why do Vexlings take tranced victims rather than simply killing them? Where do they go? Some theorize the victims are food; others suggest something darker. The lack of bodies supports neither theory.

**The Intelligence**: What changed? Why have the Vexlings become coordinated only in recent decades? Is there a leader, a hive mind, or something directing them from outside?

**The Ruins**: Deep in the Wilds, multiple expeditions have reported glimpsing structures that aren't Vexling nests—stone ruins of clearly humanoid construction, overgrown but unmistakable. Who built them? What connection do they have to the Vexlings? No one has gotten close enough to investigate and returned.

**The Light**: On certain nights, observers at the Myublin outposts report seeing lights deep in the Wilds—not the bioluminescence of the jungle or the eye-glow of Vexlings, but steady lights like fires or torches. They never move. They never go out. And they're always in different places.

### For Adventurers

The Moon Wilds offer something rare in Gorath: genuine mystery. The empire that has conquered so much knows almost nothing about what lives in its own western territories. Anyone who could venture into the Wilds, survive, and return with information would find grateful—and wealthy—patrons in Azantir.

Of course, survival is the challenge. The Vexlings kill most who enter. The jungle claims many of the rest. And whatever lies at the heart of the Wilds—whatever explains the lights, the ruins, the sudden intelligence—may be worse than all of it combined.

Heroes looking to strike at Gorath might find unlikely allies in the Wilds. The Vexlings don't distinguish between the empire's soldiers and anyone else, but they also don't pursue escaped slaves or refugees who stumble through their territory. Some whisper that the underground railroad helping slaves escape passes through the Moon Wilds—that the most dangerous route is paradoxically the safest, because even Gorath won't follow you there.
