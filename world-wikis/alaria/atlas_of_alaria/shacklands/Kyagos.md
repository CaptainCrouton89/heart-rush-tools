## Kyagos

Tags: island, state, nation

A mountainous island roughly 400 miles across, Kyagos rises from the waters between the Sea of Seven Snakes and the Alrock Ocean like a clenched fist of stone. The Aktarvkus Mountains dominate the interior—an impassable tangle of peaks, ravines, and wind-scoured passes that effectively divides the island into isolated coastal territories. This geography explains why Kyagos never unified into a single nation: four city-states emerged independently around the island's rim, each controlling its own slice of coast and whatever mountain approaches it could defend.

The Sylthik who rule these city-states measure worth in scars. Cheek-scars mark rank—one for minor distinction, five for the highest lords. Outsiders receive handkerchiefs around their necks marking them as rightless visitors. The economy runs on mining, the mines run on slaves, and for three centuries the Drasnian dwarves shipped from Gorath's Slaver's Coast have extracted Kyagos's legendary gems and metals from the deep shafts beneath the mountains.

That arrangement shattered recently. Syvlius, the largest and wealthiest city-state, burned. Slaves rose, a trade tower fell, and the Dead Moon Tribe swept down from Moonwood to finish what the uprising started. The other three city-states now face an island transformed—one quarter in chaotic ruin, the native humans emboldened, and every remaining slave watching to see what happens next.

### The Aktarvkus Mountains

The spine of Kyagos—a brutal mountain range that defeats casual crossing. Peaks here reach above the treeline into permanent snow, with passes that close entirely during storm season. The range runs roughly northeast to southwest, creating a natural barrier between the northern forests and the southern jungles.

The mountains hold Kyagos's true wealth: veins of silver, copper, and iron laced through the stone, pockets of gemstones that made the island's reputation, and deeper deposits that Drasnian miners have barely begun to tap. Mining operations cluster around the more accessible valleys, with the most lucrative shafts controlled by whichever city-state can hold them.

Travel through the Aktarvkus requires either expensive guides who know the passes, or acceptance that you're probably going to die. The Sylthik city-states maintain a few fortified routes between them, but these are jealously guarded and subject to tolls that make sea travel look economical despite Kyagos's dangerous coasts.

#### Mount Syvlia

The mountain that gave Syvlius its name—a distinctive peak visible from much of northwestern Kyagos. The city sprawled across its lower slopes before the revolution. Now smoke still rises from the ruins on clear days.

#### Mount Essel

Western peak near Vassum, notable for the road that winds around its base connecting the city to the interior passes. Vassum's guards patrol this route heavily; it's their primary overland connection to the rest of Kyagos.

#### Mount Laska

Central peak marking the rough geographic heart of the Aktarvkus. No settlements here—too remote, too difficult to supply. Local Sylthik legends claim something lives in the caves beneath Laska, something that predates their arrival on the island. The miners avoid the area.

#### Skyreach

A fortress carved into a high mountain saddle, built in a style that predates the Sylthik city-states by centuries. No one knows who constructed it or why they chose such an inaccessible location. The structure is largely intact but abandoned—reaching it requires days of climbing through treacherous terrain, and whatever value it once held apparently wasn't worth the effort of maintaining supply lines.

Scholars have noted that Skyreach sits almost exactly where multiple mountain passes converge, suggesting it once controlled movement through the Aktarvkus. Some speculate it was a toll fortress from an earlier civilization; others think it served as a watchtower or signal station. The Sylthik occasionally use it as a neutral meeting ground for inter-city negotiations, precisely because no single city-state can easily garrison it.

#### Valley of Whispers

A high mountain valley deep in the Aktarvkus, marked on maps but rarely visited. The valley earned its name from an acoustic phenomenon—sounds carry strangely here, bouncing between the surrounding peaks in ways that make distant conversations audible and nearby ones incoherent. Whispers from one end of the valley reach the other with unsettling clarity. Shouts fragment into meaningless noise.

The Sylthik consider the place cursed. The Dead Moon Tribe considers it sacred. Neither group spends much time there, but for different reasons.

Some scholars theorize the effect is purely natural—a quirk of the valley's shape and the persistent winds. Others note that the valley sits at the intersection of several minor leylines, suggesting the acoustic distortion might be a symptom of deeper planar interference. A few claim the whispers sometimes carry words that no one present actually spoke.

During the recent revolution, escaped slaves used the valley as a staging ground. The acoustic properties that unnerved their Sylthik pursuers became a tactical advantage—the rebels could coordinate across the valley floor while their enemies stumbled around unable to communicate effectively.

#### Eskagon Hills

A region of broken highlands northeast of the central peaks, where the Aktarvkus begins to descend toward the eastern coast. The terrain here is more navigable than the true mountains but still difficult—a maze of ridges, box canyons, and seasonal streams that make travel unpredictable. Sy uses the Eskagon Hills as a buffer zone against both the mountain interior and the Traevluong werewolves to the south.

### Moonwood

The great northern forest of Kyagos, stretching from the Sea of Seven Snakes coast inland to the mountain foothills. Dense canopy, ancient trees, and undergrowth thick enough to swallow armies. The Sylthik city-states never successfully colonized Moonwood—every attempt ended in disaster, ambush, or simple disappearance.

This is Dead Moon Tribe territory.

#### The Dead Moon Tribe

The humans who ruled Kyagos before the Sylthik arrived—and who never accepted their displacement. For generations they've maintained a fighting retreat into Moonwood, trading open warfare for guerrilla resistance. The Sylthik called them weakened, broken, finished. The smoking ruins of Syvlius suggest otherwise.

The tribe takes its name from Nyxara, the dark moon. Their shamans claim a special connection to Nyxara's cycles, drawing power from the nights when the dark moon dominates the sky. Their healing abilities are legendary—wounds that should kill close within hours, poisons that should be fatal become mere illness. The shamans say Nyxara accepts their pain so they may continue fighting.

Whether this is Psy magic, some form of shadow-aspected Kethic work, or something older remains unclear. What's clear is that Dead Moon warriors fight with unsettling fearlessness, knowing their healers can pull them back from injuries that would end other soldiers.

The revolution revealed what decades of low-intensity conflict obscured: the Dead Moon Tribe was never as weak as they pretended. They were waiting. When a band of outsiders arrived with a plan to free the Drasnian slaves, the tribe saw their opportunity. Dead Moon warriors poured out of Moonwood, joined the slave uprising, and helped reduce Syvlius to rubble.

Now they've retreated back to the forest, nominally. But their warriors patrol further south than they have in decades, and their shamans have been seen meeting with Drasnian leaders in the ruins. Something is being negotiated. The remaining Sylthik city-states are terrified to find out what.

#### Juniper Swamp

A fetid wetland in the heart of Moonwood, where the forest floor drops into permanent marsh. The Dead Moon Tribe uses it as a defensive barrier—outsiders who try to penetrate deep into Moonwood inevitably end up in the swamp, where they sink, sicken, or simply never emerge. The tribe knows the safe paths through. No one else does.

Local legend claims the swamp was created deliberately, flooded by Dead Moon shamans to deny the Sylthik a route into their territory. If true, it suggests capabilities the tribe has been careful to hide.

#### Xyrionn

In the northeastern edges of Moonwood, north and east of Juniper Swamp, stands Xyrionn—a giant tree stump with a maze leading to its center. The stump is all one piece of living wood, resistant to many forms of magic. A druid lives within the maze, and they will be furious if anyone attempts to burn or harm the sacred tree.

Dense overbrush prevents people from passing through the top of the maze, forcing them to navigate the deadly traps within. Only those who successfully reach the center prove themselves worthy of the druid's mentorship.

The druid's relationship with the Dead Moon Tribe is unclear. They share the forest but seem to operate independently, tolerating each other's presence without alliance or conflict.

#### Deathmarsh

Where Moonwood meets Jungula Serpentine, the terrain collapses into a stretch of poisoned wetland. The water here is discolored, the plants twisted, and the few creatures that survive are aggressive and wrong-looking. Neither the Dead Moon Tribe nor the Sylthik claim Deathmarsh—both avoid it.

Something is buried there. The corruption seeps from a central point, spreading slowly outward over centuries. Whatever it is, the Dead Moon shamans know about it and refuse to discuss it with outsiders.

### Jungula Serpentine

The northwestern peninsula, a finger of jungle extending toward the Sea of Seven Snakes. Named for the serpents that infest its waterways—some venomous, some constrictors large enough to take a man, and rumors of something larger still in the deep interior.

Vassum nominally controls Jungula Serpentine, but "control" means they patrol the coast and maintain a few logging camps. The interior belongs to the snakes and whatever else lives there. Pirates from the Sea of Seven Snakes sometimes use the peninsula's hidden coves as anchorages, and Vassum's navy—such as it is—plays an eternal game of cat and mouse with smugglers running contraband through the serpent-infested waters.

### Traevluong

The eastern coastal jungle, running from the Eskagon Hills down to the southern waters. Dense rainforest, heavy with moisture from the Alrock Ocean, where the canopy grows so thick that twilight reigns even at midday.

This is werewolf territory.

#### The Ulvsjael

The werewolves of Traevluong are not the cursed monsters of northern legend. The Ulvsjael are something older—werewolves who never transform to human form, remaining always in wolf form. They were born this way, their parents were born this way, and their ancestors have hunted these jungles since before human memory.

They are somewhat feral but not evil, living in harmony with the deep jungle. The Ulvsjael tolerate human presence at the jungle's edge but kill anyone who penetrates too deep into their territory. They don't negotiate, don't trade, don't communicate in ways the Sylthik understand. They simply enforce their borders with casual, efficient violence.

Sy has the misfortune of sharing a border with them. The city-state maintains a perpetual defensive posture along the Traevluong boundary, rotating patrols and watching for incursions. The werewolves rarely attack in force, but individual packs probe the defenses regularly, picking off isolated travelers and small parties who stray too close to the trees.

Silver helps. Sy's economy has pivoted toward silver extraction partly for this reason—a silver-bearing soldier stands a better chance against an Ulvsjael raider. But there are many werewolves in Traevluong, and even silver can't save you if you're outnumbered in the dark.

### Mythlias

The southern jungle, stretching from the Killing Hills down to the coast. Less dense than Traevluong, more varied in terrain—patches of open savanna interrupt the forest, and rivers cut navigable channels toward the sea.

Tekos draws much of its agricultural base from Mythlias. The jungle provides timber, exotic plants, and game that supplements the city-state's mine-focused economy. Farming settlements dot the northern edges where the trees thin out, though they're fortified against raids from the Killing Hills.

The Kuru live here—beast-warriors who've adapted to jungle warfare in ways that make even the Sylthik nervous. They're not numerous enough to threaten the city-states directly, but they make Mythlias dangerous for anyone traveling without armed escort.

### Killing Hills

The southern highlands between the Aktarvkus and Mythlias, where the mountains break down into a chaotic landscape of steep ridges and narrow valleys. The name is earned: these hills have killed more travelers, soldiers, and would-be settlers than any other region of Kyagos.

The Kuru beast-warriors treat the Killing Hills as sacred ground. Their warriors come here to prove themselves, hunting each other and anything else that enters. Surviving a solo journey through the Killing Hills marks a Kuru as an adult; dying there is considered an honorable fate.

For everyone else, the Killing Hills are simply an obstacle—one of several reasons why overland travel between Tekos and the western city-states rarely happens. Better to take a ship around the coast, despite the dangers, than to cross terrain where everything is trying to kill you.

### Avakus Forest

A stretch of dense woodland west of Syvlius, climbing into the mountain foothills. Before the revolution, Syvlius used Avakus Forest as a buffer zone—patrols maintained order, logging operations extracted timber, and escaped slaves who fled this direction were hunted down.

Now Avakus is contested ground. Dead Moon warriors pass through heading south. Drasnian refugees hide in its depths. Sylthik survivors from Syvlius shelter in abandoned logging camps. And the Kuru, sensing weakness, have begun probing north from the Killing Hills.

### The City-States

#### Syvlius

**Status: Destroyed**

What was the largest and wealthiest city-state on Kyagos is now a smoking ruin. The revolution didn't just overthrow the Sylthik rulers—it demolished the city itself. Buildings burned, walls were torn down, and the great trade tower that connected Syvlius to the astral current was toppled in a final act of destruction.

The city had grown around the lower slopes of Mount Syvlia, expanding outward from the original mining camps that first exploited the region's wealth. Lake Shikaya provided fresh water and a scenic centerpiece; the mines provided gems and precious metals that funded centuries of expansion. At its height, Syvlius controlled the best access to the astral current that passes roughly 35 miles east of the Aktarvkus peaks—close enough for profitable sky trade, far enough to require substantial infrastructure.

That infrastructure is gone. The trade tower's wreckage blocks what used to be the main approach to the city. The slave camps that once processed thousands of Drasnian workers have been torn apart, their materials repurposed for barricades and makeshift shelters. The mines still operate—someone is extracting wealth—but under whose authority and for whose benefit changes weekly.

##### Current State

Syvlius is controlled by Drasnians and gangs. Not a government, not even a coalition—just a chaotic patchwork of factions occupying different districts, controlling different resources, fighting each other as often as any external threat.

The heroes who led the revolution—Xe, Alice, Bryce, Woof, Bordrick, and Snuffles—have moved on. They lit the fire and left others to deal with the aftermath. Some Drasnians curse them for it; others consider them liberators regardless of what came next.

The Dead Moon Tribe maintains a presence, but they haven't occupied the city. Their warriors come and go, meeting with various Drasnian leaders, but they've retreated to Moonwood rather than trying to hold urban terrain. What they want from the alliance remains unclear.

##### Lake Shikaya

The lake still exists, now surrounded by ruins rather than palatial estates. Drasnian refugees have established camps along its shores, using the water access as a foundation for their attempts at rebuilding something functional. The lake's fish provide food; its position provides defensibility. If any organized settlement emerges from Syvlius's chaos, it will probably center here.

#### Vassum

The northwestern city-state, positioned where Moonwood meets Jungula Serpentine. Vassum has always been Kyagos's window to the outside world—the city-state most engaged with foreign trade, most tolerant of outsiders, most willing to bend the rigid Sylthik social codes when profit was involved.

The trade tower in Syvlius connected to the astral current, but goods still had to reach Syvlius somehow. Vassum controlled the sea routes, the overland passes, the warehouses where foreign cargo accumulated before the mountain crossing. This made them wealthy. It also made them dependent on Syvlius's infrastructure.

Now that infrastructure is gone, and Vassum is scrambling to adapt.

##### Post-Revolution Vassum

The city is flooded with refugees—Sylthik fleeing Syvlius, merchants whose businesses collapsed with the trade tower, opportunists hoping to profit from chaos. Vassum's traditional social order is straining under the pressure. The scar-ranking system feels increasingly absurd when five-scarred nobles sleep in warehouses alongside unscarred laborers.

Some in Vassum see opportunity. If they could establish their own connection to the astral current—build their own trade tower, find their own route through the mountains to the current's path—they could inherit Syvlius's economic position. The investment would be staggering, the engineering challenges severe, but the potential payoff enormous.

Others argue for intervention. Retake Syvlius, crush the rebellion, restore order. But Vassum's military was never strong, and the prospect of fighting through Dead Moon warriors and desperate Drasnians terrifies a population that hasn't seen real warfare in generations.

For now, Vassum waits, negotiates, and tries to maintain what trade it can through increasingly dangerous waters.

#### Tekos

The southern city-state, built on the shores of Lake Teklan where the mountains give way to Mythlias jungle. Tekos was always the most traditional of the four city-states—conservative, hierarchical, deeply invested in the scar-ranking system and the social order it represented.

The city sits roughly 35 miles from the astral current, on the opposite side of the mountains from Syvlius. Before the revolution, this was a disadvantage—Tekos had to route its exports through Syvlius's infrastructure, paying tolls and accepting dependency. Now that dependency is severed, and Tekos faces a choice: build its own connection to the astral trade, or accept permanent economic decline.

##### Post-Revolution Tekos

The city has adopted a fortress mentality. Walls are being strengthened. Slave populations are being watched more carefully than ever—any hint of unrest is crushed immediately and publicly. The Tekosi lords refuse to acknowledge that their social order might be vulnerable; instead, they double down, increasing the brutality of their rule in hopes of preventing their own Syvlius.

This is probably making things worse. The Drasnian slaves of Tekos have heard what happened in the north. They've heard that their kin now control the mines they once worked as property. Every execution, every public punishment, every reminder of their status feeds resentment that the Tekosi seem determined to ignore.

The city-state is also dealing with increased Kuru activity from the Killing Hills. The beast-warriors have noticed Kyagos's instability and are testing boundaries. Tekos can't afford to fight a two-front conflict—slaves within, Kuru without—but they may not have a choice.

##### Lake Teklan

A large freshwater lake providing Tekos with water, fish, and a natural defensive barrier on one flank. The city sprawls along its northern shore, with the wealthiest estates claiming waterfront positions and the slave quarters pushed to the margins. Boats cross the lake regularly, carrying ore from mountain mines to city refineries.

#### Sy

The eastern city-state, smallest of the four, perched between the Eskagon Hills and the Traevluong werewolf territory. Sy has always been embattled—the Ulvsjael don't recognize borders, don't negotiate truces, and don't stop probing for weakness.

This perpetual siege has shaped Sy's character. The city is militarized in ways the other city-states never needed to be. Service in the border patrols carries respect that military service elsewhere on Kyagos lacks. Silver is everywhere—weapons, jewelry, architectural details—both for practical defense and as cultural symbol.

##### Post-Revolution Sy

The chaos in Syvlius has left Sy isolated. The western route through the mountains is now contested ground; the southern route through Tekos is longer and more expensive; the sea route around the island means passing either the pirate-infested Sea of Seven Snakes or the Ulvsjael-haunted Traevluong coast.

Sy's response has been pragmatic rather than ideological. They've sent envoys to the Drasnian factions in Syvlius, not to demand restoration of the old order, but to establish trade relationships with whoever ends up in charge. They've even made cautious overtures to the Dead Moon Tribe, though those negotiations are proceeding slowly.

The Tekosi consider this treasonous. Vassum considers it premature. Sy considers it survival.

##### Kessus Lake

Eastern lake providing Sy with water and a secondary food source. Smaller than Teklan or Shikaya, but positioned to catch runoff from the Eskagon Hills. The Ulvsjael avoid the lake's immediate shores—one of the few reliable safe zones in the border region.

### Towns & Villages

The city-states don't exist in isolation. Smaller settlements dot the coasts and mountain approaches—mining camps grown into permanent towns, fishing villages that supply the cities, waypoints on the few safe routes through the interior. Most owe allegiance to whichever city-state controls their region, though that control has always been lighter than the city-states pretend.

#### Vassum's Sphere

**Eleza** — A mining town in the foothills southeast of Vassum, positioned where the road toward Mount Essel begins its climb. Before the revolution, Eleza processed ore coming down from smaller mountain operations before it continued to Vassum's warehouses. Now it's swollen with refugees who couldn't afford passage into Vassum proper.

**Eko** — Fishing village on the western coast, technically under Vassum's protection but practically independent. The villagers pay nominal tribute and otherwise ignore the city-state's existence. Their boats work the Sea of Seven Snakes despite the pirate risk—the fishing is good, and they know the coastal waters better than any raider.

**Tissen** — Southwestern coastal town near where the Jungula Serpentine peninsula meets the main island. Vassum uses Tissen as a naval outpost, such as it is—a few patrol boats watching for smugglers and pirates. The posting is considered punishment duty.

#### Syvlius's Ruins

**Shaz** — A waypoint town on the mountain roads between Vassum and Syvlius. Before the revolution, merchant caravans rested here; guards rotated through on patrol duty. Now Shaz is caught between factions—Drasnian refugees fleeing the chaos, Dead Moon patrols pushing south, and Vassum interests trying to maintain the trade route. No one's in charge.

**Eiv** — Small settlement on the approaches to Syvlius, close enough that the smoke from the burning city was visible for days. Most residents fled during the revolution. Those who remained are now under the loose authority of whatever Drasnian faction controls the nearby district of the ruined city.

**Shia** — Village on the shores of Lake Shikaya, now absorbed into the refugee camps that ring the lake. The distinction between "Shia village" and "Shikaya camps" has blurred—it's all one sprawling, chaotic settlement of freed slaves trying to build something new.

#### Tekos's Territory

**Kilum** — Town in the southern foothills where the Tyatach River emerges from the Killing Hills. Kilum exists in a state of permanent tension—Kuru raiders come down from the hills regularly, and the town's militia has more combat experience than Tekos's actual army. The Tekosi lords resent this competence.

**Vim** — Eastern town near Lake Teklan, primarily agricultural. Vim's farms feed Tekos; Tekos's guards theoretically protect Vim. Since the revolution, those guards have been pulled back to the city, leaving Vim increasingly exposed to Kuru probing from the west.

**Lus** — Southeastern settlement in the Mythlias jungle, as far from Tekos's direct control as you can get while still nominally being part of the city-state. Lus survives by trading with anyone—Tekosi merchants, Kuru hunters, even the occasional Ulvsjael who wanders out of Traevluong. The Tekosi consider this treasonous flexibility; the Lusians consider it survival.

#### Sy's Border

**Sygosa** — The largest settlement outside the four city-states, positioned on the southeastern coast where the Sygum River meets the sea. Sygosa serves as Sy's primary port—the city itself sits inland, away from the werewolf-haunted coast, so Sygosa handles maritime trade. It's a tense place, with silver worn openly and weapons never far from hand.

#### The Unaffiliated

**Istriv** — A fishing village on the far southwestern coast, in the no-man's-land between Vassum's reach and the Sea of Sighs. Istriv owes allegiance to no city-state and pays tribute to none. The villagers are poor, isolated, and stubbornly independent. They fish the dangerous waters near Viper Rapids and sell their catch to whoever shows up with coin.

### Rivers

#### Deadman's River

Flows from the western Aktarvkus down through Moonwood toward the Sea of Seven Snakes coast. Named for the bodies that occasionally wash downstream—casualties of mountain crossings, Dead Moon Tribe justice, or simple misadventure. Vassum monitors the river mouth but makes no attempt to control its upper reaches.

#### Merthcant River

Eastern drainage flowing from the Eskagon Hills through Traevluong to the Alrock Ocean. The Ulvsjael use it as a highway; Sy's patrols avoid it. Anyone traveling the Merthcant is in werewolf territory whether they acknowledge it or not.

#### Sygum River

Southeastern river connecting Kessus Lake to the coast. Sy maintains watchtowers along its length, the closest thing to a safe corridor through the eastern jungle. Even so, Ulvsjael raids hit the river settlements regularly.

#### Tyatach River

Southern river flowing through the Killing Hills to the coast west of Tekos. Theoretically navigable; practically suicidal. The Kuru consider the Tyatach theirs.

#### Mysik River

Drains the southern Aktarvkus through Mythlias to the sea. Tekos uses its lower reaches for timber transport, but the upper river passes through territory no one controls.

#### Viper Rapids

Not a river but a section of whitewater where western mountain drainage drops toward the Sea of Sighs coast. Named for the water serpents that congregate in the pools below the rapids, waiting for anything the current delivers.
