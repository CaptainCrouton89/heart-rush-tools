### Moonwood

A jungle/forest on the north side of Kyagos.

#### Juniper Swamp

A swamp within the Moonwood.

#### Xyrionn

In the northeast edges of Moonwood, north and east of Juniper Swamp, stands Xyrionn—a giant tree stump with a maze leading to its center. The stump is all one piece of living wood, resistant to many forms of magic. A druid lives within the maze, and they will be furious if anyone attempts to burn or harm the sacred tree.

Dense overbrush prevents people from passing through the top of the maze, forcing them to navigate the deadly traps within. Only those who successfully reach the center prove themselves worthy of the druid's mentorship.

### Jungula Serpentine

A jungle forest in the northwest of Kyagos, sharing a coast with the Sea of Seven Snakes.

#### Melera Skeyad

Translating to "Melera's Rest," this ancient city was dedicated to the deity Melera. The music of Melera still flows through the ruins, keeping the city supernaturally alive—a very powerful and sacred place. However, the city's power has attracted the attention of Elnir, making it both a site of wonder and danger.

### Traevluong

A jungle forest on the southeast side of Kyagos, home to the Ulvsjael—werewolves who never transform to human form, remaining always in wolf form. They are somewhat feral but not evil, living in harmony with the deep jungle.
