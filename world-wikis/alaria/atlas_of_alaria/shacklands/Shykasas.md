## Shykasas

Tags: state, nation, shacklands, alekroin

A saltwater swamp kingdom sprawling across a broken archipelago southwest of Kyagos, where the Alekroin have ruled as apex predators for millennia. The landscape is a maze of tidal channels, mangrove thickets, and flooded grasslands—terrain that would swallow armies but yields its secrets to those who evolved within it. Outsiders call it inhospitable. The Alekroin call it home.

Shykasas occupies roughly 400 miles of coastline and island chains between the Sea of Sighs to the north and the open waters to the south. The climate runs hot and humid year-round, with monsoon seasons that raise water levels by several feet and transform the interior into a vast shallow lake. During dry months, the waters recede to expose mudflats teeming with shellfish, waterfowl, and the unfortunate.

The Alekroin do not participate in the Shacklands slave trade. They have no interest in it. Their isolation is not political neutrality—it is the simple indifference of apex predators toward the squabbling of prey. Gorath's slavers give Shykasas waters a wide berth. The few who didn't learned why.

### Vila Bonsa

The capital rises from the central archipelago on wooden platforms and stone foundations driven deep into the muck. Buildings stand on stilts, connected by walkways that flood predictably with the tides. The Alekroin designed it this way. What looks like poor planning to visitors is actually architecture optimized for ambush—the water beneath the walkways is never empty.

The Palace of the Six Jaws dominates the city center, a sprawling complex where the King and the six noble houses conduct their slow, deliberate politics. Royal succession follows an ancient ritual: an egg is selected from the King's brood, incubated at precise temperatures in isolation, watched by keepers who will never see it hatch. The chosen heir grows larger, stronger, and more cunning than any other Alekroin—a process the Alekroin do not explain and outsiders do not understand.

Vila Bonsa's markets trade in swamp goods: cured hides, medicinal plants, bioluminescent algae harvested from the deeper channels, and shellfish in varieties found nowhere else. Metal is the primary import—the swamps offer little ore. Merchants who trade here learn quickly that the Alekroin do not haggle. They state a price. You accept it or you leave.

### Turiik Forest

The northern reaches of Shykasas transition from saltwater marsh to dense coastal forest where the tides still reach but the canopy blocks the sun. Turiik Forest marks the boundary between Alekroin territory and the lands beyond—a buffer zone of mangroves, strangler figs, and root systems that rise from the water like wooden cathedrals.

The Alekroin hunt here but do not settle. The forest belongs to older things—massive crocodilians that even the Alekroin treat with wary respect, and stranger creatures that surface only at night. Outsiders sometimes attempt to use Turiik as a route into Shykasas, reasoning that forest offers more cover than open water. The Alekroin find this amusing.

Several of the noble houses maintain hunting lodges at the forest's edge, where young Alekroin prove themselves against increasingly dangerous prey. Returning with a crocodilian skull larger than one's own head is considered a respectable coming-of-age achievement.

### Soso Mari

The great tidal bay that defines Shykasas's southern coast, where the archipelago opens into deeper waters. Soso Mari runs roughly 60 miles across at its widest point, shallow enough that low tide exposes vast mudflats but deep enough at high tide for ocean-going vessels—if any dared enter.

Gorath has made overtures about establishing shipping lanes through Soso Mari, which would cut travel time between the central Shacklands and the western reaches. The Alekroin have not responded to these diplomatic inquiries. Three Gorathi survey vessels have entered the bay over the past century. None returned. Gorath has not pressed the issue.

The bay teems with life. Shellfish beds cover the shallows. Schools of fish enter with the tide and become trapped in pools as the water retreats. The Alekroin harvest methodically, taking only what they need, maintaining the abundance that has fed them for generations. Foreign fishing vessels are not tolerated.

### Settlements

**Sornas** — A fishing village on the western islands, known for its shell-divers who harvest rare specimens from deeper waters. The village supplies Vila Bonsa with most of its decorative shells and pearls.

**Bixesarri** — A town on the outer archipelago where the few foreign traders permitted in Shykasas conduct their business. Alekroin rarely enter the trading posts themselves; intermediaries handle the actual exchanges.

**Erez** — A southern settlement near the mouth of Soso Mari, functioning as an informal coastwatch. The Alekroin stationed here track all vessel movements in the surrounding waters.

**Ansalonga** — A town at the edge of Turiik Forest, serving as a staging ground for hunting expeditions. Young Alekroin from across Shykasas travel here to prove themselves.

**Molleres** — An eastern settlement near the border with Lyoki Ingi Ingi. Relations with the Mudzwiti goblins of the jungle are neither friendly nor hostile—both peoples respect territorial boundaries and leave each other alone.

**Arinsal** — A central town in the archipelago's interior, notable for its extensive aquaculture pools where the Alekroin cultivate shellfish and certain medicinal plants.

### Thizun

A ruined temple complex on a small island northwest of the main archipelago, visible only at low tide. The stone architecture predates the Alekroin settlement by unknown millennia—the construction style matches no known civilization, and the carvings depict creatures that do not exist in any bestiary.

The Alekroin consider Thizun taboo. Not from fear, exactly—they simply do not go there, following a custom so old that no one remembers its origin. When asked, they say only that "the old ones told us not to." Whether this refers to their ancestors or something else entirely remains unclear.

Treasure hunters occasionally attempt to explore the ruins. Some return with strange artifacts—geometric stones that hum faintly, metal tablets inscribed with unknown scripts. Most don't return at all. The Alekroin do not interfere with these expeditions. They also do not help.

Rumors persist of something that moves in the submerged chambers when the tide rises. The Alekroin do not confirm or deny these stories. They simply don't discuss Thizun at all.
