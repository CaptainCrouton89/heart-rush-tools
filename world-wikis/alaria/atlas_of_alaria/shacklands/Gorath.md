## Gorath

Tags: region, jungle, empire

Six hundred miles of jungle. Three great rivers. A million souls. Gorath sprawls across southern Rimihuica like a green stain on the map, the largest territorial state on Alaria and one of the most aggressive. The jungle canopy stretches unbroken for hundreds of miles in places, punctuated by hill country, river valleys carved through dense vegetation, and the scattered stone cities of the Gorathi empire.

This is not wilderness in the classical sense—much of Gorath is claimed, mapped, and theoretically controlled by the empire. But "controlled" is relative when the jungle grows back faster than you can cut it. Outside the river corridors and fortress-cities, Gorath remains profoundly wild. A hundred miles of untamed canopy separates many settlements. Creatures that have never seen a human hunt in the deep green. And in the Moon Wilds, even the empire fears to tread.

### Overview

Gorath occupies the southeastern portion of Rimihuica's mainland, bounded by:
- **North**: The Myjornis Mountains, beyond which lies Nashua and the Inner Rim
- **West**: The Moon Wilds and the open water leading to the Western Isles
- **South**: The Divinity Passage and the Sea of Selegos, beyond which lies Pesalolo
- **East**: The Deserted Hills and contested borderlands with Nashua

The terrain divides roughly into three zones:
1. **The River Corridors**: Settled, civilized, economically productive
2. **The Hill Country**: Partially tamed, resource-rich, strategically important
3. **The Deep Jungle**: Wild, dangerous, and largely unexplored

### The Three Rivers

Gorath's civilization follows its rivers. The jungle is simply too dense, too hostile, and too quick to reclaim cleared land for overland travel at scale. Everything moves by water.

#### Lucenia River

The Lucenia is Gorath's spine. It flows south from the Myjornis Mountains, emerging into the jungle at Esteves and winding through the heart of the Jungles of Titania before emptying into the Divinity Passage at Azantir. This is the empire's primary artery—the route connecting the northern frontier to the capital, the highway for troops moving to the Nashua front, and the conduit for much of Gorath's internal trade.

The river is navigable for most of its length, though rapids near Pereiro require portage. During the wet season, the Lucenia swells dramatically, flooding low-lying areas and making travel faster but more dangerous.

**Major settlements along the Lucenia**: Esteves (north), Pereiro (upper-middle), numerous smaller towns, Azantir (mouth)

#### Droaz River

The Droaz runs roughly parallel to the Lucenia, further east. It drains the Purlin Hills and the central Jungles of Titania, flowing south through increasingly settled territory before reaching the coast. The Droaz valley is Gorath's logging heartland—the great bloodwood and ironwood groves that supply the empire's construction and export industries cluster along its banks.

Carvalhais, the empire's timber capital, sits on the upper Droaz. From there, log rafts float downstream to coastal mills and export docks.

**Major settlements along the Droaz**: Carvalhais (upper), Pombares, Velorasa, Bougado, Ranholas, coastal outlet

#### Torga River

The youngest of Gorath's river civilizations, the Torga drains the southeastern jungle between the Bata Nujo Hills and the Deserted Hills. It empties at Ageito, a growing port city that has become the staging ground for Gorath's push toward Nashua.

The Torga valley was largely unsettled until three generations ago, when the empire's expansion eastward demanded new supply lines. Now it bustles with military traffic, colonist barges, and the constant movement of a frontier being actively conquered.

**Major settlements along the Torga**: Ageito (mouth), numerous military outposts, scattered colonial towns

### The Hill Regions

Five distinct hill regions break up Gorath's jungle lowlands, each with its own character.

#### Poison Hills

The Poison Hills run north-south through western-central Gorath, separating the Moon Wilds from the Jungles of Titania proper. The name comes from the region's extraordinary biodiversity of toxic flora and fauna—venomous snakes, poison-dart frogs, contact-toxic plants, and flowers whose pollen induces hallucinations or worse.

Paradoxically, this makes the Poison Hills valuable. Gorathi alchemists and poisoners prize the region's resources. The cities of **Fresta** and **Recarei** in the northern hills have become centers of the poison trade, supplying everything from medicinal antidotes to assassination tools. The locals have developed partial immunities over generations—outsiders are advised to touch nothing and watch where they step.

The hills themselves are lower and more rolling than true mountains, heavily forested but with enough elevation to break the jungle canopy in places. Travel is possible but unpleasant; the locals know the safe paths.

#### Purlin Hills

The Purlin Hills occupy the center of the Jungles of Titania, running north-south between the Lucenia and Droaz rivers. These are Gorath's most civilized hills—well-mapped, crisscrossed with trails, and dotted with logging camps and small settlements.

The Purlin lumber industry supplies much of Gorath's construction needs. Slaves work the camps, felling trees under legion guard, while Gorathi overseers manage the operations. It's brutal work in brutal conditions, but the empire's appetite for timber is endless.

#### Bata Nujo Hills

East of the Droaz River, the Bata Nujo Hills mark the transition from core Gorathi territory to the expanding frontier. These hills are more rugged than the Purlins, with deeper valleys and denser vegetation. Several mid-sized towns dot the region, serving as waypoints between the Droaz and Torga watersheds.

The Bata Nujo are known for mineral wealth—iron, copper, and occasional silver deposits that the empire exploits through mining operations. Slave labor, again, does the dangerous underground work.

#### Deserted Hills

The Deserted Hills run along Gorath's eastern edge, forming a natural buffer between the empire and Nashua. The name is misleading—they're not empty, but they are sparsely populated compared to the rest of Gorath. The combination of difficult terrain, proximity to the Nashua front, and lack of major rivers has discouraged settlement.

Military outposts dot the hills, watching for Ix'Vasyla incursions. The few civilians who live here are either too stubborn to leave or engaged in activities that benefit from the lack of imperial attention—smuggling, primarily, but also refuge for escaped slaves making their way toward Nashua.

### Major Cities

Gorathi cities rise from the jungle like stone monuments to conquest. Architecture favors massive stepped pyramids, broad stone plazas, and walls thick enough to resist both siege engines and the jungle's relentless growth. Every city maintains its Pillar of Conquest at the center, a slave market, and military barracks sized to house the legions.

#### Azantir

The capital. Where the Lucenia River empties into the Divinity Passage, Azantir sprawls across both banks in a maze of pyramids, canals, and markets. This is the largest city in the Shacklands—estimates put the population at over 200,000, though accurate counts are impossible given the Skaag warrens below and the constant flow of slaves through the markets.

The Emperor's Palace crowns the city's highest pyramid, offering views across the entire urban expanse. Below it, the Imperial Plaza can hold fifty thousand for speeches, festivals, or public executions. The great Pillar of Conquest here stands over two hundred feet tall, covered in names too numerous to read.

Azantir's docks never sleep. Slave ships arrive from Tamadrez. Timber rafts float down from upriver. Trade goods flow in from across Alaria, drawn by Gorath's colossal economy. If it can be bought or sold, Azantir has a market for it.

#### Esteves

The northern gateway. Esteves guards the point where the Lucenia River emerges from the Myjornis Mountains, controlling access to the passes beyond. This is a fortress-city first and a population center second—soldiers outnumber civilians, and the entire urban plan is designed for defense.

The Esteves garrison maintains watch over three separate threats: giants from the northwest, potential Nashua flanking maneuvers, and whatever might come through the mountain passes from the Inner Rim. Emperor Veramus earned his epithet here, holding the Esteves Pass against a giant assault for forty-three days without reinforcement.

#### Carvalhais

The timber capital. Carvalhais sprawls along the upper Droaz, a city that smells of sawdust, industry, and the sweat of slaves. The great lumber mills here process logs floated down from camps throughout the Purlin Hills, cutting and treating wood for construction, shipbuilding, and export.

This is a working city, without the grandeur of Azantir or the martial pride of Esteves. The wealthy timber merchants who run Carvalhais care more about board-feet than glory. But their wealth funds legions, and that makes them powerful.

#### Ageito

The eastern anchor. Ageito sits where the Torga River meets the sea, a newer city that has grown rapidly as Gorath pushes toward Nashua. The docks here handle military supplies for the eastern front; the barracks house troops rotating to and from the fighting.

Ageito has a frontier energy that older Gorathi cities lack—fortunes being made and lost, opportunities for the ambitious, and a willingness to overlook questions about one's past. It's also the most diverse city in Gorath, with significant populations of assimilated peoples from the empire's various conquests.

#### Interior Cities

**Pereiro**: Upper Lucenia, below the rapids. A transfer point where river cargo must be portaged around dangerous waters. Smaller than the coastal cities but strategically vital.

**Pombares**: Central Droaz valley. A market town serving the logging camps and mining operations of the Purlin and Bata Nujo Hills.

**Velorasa**: Lower Droaz. Known for its shipyards, which build the river craft that keep Gorath's economy moving.

**Bougado**: Junction town where overland routes from the Poison Hills meet the Droaz River trade.

**Ranholas**: Southern Droaz, near the coast. A secondary port handling overflow from Azantir's crowded docks.

**Fresta**: Northern Poison Hills. Center of the poison and alchemical trade.

**Recarei**: Poison Hills. Sister city to Fresta, specializing in antidotes and medicinal applications of the region's toxic bounty.

### The Wilds Between

Between the river corridors and fortress-cities, between the hill towns and logging camps, stretches the jungle. Hundreds of miles of it. This is not the tamed forest of civilized lands—this is primordial growth that has never been cleared, home to creatures that have never seen a human, and pathways that exist only in the memories of those who've walked them.

Travel through the deep jungle is measured in weeks, not days. Trails exist, but they're narrow, prone to flooding, and require constant maintenance against the vegetation's relentless advance. Most Gorathi never venture more than a day's walk from the rivers. Those who do are soldiers, scouts, escaped slaves with nowhere else to go, or fools who will become food for something.

The jungle sustains Gorath—its timber, its exotic resources, its very identity as a people who conquered the unconquerable. But the jungle also defines Gorath's limits. The empire can claim six hundred miles of canopy. Actually controlling it remains another matter entirely.

### Myublin River

A smaller river flowing through the Moon Wilds, the Myublin is notable primarily as a boundary marker. East of the Myublin, you're in Gorathi territory. West of it, you're in the Wilds proper. The distinction matters to the soldiers who patrol the river's edge, watching for Vexling incursions. It matters less to the creatures who don't recognize borders.
