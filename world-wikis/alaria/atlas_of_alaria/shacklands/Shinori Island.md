## Shinori Island

Tags: island, geography, shacklands, dragon

The largest island in the northern Pesalolo archipelago, and the lair of Agtakkeri the Flayed Banner. Shinori sits between Pukot Island to the north and the Liki Forest island to the south, commanding the waters that Gorathi ships must traverse to reach the northern Tamadrezan coast.

No one lives on Shinori by choice.

### Geography

Shinori is roughly fifteen miles long and eight miles wide, a volcanic remnant rising steeply from the sea. The western face slopes gradually toward a rocky beach; the eastern face drops in sheer cliffs to the water. Dense jungle covers the interior, fed by rainfall that the island's central peak wrings from passing clouds.

The coastline is mostly inaccessible—cliffs, rocks, and violent surf make landing difficult everywhere except a few protected coves on the western shore. These coves are where Agtakkeri brings its prey.

### The Lair

Agtakkeri's lair occupies a network of sea caves on the eastern cliff face. The caves are accessible only at low tide by swimming through flooded tunnels, or by approaching from the air—neither option practical for most visitors. The cave system extends deep into the island's volcanic core, with chambers above and below the waterline.

The dragon has occupied this lair for at least six centuries, possibly longer. The caves show signs of deliberate modification—passages widened, chambers smoothed, defensive chokepoints created. Agtakkeri has made the lair specifically defensible against the dragonslaying expeditions it knows will continue coming.

The main chamber, by the accounts of the few who have seen it and survived, contains Agtakkeri's ledger: the physical record of its centuries-long vendetta against Gorath. Ship figureheads line the walls. Preserved banners hang from the ceiling. Bones—some arranged, some scattered—cover the floor in drifts. The dragon knows the origin of every trophy.

### The Western Shores

The coves on Shinori's western coast are killing grounds.

When Agtakkeri takes prisoners from Gorathi ships, it brings them here. The rocky beaches show evidence of prolonged occupation: fire pits, restraint points carved into the stone, dark stains that the tide never quite washes away. Fishermen from Pukot Island have heard screaming carry across the water for days after an attack.

The dragon asks its prisoners questions. Names. Ranks. Family connections. It particularly wants to know if any are descended from the Veryx bloodline—the dragonslayer dynasty that scarred its eye. Those prisoners receive special attention.

### Survivors

Occasionally, escaped slaves wash up on Shinori after surviving one of Agtakkeri's attacks on slave ships. They jumped overboard before the dragon's arrival and swam until they hit land.

These survivors find themselves in a strange situation. Agtakkeri ignores them completely. They are not Gorathi. They are not interesting. The dragon's territorial instincts apparently don't extend to shipwrecked individuals crawling up its beaches.

But surviving on Shinori is difficult. The jungle provides food and water, but the island offers no easy escape. Building a raft capable of reaching Pukot Island—visible on clear days to the north—takes time and materials. Some survivors have spent weeks on Shinori before escaping, hiding in the interior whenever Agtakkeri returns from a hunt, listening to the screaming from the western coves.

Those who make it to Pukot tell stories that spread through the underground railroad networks. Shinori has become an accidental waystation for the desperate—terrible to endure, but better than the alternative.

### The Skinning Grounds

The waters around Shinori, extending south toward the Tamadrezan coast and east toward Divinity Passage, are called the Skinning Grounds by Gorathi sailors. Naval maps mark the area with a simple skull. Vessels flying Gorathi colors do not enter this zone except under direct imperial orders—and those orders come rarely.

This creates a de facto safe corridor for small boats fleeing north from the Slave Coast. Gorathi patrol vessels won't follow into the Skinning Grounds. If escapees can make it past Slavewatch and reach the northern coast, they can sail for the archipelago knowing the dragon will ignore them while hunting their pursuers.

The irony is not lost on anyone. Agtakkeri has saved more escaped slaves than any underground railroad—not because it cares about them, but because killing Gorathi is more important.

### Pukot and Liki Forest

The other major islands in the archipelago maintain a careful distance from Shinori.

**Pukot Island** lies to the north, separated from Shinori by a strait roughly five miles wide. A small fishing community lives there, descendants of Tamadrezans who settled the island centuries ago. They keep their boats small, their profile low, and their relationship with the mainland minimal. When survivors from Shinori arrive on makeshift rafts, Pukot's fishermen take them in without asking questions. The dragon has never attacked them. They intend to keep it that way.

**Liki Forest island** lies to the south, named for the dense woodland covering its entire surface. The island is uninhabited and largely unexplored. Fishermen avoid it—not because of the dragon, but because the currents around Liki are unpredictable, and the forest has a reputation. What that reputation involves, the fishermen don't specify. They just don't go there.

### Hooks

- **The Survivor's Tale**: A Drasnian dwarf survived weeks on Shinori before escaping to Pukot. They know the island's layout, Agtakkeri's patterns, and the location of something they saw in the jungle—something that predates the dragon. They want help retrieving it.

- **Into the Lair**: Someone needs something from Agtakkeri's trophy collection—a ship's log, a specific banner, evidence of what happened to a particular vessel. Getting in and out without disturbing the dragon will require perfect timing and significant luck.

- **Liki Forest**: The fishermen's warnings about Liki are vague but consistent. Something lives in that forest. With Agtakkeri's territory so close, investigating seems suicidal—which is exactly why no one has done it.

- **The Pukot Question**: The fishing community has survived near Agtakkeri for generations. How? The dragon ignores them, but why? Some suspect an old arrangement. Others think the community has been compromised. The truth might be simpler—or much more complicated.
