# Shacklands

## Geography

The Shacklands are not a single contiguous territory but rather a collection of southern regions united by their participation in the slave trade. The name comes from the shackles worn by enslaved dwarves—a grim legacy that defines the region's character. These scattered territories stretch across the southern reaches of Rimihuica, from the mainland jungles to distant island chains.

### The Concept

Unlike other regions defined by geography, the Shacklands are defined by economy and practice. States belong to the Shacklands not because they share borders but because they share in the brutal commerce of slavery. This makes the region's boundaries fluid and political rather than natural.

### Major Territories

#### Gorath

The largest Shacklands state on the mainland, covering the Jungles of Titania and surrounding territories. Gorath lies:
- South of the Cloud Mountains
- East of the Thunder Plains
- Contains the Moon Wilds, home to six-eyed goblin-spider creatures with corrosive blood

#### Kyagos

A mountainous, cloud-shrouded peninsula in the far southeast—almost island-like in its isolation. Kyagos is covered in peaks and perpetual mist, containing numerous city-states (Tekos, Syvlius, Sy, Vassum) and jungle territories. It lies south of Phyrexes, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes.

#### Tamadrez

The state covering Pesalolo, a large island in the far south separated from the mainland by the Sea of Selegos. This island marks the southern extent of the Shacklands' reach.

### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: Separates the mainland from Pesalolo island
- **Deaddorf Strait**: A passage within the Shacklands region
- **Cindrak Sea**: Southern waters
