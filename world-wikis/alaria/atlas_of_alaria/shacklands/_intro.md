# Shacklands

## Geography

The Shacklands are not a single contiguous territory but rather a collection of southern regions united by their participation in the slave trade. The name comes from the shackles worn by enslaved dwarves—a grim legacy that defines the region's character. These scattered territories stretch across the southern reaches of Rimihuica, from the mainland jungles to distant island chains.

### The Concept

Unlike other regions defined by geography, the Shacklands are defined by economy and practice. States belong to the Shacklands not because they share borders but because they share in the brutal commerce of slavery. This makes the region's boundaries fluid and political rather than natural.

The slave trade provides the economic glue holding these disparate territories together. Tamadrez supplies the labor—primarily Drasnian dwarves, though other peoples are caught in the system too. Gorath provides the demand, the military muscle, and the infrastructure. Smaller states participate as middlemen, suppliers, or simply beneficiaries of the wealth that flows through the region.

### Major Territories

#### Gorath

The dominant power of the Shacklands and the largest territorial state on Alaria. Six hundred miles of jungle, three great rivers, and over a million souls organized into a militaristic empire that has spent three centuries conquering its neighbors and shows no sign of stopping.

Gorath occupies the southeastern mainland, bounded by:
- **North**: The Myjornis Mountains, beyond which lies Nashua and the Inner Rim
- **West**: The Moon Wilds—Gorath's most dangerous frontier
- **South**: The Divinity Passage and the Sea of Selegos
- **East**: Contested borderlands with Nashua

Key features include:
- **Jungles of Titania**: The settled heartland between the Lucenia and Droaz rivers
- **Moon Wilds**: A haunted jungle that has defeated every attempt at conquest
- **Divinity Passage**: The maritime highway connecting Gorath to the slave trade
- **Azantir**: The capital, largest city in the Shacklands

Gorath operates as a military republic with elected emperors chosen from successful generals. The empire's core values—glory, conquest, discipline, assimilation—have created a state that grows stronger with every victory, absorbing conquered armies into its own legions.

#### Kyagos

A mountainous, cloud-shrouded peninsula in the far southeast—almost island-like in its isolation. Kyagos is covered in peaks and perpetual mist, containing numerous city-states (Tekos, Syvlius, Sy, Vassum) and jungle territories. It lies south of Phirexes, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes.

#### Tamadrez

The source of the slave trade. Tamadrez covers Pesalolo, a large island in the far south separated from the mainland by the Sea of Selegos. The island's Drasnian dwarves have become the primary commodity of the Shacklands economy—a grim distinction that has shaped their entire society.

The relationship between Tamadrez and Gorath is exploitative but stable: Gorath operates the Slaver's Coast on Pesalolo's southern shores, taking slaves while leaving the north nominally independent. This arrangement persists only because Gorath finds it more profitable than outright conquest—for now.

### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: Separates the mainland from Pesalolo, crossed regularly by slave ships
- **Divinity Passage**: The main maritime corridor connecting Gorath to the outside world
- **Deaddorf Strait**: A passage within the Shacklands region
- **Cindrak Sea**: Southern waters

## Political Climate

The Shacklands lack unified governance—they're defined by participation in slavery, not political allegiance. However, Gorath's dominance creates a de facto hierarchy:

**Gorath** sets the terms. Their military power, economic might, and willingness to use both give them effective control over the slave trade and significant influence over neighboring states. They don't rule the Shacklands, but they shape it.

**Tamadrez** provides the supply. Their relationship with Gorath is unequal but stable—cooperation keeps them independent, and the threat of Gorath's military ensures compliance.

**Smaller participants** fill specialized roles: brokers, transporters, secondary markets. They profit from the system while lacking the power to challenge it.

The result is an economic zone masquerading as a region. States that have nothing else in common share the taint of slavery—and the wealth it generates.

## What Makes It Interesting

The Shacklands offer moral complexity that most fantasy settings avoid. This is not a simple evil empire to be defeated; it's a system with participants at every level, from the emperors who profit most to the merchants who profit enough to look away to the slaves who sometimes cooperate for survival. Heroes here face hard choices:

- **Opposing slavery means opposing prosperity.** Gorath's economy would collapse without slave labor. What happens to the people who depend on that economy?
- **Freeing slaves means endangering them.** Escaped slaves face the jungle, the sea, or recapture. Where do they go? Who helps them?
- **Justice requires violence.** The system won't reform peacefully. Is revolution better than stability?

The Shacklands are also intensely physical places—massive jungles, dangerous waters, fortress-cities rising from impossible terrain. Adventure here means facing environments as hostile as any enemy.

## What Will Go Wrong

The system is stable but not static. Several pressure points threaten to destabilize the Shacklands:

**The Moon Wilds are stirring.** Something is organizing the Vexlings, transforming scattered predators into coordinated threats. If they break through the Myublin line, Gorath faces a war on yet another front.

**Emperor Veramus is aging.** He's sixty-three and has held power longer than any recent predecessor. When he dies, the succession crisis will be spectacular—and bloody.

**External powers are watching.** The dwarves of Trømgar object to Gorath's treatment of their Drasnian kin. The Nashua conflict drags on. Somewhere, someone is planning to disrupt the slave trade.

**The enslaved remember.** Three centuries of slavery have not broken the Drasnian spirit. Escape networks operate despite Slavewatch. Resistance movements simmer. One day, something will ignite.

The Shacklands are a powder keg. The only question is what—or who—provides the spark.
