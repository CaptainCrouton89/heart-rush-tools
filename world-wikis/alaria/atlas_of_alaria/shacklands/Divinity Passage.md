## Divinity Passage

Tags: strait, waterway, trade route

The main maritime highway connecting Gorath to the outside world—and the primary route for the Tamadrez slave trade. The Passage cuts between the Gorathi mainland and the scattered islands to the south, providing sheltered waters for the endless traffic of merchant vessels, slave ships, and naval patrols that keep the empire's economy moving.

The name is ancient, predating Gorath itself. Local legend claims the passage was carved by a god fleeing some primordial catastrophe, though which god and what catastrophe varies by telling. The Gorathi have adopted the name without the mythology—to them, it simply describes the route that brings divine favor in the form of endless labor.

### Geography

The Divinity Passage runs roughly east-west, connecting the Sea of Selegos in the south to the open waters leading toward the Western Isles. At its narrowest point, the passage spans approximately fifteen miles; at its widest, nearly forty. The waters are generally calm compared to the open ocean, protected by the mainland to the north and island chains to the south.

Several features define the passage:

**The Narrows**: The tightest stretch, where Gorath maintains permanent naval presence. Any ship passing through submits to inspection—pirates, smugglers, and unauthorized slavers are dealt with harshly. The Narrows also serve as the empire's first line of naval defense; enemy fleets would have to force this chokepoint to threaten Azantir directly.

**Azantir Roads**: The broad anchorage at the passage's northern shore, where the Lucenia River empties into the strait. Hundreds of vessels anchor here at any given time—more during trading season. The docks of Azantir extend into the Roads, creating a maze of piers, floating markets, and moored ships that never truly sleeps.

**The Southern Shallows**: A hazardous stretch near the passage's western mouth, where sandbars and submerged rocks have claimed countless ships. Pilots who know the safe channels charge premium fees; those who try to navigate alone often join the wrecks.

### The Slave Route

Every week, slave ships make the crossing from the Slaver's Coast on Pesalolo to the markets of Azantir. The journey takes three to five days depending on weather and cargo. The ships are purpose-built for their grim trade: shallow draft for navigating coastal waters, multiple decks configured to pack human cargo efficiently, and holds designed to be hosed clean between voyages.

The conditions below decks are precisely calculated: enough space to prevent the enslaved from dying en masse (dead cargo earns nothing), but not an inch more. Drasnian dwarves, being shorter than humans, are packed even more densely. Mortality rates run between five and fifteen percent per voyage, considered acceptable by the slavers' brutal arithmetic.

At peak season, as many as thirty slave ships work the passage simultaneously. The traffic is so regular that the sound of chains has become background noise for Azantir's dockworkers.

### Other Traffic

Slavery dominates the passage, but it's not the only trade:

**Timber**: Log rafts and lumber barges heading south for export, processed wood returning as finished goods.

**Exotic Goods**: The rare resources of the Gorathi jungle—bloodwood, witchbark, azure orchids, alchemical ingredients—flow out through the passage to markets across Alaria.

**Military Logistics**: Troops, supplies, and equipment moving to and from the Slaver's Coast operations, or heading toward the naval patrols that keep the passage secure.

**Legitimate Commerce**: Despite its reputation, the passage also carries ordinary trade. Merchants from the Western Isles, the Middle Sea, and beyond bring goods to Azantir's markets, drawn by Gorath's immense purchasing power.

### The Passage Patrol

Gorath maintains a permanent naval squadron in the Divinity Passage, headquartered at **Fort Selegos**, a island fortress commanding the Narrows. The Passage Patrol's responsibilities include:

- Inspecting vessels for contraband (primarily unauthorized slaves—Gorath tolerates no competition in its core industry)
- Suppressing piracy (though some pirates operate with tacit Gorathi approval, preying on rival nations' shipping)
- Preventing slave escapes (boats fleeing north from Tamadrez are hunted ruthlessly)
- Defending against naval incursions (no enemy fleet has forced the Narrows in living memory)

Patrol captains wield significant authority within the passage. A captain who decides a ship is suspicious can impound it, interrogate its crew, and confiscate cargo without appeal. This power invites corruption—bribes to overlook questionable cargo are a regular cost of doing business—but the patrol remains effective enough to maintain Gorath's control over the strait.

### What the Name Means

To Gorathi merchants and sailors, the Divinity Passage is simply the route to wealth. The name is traditional, unremarked, like a street called "King's Road" long after anyone remembers which king.

To the enslaved who cross it in chains, the name is bitter irony. Some call it "Divinity's Mockery" or "the Gods' Shame." Drasnian dwarves have another name entirely in their own tongue, one that translates roughly to "the Drowning Path"—a reference both to the passage's waters and to the death of hope that the crossing represents.

To abolitionists and those who oppose the slave trade, the passage represents everything wrong with Gorath: the systematic, industrialized evil that the empire has built its prosperity upon. Disrupting the passage—whether through piracy, sabotage, or somehow convincing other powers to blockade it—remains a dream for those who would see the trade ended.

### Navigation

The passage is well-charted but not without hazards:

- **Seasonal storms** can make the western approaches dangerous, particularly during the wet season
- **The Southern Shallows** claim several ships yearly despite the best efforts of pilots
- **Currents** at the Narrows run fast and unpredictably; sailing against them requires expert handling
- **Traffic congestion** at Azantir Roads creates its own dangers, as ships jostle for anchorage and dock space

Most captains consider the passage routine sailing compared to open ocean crossings. The real dangers are political, not nautical: getting on the wrong side of the Passage Patrol can end a career—or a life—faster than any storm.
