## Slavewatch

Tags: fortress, poi, tamadrez, shacklands

A Gorathi fortress carved into the central Freedom Mountains, overlooking the Slaver's Coast and the shipping lanes that connect the slave ports to Divinity Passage. Slavewatch was built to monitor the mountain passes and prevent escaped slaves from reaching the northern coast. After two centuries, it has become something else entirely: a corrupt institution that profits from both sides of the trade it ostensibly polices.

### Purpose

Officially, Slavewatch exists to:
- Monitor the mountain passes connecting north and south Tamadrez
- Intercept escaped slaves attempting to flee through the highlands
- Report escape network activity to Gorathi authorities
- Provide a Gorathi military presence deep in Tamadrezan territory

In practice, Slavewatch does all of these things—inconsistently, selectively, and for a price.

### The Arrangement

The fortress garrison has been stationed here for generations. Soldiers rotate in from Gorath, but the command structure has become hereditary in all but name. The current commander, **Tribune Kassander Volso**, inherited the post from his father, who inherited it from his.

Kassander understands something his distant superiors in Azantir do not: Slavewatch's power comes from being *necessary* to everyone.

**For Gorath**: Slavewatch reports enough captured escapees to justify its existence. It identifies enough underground railroad contacts to demonstrate vigilance. It never catches *all* the escapees, of course—that would end the problem and end the posting.

**For the northern villages**: Slavewatch looks the other way for the right price. A village can pay a "navigation fee" and Kassander's patrols will coincidentally be elsewhere when escaped slaves move through. The fortress takes bribes in coin, goods, and information.

**For the slavers**: Slavewatch provides intelligence on which coastal towns are accepting new cargo and which are temporarily "full." Captains who donate generously to the garrison's "comfort fund" receive favorable docking assignments and advance warning of inspection schedules.

**For the escapees themselves**: Some make it through the passes because Slavewatch was bribed. Others are captured because someone paid more. The system is arbitrary, cruel, and—from Kassander's perspective—beautifully profitable.

### The Fortress

Slavewatch occupies a spur of the Gesichi Mountains where three major passes converge. The original structure was Drasnian—a watchtower from before the Gorathi arrival—but two centuries of expansion have transformed it into a substantial fortification. Walls of local stone blend into the mountainside. The main keep commands views of all three passes and the coastal lowlands beyond.

The garrison numbers approximately two hundred soldiers, though this fluctuates. Most are Gorathi regulars on extended "frontier posting"—a punishment detail in theory, a profit opportunity in practice. Veterans request assignment here. Kassander only accepts soldiers he can trust to keep their mouths shut.

Beneath the fortress, the Drasnian tunnels remain partially intact. These passages predate Gorathi occupation and extend deep into the mountain. The garrison uses them for storage, but older sections have been sealed. What the original builders were doing inside the mountain, the current occupants prefer not to investigate.

### Commander Volso

Tribune Kassander Volso is fifty-three years old, heavyset, and smarter than he appears. He speaks fluent Drasnian (unusual for a Gorathi officer) and has lived on Pesalolo for his entire adult life. His wife was a Tamadrezan woman who died in childbirth; his son serves in the garrison.

Kassander's loyalty is to Kassander. He wears Gorathi colors because Gorath pays his salary and could crush him if sufficiently motivated. He takes bribes from northerners because they pay well and he genuinely finds the slave trade distasteful—not morally, just aesthetically. He's seen what the ships look like inside.

He has no intention of ending the system. He has every intention of dying rich.

Emperor Veramus suspects Slavewatch is corrupt but lacks proof and—more importantly—lacks a better alternative. Replacing Kassander would require finding someone both competent enough to manage the passes and incorruptible enough to actually do the job. Such people exist, but they tend to die of "mountain fever" before their first year ends.

### The View

From Slavewatch's upper battlements, on a clear day, you can see the Slaver's Coast stretching east toward Divinity Passage. The shipping lanes are visible as a dark thread across the water—the constant traffic of vessels moving between the coastal ports and Azantir.

Looking north, the Freedom Mountains continue their spine-like march across the island. The passes disappear into highland jungle. Somewhere in those passes, at any given moment, someone is fleeing for their life.

The garrison watches both directions. They place bets on which ships will make it through Agtakkeri's territory. They speculate about which villages will be next to receive a "navigation fee" request. They do their jobs, more or less, and they go home rich.

### Hooks

- **The Honest Officer**: A new sub-commander arrives from Azantir with orders to clean up Slavewatch. Kassander needs the problem solved quietly. The party could help either side—or play them against each other.

- **The Sealed Tunnels**: Something is moving in the old Drasnian passages. The garrison has heard sounds. Kassander wants it investigated before he has to report it to anyone official.

- **The Price of Passage**: The party needs to move escaped slaves through the mountains. Kassander will deal—but his price isn't gold. He wants information about the underground railroad's network. Giving it to him means selling out future escapees.

- **The Emperor's Spy**: Veramus has finally sent someone to investigate Slavewatch properly. The spy's cover is convincing. The party might be hired to protect them—or to expose them before they report back.

- **Kassander's Insurance**: The commander has kept records of every bribe, every looked-the-other-way, every Gorathi official who took money to ignore what Slavewatch really does. If he dies, those records go public. Someone wants to find and destroy them before that happens.
