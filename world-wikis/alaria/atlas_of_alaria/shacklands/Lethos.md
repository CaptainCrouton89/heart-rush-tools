## Lethos

Tags: state, nation, jungle, shacklands

A waterlogged jungle peninsula extending south into the Sea of Sighs, Lethos is one of the smallest and strangest states in the Shacklands. Its five thousand inhabitants—Faeja, Darklings, druids, and the changed folk of Qlyp Augo—live scattered across seven villages in a land that is as much water as earth. The jungle here grows from standing pools; the trees rise from brackish floods; the paths between villages are more canoe routes than roads.

Travelers from Gorath speak of Lethos with a particular silence. The empire's archives note it as "tribute-exempt, do not garrison," and no Gorathi soldier has set foot past the border in three hundred years. The official explanation is that Lethos has nothing worth taking—no farmland, no ore, no population worth assimilating. The unofficial explanation is older, stranger, and spoken only in certain taverns after too much wine: *the jungle remembers*.

### The Binding of Qlyp Augo

Three centuries ago, Gorath did conquer Lethos.

The Fourth Legion crossed the border in the dry season of 412 PR, meeting little resistance. The Faeja melted into the deep jungle; the Darklings retreated into caves and ruins. Within two years, the empire had established a provincial capital at what is now Qlyp Augo—stone towers rising from filled swampland, administrative buildings, a garrison of three thousand, and the families and merchants who followed any Gorathi occupation.

For forty years, the occupation held. The jungle was difficult, the natives elusive, but the province was stable enough. Reports to Azantir mentioned minor incidents: soldiers who wandered off patrol and weren't found, strange sounds at night, a persistent sense of being watched. Nothing actionable.

The druids changed that.

The Faeja and Darklings couldn't win a conventional war—they were too few, too scattered, too poorly armed. But the druids who lived among them remembered older ways. They proposed a ritual that would bind the souls of the dying to the land itself. Every Gorathi who died in Lethos would not pass on. They would become part of the jungle—their hatred, their fear, their final moments woven into the trees and water and darkness.

The Faeja elders agreed. The Darklings provided the darkness. The druids began the Binding.

It took forty years because that's how long it took for enough soldiers to die.

The change was gradual. Patrols reported that the jungle felt *wrong*—trees in different positions than yesterday, familiar paths leading to unfamiliar places. Soldiers woke screaming from dreams of drowning, of being pulled into the earth, of faces they recognized pressed against the inside of bark. The darkness the Darklings commanded grew deeper, and things moved in it that weren't Darklings.

Then came the Night of Roots.

The provincial records end on the 15th of Third Quarter, 452 PR. The next morning, Gorathi scouts from a border outpost found Qlyp Augo silent. Every building stood intact. Every door was closed. Inside, nothing—no bodies, no blood, no signs of violence. Three thousand people simply *gone*. The only trace was the roots. Roots had grown up through the stone floors overnight, threading through every room, and when the scouts looked closely, they found the roots had shapes. Hands. Faces. The impression of screaming mouths.

The survivors—a few hundred who'd somehow been changed rather than taken—emerged from the swamps days later. They were no longer fully human. The jungle had accepted them as its own. They became the Gillykin.

Gorath does not speak of what happened at Qlyp Augo. The provincial records were sealed, then lost, then deliberately destroyed. But somewhere in the military archives in Azantir, there is a single standing order: *Lethos is forbidden.*

### The Watching Council

Lethos is governed by what outsiders call an "open council," but the locals call the Vigil. Representatives from each of the seven villages meet at Xyrionn twice yearly—more often in times of crisis—to coordinate the ongoing maintenance of the Binding.

The Binding requires tending. The souls woven into the jungle strain against their imprisonment, especially during the double-new moons of Hollownight. The seven villages are positioned at key points along the peninsula where the Binding's weave is thinnest, and each village maintains shrines, rituals, and boundary-walks that keep the dead quiescent. The Vigil coordinates these efforts, resolves disputes between villages, and makes decisions about contact with the outside world.

There is no single leader. Decisions require consensus from at least five villages. This makes Lethos slow to act but almost impossible to subvert—there is no king to assassinate, no capital to conquer.

### The Seven Villages

The villages of Lethos are small, rarely exceeding a few hundred residents. They are built on stilts or floating platforms, designed to move with the seasonal floods. Each has a character shaped by its position and role in maintaining the Binding.

**Tanekala** — The southernmost village, perched where the jungle meets the Sea of Sighs. Tanekala's residents are primarily Faeja fishers who venture into waters other sailors avoid. They report that the Binding extends into the sea around the peninsula—ships that approach too closely find their crews plagued by nightmares of drowning soldiers, and some captains swear they've seen Gorathi legionnaires marching beneath the waves.

**Altimarloch** — The largest village, closest to what passes for a road to Gorath. Altimarloch handles the rare legitimate contact with the outside world—traders brave enough to enter Lethos, the occasional Gorathi official delivering tribute-exemption notices (they never stay overnight), and the even rarer traveler seeking something in the jungle. The Darklings here are the most comfortable with outsiders, though "comfortable" is relative.

**Mangaone** — A Faeja village deep in the flooded interior, accessible only by canoe. Mangaone's residents are herbalists and poison-crafters, tending gardens of the toxic plants that flourish in Lethos's unique soil. They supply the other villages with medicines, ceremonial compounds, and the specific toxins used in certain Binding rituals.

**Erua** — Perched on one of the few areas of solid high ground in eastern Lethos, Erua is the village of the druids. Or rather, what remains of them. The druids who performed the Binding three centuries ago are still here, still alive, still dying. The ritual requires living anchors, and they have been unable to fully die ever since. Erua is part village, part hospice, part shrine. The other villagers bring them food and comfort; in return, the druids maintain the deepest layer of the Binding's magic.

**Ohoka** — A Darkling village in the deep jungle, where the canopy is so thick that true daylight never reaches the forest floor. Ohoka's residents are the keepers of the darkness, the specialists who ensure that the supernatural shadow blanketing Lethos remains deep enough to hide and strong enough to trap. They are also the closest thing Lethos has to a military—when threats arise, Ohoka's hunters move through the darkness to eliminate them.

**Mintai** — Built around a freshwater spring that somehow remains clear despite the brackish swamp surrounding it, Mintai is the village of memory. Its residents—a mix of Faeja, Darklings, and a few Gillykin—maintain the oral histories of Lethos, including the true account of the Binding and the Night of Roots. They are the only ones who speak the names of the Gorathi dead, because someone must remember them to keep them bound.

**Eptos** — The newest village, established only a century ago near the ruins of Qlyp Augo. Eptos serves as a buffer between the ruins and the living jungle, monitoring the Gillykin and ensuring that whatever sleeps in the drowned towers stays sleeping. Its residents are grim, fatalistic, and drink more than the other villages consider healthy.

### Qlyp Augo

The ruins of the Gorathi provincial capital rise from the mangrove swamps of northeast Lethos—massive stone towers still standing after three centuries, their foundations drowned in brackish water, their windows dark and empty. Crocodiles nest in the flooded plazas. Birds refuse to roost on the walls.

The Gillykin live here.

They are the descendants of those Gorathi who survived the Night of Roots by accepting the jungle's terms. No one knows exactly what that means—the Gillykin don't speak of it, and the other peoples of Lethos don't ask. Physically, they no longer resemble the Gorathi of three centuries ago. Their skin has taken on greenish or grayish tones; their eyes have adapted to the permanent twilight of the ruins; their movements are too fluid, too quiet, as if they've learned to move like the water itself.

The Gillykin keep to Qlyp Augo. They harvest fish and crabs from the flooded streets, tend small gardens on the upper floors of the towers, and maintain a cold, careful distance from the other peoples of Lethos. They attend Vigil meetings but rarely speak. Their representative votes according to some internal logic the other villages have learned not to question.

What the Gillykin do in the ruins—what they remember, what they worship, what they guard—is their own business. The other villages are content to leave it that way.

### Xyrionn

In the hills at the center of Lethos stands a tree stump the size of a castle.

The tree that once grew here must have been ancient beyond reckoning—the stump is a quarter-mile across, and the wood, though dead, refuses to rot. Paths wind through the exposed root system, creating a natural maze that leads to the hollow center. At the heart of the maze lives a druid named Veleth.

Veleth is old. How old, no one knows—certainly older than the Binding, possibly older than Gorath itself. They tend the maze, grow things in the hollow center, and react with violent fury to anyone who attempts to harm the sacred wood. The stump is resistant to most forms of magic, as if the tree's death somehow concentrated its essence into impenetrability.

The Vigil meets here because Xyrionn is the heart of the Binding. The roots that spread from this stump connect to every part of Lethos, and the souls of the Gorathi dead are woven through them. Veleth doesn't control the Binding—no one does, not anymore—but they understand it better than anyone. When the villages have questions about the dead, about the jungle's behavior, about signs and portents, they come to Veleth.

The maze is not just difficult to navigate. The root-paths shift, especially at night, especially during Hollownight. Those who enter without permission find themselves walking the same paths forever, or emerging days later with no memory of the intervening time, or not emerging at all. The dead do not like visitors.

### The Jungle That Remembers

Lethos is dangerous to outsiders in ways that have nothing to do with conventional threats.

The Binding did what it was designed to do—it wove the souls of three thousand dead Gorathi into the land itself. But souls are not passive things. They strain. They hate. They *remember*. A traveler walking the jungle paths might feel watched, might hear whispers in languages they don't speak, might wake from sleep convinced someone was standing over them. These are the dead, pressing against the boundaries of their prison.

Worse things happen to those who stay too long.

The darkness in Lethos is unnatural. Even at noon, even in clearings, the light feels thin, filtered through something that isn't just canopy. At night, the darkness is absolute—thick enough to feel against your skin, deep enough that even magical light seems muted. The Darklings command this darkness, shape it, move through it freely. Outsiders are not so lucky.

The water cannot be trusted. Pools that look shallow go down forever. Rivers run in directions that change between visits. Thirst becomes dangerous—not because there's no water, but because the wrong water kills slowly, filling the drinker's dreams with the last moments of soldiers who drowned three centuries ago.

And then there are the roots.

They grow everywhere in Lethos—through the soil, up through the water, along the surfaces of trees. Most are ordinary. Some are not. The roots that carry pieces of the Binding are subtle, almost invisible, and they reach for the living. Not to kill—not usually—but to incorporate. To *remember*. A traveler who sleeps too close to the wrong roots might wake to find them growing through their blanket, their clothing, their flesh. The villages know how to treat this. Outsiders don't.

### Relations with Gorath

Lethos exists because Gorath allows it to.

This is both more and less true than it appears. Gorath's standing orders forbid military operations in Lethos, and the institutional memory of the Night of Roots—however distorted and denied—ensures that no ambitious general proposes changing this. But the empire could still make Lethos's existence difficult through economic pressure, border enforcement, or simply encouraging bandits and raiders.

Instead, Gorath does none of these things. Lethos receives a "tribute exemption"—a bureaucratic category that officially recognizes it as too poor to be worth taxing. Gorathi border patrols stay on their side of the line. Merchants who trade with Lethos face no official sanctions.

Some in Lethos believe this is fear. Others believe it's calculation—better to have someone watching the Sea of Sighs than to garrison the peninsula yourself. A few whisper that someone in Azantir knows the truth about the Binding and understands that a war with Lethos would not end with Lethos defeated. It would end with the dead finally released.

### Player Hooks

**The Binding Weakens** — The druids of Erua report that the Binding has been weakening for decades. The maintenance rituals require more effort each year; the dead are more restless; the roots grow more aggressively. Someone needs to find out why—and whether it can be reversed.

**Gillykin Secrets** — A Gillykin has contacted outsiders for the first time in living memory, claiming to have information about something buried beneath Qlyp Augo. Something the original Gorathi found. Something that might be why the druids chose this particular place for the Binding.

**Veleth's Heir** — The druid at Xyrionn is finally dying—truly dying, after centuries of maintaining their vigil. They need a successor, someone willing to learn the maze, the Binding, and the names of three thousand dead. They're looking beyond Lethos, because everyone in Lethos knows what the job actually requires.

**Gorathi Descendants** — Somewhere in Azantir, an old family keeps records of the Fourth Legion. They know their ancestors disappeared in Lethos three centuries ago. They've hired adventurers to enter Qlyp Augo and find proof of what happened—or, perhaps, to find survivors.

**The Sea Remembers** — Ships near Lethos have been disappearing with increasing frequency. The Faeja of Tanekala believe the Binding is spreading—that the dead are no longer content with the jungle, that they're reaching into the Sea of Sighs. If this continues, the major shipping lanes around the peninsula will become impassable.
