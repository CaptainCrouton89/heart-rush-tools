## Strymün Island

Tags: island, geography

The Strymün Isles rise from the Gindrik Sea like green jewels set in blue-gray water—a cluster of volcanic islands whose peaks remain visible for miles in clear weather. The main island, simply called Strymün, is the largest landmass between the Salt Flats and the distant Free Isles, making it a natural waypoint for maritime traffic.

### Geography

The archipelago consists of one major island and several smaller satellites:

- **Strymün** (the main island): Approximately eighty miles long and forty wide at its broadest point, dominated by twin volcanic peaks and heavily forested lower slopes
- **The Strymün Isles** (smaller satellites): A dozen inhabited islets plus countless rocks and shoals, scattered in a rough arc northeast of the main island

The main island's terrain divides naturally into three zones:

**The Highlands**: The volcanic interior, where twin peaks—Mount Aldris and Mount Brevani—rise above the treeline. Aldris is dormant; Brevani vents steam and occasional ash, a reminder that the island's fires have not entirely died.

**The Greenwood**: Temperate forest covering the mid-slopes, fed by reliable rainfall and volcanic soil. This is Ethadia's breadbasket—farms, orchards, and hunting grounds that support the population.

**The Coast**: Rocky cliffs on the windward side, gentler harbors on the leeward. Most settlements cluster along the southern and western shores, sheltered from the worst of the Gindrik storms.

### Climate

Maritime and mild. Winters are wet rather than cold; summers are warm but rarely brutal. The volcanoes generate their own weather patterns—morning fog rolling down the slopes, afternoon thermals carrying seabirds to improbable heights. The northern coast catches the full force of Gindrik storms, limiting development there.

### Resources

The Strymün Isles lack the mineral wealth of continental territories. Their value lies in position and productivity:

**Agriculture**: Volcanic soil supports intensive farming. The Greenwood produces grain, fruit, timber, and game sufficient to feed the islands' population with surplus for export.

**Fisheries**: The surrounding waters teem with life. Ethadian fishing fleets range across the Gindrik, and smoked fish is a significant export.

**Harbor Access**: The main island offers multiple natural harbors suitable for deep-water vessels—rare in this region of the Gindrik. This geography made Ethadia's commercial success possible.

## Ethadia

Tags: state, nation

Ethadia is what remains when ambition meets geography. A maritime trading state that has survived for centuries by making itself useful to everyone and threatening to no one, Ethadia occupies the Strymün Isles and maintains commercial relationships with powers that would destroy each other given the opportunity.

### Character

The Ethadians pride themselves on neutrality, discretion, and the ability to conduct business with anyone. Their ships carry Kuzagt salt to markets that would never trade directly with Bonnetaz. Their banks hold deposits from Gorathi merchants and escaped slaves alike. Their diplomats speak every language, follow every custom, and commit to nothing.

This flexibility has a cost. Ethadia's hands are perpetually dirty. They profit from the slave trade without owning slaves. They facilitate atrocities they would never commit. They watch their trading partners brutalize each other and calculate their margins.

The older generation considers this wisdom—survival through accommodation. The younger generation increasingly calls it cowardice.

### History

Ethadia was founded roughly eight centuries ago by refugees from a mainland conflict whose details have been deliberately obscured. The founders established Regina as a trading post, built relationships with the Kuzagt (then a minor power), and gradually accumulated the wealth to buy independence.

For most of its history, Ethadia has avoided the wars that consume its neighbors. When Gorath rose, Ethadia offered tribute and trade agreements. When Bonnetaz expanded its slave operations, Ethadia provided shipping services. When the Free Isles declared independence from various powers, Ethadia recognized all of them and none, maintaining relationships without commitments.

This strategy has worked. Ethadia has never been conquered. But it has also never been respected. Other powers view Ethadians as useful parasites—tolerated for their services, despised for their flexibility.

### Government

Ethadia operates as an aristocratic republic. The Crown is hereditary within the Aldric dynasty, currently worn by Queen Morvena III (age 67, ruling for 31 years). The Crown's powers are substantial but checked by the Council of Families—representatives of the twelve oldest noble houses, each holding their seat by hereditary right.

In practice, power resides with whoever controls the shipping revenues. The Crown controls the royal fleet and harbor fees. The Families control the merchant houses that generate most of the kingdom's wealth. Conflict between them is constant, bitter, and carefully constrained—no one wants to damage the commercial system that enriches both sides.

The common population has no formal political voice but enjoys significant practical freedoms. Ethadia needs skilled sailors, competent clerks, and reliable workers. Oppressing them would be economically foolish.

### Economy

Trade is everything. Ethadia produces enough food to survive but not enough to thrive. Its wealth comes from moving other peoples' goods:

**Transshipment**: Goods pass through Ethadian ports to reach markets that won't deal with their origins. Kuzagt salt becomes "Ethadian salt." Gorathi timber becomes "Gindrik lumber." The markup is substantial.

**Banking**: The major houses offer financial services with legendary discretion. Deposits are secure, loans are available, and no one asks where the money came from.

**Information**: Ethadian merchants hear things. This information has value, carefully commodified and sold to interested parties.

**Neutral Ground**: Enemies meet in Ethadian territory to negotiate truces, exchange prisoners, or conduct business that would be impossible elsewhere. Ethadia charges for this privilege.

### Military

Ethadia maintains a defensive navy of approximately forty vessels—enough to discourage casual piracy, insufficient to threaten any major power. The fleet's primary purpose is escort duty: protecting Ethadian merchants from the hazards of the Gindrik Sea.

Land forces are minimal. The islands' geography makes invasion difficult, and Ethadia relies on diplomatic relationships rather than walls. A small professional guard maintains order in the cities; beyond that, the population is expected to arm itself if circumstances require.

This military weakness is deliberate. An armed Ethadia would threaten its neighbors and invite the very conflicts it seeks to avoid.

### Society

Ethadian society stratifies by wealth rather than birth, though the two often coincide. The aristocracy—the Aldric crown and the twelve Families—control most significant assets. A prosperous merchant class operates in their shadow, wealthy enough for comfort but not powerful enough to challenge the established order. Below them, sailors, craftspeople, and laborers work for wages or shares.

Slavery is technically legal but practically extinct. The Ethadians discovered early that free workers are more productive and less troublesome. The handful of slaves in the kingdom are foreign-owned, passing through Ethadian ports en route to destinations that don't share these scruples.

This technicality enables Ethadian hypocrisy. They don't own slaves. They merely transport them, insure them, and bank the proceeds of their sale.

### Religion

Ethadia observes standard Alarian religious practices without distinctive local traditions. Temples to major deities operate in both cities. The population is conventionally pious without notable fervor.

One exception: mariners throughout the kingdom venerate Pelagos, a local spirit or minor deity associated with safe passage. Offerings to Pelagos are made before every voyage—fish blood poured into the harbor, coins tossed into the sea. Whether Pelagos exists, and whether these offerings accomplish anything, remains a matter of faith.

## Regina

The capital of Ethadia sprawls across the southern shore of Strymün's main harbor—a natural bay so perfect for shipping that the city's founding was essentially inevitable. Approximately fifty thousand people live here, making it the largest settlement in the Gindrik Sea region.

### The City

Regina grew organically around its harbor rather than following any planned design. The oldest districts cluster near the waterfront: warehouses, counting houses, taverns, chandleries, and the other businesses that serve maritime commerce. The Aldric Palace occupies a promontory at the harbor's eastern edge, positioned to observe all arrivals.

Wealthier neighborhoods climb the slopes behind the waterfront, arranged roughly by age and status. The twelve Family compounds form a loose ring around the palace—each a walled estate containing the main residence, offices, and quarters for household staff and guards. Beyond them, prosperous merchant homes give way to artisan quarters and eventually to workers' housing on the city's outskirts.

The city has no walls. Like Bonnetaz, Regina relies on water for defense—though here the calculation is maritime rather than environmental. Enemy fleets would need to enter the harbor to threaten the city, and Ethadian defenses focus on the harbor approaches.

### Architecture

Ethadian building favors stone foundations with timber upper stories—practical in an earthquake-prone volcanic region. Roofs are typically tile, imported or locally made from clay deposits in the Greenwood. The overall effect is Mediterranean: white and pale yellow walls, terra-cotta roofs, narrow streets climbing steep slopes.

The palace and Family compounds are more elaborate, featuring carved stonework, imported marble, and elaborate gardens. These displays of wealth are competitive; each Family strives to outdo its rivals without crossing the line into ostentation that might invite Crown intervention.

### The Waterfront

Regina's commercial heart stretches along two miles of harbor frontage. Wharves extend into the bay, capable of servicing a hundred vessels simultaneously. Behind them, warehouses store goods awaiting transshipment—everything from Kuzagt salt to Gorathi timber to items whose origins the harbormaster doesn't record.

The Merchant's Exchange dominates the waterfront district: a massive building where traders conduct business, banks maintain offices, and information changes hands. Membership in the Exchange requires substantial fees and Family sponsorship, limiting access to established merchants. Those excluded conduct business in the surrounding streets, legal but less reputable.

### Districts of Note

**Palace Hill**: The Aldric compound and administrative center. Access is restricted but not forbidden; petitioners can approach the palace gates during daylight hours.

**The Ring**: The twelve Family compounds, each a small fortress in its own right. Social invitations here are political currency.

**Temple Row**: Major temples clustered along a single thoroughfare, convenient for the pious and the superstitious alike.

**Sailor's Rest**: Entertainment district catering to maritime workers. Taverns, brothels, gambling houses, and establishments that combine all three. Surprisingly orderly—the Families have investments here and maintain security accordingly.

**The Gutters**: Worker housing on the city's western edge. Not dangerous, merely poor. The population here works the industries that wealth enables: shipbuilding, rope-making, sail-lofting, and the hundred other trades that keep Ethadia's fleet operational.

### Politics

Regina is Ethadia writ small. Crown and Families maneuver constantly, each seeking advantage without destabilizing the system that enriches everyone. The current queen is aging, her heir is young, and the succession is not as secure as the palace claims. Several Families smell opportunity.

This internal competition has external implications. Each major foreign power has cultivated relationships with specific Families, hoping to gain influence in Ethadian affairs. The Kuzagt favor House Valdren, which handles most Bonnetaz trade. Gorath has connections to House Mircalis, despite their mutual distaste. Even the Free Isles have their preferred partners among the aristocracy.

Queen Morvena has maintained balance for three decades. When she dies, that balance will be tested.

## Sivirine

The second city of Ethadia occupies the archipelago's northwest coast, facing the open Gindrik rather than the sheltered waters of the main harbor. Approximately fifteen thousand people live here—sailors, fishers, and those who prefer distance from Regina's politics.

### Character

Where Regina is commercial and cosmopolitan, Sivirine is working-class and Ethadian. The population here traces its ancestry to the original founders rather than the merchants who came later. They speak older dialects, observe older customs, and maintain older grudges against the capital that has overshadowed their city.

Sivirine's economy depends on fishing rather than trade. The Gindrik's richest waters lie northeast of the Strymün Isles, and Sivirine's fleets work them year-round. The catch is processed here—smoked, salted, dried—and shipped to markets throughout the region. It's honest work, the locals say. Unlike Regina.

### Layout

Sivirine occupies a rocky peninsula with minimal natural harbor—a disadvantage for trade, an advantage for fishing boats that can beach on any shore. The town sprawls along the peninsula's spine, with processing facilities on the windward side (where the smell blows out to sea) and residential areas on the leeward.

No noble Families maintain compounds here. A few minor houses operate fishing operations, but political power resides in the Fisher's Council—an elected body representing the major fishing cooperatives. The Crown appoints a governor to represent royal interests, but wise governors listen more than they command.

### Tensions

Sivirine resents Regina. This resentment focuses on taxation (Regina takes more than its share), representation (the Council of Families ignores Sivirine's interests), and cultural contamination (Regina has forgotten what it means to be truly Ethadian).

These complaints are as old as the division between the cities. Usually, they remain complaints. Occasionally—when Regina's attention wanders or a particularly charismatic leader emerges—Sivirine pushes back. Tax refusals, work stoppages, and once (two centuries ago) an outright rebellion that lasted three months before the Families offered acceptable terms.

The current mood is sullen but stable. Governor Aldric Thorne (a distant cousin of the Queen, exiled here for unspecified failures in Regina) has learned to work with the Fisher's Council rather than against it. But the underlying tensions persist, waiting for a spark.

### Significance

For outsiders, Sivirine matters primarily as an alternative entry point. Ships approaching from the northwest can reach Sivirine without passing Regina's watchers. Some cargoes—and some passengers—prefer this discretion. The Fisher's Council officially opposes smuggling but lacks the resources to prevent it.

For players, Sivirine offers a different Ethadia: rougher, poorer, more honest about its grievances. People here will talk about things Regina prefers to ignore.
