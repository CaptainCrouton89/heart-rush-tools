## Pesalolo

Tags: island, geography, shacklands

A thousand-mile island running northeast to southwest, split in half by geography and politics alike. The Freedom Mountains form an unbroken spine from one end to the other, dividing Pesalolo into two coasts that rarely interact overland. The southern coast belongs to Gorath in all but name—the Slaver's Coast, where ships collect their human cargo for the crossing to Azantir. The northern coast is nominally independent Tamadrez, a scattering of villages and towns that survive by being too poor to conquer and too useful to destroy.

The island is dominated by jungle in the lowlands and dense highland forest along the mountain slopes. Rivers drain from the central peaks toward both coasts, creating the only practical routes through otherwise impassable terrain.

### The Freedom Mountains

The central mountain range bisecting Pesalolo, running the full length of the island. The name is bitterly ironic or desperately hopeful depending on who uses it—the mountains are both the barrier that prevents Gorath from simply conquering the north, and the escape route for slaves fleeing the southern coast.

The range comprises several named sections:
- **Apuindi Mountains** — The eastern section, rising from the coast near Divinity Passage
- **Gesichi Mountains** — The central section, where Slavewatch fortress commands the major passes
- **Tishkung Mountains** — The southwestern section, descending toward the Ryujilin Hills

The mountains are high enough to catch clouds, keeping the slopes perpetually damp and the passes frequently fogged. Gorathi military expeditions have repeatedly failed to establish permanent control of the highland routes—the terrain favors those who know it, and the Drasnian dwarves have known it for millennia.

### Slaver's Coast

The southern coast of Pesalolo, stretching from Divinity Passage in the east to the Tishkung foothills in the west. Gorath has occupied this coast for three centuries, extracting Drasnian dwarves for the empire's labor needs. There was no treaty, no negotiation—Gorath simply took what it wanted and announced the terms.

Dozens of small ports dot this coast, each little more than a dock, a holding pen, and a few permanent structures for the slavers who manage the trade. Ships run a regular circuit from port to port, collecting captives until their holds are full, then crossing through the Torgan Passage or around Agorf Island to reach Divinity Passage and the journey north to Azantir.

The shipping lanes are visible from the highlands—a constant procession of vessels, predictable as tides.

### Yava

The largest city on Pesalolo, at the island's southwestern tip where the Ryujilin Hills meet the sea. Yava exists because everyone needs it to exist.

The city is the only major deepwater port between Screamstrait and the Slave Coast—a geographic necessity for any vessel crossing the Gindrik Sea. Ships from Ethadia, Shir Island, Windori, and points beyond require Yava for resupply, repair, and shelter from the storms that sweep through Screamstrait seasonally. Merchants from a dozen nations use the port as neutral ground.

This makes Yava untouchable.

Gorath could reach it. The imperial navy is more than capable of sailing around Pesalolo and burning the city to the waterline. But doing so would destabilize trade across the entire region—including Gorath's own legitimate commerce. Every major trading power has made clear, through diplomatic channels, that destroying Yava would have consequences.

So Gorath pretends Yava is a minor fishing town beneath imperial notice. Yava pretends it doesn't shelter escapees from the Slave Coast. Everyone maintains the fiction because the alternative hurts everyone's bottom line.

**Population**: Large by Tamadrezan standards—perhaps thirty thousand permanent residents, with thousands more transients at any given time. The majority are Drasnian dwarves, but foreign sailors, traders, and people who don't ask questions have made Yava genuinely cosmopolitan.

**Character**: Yava is not a resistance headquarters or a utopia. It is a grubby, pragmatic port city that survives by being useful to people who could destroy it. The docks smell of fish and tar. The taverns serve anyone with coin. The city watch takes bribes but maintains enough order to keep merchants coming back.

The closest thing Tamadrez has to a capital, though no one would call it that officially. When Tamadrezan leaders need to coordinate—which is rarely—they meet in Yava. When escaped slaves make it through the mountains and need to disappear, many end up here. When Gorathi deserters want a new life, Yava doesn't ask about their past.

The city faces southwest, toward Screamstrait and the wider world, deliberately turning its back on the Slave Coast hundreds of miles to the east. This orientation is architectural and philosophical. Yava wants nothing to do with Gorath's business—as long as Gorath leaves it alone.

### Ryujilin Hills

Low, rolling highlands at Pesalolo's southwestern tip, where the Freedom Mountains finally descend to the sea. Less dramatic than the central peaks but equally important—the hills provide defensible terrain around Yava and make any overland approach to the city costly.

The hills are drier than the rest of Pesalolo, catching less rainfall in the mountain shadow. Scrubland and scattered forest rather than dense jungle. Goatherds and farmers work the slopes, supplying Yava's markets.

### Scream Strait

The waters off Pesalolo's southwestern tip, between the island and Shir to the south. Named for the winds that howl through during storm season, Screamstrait is notoriously dangerous for navigation. The currents are treacherous, the weather unpredictable, and the rocky approaches to Yava have claimed dozens of ships over the centuries.

Local pilots make good money guiding vessels through. Captains who try to save the fee often regret it.

### The Northern Archipelago

A cluster of islands north of Pesalolo, between the mainland and Pukot Island. The largest is Shinori Island, lair of the dragon Agtakkeri. The archipelago also includes Liki Forest island to the south of Shinori—a densely wooded island that takes its name from the forest covering its entire surface.

The islands are largely uninhabited due to Agtakkeri's presence. Fishermen from the Tamadrezan coast give them wide berth. The waters between the archipelago and Pesalolo are called the Skinning Grounds by Gorathi sailors, who refuse to enter them.

See [Agtakkeri](../../bestiary/dragons/Agtakkeri.md) for details on the dragon's territory and behavior.

### Torgan Passage

The strait between Pesalolo and Agorf Island to the south. Slave ships use this passage to reach the eastern Slave Coast ports, though the route is longer than sailing around Agorf. The passage is relatively calm and well-charted, making it preferred by captains who value predictability over speed.

### Divinity Passage

The major maritime corridor separating Pesalolo from Gorath's mainland. All slave traffic ultimately flows through Divinity Passage on its way to Azantir. The passage is heavily traveled, well-patrolled by Gorathi naval vessels, and—for the enslaved—the last sight of home they will ever see.

See [Divinity Passage](Divinity%20Passage.md) for full details.
