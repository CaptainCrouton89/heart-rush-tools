## Lyoki Ingi Ingi

Tags: jungle, geography, mudzwiti, shacklands

A dense rainforest peninsula stretching south from the Shacklands interior, where the Mudzwiti goblins have built a civilization around death, dinosaurs, and the slow accumulation of glory. The jungle canopy blocks most sunlight, creating a perpetual green twilight beneath where utahraptors hunt in packs and goblin tribes compete for territory, hunting grounds, and the honor of the grandest tombs.

Lyoki Ingi Ingi runs approximately 150 miles from its northern roots to the southern tip, averaging 40-50 miles wide. The terrain is unforgiving—dense undergrowth, sudden ravines, rivers that flood without warning, and megafauna that views humanoids as convenient protein. Outsiders who enter without guides rarely return. The Mudzwiti do not offer guides.

Eight major villages dot the peninsula, each ruled by a tribal king whose lifespan stretches across centuries thanks to rare jungle plants that the Mudzwiti guard jealously. These kings accumulate wealth, followers, and elaborate tomb preparations over generations, competing not for territory but for legacy—who will be remembered longest, whose tomb will stand grandest, whose name will echo through the ages.

### The Mudzwiti Way

The Mudzwiti are tribal goblins who have formed a symbiotic relationship with the utahraptors that roam their jungle home. Each tribe maintains raptor bloodlines spanning generations, with individual goblins bonding to specific animals in rituals that leave both parties marked. The goblins ride their raptors into battle and hunt, wearing the skulls of fallen dinosaurs as helmets and adorning their bodies with elaborate bone piercings and ritualistic scarification.

Death defines Mudzwiti culture. Not death as ending—death as legacy. A Mudzwiti's life is preparation for the tomb they will leave behind. The grandest tombs contain buried servants (volunteers who achieve honor through service), accumulated treasures, and murals depicting the deceased's greatest achievements. The quality of one's tomb determines one's status in whatever comes after.

The kings consume rare jungle plants that extend their lives dramatically—some have ruled for three or four centuries, accumulating vast wealth and elaborate tomb preparations. These plants grow only in specific locations, and knowledge of them is the kings' most guarded secret.

### Villages

**Chikowe** — The northernmost village, closest to the mainland Shacklands. Chikowe serves as the reluctant point of contact for the rare outsiders who seek trade or passage. The village maintains a neutral ground at its northern edge where such interactions occur—foreigners do not enter the village proper.

**Gondowe** — A village built around an ancient stone structure that predates Mudzwiti settlement. The current inhabitants use it as a communal tomb for their kings, adding chambers and decorations with each generation. The oldest sections are no longer entered.

**Chriunda** — Known for its raptor breeders, who have cultivated the most aggressive and intelligent utahraptor bloodlines in the peninsula. Warriors from across Lyoki Ingi Ingi seek Chriunda-bred mounts.

**Mpakati** — A central village that controls access to one of the rare plant groves that extend goblin lifespans. The current king, rumored to be over 400 years old, maintains strict protocols about who may harvest and how much.

**Kadivivire** — Perched on elevated ground above the flood line, Kadivivire has never been submerged in the seasonal deluges. The village considers this evidence of divine favor and maintains an unusually elaborate religious practice centered on elevation and ascension.

**Nanda** — A village of craftsgoblins who specialize in bone-working, creating the intricate piercings, helmet-skulls, and decorative elements that define Mudzwiti aesthetics. Nanda work commands high trade value throughout the peninsula.

**Baswi** — The easternmost village, positioned where the jungle meets coastal waters. Baswi Mudzwiti have developed limited fishing traditions unusual for their people, and their tomb architecture incorporates shells and coral alongside the traditional bone.

**Matsikiti** — The southernmost village at the peninsula's tip, isolated and insular even by Mudzwiti standards. Matsikiti goblins maintain the oldest unbroken king-lineage in the peninsula, with oral histories stretching back over a thousand years. They consider the other villages upstarts.

### Geography

The jungle interior defies easy mapping. Rivers shift course seasonally, trails become impassable within weeks, and the canopy blocks celestial navigation. The Mudzwiti navigate by raptor-scent, landmark trees, and generational memory—knowledge that cannot be extracted or easily shared.

Several ruins dot the deep jungle—structures that predate the Mudzwiti by unknown millennia, built by hands that were not goblin and perhaps not humanoid. The Mudzwiti use some as tomb foundations but do not claim to understand them. The deepest jungle, beyond where even hunting parties venture, contains things the Mudzwiti acknowledge exist but do not discuss with outsiders.

### Relations

**Shykasas**: Neutral non-interference. The Alekroin swamps border Lyoki Ingi Ingi to the west at Molleres. Both peoples are fiercely territorial, which paradoxically makes them good neighbors—neither has any interest in the other's land, and both respect clearly marked boundaries.

**The Shacklands**: Minimal contact. The Mudzwiti do not participate in the slave trade and have no interest in Shacklands politics. Occasionally, escaped slaves find their way into the jungle. Those who survive the journey and prove useful are sometimes adopted into villages. Most do not survive the journey.

**Outsiders**: Deeply unwelcome. The Mudzwiti have nothing they want from the outside world and see no reason to accommodate visitors. Explorers, treasure hunters, and would-be colonizers enter the jungle periodically. The jungle tends to resolve such incursions without Mudzwiti intervention, but when necessary, the tribes cooperate with unusual efficiency.
