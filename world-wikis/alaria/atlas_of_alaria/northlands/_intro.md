# Northlands

## Geography

The Northlands occupy the extreme northwest of Alaria—a harsh arctic tundra of perpetual snow and ice. This flat or rolling icy plain borders the northern ocean, where howling winds sweep across featureless white expanses for hundreds of miles. The terrain consists primarily of frozen tundra: permafrost beneath shallow snow, occasional rocky outcrops, and rare patches of hardy lichen. The coast is treacherous, with ice shelves that calve into the frigid sea and pack ice that shifts with the seasons.
