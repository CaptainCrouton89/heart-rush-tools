# Northlands

## Geography

The Northlands occupy the frozen heart of northern Clueanda, filling the space south of the Nysanna Range. This vast arctic tundra stretches from the North Sea—a small body of water in the extreme north—down to where it meets the Westwilds in the southwest and transitions into the Celedrim Plains to the east.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Nysanna Range forms the northern boundary, an east-west mountain chain that marks the edge of habitable land
- **East**: Transitions into the Celedrim Plains; the two regions meet at approximately where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains join at their 120-degree angle
- **South/Southwest**: Grades into the Westwilds, a transitional zone of arid scrubland
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking distant waters

### Terrain

The terrain consists primarily of frozen tundra: permafrost beneath shallow snow, occasional rocky outcrops, and rare patches of hardy lichen. Howling winds sweep across featureless white expanses for hundreds of miles. The coast is treacherous, with ice shelves that calve into the frigid sea and pack ice that shifts with the seasons.

### Titanwurm Mountains

Scattered throughout the Northlands are several Titanwurm mountain ranges—isolated peaks and ridges that break the otherwise flat tundra. These are not traditional geological formations but the colossal remains of titanwurms, ancient creatures whose bones now form mountain ranges:

- Melrin Mountains
- Gwyndolsong Mountains
- Wurmling Mountains
- Sotori Mountains (south of Wurmling and Jemco, just north of the eastern Krenglelan Range)—composed of the colossal vertebrae of a titanwurm
- Jemco Mountains

### The Northern Plains

The vast frozen grasslands that stretch between the Titanwurm mountain ranges, west of the Wurmling Mountains and south of the Gwyndolsong Mountains. The Beathamuir River cuts horizontally through the entire Northern Plains, one of the few sources of unfrozen water in this frozen realm. The river is massive—wide enough that in some stretches the far bank is barely visible—and fed by glacial melt from the Nysanna Range.

#### Circle of Stone

Like Stonehenge but far more imposing—colossal stones arranged in an ancient circle, each stone unbreakable and emanating massive magical power. The site sits at a convergence of Earth and Force leylines, allowing for extraordinarily powerful geomancy and force magic. The stones predate all known civilizations in the Northlands, and their creators remain a mystery.

The Circle has become a pilgrimage site for geomancers and force-attuned mages seeking to study or harness the immense power concentrated here.

#### Tower of Azül

Where the Beathamuir River crosses a water leyline, the Tower of Azül rises from an island in the river's center. The tower is ancient—built of blue-black stone that seems to drink in light—and has served many masters over the millennia. Currently it stands empty, its last occupant having departed (or died) within living memory.

The tower's position on the water leyline makes it valuable to any mage with water attunement. The river itself behaves strangely near the tower: it never freezes regardless of temperature, and fish caught in its waters near the island are said to grant prophetic dreams when eaten. The Neth tribes who range through the Northern Plains consider the tower taboo and will not approach within a mile of it, though they refuse to explain why.

Whoever built the tower understood both hydromancy and architecture that has not been replicated since. The interior is rumored to contain chambers that exist partially underwater, partially in air, with no clear boundary between—rooms where one can breathe liquid and drown in air.

### Nysanna Range

The massive east-west mountain chain that forms the northern boundary of the Northlands, marking the edge of habitable territory before the polar wastes. The tallest mountains in the world, home to two white dragons, the Wydling ice goblins, and countless glaciers. See the dedicated [Nysanna Range](./Nysanna%20Range.md) entry for details.

### Wurmling Mountains

One of the Titanwurm mountain ranges scattered throughout the Northlands, the Wurmling Mountains divide the frozen plains.

#### Temple of Zicadia

At the northern tip of the Wurmling Mountains, where force and air leylines intersect, stands the Temple of Zicadia. This remote institution is dedicated to elemental protection magic—specifically, the art of turning air into solid structures that can deflect attacks.

The temple is run by Master Felwana, a reclusive woman who lost her husband in a distant war and came to the Northlands to learn. She became a master of the art and now teaches others, though the temple is brutal and miserable. Life here is harsh—the temple faces frequent threats from the creatures of the frozen snowplains, and students must be prepared to defend themselves while mastering the difficult discipline of solidifying air itself.
