# Northlands

## Geography

The Northlands occupy the frozen heart of northern Clueanda, filling the space south of the Nysanna Range. This vast arctic tundra stretches from the North Sea—a small body of water in the extreme north—down to where it meets the Westwilds in the southwest and transitions into the Celedrim Plains to the east.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Nysanna Range forms the northern boundary, an east-west mountain chain that marks the edge of habitable land
- **East**: Transitions into the Celedrim Plains; the two regions meet at approximately where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains join at their 120-degree angle
- **South/Southwest**: Grades into the Westwilds, a transitional zone of arid scrubland
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking distant waters

### Terrain

The terrain consists primarily of frozen tundra: permafrost beneath shallow snow, occasional rocky outcrops, and rare patches of hardy lichen. Howling winds sweep across featureless white expanses for hundreds of miles. The coast is treacherous, with ice shelves that calve into the frigid sea and pack ice that shifts with the seasons.

### Titanwurm Mountains

Scattered throughout the Northlands are several Titanwurm mountain ranges—isolated peaks and ridges that break the otherwise flat tundra:

- Melrin Mountains
- Gwyndolsong Mountains
- Wurmspine Mountains
- Sotori Mountains
- Jemco Mountains
