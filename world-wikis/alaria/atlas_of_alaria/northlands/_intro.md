# Northlands

## Geography

The Northlands occupy the frozen heart of northern Clueanda, filling the space south of the Nysanna Range. This vast arctic tundra stretches from the North Sea—a small body of water in the extreme north—down to where it meets the Westwilds in the southwest and transitions into the Celedrim Plains to the east.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Nysanna Range forms the northern boundary, an east-west mountain chain that marks the edge of habitable land
- **East**: Transitions into the Celedrim Plains; the two regions meet at approximately where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains join at their 120-degree angle
- **South/Southwest**: Grades into the Westwilds, a transitional zone of arid scrubland
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking distant waters

### Terrain

The terrain consists primarily of frozen tundra: permafrost beneath shallow snow, occasional rocky outcrops, and rare patches of hardy lichen. Howling winds sweep across featureless white expanses for hundreds of miles. The coast is treacherous, with ice shelves that calve into the frigid sea and pack ice that shifts with the seasons.

### Titanwurm Mountains

Scattered throughout the Northlands are several Titanwurm mountain ranges—isolated peaks and ridges that break the otherwise flat tundra. These are not traditional geological formations but the colossal remains of titanwurms, ancient creatures whose bones now form mountain ranges:

- Melrin Mountains
- Gwyndolsong Mountains
- Wurmspine Mountains
- Sotori Mountains (south of Wurmspine and Jemco, just north of the eastern Krenglelan Range)—composed of the colossal vertebrae of a titanwurm
- Jemco Mountains

### The Northern Plains

The vast frozen grasslands that stretch between the Titanwurm mountain ranges, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and south of the Gwyndolsong Mountains. The Beathamuir River cuts horizontally through the entire Northern Plains, one of the few sources of unfrozen water in this frozen realm.

#### Circle of Stone

Like Stonehenge but far more imposing—colossal stones arranged in an ancient circle, each stone unbreakable and emanating massive magical power. The site sits at a convergence of Earth and Force leylines, allowing for extraordinarily powerful geomancy and force magic. The stones predate all known civilizations in the Northlands, and their creators remain a mystery.

The Circle has become a pilgrimage site for geomancers and force-attuned mages seeking to study or harness the immense power concentrated here.

### Nysanna Range

The massive east-west mountain chain that forms the northern boundary of the Northlands, marking the edge of habitable territory before the polar wastes.

#### Inthikrilix Dungeon

On the northern side of the Nysanna Range, where water and force leylines intersect, lies the Inthikrilix Dungeon—a massive fortress carved into the mountainside. This network of ice-encrusted tunnels delves deep into the mountain, leading eventually to the crypt of Inthikrilix, an ancient mage who mastered both ice and force magic.

The dungeon is guarded by spirits of ice and force—ethereal beings created by the leyline convergence or bound by Inthikrilix himself. These spirits manifest as crystalline wraiths that can freeze flesh instantly or crush intruders with invisible force. The deeper one ventures into the mountain, the more powerful and numerous the guardians become, and the temperature drops to levels that can kill unprotected explorers within minutes.

#### Pyoa Noi

In the eastern region of the Nysanna Range stands one of the most bizarre landmarks in the Northlands: Pyoa Noi, a hundred-mile-long stone serpent that twists and turns through the mountains, its petrified body diving in and out of the peaks like a sea serpent frozen mid-leap.

The serpent was once a living creature of unimaginable size, turned to stone by an incredibly powerful gorgon in an ancient battle. Over the centuries, miners have hollowed out the serpent's interior, creating a network of tunnels and chambers within the stone body. These carved spaces are now inhabited by the Wydlings—a reclusive people who have made Pyoa Noi their home, living within the belly of the petrified beast and defending it from those who would mine it further.

### Wurmspine Mountains

One of the Titanwurm mountain ranges scattered throughout the Northlands, the Wurmspine Mountains divide the frozen plains.

#### Temple of Zicadia

At the northern tip of the Wurmspine Mountains, where force and air leylines intersect, stands the Temple of Zicadia. This remote institution is dedicated to elemental protection magic—specifically, the art of turning air into solid structures that can deflect attacks.

The temple is run by Master Felwana, a reclusive woman who lost her husband in a distant war and came to the Northlands to learn. She became a master of the art and now teaches others, though the temple is brutal and miserable. Life here is harsh—the temple faces frequent threats from the creatures of the frozen snowplains, and students must be prepared to defend themselves while mastering the difficult discipline of solidifying air itself.
