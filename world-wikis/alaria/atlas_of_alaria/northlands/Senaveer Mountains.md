## Senaveer Mountains

Tags: mountains

They are home to a large population of northern rocs, which hunt the caribou in the east. The mountains are rich with the lichen that feeds the caribou, so the Atowatowa herders will journey there every spring.

### Anderegnons

The Anderegnons are a miserable, cold, windy range of mountains, on the border of the Material Plane and Celestia. It is also a rich source of malstaric ash, which can be found throughout the mountains. The Bollinger Mining Company have discovered it, laid claim to it, and now mine and ship the ash south towards the sea. It is an incredibly expensive and dangerous operation, as food has to be shipped in, and ash shipped out. The journey is treacherous. They have so far managed to avoid the Atowtowa by skirting along the eastern edge of the Senaveer Mountains. However, stray too far west and get eaten by the Northern Rocs in the mountains, and stray too far east an get captured and killed by the Atowatowa.
