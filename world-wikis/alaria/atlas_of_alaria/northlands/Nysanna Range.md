## Nysanna Range

Tags: mountains

The Nysanna Range is one of the most inhospitable places on Alaria—and by some measures, the most dramatic. These are the tallest mountains in the world, their peaks rising so high that the air becomes too thin to breathe. The entire range is plagued with constant blizzards, high winds, and freezing temperatures. It is rare for the temperature to climb above -20°F, and the high altitudes cause confusion, hallucination, and poor judgment in those who venture too high without magical protection.

Within the range lie a wide variety of wildlife, civilizations, and valuable resources—but claiming any of them requires surviving the mountains first.

### The Glaciers

Massive glaciers fill the valleys and passes of the Nysanna Range, some of them miles thick and constantly grinding forward. These rivers of ice are not static; they calve enormous icebergs into the North Sea, reshape the landscape over centuries, and occasionally release ancient things frozen within them. The glaciers are also riddled with tunnels—some carved by meltwater, others by creatures that call the ice home.

The largest glaciers have names among those who know the range: the Breath of Nydus, the Thousand-Year Flow, the Grinding. Navigation through the range often means traveling *through* glaciers rather than around them, following tunnel networks that may or may not still exist from season to season.

### Dragon Territories

Two white dragons claim the Nysanna Range as their hunting ground, dividing the mountains between them in a cold détente.

**Shananae** holds the western reaches, from the approaches to the Anderegnons to roughly the midpoint of the range. She is ancient and indifferent—not actively cruel, but utterly unconcerned with the lives of smaller creatures. The Atowatowa have learned to read the wind patterns that signal her hunts and adjust their movements accordingly.

**Niquous** claims the central range, his territory beginning where Shananae's ends and stretching east toward Witvein. He is younger and far more actively malevolent, a hunter who takes pleasure in terror. His blue-white scales make him nearly invisible against glacial ice. The Wydlings of Witvein have lost enough hunting parties to him that they've developed elaborate warning systems for his approach.

The space between their territories is not safe—it's simply where both dragons hunt.

### Western Peaks

The western arm of the Nysanna Range curves northward toward the Senaveer Mountains and the Anderegnons, approaching the border between the Material Plane and Celestia. Here the mountains grow taller and stranger, their peaks often wreathed in aurora-light even during the day.

#### Top of the World

The highest peak in the western Nysanna Range, and by some measures the highest point in all of Clueanda. Top of the World rises where the planar membrane between Material and Celestia grows gossamer-thin—so thin that on clear nights, observers claim to see the faint shapes of spirits moving on the other side.

The Atowatowa consider this peak sacred ground. When their greatest leaders die, their bodies are carried up the treacherous slopes by a procession of wind-callers who still the lethal gales long enough to reach the summit. There, the body is laid upon the bare stone and left for the wind. The Atowatowa believe that here, closer to Celestia than anywhere else on the continent, the spirit can step directly across rather than making the long journey through death. What happens to the body is unclear—some say the wind takes it; others say it simply fades.

The peak is why the Atowatowa are so hostile to outsiders in general and to the Bollinger Mining Company in particular. Every step the miners take toward the mountains is a step toward desecrating the place where their ancestors crossed over.

#### Bjorin's Lookout

A weathered outcropping on the northwestern slope of the Nysanna Range, overlooking the Anderegnons and the approaches to Anu'Itiklik. Named for Bjorin Wolfseye, a Zwaeron pathfinder who lived three centuries ago.

Bjorin earned his name not from keen vision but from what he witnessed. According to Zwaeron legend, he was camped at this outlook when the aurora twisted into unnatural shapes and something emerged from the thinning planar border—a creature of light and memory that had no business existing in the Material world. Bjorin's dire wolf companion went mad at the sight. Bjorin himself survived by gouging out his own eyes before the thing could be fully seen.

Blind, he made his way back to the Zwaeron camps and lived another forty years, guiding caravans by scent and sound alone. The lookout bearing his name became a traditional waystation for Zwaeron scouts, who watch for unusual aurora activity and maintain signal-fires to warn the southern camps if the lights begin to twist.

The Zwaeron tell their children: *"If the sky dances wrong, run. Don't look back. Bjorin looked, and he was lucky."*

### Witvein

The eastern Nysanna Range, on its northern slopes facing the polar wastes, is dominated by the region known as Witvein—a maze of tunnel-laden glaciers that serves as home to the Wydlings, the ice goblins of the far north.

The Wydlings have carved an entire civilization into these glaciers, creating networks of passages, chambers, and hunting blinds that only they can navigate safely. The ice shifts constantly, and the Wydlings have learned to read its movements—knowing which tunnels will collapse within days and which will last generations. Outsiders who enter Witvein without Wydling guides rarely emerge.

Unlike their southern goblin cousins who live in massive communal broods, Wydlings move in small extended-family hunting packs. They are patient, methodical predators—capable of waiting motionless in snowdrifts for hours before striking. Their pale blue skin and razor-sharp icicle teeth mark them as creatures perfectly adapted to this frozen hell.

The Wydlings maintain an uneasy awareness of Niquous, the white dragon whose territory borders their own. They have lost enough hunters to him that they've developed an elaborate system of scouts, signals, and escape routes. When Niquous hunts, the Wydlings vanish deeper into their glacier tunnels, waiting in absolute stillness until the danger passes.

#### Pyoa Noi

Within the eastern Nysanna Range stands one of the most bizarre landmarks in the Northlands: Pyoa Noi, a hundred-mile-long stone serpent that twists through the mountains, its petrified body diving in and out of the peaks like a sea serpent frozen mid-leap.

The serpent was once a living creature of unimaginable size, turned to stone by an incredibly powerful gorgon in an ancient battle. Over centuries, the Wydlings have hollowed out the serpent's interior, creating a network of tunnels and chambers within the stone body. Pyoa Noi is their greatest stronghold—a place where the ice cannot shift and the dragons cannot easily reach them.

The Wydlings defend Pyoa Noi fiercely from those who would mine it further. The stone of the petrified serpent has unusual properties that outside interests would love to exploit, but the Wydlings consider it sacred—the belly of a dead god, in their telling, and the only permanent home their people have ever known.

### Last Chance

High on the northern face of the Nysanna Range, where the peaks give way to the polar wastes beyond, stands the ruined fortress of Last Chance. The name is grimly literal: this was the final point where skyships traveling the northern astral current could safely dock before being swept further into the storms and ice of the world's edge.

The astral currents that flow through Alaria's skies follow paths as fixed as ocean currents, and one of the major northern routes sweeps along the Nysanna Range before curving northwest toward oblivion. Skyships caught on this current without enough aether to break free would be carried into the perpetual storms beyond the mountains, never to return. Last Chance was built as a desperate waystation—a place to refuel, repair, or simply abandon ship before the current carried you past the point of no return.

The fortress has been abandoned for centuries now. Its docking spires still jut from the mountainside, encrusted with ice, and its interior is a frozen tomb of whatever crew last sheltered there. Occasionally treasure hunters or scholars make the dangerous climb to explore it, hoping to find salvage from the skyships that didn't make it—or records of what lies beyond the edge of the world. Few return with anything useful. Fewer still return at all.

The Wydlings avoid Last Chance. They say the wind sounds wrong there—that it carries voices from places that shouldn't exist.

### Inthikrilix Dungeon

On the northern side of the Nysanna Range, where water and force leylines intersect, lies the Inthikrilix Dungeon—a massive fortress carved into the mountainside. This network of ice-encrusted tunnels delves deep into the mountain, leading eventually to the crypt of Inthikrilix, an ancient mage who mastered both ice and force magic.

The dungeon is guarded by spirits of ice and force—ethereal beings created by the leyline convergence or bound by Inthikrilix himself. These spirits manifest as crystalline wraiths that can freeze flesh instantly or crush intruders with invisible force. The deeper one ventures into the mountain, the more powerful and numerous the guardians become, and the temperature drops to levels that can kill unprotected explorers within minutes.

What treasures or secrets Inthikrilix left behind remain unknown. The few expeditions that have penetrated the outer chambers report that the architecture becomes increasingly alien the deeper one goes—as if the mage was building according to geometries that don't quite match the Material Plane.
