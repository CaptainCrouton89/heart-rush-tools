## Maun

Tags: citystate

Maun is the home to the most famous dwarven school of music and theater in Alaria. Many bards travel to Maun to learn from the great scholars of the school. 

Comes with a cost. Everyone who goes *must* serve a year in the military or mines, either mining or fighting the beasts within the mountain. You can either do it simultaneously, or sequentially. 

Yearly competition at the school for musical ability. Chapion gets an incredibly powerful magical instrument.

"The Ghost" wanders halls of school, offering help. Some believe he is one of the founders.
