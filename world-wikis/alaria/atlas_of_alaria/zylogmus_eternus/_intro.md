## Zylogmus Eternus

Tags: region

Stretching all the way across the material plane, Zylogmus Eternus is the "infinite labrynth". Houseing all manners of horrors, and plagued by a terrible curse, Zylogmus Eternus is one of the worst places you can possibly find yourself.

Zylogmus Eternus is an enormous maze of corridors and tunnels spanning thousands of miles, built on the lower surface of the Material Plane. It has undergone countless modifications and iterations over the eons, and is a hodgepodge of new and old. Factions control various parts of this megadungeon, vying for power, but their borders are constantly shifting, as the fight for territory is fought nearly ceaselessly. Dividing all of it is an invisible grid. Nobody knows exactly where the grid lines pass through, but once every month, a random person from within that grid doesn't wake up that night, dying painlessly in their sleep. If someone is sacrificed (burned alive) in one of the eternally burning braziers scattered through the labyrinth, that grid square can avoid having a random person killed.

Up above, there is the Meat Grinder—an impenetrable ceiling of twisting gears and blades. No one has ever gotten through this alive to live the tale. Below, their is the abyss—less explored, more dangerous dungeon. All sorts of rumors exist about what lives the deeper you go, but as with the Meat Grinder, few make it back

Scattered throughout the dungeon are the sacrificier braziers, used to burn those who are given over to the dungeon.

The shadows of the dead come out at night and kill those who are still wandering the hallways. Curfews are enforced.

Many governments have enforced sacrificial pools—they sacrifice those who are weak in order to ensure the safety of themselves.

At the bottom of the dungeon is Emphathum, and then a long journey through the Underrealms to the surface. No one has made it down, as it is guarded by...?

### Emphathum

Emphathum is a region of zero gravity, in the space between the Underrealms and Zylogmus Eternus.

Very few people ever pick up attunements to anything other than the secondary elements, since they spend their entire lives away from stone, fire, fresh air, and clean water.

### History

In a long forgotten time ago, Phlethageros' surface was ruled over by the powerful kingdom of Trivulin. United, the people of Trivulin faught against the demons above, holding them at bay for centuries. An order of paladins known as the Demon Slayers protected the land, and were perhaps the most noble and powerful order of knights to ever exist in all of Alaria. For a millenia, both the demons of Geth and Trivulin remained neck and neck.

The delicate balance came to an end, however, when Xeros, the king's brother, betrayed his people and allied himself with Gorthrusk the Deceiver in order to assassinate his brother and ascend as king. However, Gorthrusk used his allyship to weaken the empire by accusing the Demon Slayers of treason, having many of them killed for their ficticious crimes.

Among the demon slayers who remained were the brothers Averos and Perleus. They were determined to avenge the treachery of Xeros, and shortly after he ascended the throne, the brothers murdered him and temporarily claimed the throne for themselves until a new king could be decided. With a crippled order of paladins, and a kingdom's succession in question, the defenses of Trivinum began to falter. By the end of the year, Trivinum survival was in question.

With no other options, the two paladin brother kings cast two spells with the aid and sacrifice of their kingdom to forever protect their world. The younger brother cast a spell to make an impenetrable wall between their kingdom and the raining hell above, and the elder brother cast a spell cursing the demons to slowly die.

Unfortunately, one of the most powerful demons infiltrated and corrupted the elder brother's spell, reflecting it upon their own kingdom, cursing them to make sacrifices forever. Eldest brother sacrifices himself in shame as first sacrifice for the kingdom.

### The Unmaking of Trivulin

Though the spells held for a time, the corruption ran deeper than anyone realized. Approximately 15,000 BSD, a catastrophic breach of the Nilus—the void itself—tore open beneath Trivulin. The kingdom was not merely destroyed. It was unmade. Erased from existence so completely that even its name has been largely forgotten from the histories of the world, known now only in fragmented texts and fading recollections.

What remains is Zylogmus Eternus—a labyrinth born from Trivulin's geography twisted and warped by the unmaking force. The corridors and caverns that once connected the kingdom's cities have been stretched, inverted, and transformed into an endless maze. The very stone remembers what was lost.

The void breach never fully sealed. Instead, it was merely... contained. The paladin kings and their descendants discovered that the rupture could be held in place through sacrifice—blood spilled into the burning braziers throughout the labyrinth channels a kind of spiritual power that reinforces whatever barrier remains between Zylogmus Eternus and the infinite void beyond. Every month, the invisible grid that divides the labyrinth exacts its price: a random death unless a sacrifice is made to stave off the hunger of what lies at the edge of reality.

### What Waits Below

At the labyrinth's deepest point—at Emphathum and beyond—something stirs. The entity that consumed Trivulin, that unmade an entire kingdom and left only a twisted maze in its place, remains. It does not sleep. It does not rest. It merely watches from the abyss, pressing against the boundaries of the sacrificial seal, waiting for the day when the offerings cease and the barrier fails. For now, the monthly deaths—whether by sacrifice or the grid's random claim—hold it at bay.

But the seal weakens with each passing generation. The people of the labyrinth know this. They whisper it in the dark. The question is no longer if the breach will open again, but when.
