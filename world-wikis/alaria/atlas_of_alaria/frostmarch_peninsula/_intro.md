# Frostmarch Peninsula

## Geography

The Frostmarch Peninsula is a long landmass that juts eastward from the Celedrim Plains, forming the mainland anchor of the Northern Isles archipelago. It serves as a layered transition between the continental interior and the fragmented island chains of the Ocean of Azeros.

### Position and Shape

- **West**: Connects to the Celedrim Plains; the two regions are layered, with the plains slanting down and the peninsula extending beneath and eastward
- **East**: Reaches across toward the Northern Isles, forming the "underneath" section of the archipelago
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros and the scattered islands of the Northern Isles
- **South**: Faces the open waters of the Azeros

The peninsula and Celedrim Plains create a stepped geography—the plains occupying the upper layer, with Frostmarch extending as a lower shelf beneath them, reaching eastward into the island chains.

### Nearby Features

- **Plutochranes Forest**: Lies to the west of the peninsula, north of the Kharvorn sub-range Myorna
- **Northern Isles**: The peninsula transitions into this archipelago as the land fragments into islands

### Notable Subregions

The Frostmarch Peninsula contains a remarkable diversity of terrain given its northern latitude—from dense ancient forests to open tundra to volcanic anomalies.

#### Western Forests

The western half of the peninsula is dominated by massive forests that provide some shelter from the arctic winds:

- **Plutachranes**: The largest forest on the peninsula, covering much of the northwest. Ancient conifers and hardy deciduous trees, crossed by the Mirethion River. Home to scattered Tikhaya settlements and Wytrolape communities.
- **Buleeri T'han**: A dense forest south of Plutachranes, known for its unusual blue-tinged bark on the dominant tree species.
- **Gysheyani**: Eastern forest region, transitioning toward the more open terrain of central Frostmarch.

#### Central Regions

- **Knulak**: A forest-and-lake region in the heart of the peninsula, centered on the Knulak Lakes—a cluster of interconnected bodies of water fed by glacial melt.
- **Nevadi**: A smaller forest south of Knulak, bordering the Qynxlis Mountains.

#### Eastern Regions

- **Danak**: The northwestern reaches, home to scattered Danaki minotaur villages. A region of rolling highlands and sparse forest, perpetually at war with Atyeska to the east.
- **Atyeska**: The northeastern tip, dominated by Enti orc tribes. Dozens of villages along Wolfhawk Bay and the Geshwin Passage.
- **Sunglint**: Northern coastal forest overlooking Startip Bay and the approaches to the Northern Isles.

#### Southern Regions

- **Pyceuri Tuni**: Open tundra plains in the south-central peninsula.
- **Twilight Forest**: The supernaturally darkened forest in the southeast, home to the Spindral (Quill Elves) and the dragon Ural of the Third Moon.
- **Moyginder Forest**: Northern edge of the southern forests, transitioning toward the darkness of the Twilight Forest.

### Bodies of Water

The peninsula is ringed by significant bodies of water:

- **Bay of Teeth**: Northwestern bay, named for the jagged rocks that line its shores
- **Barlomew Inlet**: Eastern inlet separating the main peninsula from the northeastern extension
- **Geshwin Passage**: The strait between Frostmarch and the Northern Isles, rich fishing waters for the Enti
- **Bay of Serpents**: Southern bay near the Twilight Forest
- **Denrik Sea**: Southern waters, beneath which lie the Darkstone Caves
- **Wavecrash Sound**: Southeastern waters off Kyorda

### Climate

The Frostmarch represents the edge of the arctic world. The northern part remains white and snowy year-round, while the southern edges show signs of brown, thawing terrain in warmer seasons. Ice gives way to earth here, but only barely.

## Political Climate

The Frostmarch is not a unified political entity but rather a collection of independent states, tribal territories, and lawless wilderness:

- **Kyorda**: The most organized state, home to Tikhaya humans and Wytrolape giant apes, centered on the capital Xandur.
- **Atyeska**: Enti orc tribal confederation along the eastern coast.
- **Danak**: Danaki minotaur territories in the northwest, perpetually at war with Atyeska.
- **Shykasas**: The anomalous Alekroin kingdom in the south, a jungle somehow thriving in arctic conditions.
- **Spindral Warrens**: The underground realm of the quill elves beneath the Twilight Forest, not a surface nation but a power nonetheless.

## What Makes It Interesting

The Frostmarch is a land of contrasts and ancient conflicts. The Enti-Danaki war has raged for generations with no end in sight. The Twilight Forest's supernatural darkness hides both the secretive Spindral and the terrifying dragon Ural. The Wytrolape's moon-curse creates periodic chaos during Hollownight. And in the south, the Alekroin maintain a jungle kingdom that defies all natural law.

## What Will Go Wrong

- The Enti-Danaki war escalates to the point where one side is annihilated—and the victor looks for new targets
- Ural of the Third Moon stirs from its long quiescence
- The Wytrolape suffer a particularly bad Hollownight, with casualties among their Tikhaya neighbors
- Something emerges from the Darkstone Caves beneath the Denrik Sea
- The Shykasas jungle anomaly begins expanding—or collapsing
