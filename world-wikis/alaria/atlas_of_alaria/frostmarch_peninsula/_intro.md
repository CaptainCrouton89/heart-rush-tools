# Frostmarch Peninsula

## Geography

This landmass juts south from the Northern Isles, serving as a transitional zone between the frozen north and more temperate lands. The northern part is white and snowy, while the southern tip begins to show signs of brown, thawing terrain. It represents the edge of the arctic world, where ice gives way to earth.
