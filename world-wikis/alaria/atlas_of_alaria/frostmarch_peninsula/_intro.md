# Frostmarch Peninsula

## Geography

The Frostmarch Peninsula is a long landmass that juts eastward from the Celedrim Plains, forming the mainland anchor of the Northern Isles archipelago. It serves as a layered transition between the continental interior and the fragmented island chains of the Ocean of Azeros.

### Position and Shape

- **West**: Connects to the Celedrim Plains; the two regions are layered, with the plains slanting down and the peninsula extending beneath and eastward
- **East**: Reaches across toward the Northern Isles, forming the "underneath" section of the archipelago
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros and the scattered islands of the Northern Isles
- **South**: Faces the open waters of the Azeros

The peninsula and Celedrim Plains create a stepped geography—the plains occupying the upper layer, with Frostmarch extending as a lower shelf beneath them, reaching eastward into the island chains.

### Nearby Features

- **Plutochranes Forest**: Lies to the west of the peninsula, north of the Kharvorn sub-range Myorna
- **Northern Isles**: The peninsula transitions into this archipelago as the land fragments into islands

### Notable Subregions

- **Twilight Forest**: A vast, supernaturally darkened forest in the southeastern reaches of the peninsula, home to the Spindral (Quill Elves) who dwell in underground warrens beneath the cursed trees

### Climate

The Frostmarch represents the edge of the arctic world. The northern part remains white and snowy year-round, while the southern edges show signs of brown, thawing terrain in warmer seasons. Ice gives way to earth here, but only barely.
