## Knulak

Tags: forest, lakes

Knulak is a forest-and-lake region in the north-central Frostmarch Peninsula, named for the cluster of interconnected lakes at its center. Bordered by Barlomew Inlet to the east and the vast Plutachranes forest to the west, Knulak occupies a relatively peaceful stretch of the peninsula—far from the conflicts that plague other regions.

### The Knulak Lakes

The Knulak Lakes are a cluster of interconnected bodies of water fed by glacial melt from the Qynxis Mountains to the south. The lakes remain unfrozen for much of the year, warmed by geothermal springs that bubble up from below. This creates a microclimate around the lakes where the forest grows thicker and the winters are marginally more survivable.

The lakes are rich with fish—a crucial food source for the scattered communities of the region. Fishing rights are loosely respected among the various families and small clans who live here.

### The Forest

The Knulak forest is primarily coniferous—hardy pines and firs that can survive the long winters. The trees here are younger than those in Plutachranes to the west, suggesting the region was cleared at some point in the past and has since regrown. What cleared it, and when, is not recorded in any surviving history.

Wildlife is abundant: deer, elk, wolves, and bears make their homes here. The forest supports small, self-sufficient communities who have little contact with the larger powers of the peninsula.

### Settlements

Knulak has no major cities or organized government—just scattered communities:

- Fishing villages clustered around the lakes
- Hunting camps used seasonally
- Isolated homesteads of families who prefer solitude

The people here are largely independent, owing allegiance to no state. They trade occasionally with travelers passing through, but mostly keep to themselves.

### The Xixes River

The Xixes River flows south from the Knulak Lakes toward the Qynxis Mountains. It provides a natural highway through the forest, and small boats can navigate much of its length during the warmer months. The river freezes solid in deep winter, becoming a different kind of highway—a path for sleds and travelers on foot.
