## Ural of the Third Moon

Tags: dragon, frostmarch, twilight forest

A dragon of legendary menace that haunts the Twilight Forest in southeastern Frostmarch Peninsula. Ural is a creature of darkness and shadow, and its presence has shaped the history of this region for centuries.

### The Spindral Exodus

Generations ago, when the ancestors of the Spindral still lived above ground in the Twilight Forest, Ural descended upon them with devastating fury. Unable to face the dragon's power in open battle, the elves fled underground, abandoning their surface settlements and carving out a new existence in the caverns beneath the forest floor.

The Spindral have never forgiven this displacement. They maintain an eternal vigil, watching for signs of Ural's movements, preparing for the day when they might have a chance at vengeance—or when the dragon might seek to finish what it started.

### Nature and Appearance

Little is confirmed about Ural's true form. The darkness of the Twilight Forest and the dragon's apparent mastery of shadow make reliable accounts scarce. What survivors describe:

- Scales that seem to drink in light rather than reflect it
- Eyes that glow with a cold, moonlike luminescence
- An ability to move through the darkness as if it were water

The epithet "of the Third Moon" remains unexplained. Some scholars theorize it refers to an ancient calendar, a cosmic alignment, or perhaps something the dragon consumed or destroyed long ago.

### Current Status

Ural's exact lair and current activities are unknown. The dragon has not been seen in force for decades, though the Spindral report periodic signs of its presence—strange darkness even by Twilight Forest standards, the distant sound of massive wings, prey animals found drained of something more than blood.

Whether Ural sleeps, schemes, or simply waits is a question that keeps the Spindral ever-watchful.
