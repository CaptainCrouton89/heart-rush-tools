## Shykasas

Tags: state, nation

A jungle state in the frozen wastes of the Frostmarch Peninsula—a unique geographical anomaly where tropical vegetation thrives despite the surrounding arctic conditions. Home to the Alekroin, massive alligator-folk whose predatory mindset and rigid traditions have allowed them to dominate this unusual environment for millennia.

The state is ruled by an absolute monarchy, with the King of Shykasas commanding the six noble houses. Royal succession is determined before birth: an egg is selected from the King's brood and kept at a specific temperature, watched separately from its siblings. This chosen heir grows to become more powerful than any other Alekroin.

Shykasas has few allies due to the nonsocial attitudes of its people, and interacts very little with the outside world.
