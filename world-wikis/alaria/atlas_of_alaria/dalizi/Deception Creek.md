# Deception Creek

**Deception Creek** flows from the Hills of the Moon Goblins through the southern Foggy Mountains before disappearing into a sinkhole system several miles from the Shipwreck Coast. The name refers to the creek's frustrating habit of vanishing underground, reappearing miles away, and generally refusing to behave as water should.

## Course (Such As It Is)

The creek originates in the Hills of the Moon Goblins, fed by springs that surface in the saddle between those hills and the main mass of the Foggy Mountains. The water is cold and clear at its source, with a faintly mineral taste that some find unpleasant.

From its source, Deception Creek flows southeast toward the coast—for about four miles. Then it vanishes into a limestone sinkhole, dropping into an underground system that riddles the eastern slopes. The creek reappears three miles to the south, surfaces for another two miles, vanishes again, and repeats this pattern at least twice more before its final disappearance into a cave system that presumably empties into the sea.

Travelers who try to follow the creek toward the coast invariably lose it. Those who try to follow it upstream fare no better. The underground stretches are not navigable—the caves flood completely during rain.

## Why "Deception"?

The Dalizi named this creek after several expeditions attempted to use it as a route to the coast. Each time, the parties followed the water until it vanished, then tried to pick up its trail on the far side of the underground section. Each time, they found themselves somewhere other than where they expected—sometimes miles from where the creek should have resurfaced.

The current theory is that the underground system has multiple outlets, and the creek doesn't always emerge from the same one. Rain, seasonal variation, or underground rockfalls may redirect the flow. Whatever the cause, the creek cannot be trusted for navigation.

There's a Dalizi proverb: *"Trust the creek to find the sea, trust yourself to find the creek."* It means something like "everyone reaches the same destination eventually, but the path will deceive you."

## The Sinkhole Country

The terrain around Deception Creek is riddled with sinkholes, caves, and sudden drops. The limestone bedrock has been dissolved over millennia into a maze of underground passages, some flooded, some dry, most unexplored. The surface terrain is deceptively solid—grass grows over thin crusts that can collapse under a traveler's weight.

Shepherds avoid this area entirely. The handful of explorers who have investigated the cave systems report extensive passages, underground pools, and evidence of habitation by something that leaves claw marks on the walls.

**GM Information:** The claw marks come from **cave crawlers**—eyeless, amphibious predators that evolved in the flooded cave systems. They're roughly dog-sized, with pale, smooth skin, powerful limbs ending in hooked claws, and jaws full of needle-like teeth. They hunt by vibration and scent, and they're well-adapted to the lightless, flooded tunnels.

Cave crawlers are territorial and aggressive, but they rarely venture far from water. They're the reason Deception Creek seems to vanish into "impassable" caves—the caves are physically navigable, but anything that enters is attacked. The creatures are too numerous and too well-suited to their environment to eliminate; expeditions that tried to push through the caves lost members to attacks from the water, the walls, and above.

The cave crawlers are not connected to the Vetharak civilization or the titan—they're simply ordinary predators that colonized the cave system and thrived. However, their presence may explain why the Moon Goblins don't expand in this direction despite their proximity; even dream-touched goblins don't want to fight cave crawlers in flooded tunnels.
