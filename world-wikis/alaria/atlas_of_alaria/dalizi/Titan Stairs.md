# Titan Stairs

The **Titan Stairs** are the western gateway to the Dalizi Highlands, a dramatic stepped formation where the land rises from the lowland Dalizi Confederation toward the mountain wall in a series of massive terraces. Each "step" is a plateau tens of miles across, separated by cliffs and escarpments that must be climbed or circumvented. The name refers to the scale—the formation looks like stairs built for beings far larger than humans.

## Geography

The Titan Stairs occupy roughly eighty square miles at the western edge of the Dalizi Highlands, where the Thundering Mountains and Jackal Mountains give way to lower terrain. The formation consists of four distinct plateaus, each roughly 1,000 feet higher than the previous one:

- **First Step** (1,500-2,500 feet): Rolling hills and grassland at the base, still influenced by the Dalizi lowlands
- **Second Step** (2,500-3,500 feet): Drier terrain with scattered forest, accessible from the Chull Lands
- **Third Step** (3,500-4,500 feet): Rocky highlands, sparse vegetation, approaching the Thundering Mountains
- **Fourth Step** (4,500-5,500 feet): Barren plateau merging with the approaches to Fool's Pass

The escarpments between steps range from 500 to 1,000 feet of near-vertical cliff. Ancient paths wind up through gaps and switchbacks, but the climbs are never easy.

## Origin Theories

The Titan Stairs are geologically unusual. Nothing else in the Dalizi Highlands shows this stepped pattern. Scholars have proposed several explanations:

**Faulting.** The steps represent ancient fault lines where massive blocks of stone shifted upward relative to their neighbors over millennia. This is the most conventional explanation, though it doesn't fully account for the regularity of the formation.

**Erosion.** Differential erosion of layered rock created the terraces, with harder stone forming the plateaus and softer material eroding away to create the escarpments. This theory struggles to explain why the erosion occurred so uniformly.

**Construction.** The stairs were built, shaped by beings with the power to move mountains. Proponents point to the formation's name, arguing that the ancient Dalizi recognized the artificial nature of the terrain. Critics note that no evidence of tool marks or construction techniques has been found.

The Dalizi themselves offer no traditional explanation. The stairs have always been there; the stairs will always be there; the stairs are what they are.

## The Climb

Traveling up the Titan Stairs is the primary route into the western Dalizi Highlands. Each escarpment requires a half-day's climb on the established paths, more if conditions are poor or the traveler is burdened. The entire ascent from the lowlands to the Fourth Step takes two to three days.

The paths are not maintained in any formal sense, but they're well-worn from centuries of use. The most dangerous sections have rope handholds installed by unknown hands—some ancient, some relatively recent. Falls are possible but rare for those who pay attention.

Descending is faster but requires more care. The temptation to hurry has killed climbers who rushed switchbacks or trusted their footing on loose stone.

## The Chull Lands Access

The Second and Third Steps connect to the Chull Lands through relatively gentle slopes, making this the easiest access point between the lowlands and the highland interior. Most traffic through the Titan Stairs is heading to or from the Chull Lands, using the stairs to bypass the impassable Toothlar Mountains to the south.

## Points of Interest

### Giant's Rest

A flat area on the Third Step where a massive stone slab—roughly fifty feet long and twenty feet wide—lies at an angle that resembles a reclining figure. Legend claims this is where a titan stopped to rest during the stairs' construction and was turned to stone. The stone shows no tool marks or carved features; it's just a slab that happens to look somewhat humanoid from certain angles.

### The Watchtowers

Ruined structures on the Fourth Step, positioned to overlook both the Chull Lands and the approaches to Fool's Pass. Three towers survive as partial walls; foundations suggest at least two more once existed. The architecture is unfamiliar, the age uncertain. Someone wanted to watch the western highlands, once.

**GM Information:** These towers were built by the Vetharak civilization to monitor traffic through the Titan Stairs—specifically, to watch for anything emerging from Fool's Pass. The builders knew the dragon (or the dragon's predecessor) controlled the northern side and maintained these posts as early warning stations. The towers were staffed until the civilization's collapse; they've stood empty for millennia since.

### The Counting Stones

A series of carved marks on the escarpment between the First and Second Steps, apparently counting something. The marks number over two thousand and continue up the cliff face higher than any casual reach. Their meaning is unknown; their age is estimated at several centuries minimum.

**GM Information:** The marks count heartbeats—specifically, the titan's heartbeats. The Vetharak civilization developed methods to detect the titan's century-slow pulse and carved a mark for each beat, using the count to predict dream-cycles and plan their rituals accordingly. The marks continue above human reach because the carvers used scaffolding or magic; the project was eventually abandoned when the correlation between heartbeats and dream-intensity proved unreliable. There are 2,347 marks, representing approximately 234,700 years of monitoring.
