# Cerulean Crests

The **Cerulean Crests** are the southernmost major range of the Dalizi Highlands, a chain of blue-tinged peaks that marks the transition between the highland interior and the lowland Dalizi Confederation. The name refers to the distinctive coloration of the stone—a pale blue-gray that appears almost luminous in certain light conditions.

## Geography

The Cerulean Crests extend roughly fifty miles from the Toothlar Mountains in the west to the approaches to the Troyan Mountains in the east. The range is lower than the northern highland chains—most peaks fall between 7,000 and 9,000 feet—but compensates with dramatic scenery and relatively accessible terrain.

The blue coloration comes from a high copper content in the rock, which oxidizes to create the distinctive hue. The effect is most striking in early morning and late evening, when angled light brings out the color. At midday, the mountains look merely gray; at dawn and dusk, they glow.

The range is relatively gentle by Dalizi Highland standards. Passes exist at several points, and the slopes, while steep, are generally climbable. The Cerulean Crests are the most accessible mountains in the highlands—which still makes them dangerous, just less so than the alternatives.

## The River of Petals

The most notable waterway in the Cerulean Crests is the River of Petals, which rises from springs in the central range and flows south toward the Dalizi lowlands. The river gets its name from the flower petals that cover its surface during spring bloom—the copper-rich soils of the Crests support unique alpine flowers that shed their petals into the streams.

The river valley provides the easiest route through the Cerulean Crests, connecting the highland interior to the Dalizi Confederation. This is the primary southern access point to the highlands, less difficult than the Titan Stairs and less dangerous than the Chalaari Valley's proximity to the ogre-infested Troyan Mountains.

## Hills of Meus

The northern slopes of the Cerulean Crests descend into the Hills of Meus, a transitional zone of lower terrain that separates the Crests from the Jackal Mountains and Hills of False Rubies. The Hills of Meus are relatively gentle—rolling grassland with scattered rock outcrops—and provide the easiest walking in the Dalizi Highlands.

The hills are named for Meus, a legendary Dalizi prospector who allegedly found copper deposits here before vanishing into the mountains. Whether his find was real, whether he died in the Crests, and whether any wealth remains undiscovered are questions that still motivate occasional treasure hunters.

## Mining History

The Cerulean Crests have been mined intermittently for centuries. The copper that gives the mountains their color is present in extractable quantities, and several Dalizi states have operated mines in the range.

The mining operations have always been marginal. The ore is good quality, but the remote location and difficult terrain make extraction expensive. Mines open, operate for a few decades, and close when the easy deposits are exhausted or when transport costs become unsustainable.

Currently, two small mining operations function in the eastern Crests, both focused on high-grade deposits that justify the logistics. The miners live in seasonal camps, working during summer and descending to the lowlands for winter.

## The Blue Sickness

Extended exposure to the copper-rich environment of the Cerulean Crests causes health effects collectively known as the Blue Sickness. Symptoms include:

- Bluish discoloration of skin, particularly around the eyes and fingernails
- Metallic taste in the mouth
- Fatigue and weakness
- Liver and kidney problems in severe cases

Miners and long-term visitors are most affected. Short-term travelers rarely stay long enough to develop symptoms. The Dalizi mining companies rotate workers regularly to prevent chronic exposure, but some degree of Blue Sickness is considered an occupational hazard.

The Blue Sickness is treatable if caught early—removing the affected person from the copper-rich environment allows recovery. Left untreated, it can be debilitating or fatal.
