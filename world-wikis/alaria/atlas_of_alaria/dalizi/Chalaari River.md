# Chalaari River

The **Chalaari River** drains the western Troyan Mountains, cutting a valley that provides the primary route between the central Dalizi Highlands and the lowland states of the Confederation. The river is neither large nor particularly impressive, but its valley is the closest thing to a road through this part of the highlands.

## Course

The Chalaari rises from snowmelt and springs in the western Troyan Mountains, gathering water from a dozen tributary streams before flowing southwest toward the Dalizi lowlands. The river is perhaps forty feet wide at its largest, shallow enough to ford in most places during summer but prone to dangerous floods during spring melt.

The upper valley is narrow and steep-sided, cutting through the gap between the Troyan Mountains and the Hills of Meus. This stretch is the most difficult—the river often fills the valley floor, forcing travelers to pick their way along narrow ledges above the water. The valley widens as it descends, becoming gentler terrain as it approaches the lowlands.

The Chalaari eventually joins a larger river system in the Dalizi Confederation proper, contributing its water to agricultural irrigation downstream.

## The Valley Route

The Chalaari Valley is the most practical route through the western Dalizi Highlands. Travelers heading from the lowland states into the central highlands—whether bound for the Chull Lands, the Titan Stairs, or beyond—almost universally use this valley. The alternatives are worse: the Marrow Valley to the east is longer and leads through Moon Goblin territory, while crossing the Troyan Mountains directly is effectively impossible.

The route is not easy. The upper valley requires careful navigation, the river must be crossed several times as it switches banks, and the valley's position between ogre territory and jackal range means both hazards are possible. But it's passable, which in the Dalizi Highlands is high praise.

Travel time from the lowlands to the Chull Lands is approximately five days for a fit party moving at speed. Merchants with loaded pack animals take seven to ten days. Most parties travel in groups for protection.

## The Chalaari Camps

A series of traditional camping spots mark the valley route, located at roughly one-day intervals. These aren't formal waypoints—there are no structures, no services, no authority—but generations of travelers have identified the same defensible positions with good water access. The camps have names passed down through tradition: First Ford, Ogre Watch, High Shelter, The Bend, and several others.

Travelers who know the route move from camp to camp; those who don't may find themselves spending nights in less defensible positions. The camps are first-come, first-served; conflicts over space are not unknown during busy seasons.

## Seasonal Variation

The Chalaari Valley is most passable in late summer and early autumn, when the river is low and the weather is stable. Spring melt makes the upper valley dangerous or impassable, with the river filling its banks and flash floods possible after rain in the Troyans. Winter brings snow to the upper valley and ice to the river, making travel difficult but not impossible for prepared parties.

The ogres of the Ogre Hills are most active in autumn; the dire jackals of the Jackal Mountains are most dangerous at dawn and dusk year-round. Travelers time their movements accordingly.

## Economic Significance

The Chalaari Valley carries most of the traffic between the western Dalizi Highlands and the Confederation proper. This traffic is modest—the highlands produce little that the lowlands need—but it includes:

- **Mineral prospectors** heading to or from the Cerulean Crests and surrounding ranges
- **Hunters** pursuing game in the highlands, particularly the valuable dire jackal pelts
- **Scholars** investigating the mysterious features of the interior highlands
- **Exiles** heading somewhere they won't be followed
- **Fools** convinced they'll find what others missed

The Dalizi states along the lower Chalaari have considered establishing formal control over the valley—waypoints, patrols, tolls—but the traffic has never justified the expense. The valley remains wild.
