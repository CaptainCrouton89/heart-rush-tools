# Ogre Hills

The **Ogre Hills** occupy the eastern Troyan Mountains, a region of broken terrain that supports the largest concentration of ogres in the Dalizi Highlands. The hills are named bluntly for their inhabitants—the Dalizi see no reason for poetry when describing monster territory.

## Geography

The Ogre Hills cover roughly fifty square miles of broken terrain where the Troyan Mountains descend toward the approaches to the Elder Mountains. Elevations range from 4,000 to 7,000 feet—lower than the main Troyan peaks but still rugged. The terrain is a maze of narrow valleys, rocky ridges, and cave-studded hillsides that provide ideal habitat for creatures that prefer cover and ambush.

The vegetation is denser here than in the higher mountains: scrub oak, pine stands, and thick underbrush in the valleys. Water is relatively abundant, with several streams feeding down toward the Dalizi lowlands. The combination of cover, water, and proximity to raiding targets makes the hills prime ogre territory.

## The Ogre Clans

The Ogre Hills support an estimated 800 to 1,200 ogres, divided among five to eight clans depending on how one counts seasonal splits and mergers. The clans are territorial, claiming specific valleys and hillsides, but territories shift with the fortunes of war and the availability of food.

Dalizi ogres are of the Groyza subtype—heavier-built than their plains-dwelling Silzar cousins, with mottled gray-green skin that blends into the rocky terrain. They stand eight to ten feet tall, with powerful builds suited to climbing and grappling. They're not particularly intelligent, but they're cunning in their environment and have long memories for grudges.

### Social Structure

Ogre clans are organized around dominant males who maintain their position through violence. Clan membership is fluid; ogres will switch allegiance after defeats or when better opportunities appear elsewhere. Females and young travel with the clans but don't participate in raids.

The clans raid the Dalizi lowlands opportunistically, taking livestock, stored food, and occasionally people. Raids are most common in late autumn when the clans are building reserves for winter. Human captives are sometimes ransomed; more often they become food.

### Inter-Clan Relations

The clans fight each other as often as they raid humans. Territorial disputes, theft, and personal grudges spark conflicts that can escalate into small wars. The Dalizi have learned to exploit this—encouraging inter-clan conflict when possible reduces pressure on the lowlands.

A unified Ogre Hills would be a serious threat to the nearby Dalizi states. Fortunately, ogre unity is rare and brief. The longest recorded alliance, in 3,298 SD, lasted three months before collapsing into a four-way war over division of spoils.

## Dalizi Response

The Dalizi states closest to the Ogre Hills maintain defensive measures: fortified villages, armed patrols, and early warning systems. When ogre raids become too frequent or too damaging, the affected states organize punitive expeditions that push into the hills, burn ogre camps, and kill whatever they can find.

These expeditions don't eliminate the ogre problem—the terrain makes comprehensive operations impossible—but they reduce pressure for a few years. The ogres learn to associate human aggression with their own overreach, which moderates their behavior. The cycle repeats.

## Points of Interest

### The Blood Caves

A cave system in the central Ogre Hills used by multiple clans as a meeting place during the rare periods of alliance. The caves get their name from the bloodstains on the walls and floors, evidence of the rituals—or murders—that accompany ogre gatherings.

### Skull Ridge

A ridge line in the eastern hills decorated with the skulls of ogre enemies—both human and ogre. The skulls are a territorial marker, warning that this area is claimed. New skulls appear regularly; old ones weather and fall.

### The Trampled Valley

A valley in the southern hills where regular clan warfare has destroyed most vegetation. The ground is torn up, the trees are broken, and the stream that runs through is regularly fouled with blood and waste. Nothing lives here except the ogres who fight over it.
