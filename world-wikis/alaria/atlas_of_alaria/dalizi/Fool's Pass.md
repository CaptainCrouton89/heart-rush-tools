# Fool's Pass

**Fool's Pass** is the only known crossing through the Thundering Mountains, a treacherous route that connects the Dalizi Highlands to the Wanderlands beyond. The name is simultaneously warning and description—only fools use this pass, but sometimes fools have no choice.

## Geography

The pass cuts through the western Thundering Mountains, roughly twenty miles east of where the range meets the Titan Stairs. The route climbs from approximately 5,000 feet on the highland side to nearly 11,000 feet at the summit before descending to about 4,000 feet in the Wanderlands.

The pass is narrow throughout—rarely more than a hundred feet wide, often less. Sheer walls rise on both sides, channeling wind and funneling avalanches onto the route. The trail, such as it is, switchbacks up exposed faces, crosses unstable snowfields, and threads between rock formations that provide neither shelter nor stable footing.

The total distance is roughly twenty miles, but the terrain makes this a three to four day journey for fit travelers. Camp sites are limited to a few protected ledges; spending nights exposed on the route is dangerous.

## Conditions

Fool's Pass is passable only during a brief summer window—roughly sixty days from mid-summer to early autumn. Outside this window, snow depth, avalanche risk, and extreme cold make the crossing effectively impossible.

Even during the passable season, conditions are severe:

- **Altitude.** The summit at 11,000 feet challenges unacclimated travelers with thin air and rapid exhaustion.
- **Weather.** Storms can develop without warning, reducing visibility to feet and making the already-difficult route deadly.
- **Avalanche.** Fresh snow on the surrounding peaks threatens to bury the route. Major avalanches have swept the pass clean, taking everything with them.
- **Rockfall.** The walls shed debris regularly. Travelers learn to listen for the sound of stone on stone above them.

The route has no water sources. Travelers must carry everything they need or melt snow.

## Why "Fool's Pass"?

The name dates to the earliest Dalizi exploration of the range. The expedition that discovered the route lost half its members to the crossing. The survivors reported that only a fool would attempt it—and only a fool would need to.

The name stuck because it accurately describes who uses the pass:

- **Fugitives** — People fleeing justice, debts, or enemies who would rather face the mountains than what pursues them
- **Exiles** — Those expelled from Dalizi territory who have nowhere else to go
- **Adventurers** — Treasure hunters and glory seekers convinced that the Wanderlands hold something worth dying for
- **Scholars** — Researchers investigating the Dragonsong, the Dragon's Gate, or other Wanderlands mysteries
- **The desperate** — People with reasons they don't discuss

Commercial traffic is essentially nonexistent. There's nothing in the Wanderlands worth the cost and risk of the crossing. The few who use the pass are traveling for personal reasons, not profit.

## What Awaits

Those who survive Fool's Pass emerge in the southern Wanderlands, specifically the approaches to the Dragonsong forest. This is not an improvement in safety.

The Dragonsong is the domain of the dragon Ziru, who tolerates no intrusion near the Dragon's Gate. The Wanderlands beyond are cursed, empty, and dangerous. There are no settlements, no supplies, no help.

Travelers who cross Fool's Pass had better have a plan for what comes next, because there's nothing waiting for them except more wilderness and the dragon's attention.

## The Guardians

Several ruined structures stand at the highland approach to Fool's Pass, apparently the remains of guard posts or waypoints. The architecture is old and unfamiliar—not Dalizi construction. Someone once maintained a presence here, controlling access to the pass.

The ruins are empty now. Whatever authority once guarded the pass is long gone. The stones remain, slowly crumbling, a reminder that someone once thought this route worth protecting—or worth blocking.

**GM Information:** These structures were the Vetharak civilization's primary border fortification against whatever lay north of the mountains. The builders knew the Wanderlands were dangerous—possibly they knew about the dragon, possibly about something worse—and maintained a permanent garrison here.

The garrison's purpose was not to stop travelers from leaving (though they tracked departures) but to stop things from entering. The fortifications are designed to defend against something coming *down* the pass, not up it. This implies the Vetharak civilization feared intrusion from the north more than anything in their own territory.

What they feared may have been the dragon's predecessor, or it may have been something else entirely—something the Dragon's Gate was built to contain. The dragon Ziru guards the Gate now; perhaps the Vetharak civilization guarded it before, and these ruins are the southern anchor of that defense.

## Statistics

Crossing rates are not officially tracked, but estimates suggest:

- Roughly 20-30 individuals attempt the pass each year during the summer window
- Approximately half complete the crossing successfully
- Of those who fail, some turn back; others die
- Very few who cross ever return through the pass

The Dalizi Confederation maintains no presence at the pass. Anyone who wants to use it is free to try. Anyone who dies in the attempt is left where they fall.
