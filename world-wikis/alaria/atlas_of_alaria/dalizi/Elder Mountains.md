# Elder Mountains

The **Elder Mountains** rise at the southeastern corner of the Dalizi Highlands, a weathered range of ancient stone that connects the Foggy Mountains to the coastal cliffs above the Shipwreck Coast. The mountains take their name from their geological age—these are among the oldest exposed formations in Aboyinzu, predating the upheavals that created the younger ranges to the west.

## Geography

The Elder Mountains extend roughly forty miles from the Marrow Valley in the northeast to the coastal lowlands in the south. They're lower than the Foggy Mountains to the north—the highest peaks barely exceed 8,000 feet—but compensate with steepness. The slopes are severe, often exceeding 45 degrees, and the rock is fractured and unstable.

The range presents different faces to different directions. The eastern slopes drop sharply toward the Shipwreck Coast, forming the final barrier between the highlands and the sea. The western slopes descend more gradually toward the lowlands of the Dalizi Confederation. The northern face merges with the Foggy Mountains through the narrow passage of the Marrow Valley.

The rock is primarily granite and gneiss, heavily veined with quartz and marked by the distinctive red iron deposits that color the Marrow Creek. Erosion has carved the peaks into jagged profiles—the Elder Mountains look old, worn by time into shapes that younger ranges haven't yet achieved.

## Character of the Range

The Elder Mountains are neither actively hostile like the Foggy Mountains nor merely inconvenient like the ranges farther west. They're simply empty—vast, quiet, and ancient, with an atmosphere that discourages human presence without any obvious threat.

Game is scarce. Water is limited, found only in scattered seeps and the upper reaches of Marrow Creek. The vegetation is sparse: wind-bent pines on the lower slopes, lichen and moss on the exposed heights, nothing at all on the upper peaks. The silence is notable—travelers report that sound seems to die quickly here, as if the old stone absorbs it.

The mountains are not entirely uninhabited. Something lives in the high places—something large enough to leave tracks in the snow, smart enough to avoid being seen. The bones that wash down Marrow Creek suggest it hunts, or perhaps scavenges. The Dalizi call it "the thing in the heights" and leave it at that.

### The Truth (GM Information)

See [Marrow Valley](./Marrow%20Valley.md) for details on **the Shepherd**, the ancient creature that inhabits the high Elder Mountains and is responsible for the bones in the creek.

## Points of Interest

### The Iron Seeps

The red deposits that color Marrow Creek surface throughout the Elder Mountains, staining the rock in streaks of rust. In several locations, iron-rich water seeps from the rock face, creating pools with a blood-like appearance. The water is mineral-heavy but drinkable.

The Dalizi consider the Iron Seeps unlucky but not actively dangerous. They're used as landmarks by the few who travel this way.

### The Plateau

The southern Elder Mountains flatten into a high plateau, roughly 4,000 feet in elevation, before dropping to the coastal lowlands. This plateau offers the only significant level ground in the range—a few square miles of exposed rock and thin soil. Nothing grows here; the wind is constant; the view extends to the Shipwreck Coast on clear days.

Someone built here, once. Foundations are visible in the rock, too weathered to identify their original form. The stonework is old—older than the Dalizi Confederation, older than recorded history in this region.

**GM Information:** These ruins are an outpost of the same pre-human civilization that built Vetharak and the other highland structures. This was a watching post—the Elder Mountains' elevation and eastern position made it ideal for observing the Shipwreck Coast and whatever might approach from the sea. The outpost was abandoned when the civilization collapsed, and the Shepherd may have been left here as a guardian, or may have simply moved in afterward.

### The Eastern Cliffs

Where the Elder Mountains meet the Shipwreck Coast, the range ends in dramatic cliffs plunging hundreds of feet directly into the sea. These cliffs are visible from the coastal waters—the one landmark sailors use when avoiding this treacherous shore. They're called the Elder Teeth in maritime charts, for their jagged profile against the sky.

## Historical Significance

The Elder Mountains were named by early Dalizi explorers who recognized the geological antiquity of the range. The name stuck, though it's acquired other meanings over time. The mountains feel old in a way that goes beyond mere rock—there's a weight to the silence, a sense that the range has been watching whatever passed through since before memory began.

The ruins on the plateau reinforce this feeling. Something existed here before the Dalizi, before anyone currently living. The mountains remember, even if no one else does.
