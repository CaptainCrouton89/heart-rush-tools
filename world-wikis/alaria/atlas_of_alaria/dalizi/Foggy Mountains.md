# Foggy Mountains

The **Foggy Mountains** form the eastern anchor of the Dalizi Highlands' mountain wall, a range perpetually shrouded in mist that has never been fully explored. Rising to over 12,000 feet at their highest peaks, the mountains mark an absolute barrier between the Dalizi Confederation and the Shipwreck Coast—and hide secrets within their fog-wrapped valleys that few have survived to describe.

## Geography

The Foggy Mountains extend roughly eighty miles east to west, from the Hills of Tharoz and Misty Valley in the northeast to the Marrow Valley in the southwest. The range joins the Elder Mountains at its southern end and connects to the broader Dalizi Highland chain through saddles and ridgelines to the west.

The mountains are steep and rugged, with sharp peaks and deep cirques carved by ancient glaciation. Most elevations exceed 8,000 feet; the highest peaks push past 12,000 feet. Snow persists on the upper slopes year-round, while the lower elevations are blanketed in the fog that gives the range its name.

The fog originates from the interaction between cold mountain air and warm, moist air from the coast. It's thickest along the eastern slopes, where visibility can drop to feet for days at a time. The western slopes are clearer, but fog can roll in without warning anywhere in the range.

## Exploration History

The Foggy Mountains remain largely unexplored for a simple reason: explorers don't come back. Every expedition sent into the range's interior has either failed to return or emerged with fewer members than it entered with. The survivors report fog so thick they lost companions standing arm's reach away, terrain that seemed to shift overnight, and encounters with things they struggle to describe coherently.

The Dalizi Confederation has officially declared the mountains off-limits three times in recorded history. Each time, the prohibition eroded over decades as memory faded and treasure hunters grew bold. Each time, a new series of disappearances renewed the warnings.

What's known of the interior comes from the handful of survivors and from accounts that may be centuries old. These describe:

- **Hidden valleys** where the fog parts to reveal lush meadows, only to close in again and refuse to reveal the same valley twice
- **Ruins** of worked stone in styles that match no known culture, covered in carvings that hurt to look at directly
- **Sounds** that echo through the fog—voices, music, screaming—with no discernible source
- **Something large** that moves through the upper peaks, glimpsed only as shadows in the mist

**GM Information:** The Foggy Mountains were the heart of the Vetharak civilization's dream-harvesting operation. The interior is riddled with their facilities—refineries, storage vaults, ritual sites, and the infrastructure that channeled dream-energy throughout the highlands.

The phenomena explorers report are all side effects of this abandoned infrastructure:

- **The hidden valleys** are real places, but they exist partially in the titan's dream-space. Their locations shift based on dream-currents, making them impossible to find consistently. The lush meadows are sustained by residual dream-energy that promotes growth.
- **The ruins** are Vetharak facilities. The carvings "hurt to look at" because they're designed to interface with the dream-space—looking at them engages parts of the mind that shouldn't be activated while awake.
- **The sounds** are dream-echoes, moments from the titan's dreams bleeding into the physical world. The voices are the titan's half-formed thoughts; the music is something it remembers from before it slept; the screaming may be the trapped consciousness of Vetharak citizens who didn't escape the collapse.
- **The something large** is a dream-construct—a manifestation of the titan's sleeping awareness, given temporary physical form by the concentrated dream-energy. It's not truly alive, but it can interact with the physical world. It may be hostile, curious, or simply confused.

**The Fog Itself:** The perpetual fog isn't natural weather—it's a byproduct of the dream-energy concentration, manifesting as persistent moisture because the titan associates sleep with darkness and obscured vision. The fog is, in a sense, the titan's closed eyelids projected onto reality.

## Hills of the Moon Goblins

A distinct range of hills rises within the southern Foggy Mountains, forming a saddle between the main peaks and the approaches to the Elder Mountains. These are the **Hills of the Moon Goblins**, named for their inhabitants.

The Moon Goblins are a subrace distinct from other goblin populations in Alaria. They're pale, nearly colorless, with oversized eyes adapted to the perpetual twilight of their foggy domain. They hunt by sound and smell rather than sight, and they're said to see perfectly well in conditions where humans are effectively blind.

The goblins claim the hills and the surrounding fog-shrouded slopes, raiding downhill into the valleys during certain seasons. They take livestock, supplies, and occasionally people—the latter presumably for labor, food, or worse. Relations with the Dalizi range from tense standoff to open warfare, depending on the year and the boldness of particular goblin bands.

Moon Goblins do not trade. They do not negotiate. Attempts at communication have universally failed, though whether this reflects inability to communicate or simple refusal remains debated.

## Notable Features

### Deception Creek

A waterway that rises in the Hills of the Moon Goblins and flows southeast toward the coast, vanishing underground repeatedly before presumably reaching the sea.

### The Fog Line

An altitude—roughly 2,500 feet on the eastern slopes—above which fog coverage becomes nearly constant. Below the fog line, the mountains are merely difficult. Above it, they're actively hostile.

### The Singing Peaks

Several of the highest peaks produce sounds in high winds—deep, resonant tones that carry for miles. The Dalizi call these the singing peaks and consider them ill-omened. Some scholars believe the sounds are natural, produced by wind moving through rock formations. Others note that the "singing" sometimes occurs on calm days.
