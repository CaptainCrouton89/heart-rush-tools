# Toothlar Mountains

The **Toothlar Mountains** form the southwestern boundary of the Dalizi Highlands, a jagged wall of peaks that separates the highland interior from the lowland approaches. The name refers to the range's profile—from the Dalizi plains, the peaks look like a row of broken teeth against the sky, sharp and irregular and vaguely threatening.

## Geography

The Toothlar Mountains extend roughly forty miles from the western edge of the Titan Stairs to the Cerulean Crests in the east. The range is narrow—rarely more than fifteen miles wide—but tall enough to block easy passage, with most peaks exceeding 9,000 feet and the highest reaching nearly 12,000 feet.

The distinctive "tooth" profile comes from the range's geology. The rock is heavily fractured, with vertical jointing that promotes the formation of isolated spires and pinnacles. Erosion has sharpened these features over millennia, creating a skyline of pointed peaks separated by deep notches.

The slopes are steep and unstable. Rockfall is common; the slopes are littered with debris from past collapses. Snow accumulates in the higher notches year-round, feeding small glaciers that add ice hazards to the already treacherous terrain.

## Impassability

The Toothlar Mountains have no passes. Every attempt to find a route through the range has failed. The notches between peaks look promising from a distance but invariably dead-end at vertical walls or unstable ice. The slopes themselves are too steep and loose for safe climbing.

This impassability shapes traffic patterns throughout the western Dalizi Highlands. Anyone traveling from the lowlands to the highland interior must go around the Toothlars—either north through the Titan Stairs and Chull Lands, or south through the Cerulean Crests and the Chalaari River valley. The mountains effectively split the western approaches in two.

## Why So Difficult?

The Toothlar Mountains present unusual difficulty even by highland standards. Other ranges in the Dalizi Highlands are passable, if dangerous. The Toothlars are simply not.

Several factors contribute:

**Geology.** The fractured rock creates a landscape of vertical features with no gradual slopes. Climbing is the only option, and the rock is too unstable for reliable climbing.

**Ice.** Snow and ice persist in the high notches year-round, blocking the most promising routes with unstable glaciers and ice falls.

**Weather.** The Toothlars generate their own weather patterns, with sudden storms that appear from clear skies. Climbers caught on exposed faces have no shelter.

**Something else.** Survivors of failed crossings report phenomena difficult to explain—compasses behaving erratically, the sensation of being watched from above, sounds from peaks that shouldn't echo. These reports are dismissed by most as stress-induced hallucinations, but they're consistent enough to suggest something unusual about the range.

## The Southern Face

The Toothlars' southern face overlooks the Dalizi lowlands, visible from numerous settlements as a wall of broken stone. The proximity of this impassable barrier to civilized territory has inspired legends, mostly concerning what might live in the inaccessible upper peaks.

The most persistent story involves the Tooth-Dwellers—beings of some kind that inhabit the high pinnacles. No one has seen them clearly; the reports describe movements on peaks too steep for humans to reach, lights in notches at night, occasional sounds that might be voices.

**GM Information:** The Tooth-Dwellers are real. They're **harpies**—a colony of approximately forty individuals that claimed the Toothlar peaks centuries ago. They're intelligent, territorial, and hostile to intruders, which explains why the mountains remain impassable despite appearing to have navigable notches.

The harpies nest in the high pinnacles and use the notches as hunting grounds, waiting for climbers or animals to enter the narrow spaces before attacking from above. They're responsible for the compass anomalies (they collect metal objects, which they hoard in their nests, creating localized magnetic interference), the sensation of being watched (because intruders *are* being watched), and the unexplained sounds (harpy calls, distorted by echoes).

The harpies have no interest in negotiation. They view the mountains as their territory and everything that enters as either threat or prey. However, they rarely descend below the snow line—the lowland Dalizi are safe as long as they don't climb.

**Alternative option:** If harpies feel too mundane, the Tooth-Dwellers could instead be **gargoyles**—stone creatures that were created (or awakened) by the Vetharak civilization to guard this approach. They've outlived their creators and continue their function mindlessly, attacking anything that attempts to cross. Their stone nature explains why they're impossible to see clearly—they look like rock formations until they move.

## Economic Impact

The Toothlar Mountains' impassability increases travel costs throughout the western Dalizi Highlands. Merchants and travelers must add days to their journeys, going around rather than through. Several Dalizi states have invested in improving the alternate routes, reasoning that they can't make the Toothlars passable but can at least make the detours less painful.

The mountains also provide a natural defensive barrier for the lowland states. Any threat emerging from the highland interior must approach through predictable routes; the Toothlars cannot be crossed by armies any more than by individuals.
