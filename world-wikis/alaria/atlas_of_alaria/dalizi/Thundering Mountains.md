# Thundering Mountains

The **Thundering Mountains** form the great northern wall of the Dalizi Highlands, a massive range that separates the highland interior from the Wanderlands to the north. The mountains earn their name from the constant rumble of avalanches, rockfalls, and—according to some—sounds that have no natural explanation. This is the highest and most formidable range in the Dalizi Highlands, and it has only one known crossing.

## Geography

The Thundering Mountains extend over one hundred and fifty miles from the Dragonsong forests in the east to the Titan Stairs in the west. The range is immense—thirty to forty miles wide in most places—and uniformly high. Average elevations exceed 12,000 feet; the highest peaks push past 16,000 feet. Permanent snow and ice cover everything above 10,000 feet.

The range presents a continuous barrier. Unlike most mountain chains, the Thundering Mountains have no gaps, no lower saddles, no gradual descents. The northern face drops steeply toward the Wanderlands; the southern face descends equally steeply toward the highland interior. Travelers must cross the full height of the range or not cross at all.

## The Thundering

The range's distinctive sound is audible from miles away—a constant, low rumble punctuated by louder crashes and booms. The obvious explanation is avalanche activity. The steep slopes and heavy snow load create ideal conditions for slides, and avalanches do occur regularly.

But the sounds don't always correlate with visible avalanches. Sometimes the rumbling continues for hours with no sign of snow movement. Sometimes booms echo from peaks that haven't had fresh snow in weeks. The Dalizi call these unexplained sounds "the voice of the mountains" and consider them ill-omened.

Theories about the sound's source include seismic activity, wind resonance, or magical presence. The Dalizi have no consensus.

### The Truth (GM Information)

The Thundering Mountains sit atop an ancient titan's corpse—one of the beings that shaped the world in the Second Eon, killed during the conflicts that preceded human dominance. The titan is not truly dead; it exists in a state between life and death, its heartbeat slowed to once per century, its breathing measured in decades.

The thundering is the titan stirring in its sleep.

The "voice of the mountains" that occurs without visible avalanches is the titan's dreaming—half-conscious attempts to move limbs that have become stone, to speak with a throat filled with earth. The unexplained phenomena reported by explorers (compasses spinning, the sensation of being watched, terrain that seems to shift) are caused by the titan's dream-logic bleeding into reality.

The titan cannot wake fully—the weight of the mountains pins it, and its vital processes have slowed beyond recovery. But it dreams, and its dreams have power. The ruins scattered throughout the highlands (the watchtowers on the Titan Stairs, the empty temples in the Troyans, the guardian structures at Fool's Pass) were built by a civilization that knew the titan was there and either worshipped it or worked to keep it sleeping.

**Alternative option:** If a sleeping titan feels too significant, the thundering can instead be explained by a massive colony of earth elementals that migrated here during a leyline surge centuries ago. They've hollowed portions of the mountains into a vast hive, and the sounds are their constant excavation and movement. The "voice" is their collective vibration when they synchronize activity.

## The South Wall

The southern face of the Thundering Mountains—the wall visible from the highland interior—is particularly dramatic. For most of its length, the rock rises nearly vertical from the highland floor, a cliff thousands of feet high with no obvious route up. This feature is called the South Wall, and it defines the northern boundary of practical highland travel.

The South Wall has been climbed in a few places by determined mountaineers. None found anything worth the effort—only more snow, more rock, and more dangerous terrain beyond the wall's lip.

## Fool's Pass

One route crosses the Thundering Mountains: **Fool's Pass**, a narrow defile in the western portion of the range. The pass is dangerous, difficult, and leads into territory claimed by the dragon Ziru. It's called Fool's Pass because only a fool would use it—but sometimes fools have reasons.

The pass climbs to approximately 11,000 feet at its highest point, threading between peaks that rise several thousand feet higher on either side. The route is narrow, exposed to weather and avalanche, and passable only during summer months. Even in good conditions, the crossing takes three to four days and claims lives regularly.

Those who survive the pass emerge in the southern Wanderlands, specifically the Dragonsong region. From there, travel options are limited: the cursed Donclik Peninsula to the west, the dragon's domain to the north and east, or back through the pass. Most who cross are running from something worse than what awaits.

## Exploration Attempts

The Dalizi Confederation has sponsored several expeditions into the Thundering Mountains over the centuries. All have failed. The range defends itself with altitude, weather, terrain, and the unexplained phenomena that make even survivors reluctant to discuss their experiences.

The most recent significant attempt—the Confederation Survey of 3,312 SD—spent two years mapping the southern approaches and made three attempts on the range itself. The first attempt was turned back by weather; the second lost four climbers to an avalanche; the third reached the ridgeline before retreating in the face of "conditions that made further progress inadvisable." The survey report's vagueness on this point has inspired considerable speculation.
