# Marrow Valley

The **Marrow Valley** cuts through the southwestern Foggy Mountains, a narrow defile that connects the Elder Mountains to the central highlands. The valley takes its name from Marrow Creek, which runs red with iron-rich sediment during spring melt—and from the bones that occasionally wash down with the seasonal floods.

## Geography

The Marrow Valley runs roughly northeast to southwest for thirty miles, connecting the Elder Mountains plateau to the gap between the Foggy Mountains and Jackal Mountains. The valley floor is narrow—rarely more than a mile wide—with steep walls rising 2,000 to 3,000 feet on either side.

Marrow Creek occupies the valley bottom, a fast-moving stream that drops nearly 1,500 feet over its course. The creek has carved the valley deeper over millennia, leaving a V-shaped profile with unstable slopes prone to rockfall. The valley floor is boulder-strewn, the debris of countless slides.

Vegetation is sparse. The valley walls are too steep for most plants to gain purchase, and the valley floor floods too regularly for trees to establish. Scrub grass and hardy moss cling to the rocks; little else survives.

## The Red Water

Marrow Creek runs clear for most of the year, but during spring snowmelt, the water turns a deep rust-red. The color comes from iron-rich deposits in the Elder Mountains—natural erosion, nothing more—but the effect is striking. From a distance, the creek appears to be running with blood.

The red water carries a slightly metallic taste but is safe to drink. Local shepherds have known this for generations, but travelers often refuse to trust water that looks so unnatural. Some maintain the red color is a warning, that the water carries contamination from something in the Elder Mountains. The shepherds find this superstition amusing.

## The Bones

More concerning than the water's color is its occasional cargo. Spring floods in the Marrow Valley carry debris down from the Elder Mountains—rocks, sediment, uprooted vegetation, and bones. Animal bones, mostly: mountain goats, deer, the occasional predator. But also, unmistakably, human bones.

No one lives in the Elder Mountains. No one claims to, at least. Yet bones appear in the creek every few years, tumbled smooth by their journey down the rapids, bleached by sun and water. Most are fragmentary—a femur here, a skull there—but occasionally more complete remains appear.

The Dalizi have theories. Some blame the Moon Goblins, suggesting the goblins dump their dead (or their meals) into the creek's headwaters. Others point to travelers who disappeared in the mountains, their remains only now washing free. A few speak of older inhabitants, of something in the Elder Mountains that predates human memory.

The bones are generally left where they're found. Disturbing them is considered bad luck.

### The Truth (GM Information)

The bones come from **the Shepherd**—a massive, ancient creature that lairs in the high Elder Mountains. The Shepherd is a remnant of the Second Eon, possibly related to the sleeping titan beneath the Thundering Mountains. It resembles a vast, gaunt humanoid with elongated limbs, standing perhaps forty feet tall, with skin like weatherite stone and eyes that reflect no light.

The Shepherd is not aggressive by nature. It's a scavenger and opportunistic predator that has survived by being patient and avoiding notice. It hunts by waiting—sometimes for years—until prey wanders close enough to catch. It doesn't pursue; it simply exists in the high places, and eventually something dies near it.

The bones in Marrow Creek are the Shepherd's refuse. It drags kills back to its lair, consumes what it wants, and discards the rest into the creek's headwaters. The human bones are from travelers who ventured too high—explorers, lost shepherds, the occasional fugitive seeking refuge in the mountains. The Shepherd didn't hunt them specifically; they simply came within reach.

**The Shepherd's behavior:**
- It moves primarily at night or during storms, when visibility is poor
- It can remain motionless for weeks, resembling a rock formation
- It's intelligent enough to recognize threats and avoid them
- It has no interest in descending to lower elevations where humans are common
- It may have some connection to the titan's dreams, explaining its unnatural longevity

**Plot hooks:** The Shepherd could be a threat if players venture into the high Elder Mountains, a source of Second Eon lore if approached carefully, or evidence of something larger—perhaps it serves a purpose, standing watch over something in the mountains that must not be disturbed.

## Travel and Use

The Marrow Valley is the most practical route between the eastern and western sections of the Dalizi Highlands—which is to say, it's merely difficult rather than impossible. The terrain is challenging but passable for determined travelers on foot. Pack animals can manage with care, though rockfall is always a risk.

No permanent trail exists. The seasonal floods rearrange the boulder fields regularly, and what was a clear path one year may be blocked the next. Travelers through the valley typically take two to three days, camping on high ground away from the creek.

The valley sees light traffic: the occasional merchant shortcutting between Dalizi states, hunters pursuing game into the highlands, and scholars investigating the bone mystery. No one lingers.
