# Rivoleta River

The **Rivoleta River** drains the eastern Chull Lands, flowing south through the Hills of Meus before joining the River of Petals in the northern Cerulean Crests. The name means "little violent one" in an old Dalizi dialect, referring to the river's unpredictable and occasionally dangerous character.

## Course

The Rivoleta rises from numerous springs and seeps in the eastern Chull Lands, gathering water from the wetlands before finding a definite channel at the basin's southern edge. The upper river is slow and meandering, spreading across multiple channels through marshy ground—chull territory, dangerous to approach.

As the river enters the Hills of Meus, the gradient increases and the water picks up speed. This middle section is the most treacherous: the riverbed is rocky and irregular, with sudden drops, unexpected rapids, and logjams that redirect flow without warning. The "violent" in the river's name refers primarily to this stretch.

The lower Rivoleta calms as it approaches the Cerulean Crests, settling into a definite channel before joining the River of Petals. This confluence occurs in a small valley that marks one of the easier passes through the northern Crests.

## Character

The Rivoleta is not a large river—perhaps sixty feet wide at its broadest, twenty feet in the narrow stretches. But it's energetic, fed by abundant water from the Chull Lands and dropping significantly over its twenty-five mile course.

The water carries sediment from the Chull Lands, giving it a murky brown color for most of its length. This sediment includes copper from the Cerulean Crests watershed, which gradually gives the lower river a greenish tint. The water is drinkable but has a mineral taste.

Fish are present but not abundant—the chulls in the upper river reduce prey populations, and the copper content in the lower river limits what can survive. The few fish that do thrive here are tough, oily species that most people won't eat unless they have no choice.

## Crossings

The Rivoleta must be crossed by anyone traveling between the Chull Lands and the southern highlands. This is less straightforward than it sounds.

The upper river is too spread out across wetlands to cross easily, and the wetlands are chull territory. The middle river is fast and rocky, with few points where fording is safe. The lower river is more manageable, but it's also farther from most travel routes.

Most travelers cross at **Stone Ford**, a natural rock formation in the middle section where the river spreads shallow over a flat stone shelf. The crossing is manageable in summer when the water is low; in spring melt, it's dangerous or impossible. There are no bridges—the traffic doesn't justify construction, and floods would destroy any structure eventually.

## The Violent Season

Spring melt transforms the Rivoleta from a difficult river to a dangerous one. The water rises several feet, the current accelerates dramatically, and debris from the melting Chull Lands—including dead chulls, animal carcasses, and uprooted vegetation—chokes the channel.

During the violent season, the river cannot be crossed at Stone Ford. Travelers must either wait for the waters to recede (typically several weeks) or detour far downstream to the River of Petals confluence. The detour adds days to any journey.

The violent season also deposits debris throughout the river corridor, including the occasional valuable item swept from upstream. After the waters recede, locals pick through the deposits looking for anything worthwhile. They find tools, weapons, and sometimes human remains—evidence of travelers who didn't survive the Chull Lands.
