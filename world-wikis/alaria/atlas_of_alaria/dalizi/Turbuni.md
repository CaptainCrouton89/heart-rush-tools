## Turbuni

Tags: city-state, border circle

A prosperous city-state on the northern border of the Dalizi Confederation, positioned where the savanna of Central Aboyinzu begins to rise into the Dalizi highlands. Turbuni shares jurisdiction over the School of Summoning with Chechol—a arrangement that has made it wealthy, cosmopolitan, and completely blind to the danger building next door.

The city sits on a low bluff overlooking fertile farmland, with the distant gleam of Lake Ntsa visible to the northwest. Roads run north to Chechol's river valleys, south into the Dalizi heartland, and west toward the other Border Circle states. Merchants, pilgrims, and students pass through constantly, making Turbuni feel more worldly than its size suggests.

### Character

Turbuni thinks of itself as a gateway—between the Confederation and Central Aboyinzu, between secular government and magical learning, between mundane commerce and supernatural power. The city profits from all of these connections without fully belonging to any of them.

The population (~12,000) includes a significant minority of foreigners: Chechol humans, Rentar pilgrims, scholars from across Aboyinzu, and merchants seeking the Northern Corridor trade route. This diversity gives Turbuni an open, tolerant atmosphere—unusual in the Confederation, where religious and regional identities usually run deeper.

The city's wealth comes from three sources:
- **School fees**: The School of Summoning pays taxes to both Turbuni and Chechol, and the city profits from housing students, selling supplies, and providing entertainment
- **Northern trade**: Goods moving between the Confederation and Central Aboyinzu pass through Turbuni's markets
- **Lake Ntsa fishing**: The city controls the southern shore of Lake Ntsa, though the fishing is modest compared to Lake Tonactlet Chipe

### Government

Turbuni is ruled by the **Council of Factors**—a body of twelve wealthy merchants who buy their seats and govern the city as a commercial enterprise. The current First Factor is **Pemba Ashani**, a shrewd negotiator in her sixties who has held her position for twenty years.

The Council's primary concern is profit. They maintain good relations with Chechol because trade requires it. They participate in Border Circle politics because isolation would be dangerous. They pay minimal attention to the Dalizi succession crisis because it doesn't affect their bottom line.

This pragmatism has served Turbuni well. The city has avoided wars, maintained neutrality in Confederate disputes, and grown steadily wealthier. It has also left them catastrophically unprepared for a threat that doesn't care about trade relationships.

### The School Connection

The School of Summoning sits on a ridge overlooking Lake Ntsa, technically on territory claimed by both Turbuni and Chechol. Neither state has ever resolved the jurisdictional dispute—the ambiguity serves everyone's interests. The School answers to no single authority, Turbuni and Chechol both collect partial taxes, and everyone pretends this is a deliberate arrangement rather than centuries of failed negotiations.

Turbuni provides the School with:
- Student housing (the School's campus is cramped)
- Entertainment and amenities students can't find on campus
- Market access for faculty seeking exotic components
- A neutral ground for meetings the School prefers to hold off-campus

In return, the School provides Turbuni with:
- Tax revenue
- Magical consultation services
- Prestige by association
- A constant flow of visitors who spend money

This relationship has shaped Turbuni's culture. The city is comfortable with magic in ways that unsettle visitors from the conservative South Wall states. Summoners walk the streets openly. Shops sell ritual components without discretion. The Council of Factors includes two members with formal magical training.

### The Blind Spot

Turbuni's merchants have noticed oddities from Chechol. Rentar visitors have grown more confident, more certain, more prone to long silences when asked direct questions. Human merchants from the Riki Valley seem uneasy about things they won't discuss. The School has mentioned "psychic anomalies" in private conversations.

None of this has coalesced into concern. Turbuni's culture prizes pragmatism over speculation. The Rentar have always been religious; perhaps they're having a revival. The humans have always been quiet; perhaps they're just tired. The School is always detecting anomalies; that's what magical researchers do.

First Factor Pemba has more immediate worries: the succession crisis, the Border Circle's vulnerability, the possibility that a new Paramount might impose unfavorable trade policies. Chechol is stable. Chechol is profitable. Chechol is the last thing she needs to worry about.

She's wrong.

### What Comes Next

When the Red Army activates, Turbuni will have perhaps two days' warning—if that. Rentar visitors will leave suddenly. The roads north will go quiet. Then columns of minotaur warriors will appear on the horizon, marching with the terrible certainty of divine purpose.

The Council of Factors will try to negotiate. They always negotiate. It won't work—Gynor's soldiers don't want trade agreements. They want conquest.

Turbuni's walls are adequate against bandits, not armies. The city guard numbers 500, trained for peacekeeping, not war. The School of Summoning might help, but its faculty will be dealing with their own crisis—realizing that their communion techniques spawned this catastrophe.

The city will fall. The question is whether anyone escapes to warn the Confederation—and whether the Confederation, paralyzed by succession politics, can respond in time.

### Notable Locations

**The Factor's Hall**

The Council's meeting place and Turbuni's administrative center. A practical stone building decorated with trade goods from across Aboyinzu—more museum than palace. The Council meets weekly to review accounts, resolve disputes, and congratulate themselves on their prosperity.

**The Scholar's Quarter**

A district of boarding houses, taverns, and shops catering to School students and faculty. More chaotic than the rest of Turbuni—magical mishaps are common, and the city guard has learned not to investigate strange noises too closely.

**Lake Ntsa Shore**

The fishing docks and associated warehouses. Modest compared to the lakeside cities, but the source of fresh fish and a pleasant recreational area for wealthy residents.

**The Northern Gate**

The road to Chechol passes through here. The gate is larger than necessary—built optimistically during a period when the Council hoped to become a major trading hub. Now it mostly processes pilgrims heading to the School or the Pyramid of Five Sides.

When the Red Army comes, this is where they'll enter.
