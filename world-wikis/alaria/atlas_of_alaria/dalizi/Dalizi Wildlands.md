### Nykotheryx Amberylika

An ancient forest, once home to the Dark Elves. Ancient dragon totems of bone and silver dot the forest. Unbeknownst to many, these totems hold the spirits of powerful dark elves. Rather than go to Celestia, powerful dark elven leaders preferred to remain on the material plane. Like daemons of Celestia, the spirits in these totems still have power. Unlike spirits of Celestia, they will not fade upon being forgotten. Those who find their true names are likely to be showered in power as thanks.

Within the forest live the Luma, crystaline and irridescent pixies that live among the upper reaches of the forest, and the Shyoka Saseidi, gnomish caretakers of the forest.
