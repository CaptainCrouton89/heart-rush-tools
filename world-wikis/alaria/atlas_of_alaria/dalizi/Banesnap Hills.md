# Banesnap Hills

The **Banesnap Hills** run along the eastern face of the Foggy Mountains, forming a broken barrier of ridges and valleys between the mountain wall and the Shipwreck Coast. The hills take their name from the banesnap beetle, an insect whose bite causes agonizing muscle cramps—the hills are home to the largest known population of these creatures in Alaria.

## Geography

The Banesnap Hills extend roughly sixty miles north to south, from the Misty Valley to the northern slopes of the Elder Mountains. They're relatively low—most ridges top out under 2,000 feet—but steep and irregular, with numerous small canyons cutting through the terrain. The eastern slopes drop sharply toward the sea, offering dramatic views of the Shipwreck Coast from exposed ridgelines.

The hills are drier than the Foggy Mountains they border, sitting in a rain shadow that leaves them exposed to sun and wind. Vegetation is sparse: tough grasses, thorny shrubs, and the occasional twisted pine that has survived the wind. The soil is thin and rocky, better suited to insects than agriculture.

## The Banesnap Beetle

The beetle that gives these hills their name is about an inch long, with iridescent black wing covers and powerful mandibles. They nest in rocky crevices and emerge at dusk to hunt smaller insects. Their bite is not venomous in the traditional sense, but it injects a compound that causes severe muscle spasms lasting several hours.

A single bite is painful but not dangerous. Multiple bites can be life-threatening, as the accumulated muscle cramping can affect breathing and the heart. Travelers who camp in the hills quickly learn to check their bedding and boots.

The beetles are most active in warm weather. Winter travel through the Banesnap Hills is safer but presents its own challenges—exposed ridges catch fierce winds, and snow can obscure the already treacherous footing.

## The Wreck Watchers

A peculiar tradition exists among the shepherds of the nearby Dalizi states: young people seeking to prove their courage will climb to the high points of the Banesnap Hills to watch the Shipwreck Coast. From certain vantage points, the wrecks scattered along the shore and in the shallows are visible on clear days.

These "wreck watchers" compete to identify the most ships, describe the most details, or stay the longest on the exposed ridges. The practice is dangerous—the beetles, the wind, and the unstable terrain claim lives regularly—but it persists as a rite of passage. Some watchers claim to have seen lights on the wrecks at night, or movement among the scattered hulls.

## Strategic Irrelevance

Despite commanding views of the eastern sea, the Banesnap Hills have no military value. No army could climb them in formation, no supplies could be reliably transported across them, and there's nothing on the far side worth defending. The hills exist as a barrier, nothing more—a final obstacle between the Foggy Mountains and the sea that breaks the coast.
