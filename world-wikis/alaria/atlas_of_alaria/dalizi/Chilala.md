## Chilala

Tags: state, elector, lakeshore circle

The largest state in the Dalizi Confederation—by population, by territory, by economic output, and by ambition. Chilala controls the eastern shore of Lake Tonactlet Chipe and dominates the Lakeshore Circle's politics. Its ruler, Regent-Queen Mwenekazi, is positioning to become the next Paramount, and everyone knows what that would mean: the end of the Confederation as a loose alliance, and the beginning of Chilala hegemony.

The state stretches from the lake shore into the highlands northeast, encompassing rich fishing grounds, productive farmland, and control of trade routes to the Elder Wilds. Its population exceeds the next three states combined. Its capital, Kisro, rivals Metato as the Confederation's largest city. Its armies—while less professional than Shunde's—can field more soldiers than any other member state.

Chilala's neighbors fear it. Chilala's allies benefit from its protection while resenting its dominance. The Confederation's political structure was designed to prevent any single state from becoming too powerful. Chilala is testing whether that design can hold.

### Government

**The Regency**

Chilala is technically ruled by **Prince Mukwano**, a boy of thirteen who inherited the throne when his father drowned in Lake Tonactlet Chipe five years ago. In practice, power lies with his mother, **Regent-Queen Mwenekazi**, who governs "until the prince comes of age."

Mwenekazi has shown no indication she plans to surrender power when Mukwano turns eighteen in five years. Court observers note that the prince's education emphasizes philosophy and arts rather than statecraft. His tutors are all Mwenekazi loyalists. His scheduled public appearances are carefully managed. Some whisper that he's being deliberately kept unprepared.

The Regent-Queen herself is brilliant, ruthless, and patient. She's spent five years consolidating control over Chilala's administration, replacing old nobility with her creatures and building a network of informants throughout the Confederation. She's the most dangerous politician in Dalizi, and she knows it.

**The Court**

Chilala's court is a snake pit of competing factions:

- **The Queen's Circle**: Mwenekazi's loyalists, who profit from her rule and will fight to maintain it
- **The Legitimists**: Nobility who want Prince Mukwano to rule in his own right (and who expect to influence him more easily than his mother)
- **The Old Families**: Ancient bloodlines who resent Mwenekazi's lowborn favorites
- **The Temple Faction**: Lake's Children priests who want religious policy to favor their faith

Mwenekazi plays these factions against each other expertly. She gives the Legitimists just enough hope. She bribes the Old Families just enough. She makes public displays of Lake's Children devotion. No faction can unite against her because each believes it might still get what it wants.

### Culture

**Lake's Children Heartland**

Chilala is the spiritual center of the Lake's Children faith. The lake is a living god; its moods are prophecy; its depths are sacred. Every significant decision—from royal marriages to military campaigns—must be blessed by lake-sign: a particular pattern of waves, a configuration of fish, a dream revealed to the priests.

This gives the Lake's Children priesthood enormous power. The Temple of Waters in Kisro can delay royal edicts by declaring the lake "speaks against it." Mwenekazi has spent years cultivating temple support, and the current High Priest is her creature—but the relationship remains delicate.

**Fisher Culture**

The lake shore is home to thousands of fishing villages, where communities have harvested the waters for generations. These fisherfolk form Chilala's common population—hardworking, superstitious, loyal to the lake and its priests rather than to distant nobility.

Mwenekazi has cultivated fisher support carefully. She's reduced noble fishing monopolies, funded temple schools in coastal villages, and made public visits to even the smallest communities. The fisherfolk adore her. They'll fight for her if she asks.

**Highland Integration**

The highland territories northeast of the lake were conquered two generations ago. Their population—Ancestors' Way followers with highland culture—has never fully integrated. They pay taxes, obey laws, and quietly resent Kisro's rule.

Mwenekazi has tried to win highland loyalty through development projects and religious tolerance. Results are mixed. The highlands remain Chilala's least stable region, and if the state faces serious crisis, highland revolt is possible.

### The Paramount Campaign

Mwenekazi wants the Paramount seat. She's been campaigning—discreetly—since Paramount Makisani's health began to fail.

**Her Pitch**

To states that fear instability: "The Confederation needs strong leadership. Only Chilala has the resources to provide it."

To states that fear Shunde: "Better me than a military strongman who'll turn the Confederate Army on internal enemies."

To states that want prosperity: "Lake trade benefits everyone. A Chilala Paramount would invest in infrastructure, reduce internal tariffs, grow the economy."

**Her Reality**

Mwenekazi's Paramountcy would transform the Confederation. She'd use Chilala's resources to make the position powerful—building a real Confederate Army under her command, centralizing tax collection, establishing precedents that future Paramounts couldn't undo. The Confederation would become, effectively, a Chilala empire with a thin constitutional veneer.

Some states would benefit—those who ally with Chilala early. Most would lose autonomy. A few would resist and be crushed.

**Her Obstacles**

- **Shunde** will never support her. General Shundari sees her as a threat and has his own ambitions.
- **Lanwadanzi** fears her. A strong Paramount would threaten their trade autonomy.
- **The smaller states** are scared. Chilala dominance means absorption.
- **Kafula** has genealogical grudges against Mwenekazi's bloodline dating back centuries.

Currently, Mwenekazi has one confirmed Elector vote (Chilala itself) and one probable vote (Kafula, whose grudges might flip). She needs four. The campaign continues.

### Military

Chilala's army is large but uneven. The core is 8,000 professional soldiers—well-equipped, adequately trained, loyal to the Regent-Queen. Beyond that, Chilala can call up 20,000+ militia from the fishing villages and farming communities—enthusiastic but poorly trained.

The state also maintains a small lake fleet: armed fishing boats, really, but effective for patrol and piracy suppression. No other Confederation state has naval capacity.

Mwenekazi has been quietly professionalizing the army, hiring Shunde veterans as trainers and investing in equipment. If civil war comes, Chilala will be ready.

### Notable Locations

**Kisro (Capital)**

A sprawling city of 80,000 on the eastern lake shore. The royal palace, the Temple of Waters, and the commercial districts cluster near the water; poorer neighborhoods sprawl inland. The city is beautiful, wealthy, and utterly certain of its own importance.

**The Temple of Waters**

The Lake's Children's holiest site—a complex of pools, channels, and meditation chambers where priests interpret the lake's will. Pilgrims come from across the Confederation to seek blessings. The High Priest's pronouncements can move markets and topple governments.

**The River of Petals**

A river flowing into Lake Tonactlet Chipe from the northeast, named for the flowering trees along its banks. The river marks the boundary between core Chilala and the conquered highlands. Crossing it means entering territory that doesn't quite feel like the same state.

### Player Hooks

**The Regency**

- Prince Mukwano secretly wants to rule. He's smarter than his tutors report. He needs allies outside his mother's network.
- A Legitimist noble hires the party to "educate" the prince—code for breaking Mwenekazi's control over him.
- Mwenekazi suspects a plot against her regency and wants investigators. She pays well and punishes failure.

**The Campaign**

- An Elector state hires the party to find dirt on Mwenekazi—anything that might dissuade voters.
- Mwenekazi hires the party to secure a wavering Elector's vote. Methods are at their discretion.
- Someone is assassinating Mwenekazi's campaign agents. She wants to know who—and she wants them stopped.

**The Highlands**

- Highland rebels contact the party, seeking weapons or mercenaries.
- Mwenekazi wants the highland situation stabilized before the succession. She needs operatives who can work without official backing.
- An Ancestors' Way temple in the highlands has discovered something that could embarrass the Lake's Children—or unite the faiths against a common enemy.
