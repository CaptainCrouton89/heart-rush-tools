# River of Petals

The **River of Petals** flows through the heart of the Cerulean Crests, draining the copper-rich highlands before descending to the Dalizi lowlands. The river takes its name from the carpet of flower petals that covers its surface during spring and early summer—a phenomenon unique to these mountains and visible nowhere else in Alaria.

## Course

The River of Petals rises from springs high in the central Cerulean Crests, fed by snowmelt and groundwater filtering through copper-bearing rock. The headwaters are cold, clear, and tinted faintly green from dissolved minerals.

The upper river flows northeast through a high valley, gathering tributaries including the Rivoleta from the Chull Lands. The valley is one of the gentler landscapes in the Dalizi Highlands—steep-sided but with a relatively flat floor, passable for travelers and even small wagons in good weather.

Below the Rivoleta confluence, the river turns south, cutting through a gap in the Cerulean Crests before descending toward the Dalizi lowlands. This lower section drops more steeply, with several small waterfalls and rapids that make the river unnavigable.

The total course is approximately forty miles from source to the point where it leaves the highlands.

## The Petals

For roughly sixty days each year, from late spring through early summer, the River of Petals earns its name. The copper-rich soils of the Cerulean Crests support unique alpine flowers—species found nowhere else—that bloom in profusion during this window. When the blooms fade, the petals fall into the streams and rivers, accumulating until the water itself appears to be flowing color.

The effect is most dramatic on the main river, where countless tributary streams contribute their petal loads. At peak bloom, the river surface is completely obscured by floating petals in shades of blue, purple, white, and occasionally pink. The petals drift downstream, gradually waterlogging and sinking, creating a shifting carpet that moves with the current.

The flower species responsible are adapted to the copper-rich soil that would kill most plants. They've evolved to incorporate copper into their tissues, which contributes to their unusual coloration. The petals are mildly toxic if eaten in quantity, though a few won't cause harm.

## The Petal Trade

The flowers of the Cerulean Crests have modest commercial value. Dried petals are used as dye, producing colors difficult to achieve with other materials. The whole flowers, properly preserved, are prized by collectors and used in certain alchemical preparations.

Harvesting is labor-intensive. The flowers bloom in remote, high-altitude locations accessible only during the brief summer window. Gatherers must climb into the mountains, collect the blooms before they fall, and transport them down before they wilt. It's seasonal work for specialists willing to make the journey.

The river itself sometimes delivers petals to the lowlands, though waterlogged petals are less valuable than fresh ones. Enterprising merchants have attempted to collect floating petals near the river's exit from the highlands, with mixed success.

## Travel Route

The River of Petals valley is the primary southern route into the Dalizi Highlands. The terrain is gentler than the alternatives, the water supply is reliable, and the scenery—especially during petal season—is spectacular by highland standards.

The route connects to:
- **North**: The Chull Lands via the Rivoleta confluence
- **East**: The Troyan Mountains via the Hills of Meus
- **West**: The Toothlar Mountains (impassable, but visible)
- **South**: The Dalizi lowlands and the Confederation proper

Travel time from the lowlands to the Rivoleta confluence is approximately three days. The route is passable for pack animals and, in good conditions, for wheeled vehicles, making it the closest thing to a proper road in the highlands.

## The Blue Water Effect

Below the Rivoleta confluence, the River of Petals takes on a distinctive blue-green color from accumulated copper minerals. This "blue water" persists well into the lowlands, marking the river's course across the Dalizi plains.

The blue water is drinkable but has a pronounced metallic taste. Long-term consumption contributes to the Blue Sickness that affects miners in the Cerulean Crests, though the concentration is lower than in the mountains themselves. Lowland communities along the river usually have alternative water sources.

Crops irrigated with blue water show elevated copper levels. This is beneficial in small amounts—the crops are slightly more resistant to certain pests—but excessive irrigation can poison the soil.
