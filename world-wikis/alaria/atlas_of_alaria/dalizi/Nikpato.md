## Nikpato

Tags: state, elector, border circle

The most anxious state in the Dalizi Confederation. Nikpato sits at the northern frontier, directly in the path of every invasion, raid, and refugee wave from Central Aboyinzu. It's been conquered three times in the last century. Its borders have shifted with every generation. Its people have learned that survival means backing the winning side—and they're terrified of backing the loser in the coming succession.

Nikpato holds an Elector seat, which gives it influence wildly disproportionate to its actual power. Every succession crisis sees the other Electors courting Nikpato's vote with promises of protection, aid, and favorable treaties. Nikpato's rulers have learned to extract maximum concessions for their support—and to be very, very careful about who they commit to.

The current ruler, **Prince-Elector Ndaba**, is a nervous man in his fifties who has spent his entire reign preparing for catastrophe. He's fortified every town, stockpiled every granary, maintained diplomatic ties with every potential ally. He knows the next crisis is coming. He just doesn't know from which direction.

He should be looking north.

### Geography

Nikpato occupies the northwestern Dalizi Confederation, where the savanna of Central Aboyinzu transitions into the Dalizi highlands. The terrain is rolling grassland—good for farming, terrible for defense. No mountains, no major rivers, no natural barriers to slow an invading army.

The state's only geographic advantage is its central position within the Border Circle. Invasions from the north must pass through Nikpato to reach the Confederation's heart—which means the other states have strong incentives to help defend it. At least in theory.

In practice, Confederate "help" arrives late, underfunded, and often comes with political strings. Nikpato has learned not to rely on allies.

### History of Vulnerability

**The First Conquest** (3289 SD)

A Terrenia warlord swept south with 8,000 cavalry, smashing Nikpato's army in open battle and occupying the capital for two years. Confederate forces eventually drove him out, but Nikpato's population had already been subjected to occupation, taxation, and "recruitment" that left a generation of young men dead in Terrenia's internal wars.

**The Second Conquest** (3341 SD)

A coalition of Central Aboyinzu states invaded during a Confederate succession crisis. No help came—the Confederation was too busy fighting itself. Nikpato surrendered after six months of siege, paid ruinous tribute for five years, and emerged impoverished and traumatized.

**The Third Conquest** (3358 SD)

Raiders from the Deadloop region—pirates turned land-army—swept through Nikpato's western territories, burning towns and taking slaves. The Confederate response was adequate this time, but arrived too late to prevent significant damage.

These experiences have shaped Nikpato's character. The state expects catastrophe. It plans for catastrophe. It sees potential threats everywhere—and it's right to.

### Government

**The Prince-Elector**

Nikpato's ruler holds the title Prince-Elector, emphasizing the state's voting power in Confederate politics. The current Prince-Elector, **Ndaba the Cautious**, earned his epithet honestly. He's survived thirty years of rule by never committing to anything until the outcome was certain.

Ndaba's court is dominated by military advisors and spymasters. The state's limited resources go first to defense, second to intelligence, third to diplomatic gifts. Culture, education, and public works receive whatever's left—which isn't much.

**The Border Council**

A body of regional governors responsible for the state's extensive frontier. Each governor maintains local militia, watches for threats, and reports to the capital. The system works well for detecting and responding to raids. It would be insufficient against a real army.

### Culture

**Survivor Mentality**

Nikpato's people expect hard times. They stockpile food, maintain family escape plans, and teach their children to hide when strangers come. Optimism is considered naive; pessimism is considered prudent. The most respected members of society are those who've survived previous catastrophes and can teach others how to do the same.

This culture produces excellent soldiers—patient, disciplined, accustomed to hardship—but terrible morale in peacetime. Nikpato's population is smaller than it should be; young people leave for states where the future feels less grim.

**The Ancestors' Way**

Nikpato follows the Ancestors' Way faith, with particular emphasis on protective spirits. Every household maintains elaborate ancestor shrines, consulted before any significant decision. The state's military traditions include extensive pre-battle rituals asking ancestral guidance and protection.

The Temple of Names maintains a significant presence here, keeping genealogical records that help families prove claims after conquest and occupation scatter populations. The Temple's local branch is pragmatic rather than theological—they've learned that their primary value is helping people put their lives back together.

**Hospitality Protocols**

Nikpato's frequent invasions have produced elaborate hospitality customs. Visitors must be fed and housed, but also identified, questioned, and reported to local authorities. Innkeepers serve as informal intelligence officers. Travelers find Nikpato simultaneously welcoming and suspicious.

### The Succession Vote

Prince-Elector Ndaba controls one of seven votes that will choose the next Paramount. He's being courted aggressively by all three candidates, and he hates every minute of it.

**What Ndaba Wants**

A Paramount who will:
- Strengthen Confederate defense commitments
- Position forces to protect the Border Circle
- Provide military aid without political strings
- Not use Nikpato as a pawn in larger conflicts

**What the Candidates Offer**

**Shundari of Shunde**: Promises a rebuilt Confederate Army with northern garrisons. Sounds good, but Ndaba doesn't trust military strongmen—they tend to use buffer states as expendable resources.

**Mwenekazi of Chilala**: Promises economic development and infrastructure investment. Sounds good, but Chilala's interests lie south, not north. Would she actually defend Nikpato, or just express sympathy?

**Tumaini of Lanwadanzi**: Promises the status quo, which means continued vulnerability. At least he's honest about it.

**Ndaba's Dilemma**

Backing the winner means protection. Backing the loser means being remembered as an obstacle when the new Paramount distributes favors—or punishments.

Ndaba has been "neutral" for three years, extracting promises from all sides while committing to none. He can't maintain neutrality forever. When Makisani dies, he'll have to choose.

### Military

Nikpato maintains disproportionate military forces for its population—roughly 5,000 professional soldiers plus 10,000 trained militia. Quality is high; quantity is insufficient against serious threats.

The state's defensive doctrine emphasizes:
- **Early warning**: Extensive patrol networks and signal towers
- **Fortification**: Every town has walls; every village has a defensible position
- **Scorched earth**: If invasion is certain, deny the enemy resources
- **Guerrilla resistance**: If occupation is inevitable, make it costly

This doctrine has limited invasions' damage but hasn't prevented them. Against a determined enemy with sufficient forces, Nikpato falls. It always falls.

### The Threat They Don't See

Prince-Elector Ndaba watches the north obsessively. He has agents in Terrenia, contacts in Central Aboyinzu, informants along the Deadloop. He would know about any conventional military threat months before it materialized.

Chechol isn't on his radar.

Chechol is a quiet theocracy that exports grain and summoners. It has no army worth mentioning. Its Rentar population is religious, not martial. Ndaba's intelligence network reports nothing concerning—the Rentar have grown more devout, but that's not threatening.

He doesn't know about Gynor. He doesn't know about the Red Army. He doesn't know that the quiet state to the northeast is about to become the greatest threat Nikpato has ever faced.

When the Red Army marches, Nikpato's early warning system will detect movement within hours. They'll mobilize their forces, send riders to the Confederate capital, prepare for defense. And then they'll realize that 10,000 Rentar warriors are coming—zealots who believe they're doing divine work, who won't negotiate, who won't accept surrender, who will march straight through Nikpato toward whatever objective Gynor has given them.

The state will fall. Again.

### Notable Locations

**Kampaga (Capital)**

A fortified city of 20,000, bristling with walls, towers, and siege preparations. The palace is more bunker than residence—designed to withstand months of siege if necessary. The city's atmosphere is tense even in peacetime; visitors feel like they're intruding on military operations.

**The Signal Towers**

A network of watch posts across Nikpato's northern border, connected by fire-signals and messenger relays. The towers can transmit warnings from the frontier to the capital within hours. They're Nikpato's eyes—and they're looking the wrong direction.

**The Old Conquests**

Ruins dot Nikpato's landscape—burned towns from previous invasions, monuments to failed defenses, mass graves from occupations. These sites are maintained as memorials and training locations. Every soldier visits them. Every citizen knows their lessons: the Confederation cannot be trusted; only Nikpato defends Nikpato.

### Player Hooks

**The Vote**

- A candidate's agents approach the party with a simple job: convince Prince-Elector Ndaba to support their employer. Methods are negotiable.
- Ndaba himself hires the party to assess the candidates—provide unbiased intelligence on what each would actually do as Paramount.
- Someone is assassinating Ndaba's advisors, trying to isolate him before the succession. He needs protection and investigation.

**The Coming Storm**

- A Nikpato border patrol has disappeared near the Chechol frontier. Routine mission, routine area—but they haven't reported in three days.
- A Chechol merchant brings disturbing news: Rentar monasteries are emptying, with populations relocating to "spiritual retreats" the merchant couldn't find on any map.
- A Rentar defector—one of the Pyramid Keepers who suspects the truth—arrives in Kampaga seeking help. She has pieces of the puzzle but not enough to convince skeptical authorities.

**The Aftermath**

- The Red Army has passed through. Nikpato's government has collapsed. The party must help survivors organize resistance, evacuate civilians, or find someone capable of leading a counterattack.
- Ndaba survived, barely, but his state is shattered. He'll support anyone who can defeat the Rentar—including options he would never have considered before.
