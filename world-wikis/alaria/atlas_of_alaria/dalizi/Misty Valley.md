# Misty Valley

The **Misty Valley** occupies a low-lying basin at the northeastern corner of the Dalizi Highlands, where the Foggy Mountains give way to the sea. Fed by the Strangle River and perpetually shrouded in fog that spills down from the heights, the valley is the only place along the Shipwreck Coast where the terrain permits anything resembling level ground—though no one has been fool enough to settle it.

## Geography

The valley stretches roughly twenty miles inland from the coast, wedged between the Hills of Tharoz to the north and the Banesnap Hills to the south. At its widest, the valley floor spans perhaps five miles; at its narrowest, where the Strangle River cuts through to the sea, less than half a mile.

The terrain is low and wet. The Strangle River meanders through the center, its course choked with the strangling vines that give it its name, while countless smaller streams and seeps drain the surrounding slopes. Standing water is common after rain. The soil—where soil exists rather than waterlogged peat—is dark and organic, built up over millennia from decaying vegetation.

Elevation rises gradually from the coastal cliffs (roughly 200 feet) to the valley's western end (roughly 800 feet), where the terrain steepens sharply into the Foggy Mountains proper.

## The Fog

The valley earns its name honestly. Cold air draining from the Foggy Mountains meets warm, moisture-laden air from the sea, producing fog that blankets the basin on roughly two hundred days per year. The fog is thickest in morning and evening but can persist throughout the day during certain seasons.

Visibility in heavy fog drops to twenty feet or less. The fog muffles sound, making distance difficult to judge. Navigation without landmarks—and there are few—becomes nearly impossible. Travelers who enter the valley in clear weather may find themselves trapped when fog rolls in.

The fog has a distinctive smell: wet vegetation, salt from the sea, and something faintly organic that longtime visitors attribute to the peat bogs.

## Why No One Lives Here

The Misty Valley offers level ground, fresh water, apparently fertile soil, and access to the sea. By every practical measure, it should support settlement. It does not, for three reasons:

**The floods.** Heavy rain in the Foggy Mountains sends water cascading down into the valley faster than the Strangle can drain it. Flash floods scour the valley floor several times per year, carrying away anything not anchored to bedrock.

**The isolation.** The valley connects to nothing. The Banesnap Hills block the route south. The Hills of Tharoz guard the north, with the dragon-haunted Wanderlands beyond. The Foggy Mountains wall off the west. The only exit is the sea—and the Shipwreck Coast makes that exit theoretical.

**The things in the fog.** Travelers report encounters in the fog—shapes that move wrong, sounds that have no source, the sensation of being followed by something that stays just out of sight.

**GM Information:** The encounters are real, and they're caused by three distinct sources:

1. **Moon Goblin scouts** do range down from the Foggy Mountains occasionally, following the fog that gives them cover. They observe but rarely attack in the valley—it's too far from their territory, and the terrain doesn't favor their ambush tactics.

2. **Dream-echoes** from the Foggy Mountains bleed into the valley when the fog is thick. These are harmless but unsettling—shapes that aren't quite there, sounds from dreams that aren't the observer's. The proximity of the titan's dream-space creates these phenomena.

3. **A small population of bog spirits** inhabits the peat marshes. These are minor fey creatures—not powerful, but territorial about their wetlands. They create illusions to lead travelers astray, steal small objects, and generally make themselves nuisances. They're not dangerous unless someone tries to drain or settle their marsh.

The combination of all three creates the valley's reputation. On any given foggy day, a traveler might encounter one, two, or all three phenomena without ever being sure what's real.

## The Drowned Road

Old maps show a trail called the Drowned Road running the length of the valley, connecting the coast to a pass into the Foggy Mountains. The trail may have existed once; no trace remains now. Floods have erased any worked stone or graded path that might have marked the route.

Some scholars argue the Drowned Road never existed—that it was a cartographer's fantasy or a deliberate deception to lure settlers into a death trap. Others believe it represents a route from an earlier age, before the climate shifted or the Strangle River changed its course.

Treasure hunters occasionally search for the Road, reasoning that any trail worth mapping must have led somewhere worth reaching.

**GM Information:** The Drowned Road was real, and it was built by the Vetharak civilization as a supply route to a now-submerged coastal facility. The facility was constructed to observe (and possibly interact with) whatever lies beneath the Shipwreck Coast—the Vetharak believed something significant rested on the seafloor, and they built this road to access it.

The road was deliberately destroyed during the civilization's collapse, its stones scattered and its route flooded. This wasn't erosion; it was demolition. Whatever the coastal facility was monitoring, the Vetharak decided it was better that no one reach it.

**Plot hook:** The coastal facility still exists, partially submerged at the base of the sea cliffs. It contains records of what the Vetharak were watching—and possibly a way to reach it. The something in the sea may be connected to the titan, to the Dragon's Gate, or to something else entirely.
