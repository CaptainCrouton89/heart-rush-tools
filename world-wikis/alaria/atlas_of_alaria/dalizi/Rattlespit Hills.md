# Rattlespit Hills

The **Rattlespit Hills** occupy a transitional zone within the northern Jackal Mountains, a cluster of lower terrain wedged between the main peaks and the wall of the Thundering Mountains. The hills take their name from the rattlespit serpent, a venomous snake whose distinctive threat display—a rattling tail followed by a spray of caustic venom—makes it one of the highland's most recognizable hazards.

## Geography

The Rattlespit Hills extend roughly twenty miles east to west and ten miles north to south, filling the saddle between the Jackal Mountains proper and the Thundering Mountains. Elevations range from 5,000 feet in the lower valleys to 8,000 feet at the highest points—significant terrain, but modest compared to the peaks that bracket them.

The hills are rocky and dry, covered in loose scree and boulder fields with thin soil between. Vegetation is sparse: tough grasses, thorny shrubs, and scattered stands of wind-bent pine that somehow survive the harsh conditions. The terrain is broken and irregular, with countless small ravines, box canyons, and hidden hollows.

The Marrow Creek's headwaters rise somewhere in these hills before flowing southeast toward the Jackal Mountains' eastern slopes.

## The Rattlespit Serpent

The snake that gives these hills their name is a pit viper roughly three to four feet long, with sandy-brown scales that blend perfectly with the rocky terrain. Its rattle is similar to other rattlesnakes, but its venom delivery is unique: rather than injecting through fangs, the rattlespit can spray caustic venom up to eight feet when threatened.

The venom causes intense burning on contact with skin and can cause permanent blindness if it reaches the eyes. It's not typically fatal to healthy adults, but it incapacitates effectively, leaving victims vulnerable to other hazards—exposure, dehydration, or the snakes themselves, which will bite once their prey is sufficiently weakened.

Rattlespits are most active in warm weather, basking on rocks during the day and hunting small mammals at night. They're well-camouflaged and often motionless until disturbed. Travelers through the hills learn to watch where they step and never reach blindly into rock crevices.

## Strategic Position

The Rattlespit Hills occupy the only relatively accessible terrain between the Jackal and Thundering Mountains. Anyone attempting to cross the highlands from northwest to southeast—or vice versa—must pass through this snake-infested corridor unless they're willing to climb 14,000-foot peaks or descend all the way to the lowlands.

The Dalizi have occasionally discussed fortifying the hills to control highland traffic, but the proposals never advance far. The terrain is too broken to defend effectively, the snakes make garrisoning troops impractical, and there's simply not enough traffic to justify the expense. The hills remain wild.

## Points of Interest

### The Bone Wash

A ravine in the eastern hills where seasonal floods regularly expose skeletal remains—apparently a mass grave of some kind, though the bones are too old and scattered to identify. Some appear human; others do not. The bones wash down toward the Marrow Valley in heavy rains, contributing to that creek's unsettling cargo.

### Old Cairns

Scattered throughout the hills are stone cairns of uncertain origin, some still standing, others collapsed into rubble. They're too regular to be natural, but they don't match Dalizi construction techniques. Their purpose is unknown—they might be waymarkers, boundary stones, or something else entirely. The Dalizi leave them alone.
