## Nykotheryx Amberylika

Tags: forest, geography

A large ancient forest region in the Dalizi Wildlands, positioned north of the Dragon's Spine mountains and east of the Dalizi Confederation proper. The forest is known for its dream-attuned magical properties and otherworldly phenomena.

### Real Forest

The Real Forest lies in the northern reaches of Nykotheryx Amberylika, notorious for its reality-warping properties. During fall, the pollen from the trees causes dreams and reality to intermingle—travelers cannot tell if they are awake or asleep. The disorientation is so complete that people can wander for days convinced they are dreaming when they are awake, or vice versa.

The forest is home to the Pine Jester, a wild, mischievous spirit that delights in tormenting confused travelers. The Pine Jester is unkillable so long as the forest itself lives—it is bound to the forest's essence and will regenerate from any harm.

### Dreamlake

North of the main Nykotheryx Amberylika forest, just south of the Real Forest, lies Dreamlake—a body of water with profound magical properties. Drinking from the lake allows you to interact far more vividly with your dreams, experiencing them with perfect clarity and control. More remarkably, those who drink the water can enter and interact with other people's dreams, creating shared dreamscapes or invading the private dreams of others.

Dream-mages and mystics make pilgrimages to Dreamlake to enhance their oneiromantic abilities, though the power comes with risks—some who drink too deeply find themselves unable to distinguish waking from dreaming even after the water's effects should have faded.
