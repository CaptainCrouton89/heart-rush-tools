# Dalizi Region

## Geography

The Dalizi region encompasses two distinct but related areas: the **Dalizi Confederation** (a collection of states) and the **Dalizi Highlands** (a mountainous geographic region). Both are defined by their relationship to **Lake Tonactlet Chipe**, the large central lake that serves as their geographic anchor.

### The Two Dalizi

#### Dalizi (Confederation)

A massive confederation of states occupying the territory **mostly northwest, and also west/southwest** of Lake Tonactlet Chipe. This is a political entity—a collection of allied or federated states sharing cultural and economic ties. The confederation represents one of the largest political bodies in southern Aboyinzu.

#### Dalizi Highlands

A mountainous highland region positioned **north and northeast** of Lake Tonactlet Chipe. This is a geographic designation referring to the elevated, rugged terrain east of the main confederation. The Highlands are characterized by peaks, valleys, and difficult terrain.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu, the Chechol region, and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elder Wilds peninsula
- **South**: Dragon's Spine mountains
- **West**: Central Aboyinzu and the Morygun Mountains

### Lake Tonactlet Chipe

The defining geographic feature of the region—a massive freshwater lake roughly 80 miles long and 40 miles wide at its broadest point. The lake serves as the boundary marker between the Dalizi Confederation (to its west/northwest/southwest) and the Dalizi Highlands (to its north/northeast).

Lake Tonactlet Chipe is the economic heart of the Confederation. Its waters teem with fish; its shores produce freshwater pearls; its depths contain mineral deposits that divers harvest at considerable risk. The four Elector states that border the lake—Mpaso, Chilala, Misanda Mulu, and Samani—derive enormous wealth from controlling lakeside ports.

The lake is also sacred to the Lake's Children faith, whose adherents worship it as a living deity. Priests interpret the lake's moods—calm, stormy, murky, clear—as divine messages. Major decisions in lakeshore states are often delayed until the lake "speaks."

Navigation on the lake is treacherous. Sudden storms rise without warning, and the lake floor drops precipitously near certain shores. Skilled pilots command premium fees, and lakeside cities maintain lighthouse networks to guide vessels.

## Political Climate

The Dalizi Confederation is a political entity in name only. In practice, it's forty-plus independent states bound by treaties everyone interprets differently, mutual defense obligations no one trusts, and a tangle of marriages, debts, and grudges that would take a scholar decades to untangle.

**The Current Crisis**: Paramount Makisani III is dying. She's held the Confederation together for thirty-two years through personal relationships and careful diplomacy. Her heir is weak. Three candidates are maneuvering for the succession, and none commands majority support among the Seven Electors.

**The Candidates**:
- **Shundari of Shunde**: Military strongman, wants centralized power
- **Mwenekazi of Chilala**: Ambitious regent-queen of the largest state, wants Chilala dominance
- **Tumaini of Lanwadanzi**: Wealthy merchant-prince, wants stability (and continued trade profits)

The Electors are deadlocked. When Makisani dies—within two years, likely less—the Confederation may enter an interregnum. The last one killed 40,000 people.

**The Five Circles** organize regional politics:
- **Lakeshore Circle**: Wealthy lake states, paralyzed by the Mpaso-Chilala rivalry
- **Highland Circle**: Traders and scholars, nervous about instability
- **Forest Circle**: Independent frontier states, ignoring the succession fight
- **Border Circle**: Vulnerable northern states, desperate for protection
- **South Wall Circle**: Martial cultures, positioning their candidate

**Everyone is scheming**. Assassins are affordable. Mercenary companies are everywhere. The Temple of Names sells genealogical "discoveries" that conveniently support whoever pays most. And underneath all of this, no one is watching the quiet theocracy to the north.

## What Makes It Interesting

**Political Sandbox**: The Confederation is a medieval political simulator. Every state has interests, grievances, and schemes. Players can engage at any level—local city-state politics, Circle maneuvering, Elector-level succession games. There's always someone to help, someone to hinder, and someone to betray.

**Mercenary Culture**: Professional soldiers for hire are everywhere. Players can join companies, found their own, or watch their employers get outbid. Contracts have loopholes. Loyalties are fungible. The line between soldier and criminal depends on who's paying.

**Religious Complexity**: Three faiths—Ancestors' Way, Lake's Children, Old Forest—create cultural fault lines. Religious identity affects who trusts you, who hires you, and who wants you dead. The Temple of Names controls genealogical records crucial for inheritance; their favor is worth killing for.

**The Coming Storm**: The Border Circle is exposed. Chechol's Red Army is building. When Gynor activates his control, these states will burn first—and the Confederation's slow, fractious response may doom them.

**The Succession**: The Paramount's death will trigger a crisis. Players can influence the outcome through diplomacy, blackmail, assassination, or military action. Every candidate offers different adventure opportunities. An interregnum offers more.

**The Dhabisa Grudge**: A former Elector state, stripped of its seat after the War of Broken Oaths, still plots to regain its position. They'd support almost anyone who promises to help—including, potentially, the players.

## What Will Go Wrong

**The Succession Will Break**

Makisani will die. The Electors won't agree. If no candidate secures four votes, the Confederation enters interregnum—no Paramount, no Confederate Army, every state for itself. The last interregnum lasted seven years.

Possible outcomes:
- A weak compromise candidate nobody wanted
- Open civil war between Chilala and Shunde
- Chilala absorbs smaller states under "protection"
- The Confederation fragments into regional blocs

**The Red Army Will Activate**

Gynor the Conqueror has spent two centuries building his weapon. When he activates control over Chechol's Rentar, they'll march south. Turbuni will fall first. The Border Circle will burn. And the Confederation will be too distracted by succession politics to respond.

By the time they mobilize a Confederate Army—if they can mobilize one—the Red Army will be entrenched. The war will be long, bloody, and may permanently reshape the region's politics.

**The Mercenary Problem**

The Painted Shields already seized Kerikos once. Other companies are watching. If the succession crisis weakens central authority enough, mercenary companies may decide that taking cities is more profitable than protecting them. A few successful seizures could trigger a cascade—why defend a city when you could own it?

**Religious Schism**

The Temple of Names has been challenging Lake's Children inheritance claims. Lake's Children priests have been denouncing highland practices. Forest Circle states have expelled missionaries. None of this is violent yet.

In a succession crisis, religious identity becomes political identity. If candidates align with specific faiths, the theological disputes become civil war. The Confederation has survived internal conflicts before, but not religious wars.

**Chilala Gets What It Wants**

Mwenekazi becomes Paramount. Backed by Chilala's resources, she transforms the position from ceremonial to powerful. Smaller states are absorbed. The Diet becomes a rubber stamp. The Confederation becomes the Chilala Empire in all but name.

Some would call this stability. Others would call it conquest. The resistance would be desperate, bloody, and probably futile.

## Notable Locations

### The Eastern Forest

A massive ancient forest stretches east of the Dalizi Confederation, between the confederation proper and the Elder Wilds. This wilderness is home to numerous leyline intersections and ancient powers.

#### Terwin Lake

A lake within the eastern forest, positioned on a force leyline near where it intersects with a void leyline. The convergence of these two fundamental magical forces creates an area of extreme supernatural power and danger.

##### Cynker's Den

The hidden headquarters of Cynker, a mastermind of dimensional travel who has achieved paragon attunement to force magic. His lair is home to clawed nymph and rusalka-like creatures with adept control over force magic—likely his creations or servants. The convergence of force and void leylines at this location allows Cynker to manipulate dimensional boundaries, enabling him to pull off impossible heists by teleporting objects (and himself) across vast distances or even between planes.

The den itself is protected by spatial distortions and force barriers that make approach nearly impossible for those not specifically invited.

##### Kroikylo's Tomb

Located at the exact intersection of the force and void leylines on Terwin Lake, Kroikylo's Tomb is one of the most dangerous dungeons in Alaria. The burial place of Kroikylo, an ancient mage who mastered both force and void magic, the tomb is filled with lethal traps that combine both disciplines—crushing force fields that appear from nowhere, spatial rifts that tear flesh from bone, and void zones that simply erase matter.

Despite the extreme danger, the tomb draws adventurers seeking the legendary void stones said to be buried with Kroikylo—crystallized fragments of pure void that grant mastery over space and nothingness to those who can wield them without being consumed.

#### Mirror Lake

Deep within the Eastern Forest lies Mirror Lake, a body of water with a surface so perfectly still and reflective that it appears as polished glass. It is believed that if you can find your reflection in the lake's mirrored surface, you will see your true self—and within that reflection, discover your true name. Many seekers have journeyed to Mirror Lake in search of this revelation, though few claim to have succeeded in glimpsing what the waters reveal.

### Northeastern Forests

The forests in the northeastern reaches of the Dalizi region are known for their strange magical phenomena.

#### Reflection Lakes

A cluster of interconnected lakes scattered throughout the northeastern Dalizi forests. These lakes possess a remarkable property: stepping into one lake can cause you to instantly reemerge from a different lake up to 50 miles away. The teleportation is unpredictable—there is no way to control which destination lake you will emerge from, making the Reflection Lakes both a potential shortcut and a serious hazard.

Travelers have been known to step into a lake seeking to cross a small body of water, only to emerge miles away in hostile territory or completely lost. The lakes reflect each other not just in name but in essence—what happens in one ripples across the network in ways both mundane and magical.
