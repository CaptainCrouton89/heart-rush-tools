# Dalizi Region

## Geography

The Dalizi region encompasses two distinct but related areas: the **Dalizi Confederation** (a collection of states) and the **Dalizi Highlands** (a mountainous geographic region). Both are defined by their relationship to **Lake Tonactlet Chitle**, the large central lake that serves as their geographic anchor.

### The Two Dalizi

#### Dalizi (Confederation)

A massive confederation of states occupying the territory **mostly northwest, and also west/southwest** of Lake Tonactlet Chitle. This is a political entity—a collection of allied or federated states sharing cultural and economic ties. The confederation represents one of the largest political bodies in southern Aboyinzu.

#### Dalizi Highlands

A mountainous highland region positioned **north and northeast** of Lake Tonactlet Chitle. This is a geographic designation referring to the elevated, rugged terrain east of the main confederation. The Highlands are characterized by peaks, valleys, and difficult terrain.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu, the Chechol region, and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elder Wilds peninsula
- **South**: Dragon's Spine mountains
- **West**: Central Aboyinzu and the Morygun Mountains

### Lake Tonactlet Chitle

The defining geographic feature of the region—a large lake that serves as the boundary marker between the Dalizi Confederation (to its west/northwest/southwest) and the Dalizi Highlands (to its north/northeast). The lake and its surrounding territories form the cultural and economic heart of the Dalizi peoples.
