# Dalizi Region

## Geography

The Dalizi region encompasses two distinct but related areas: the **Dalizi Confederation** (a collection of states) and the **Dalizi Highlands** (a mountainous geographic region). Both are defined by their relationship to **Lake Tonactlet Chitle**, the large central lake that serves as their geographic anchor.

### The Two Dalizi

#### Dalizi (Confederation)

A massive confederation of states occupying the territory **mostly northwest, and also west/southwest** of Lake Tonactlet Chitle. This is a political entity—a collection of allied or federated states sharing cultural and economic ties. The confederation represents one of the largest political bodies in southern Aboyinzu.

#### Dalizi Highlands

A mountainous highland region positioned **north and northeast** of Lake Tonactlet Chitle. This is a geographic designation referring to the elevated, rugged terrain east of the main confederation. The Highlands are characterized by peaks, valleys, and difficult terrain.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu, the Chechol region, and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elder Wilds peninsula
- **South**: Dragon's Spine mountains
- **West**: Central Aboyinzu and the Morygun Mountains

### Lake Tonactlet Chitle

The defining geographic feature of the region—a large lake that serves as the boundary marker between the Dalizi Confederation (to its west/northwest/southwest) and the Dalizi Highlands (to its north/northeast). The lake and its surrounding territories form the cultural and economic heart of the Dalizi peoples.

## Notable Locations

### The Eastern Forest

A massive ancient forest stretches east of the Dalizi Confederation, between the confederation proper and the Elder Wilds. This wilderness is home to numerous leyline intersections and ancient powers.

#### Terwin Lake

A lake within the eastern forest, positioned on a force leyline near where it intersects with a void leyline. The convergence of these two fundamental magical forces creates an area of extreme supernatural power and danger.

##### Cynker's Den

The hidden headquarters of Cynker, a mastermind of dimensional travel who has achieved paragon attunement to force magic. His lair is home to clawed nymph and rusalka-like creatures with adept control over force magic—likely his creations or servants. The convergence of force and void leylines at this location allows Cynker to manipulate dimensional boundaries, enabling him to pull off impossible heists by teleporting objects (and himself) across vast distances or even between planes.

The den itself is protected by spatial distortions and force barriers that make approach nearly impossible for those not specifically invited.

##### Kroikylo's Tomb

Located at the exact intersection of the force and void leylines on Terwin Lake, Kroikylo's Tomb is one of the most dangerous dungeons in Alaria. The burial place of Kroikylo, an ancient mage who mastered both force and void magic, the tomb is filled with lethal traps that combine both disciplines—crushing force fields that appear from nowhere, spatial rifts that tear flesh from bone, and void zones that simply erase matter.

Despite the extreme danger, the tomb draws adventurers seeking the legendary void stones said to be buried with Kroikylo—crystallized fragments of pure void that grant mastery over space and nothingness to those who can wield them without being consumed.

#### Mirror Lake

Deep within the Eastern Forest lies Mirror Lake, a body of water with a surface so perfectly still and reflective that it appears as polished glass. It is believed that if you can find your reflection in the lake's mirrored surface, you will see your true self—and within that reflection, discover your true name. Many seekers have journeyed to Mirror Lake in search of this revelation, though few claim to have succeeded in glimpsing what the waters reveal.

### Northeastern Forests

The forests in the northeastern reaches of the Dalizi region are known for their strange magical phenomena.

#### Reflection Lakes

A cluster of interconnected lakes scattered throughout the northeastern Dalizi forests. These lakes possess a remarkable property: stepping into one lake can cause you to instantly reemerge from a different lake up to 50 miles away. The teleportation is unpredictable—there is no way to control which destination lake you will emerge from, making the Reflection Lakes both a potential shortcut and a serious hazard.

Travelers have been known to step into a lake seeking to cross a small body of water, only to emerge miles away in hostile territory or completely lost. The lakes reflect each other not just in name but in essence—what happens in one ripples across the network in ways both mundane and magical.
