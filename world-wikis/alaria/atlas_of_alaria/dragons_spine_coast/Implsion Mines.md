## Implosion Mines

Tags: fortress, poi, mines, vimlus, the-collapse

The Implosion Mines are the ruins of an ancient dwarven civilization built around the manipulation of force leylines. The dwarves of this era were master engineers of Vimlus energy, using controlled implosions to delicately extract ore from the mountain without destabilizing the surrounding rock. Their techniques were precise—decades of accumulated knowledge allowed them to harness the force leyline's fluctuations for mining with surgical accuracy.

Everything changed around 20,000 BSD when catastrophe struck. **The Collapse**—a sudden and catastrophic destabilization of the Vimlus leyline beneath the city—shattered the delicate balance the dwarves had maintained. The force leyline breached violently, and in seconds, the entire civilization was annihilated. An entire mountain range folded inward upon itself, transforming into a massive crater of impossible destruction.

The ruins of the Implosion Mines remain trapped in a state of warped physics. Gravity itself pulls inward from all directions toward the center of the crater, as if the Collapse left behind a permanent wound in the natural order. Within the ruins, **Crushers** and **Gravity Wells** drift through the devastation—artifacts and creatures born from the residual Vimlus energy, moving in strange patterns as gravity warps around them. The site is simultaneously a monument to dwarven ingenuity and a grave marker for their hubris.

Most believe everyone died in the Collapse. Most believe this.
