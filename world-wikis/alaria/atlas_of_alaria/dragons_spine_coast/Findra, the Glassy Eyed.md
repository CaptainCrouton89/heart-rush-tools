## Findra, the Glassy Eyed

Tags: dragon, force, pindolin-islands

A Force dragon who lairs in the northeastern Pindolin Islands, on the small island northwest of Tidewatcher's Perch. Findra lost her eyes three centuries ago and replaced them with something better.

### The Blinding

Findra doesn't discuss what happened. The few survivors of her encounters who've tried to ask received only silence—and then death, when they pressed further.

What scholars have pieced together: she fought something in the deep water between the Pindolins and the Abyssal shelf. Something that targeted her eyes specifically. She won—probably—but crawled onto her current island blind, bleeding, and furious.

She should have died. Dragons don't recover well from sensory loss; their hunting, their magic, their entire predatory existence depends on perception. A blind dragon is a dead dragon.

Findra disagreed.

### The Eyes

She spent decades in her lair, experimenting. The Force leyline that runs through the northeastern Pindolins gave her the raw material. She harvested crystalline formations from the island's volcanic glass deposits—obsidian shot through with leyline energy, already half-attuned to kinetic forces.

The first attempts failed. The second attempts failed worse. She destroyed miles of coastline in her rages.

The eyes she eventually created aren't eyes at all. They're resonance spheres—fist-sized orbs of Force-crystallized glass that sit in her empty sockets and vibrate in response to motion. Every footfall within two miles registers. Every heartbeat. Every breath. The rhythm of waves, the settling of stone, the minute tremors of a mouse crossing rock a thousand feet below.

She doesn't see. She *feels* the world move.

### What She Perceives

Findra's senses are simultaneously more and less than sight:

**More**: She cannot be surprised. Hidden creatures register by their heartbeats. Invisible beings still displace air. Illusions have no weight, no vibration—she ignores them entirely. In absolute darkness, in fog thick as clay, in the blinding light of noon, her perception remains unchanged.

**Less**: She has no color. No fine detail. No reading. The world comes to her as a constant wash of kinetic information—shapes defined by movement, structures revealed by the vibrations they carry. Beautiful things and ugly things feel the same. She hasn't seen a sunset in three hundred years.

The tradeoff has made her strange. Other dragons hoard gold for its gleam; Findra hoards *movement*. Her lair contains clockwork mechanisms salvaged from ships, pendulums that never stop swinging, waterfalls she's diverted through caverns just to feel the constant vibration. She keeps prisoners sometimes—not for torture, but because living things move in ways that dead things don't, and she finds the rhythm of heartbeats soothing.

### The Obsession

Findra wants more eyes.

Her current pair works. But she's convinced better crystalline formations exist—purer Force-attuned glass, more sensitive resonance structures. She's particularly interested in the Shattering Stones of Emblydium (the Nydor won't trade with her), the Chime Crystals of the Triton deep cities (too far, too wet), and persistent rumors of a titan-era construct somewhere in the Dragon's Spine that could perceive through solid stone.

She sends servants—rarely willing ones—to investigate these leads. Most don't return. The ones who do bring fragments, samples, sometimes just descriptions. She evaluates each with obsessive attention, compares them to her current eyes, and usually finds them wanting.

The servants who bring genuinely promising samples are rewarded. The ones who waste her time are killed. The ones who try to steal her current eyes are killed slowly.

### Hunting

Findra hunts by stillness.

She settles onto a rocky prominence and goes completely motionless—no breath, no heartbeat that she doesn't suppress, nothing but the slow cooling of stone. Then she waits. Her perception extends outward, feeling for anything that moves: ships passing through the strait, creatures crawling on distant beaches, the vibration patterns of schools of fish.

When she identifies prey worth taking, she moves in a single explosive motion—stone to sky to strike in seconds. Victims report (the few who survived initial contact) that she appeared from nowhere, from *nothing*, a shape they'd mistaken for a rock formation suddenly revealing itself as death.

She prefers prey that struggles. The vibrations of panic are more interesting than the stillness of acceptance.

### The Lair

Findra's island has no name on any chart. Sailors call it Glassback for the obsidian formations that ridge its eastern shore, but no one lands there by choice.

The lair itself is a complex of sea-caves and volcanic tubes, extensively modified over three centuries. The entrance is underwater at high tide—visitors must time their approach or drown. Inside, the caves branch into:

**The Resonance Chamber**: A natural cavern she's enhanced with hanging crystals, taut cables, and strategic water channels. Everything in here vibrates, hums, or chimes. She spends most of her time here, surrounded by motion.

**The Collection**: A smaller cave containing her crystalline samples—hundreds of fragments from across Alaria, organized by resonance properties. Some still pulse with leyline energy. Some are just pretty rocks she can't bring herself to discard.

**The Pen**: Where she keeps living things. Currently empty. Previously held two sailors, a scholar who came seeking her voluntarily, and something she pulled from the Abyssal deep that she eventually killed because its heartbeat was irregular and the rhythm annoyed her.

### Dealing With Findra

Findra can be bargained with, but the terms are narrow:

**She wants**: Crystalline samples with unusual resonance properties. Information about titan-era perception technology. Living prey delivered to her island (she's bored of fish). News from the surface world, which she finds entertaining in small doses.

**She won't trade**: Her current eyes, obviously. Information about what blinded her. Access to her lair for "research purposes."

**Approach carefully**: She knows you're coming before you know you're there. Attempting stealth is pointless and insults her intelligence. Attempting overwhelming force is suicide—she's been fighting for eight hundred years and hasn't lost since the blinding. Your best approach is visible, respectful, and bearing gifts.

**The eyes are a weakness**: If someone destroyed or stole her resonance spheres, she'd be blind again. Truly blind. She knows this. She has killed fourteen people who she believed were thinking about it too seriously. Whether she could create new eyes is unknown—she did it once, but she's older now, and the leyline composition has shifted.

### What She Knows

Findra has lived in the Pindolins for three centuries and perceived more of them than any surface creature alive. She knows:

- Where Oboros, the Cunning lairs (she can feel his movement through the water leyline)
- Where Elebria sleeps (the constant volcanic tremors are unmistakable)
- The location of Tidewatcher's Perch and what happens to people who sit too long
- The migration patterns of kraken-spawn through the deep channels
- The exact rhythm of the Force leyline's pulse, which has been changing for the past decade in ways she doesn't like

She shares this information rarely and unpredictably. Sometimes she's generous with knowledge; sometimes she kills people for asking. The pattern, if there is one, relates to the resonance of the asker's heartbeat. Calm hearts get answers. Frightened hearts get eaten.
