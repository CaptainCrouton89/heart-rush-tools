## Pelera

Tags: dragon, dark, the-glog

A dark emerald dragon who claims The Glog forest as her domain, laired at Shimmer Lake on the forest's eastern edge. Pelera rules through fear and mystery rather than overt destruction—every shadow in her territory might contain her, every silence might herald her approach.

She tolerates human activity at the margins but responds lethally to intrusions into her core territory. The forest's reputation for making travelers feel watched isn't superstition—it's Pelera.
