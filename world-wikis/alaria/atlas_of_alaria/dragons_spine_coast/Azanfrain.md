## Azanfrain

Tags: fortress, poi, gondurak, frostwatch, military

The southernmost permanent Fengruk installation, built into a spur of volcanic rock overlooking the northern Shrapnel Strait. Azanfrain exists for one purpose: watching the Pale Peaks and stopping what comes from them. For four thousand years, this fortress has been the first line of defense against frostwalkers, ice wyrms, and the possibility of something worse.

The fortress is not comfortable, not welcoming, and not meant to be. It's a military installation in the most literal sense—every design choice prioritizes function over form, defense over aesthetics, survival over anything else.

### Location and Construction

Azanfrain perches on a promontory at the southeastern edge of the Bellowing Mountains, where the volcanic stone gives way to the frozen approaches of the Shrapnel Strait. The location was chosen for sight lines: from the highest watchtowers, observers can see the entire northern coastline of the Pale Peaks, track ice formation on the strait, and spot movement on the southern slopes.

The fortress is built primarily underground, following Fengruk architectural tradition, but here the reasons are military rather than cultural. Surface structures present targets; underground chambers don't. The visible portions of Azanfrain are limited to watchtowers, weapon emplacements, and the heavily-fortified main gate.

The stone is volcanic basalt, naturally insulated against cold and reinforced with titan-era metalwork salvaged from deeper installations. The walls are fifteen feet thick in most places, angled to deflect both physical impacts and the cold auras of frostwalkers. The architecture assumes hostile conditions and designs around them.

Geothermal vents provide heating—carefully channeled through the fortress's interior to maintain temperatures that Fengruk can work in while remaining cool enough that the outer defenses don't create thermal signatures that attract predators. The balance is precise and constantly monitored.

### The Frostwatch Garrison

Approximately six hundred Fengruk serve in the Frostwatch at any given time—the professional military force that operates Azanfrain year-round. Garrison duty rotates every six months; longer deployments cause psychological effects the Fengruk call "ice-sight," a progressive detachment and obsessive focus on the southern horizon that makes soldiers unreliable.

The Frostwatch ranks:

**Watchers** form the basic rank—soldiers trained in observation, patrol, and basic frostwalker engagement. Most of the six hundred fall into this category.

**Hunters** specialize in ice wyrm response—harpoon crews, thermal lance operators, and the scouts who track wyrm movement through ice-ripples. Roughly sixty Fengruk hold this rank.

**Priests** maintain the spiritual and psychological health of the garrison, conduct the vigils that monitor for signs of the Cold That Hungers, and perform the memorial rites for fallen soldiers. Twenty priests serve at any time.

**The Commander** holds overall authority, reporting directly to the Council of Embers in Sildraz. The current commander is **Threkk Irontemper** (male, 180 years), a veteran of three major frostwalker incursions who is widely respected but increasingly withdrawn.

Command rotates every three years. Longer terms tend to produce commanders who see threats everywhere and nowhere, who become so focused on the watch that they forget what they're watching for.

### Defenses

Azanfrain's defensive systems have evolved over millennia, refined by each generation based on what worked and what didn't:

**The Watchtowers** rise from the fortress's highest points, staffed continuously in rotating shifts. Each tower maintains signal fires, observation equipment, and emergency weapons. The towers can communicate with each other and with the main fortress through a system of mirrors, flags, and—in emergencies—the fortress bells.

**The Fire Lines** are trenches filled with alchemical compounds that can be ignited on command, creating barriers of flame across likely approach routes. Frostwalkers avoid fire instinctively; the lines channel them toward killing grounds where the garrison can engage effectively.

**The Harpoon Batteries** line the outer walls—heavy weapons designed to anchor ice wyrms above the ice before they can submerge. Each battery requires a crew of four and can fire three harpoons before reloading. The fortress maintains thirty operational batteries.

**The Thermal Lances** are the garrison's primary anti-frostwalker weapons—devices that project concentrated heat at effective ranges of about fifty feet. Each lance requires expensive alchemical fuel and burns out after roughly ten minutes of continuous use. The fortress maintains several hundred in reserve.

**Vibration Dampening** protects the fortress floors and surrounding ice from transmitting the footfall signatures that attract ice wyrms. The dampening uses a combination of suspended flooring, absorbent materials, and careful movement discipline.

**The Ice-Breaker Stores** contain alchemical compounds designed to prevent the strait from freezing solid or to shatter ice bridges that form despite prevention efforts. These are the garrison's most precious resource—running out means accepting whatever the frozen strait permits to cross.

### Daily Life

Life in Azanfrain follows rigid routines designed to maintain alertness without exhausting the garrison:

**Watch Rotation** operates on four-hour shifts, ensuring fresh eyes on the approaches at all times. Off-duty soldiers train, maintain equipment, or rest in the barracks. Recreation is limited—the fortress has no tavern, no market, no entertainment beyond what soldiers bring themselves.

**Training** occurs daily, focusing on frostwalker engagement, ice wyrm response, and cold-weather survival. Every soldier must maintain proficiency with multiple weapons and demonstrate ability to function in extreme conditions.

**Maintenance** consumes significant time. The cold degrades equipment; the isolation prevents easy resupply. Soldiers learn to repair their own gear, manage fuel supplies, and improvise when standard materials aren't available.

**The Vigils** are religious observances conducted by the priests—rituals that supposedly detect disturbances in the Pale Peaks' spiritual atmosphere. Whether the vigils actually detect anything is debated; the priests insist they do, and the garrison has no way to prove otherwise.

**Food** comes from Sildraz via the supply route—preserved meats, dried vegetables, and dense breads designed for long storage. Fresh food is rare; hunting near the fortress is forbidden because the activity might attract predators.

### The Psychological Toll

Service at Azanfrain is difficult in ways that go beyond physical hardship. The isolation, the constant vigilance, the knowledge that something terrible might emerge from the south at any moment—these pressures accumulate.

**Ice-sight** is the most common affliction: soldiers who've served too long begin to see frostwalker movement in every shadow, hear the Cold That Hungers in every wind. They become obsessive, checking the horizon constantly, unable to sleep, certain that the end is coming. Treatment requires removal from the fortress and extended recovery in warmer, more populated environments.

**The Dreams** trouble many soldiers—nightmares of the Pale Peaks, of endless cold, of watching something vast rise from the horizon. The priests say these dreams are normal, a product of anxiety and environment. Some soldiers believe they're something more.

**Casualty Management** adds another burden. When soldiers die—to frostwalker cold, ice wyrm attacks, or accidents in the harsh environment—the garrison handles their own dead. Bodies are cremated in the forge-heated chamber; ashes are eventually returned to family in the forge cities. There's no time for elaborate mourning.

The Frostwatch considers six months the maximum safe deployment before ice-sight risk becomes significant. Some soldiers request extensions anyway, unwilling to leave the watch to others. The command usually refuses.

### The Warning System

Azanfrain's primary function is observation and warning. When threats are detected, the fortress activates a communication chain that reaches all of Gondurak within hours:

**Signal Fires** on the watchtowers can be seen from relay stations in the Bellowing Mountains proper. Different patterns indicate different threats: single fire for isolated frostwalkers, double fire for group movement, triple fire for ice wyrm activity, and the rarely-used full conflagration signal for mass incursion.

**Runners** carry detailed reports through the mountain passes to Sildraz when signal fires provide insufficient information. The run takes roughly eighteen hours in good conditions; the fortress maintains trained couriers specifically for this purpose.

**The Bells** are a last resort—massive bronze instruments that can be heard for miles, warning anyone in range that something has gone catastrophically wrong. The bells have been rung three times in recorded history.

### Notable Features

**The Frozen Hall** is a chamber in the fortress's lower levels where captured frostwalkers are contained for study. The chamber is deliberately kept cold, which keeps the frostwalkers dormant. Scholars occasionally visit to examine specimens; the garrison considers the entire arrangement distasteful but useful.

**The Vorukar Chapel** is a small shrine where soldiers pay respects to the titan who died defending this land. The chapel contains no images or relics—just carved stone walls bearing fragments of the stonescripts that describe his final battle. Soldiers visit before and after dangerous deployments.

**The Memorial Wall** bears the names of every Frostwatch soldier killed in the line of duty—over four thousand names spanning four millennia. New names are added with solemn ceremony; the wall has been expanded three times as the list has grown.

**The Commander's Observatory** crowns the highest tower, equipped with Fengruk optical instruments that can resolve detail on the Pale Peaks slopes. The commander maintains personal watch here during critical periods.

### Hooks

**The Captured Wyrm**: A small ice wyrm has been successfully harpoon-anchored and contained in a specially-constructed ice-pit. The commander wants to use it to study wyrm behavior; some of the garrison want to kill it before it escapes or attracts others.

**The New Commander**: Threkk Irontemper's term ends in three months, and the Council hasn't announced his replacement. Rumors suggest the leading candidate has controversial views about proactive expeditions into the Pale Peaks. The garrison is divided.

**The Broken Seal**: One of the detection stakes has gone silent—not removed, just stopped transmitting vibrations. Something destroyed it under the ice, and no one saw what. The garrison is debating whether to investigate or reinforce.

**Ice-Sight Prophecy**: A soldier deep in ice-sight has begun drawing pictures before her episodes—detailed images of the Pale Peaks that include structures no one has documented. Either she's hallucinating or she's seeing something the watchtowers can't.

**The Smuggler**: Someone in the garrison is selling information to traders—patrol schedules, defense positions, supply inventories. The commander doesn't know who, and the investigation is damaging morale at exactly the wrong time.
