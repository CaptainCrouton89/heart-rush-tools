## Gaplands

Tags: region, geography, grassland

A stretch of open terrain west of The Glog where the Dragon's Spine briefly relents, creating the only significant lowland passage along this section of coast. The Gaplands earned their name from the "gaps" in the surrounding mountain barriers—passes and valleys that make this region the natural crossroads of southern Aboyinzu. What passes for civilization on the Dragon's Spine Coast concentrates here.

### Geography

The Gaplands occupy roughly two thousand square miles of rolling grassland and light forest between the Pinnacles of Rosensaw to the south and the western edge of The Glog to the east. The terrain is dramatically more hospitable than surrounding regions—well-drained, relatively flat, and sheltered from the worst coastal winds by the mountain barriers.

The region's defining feature is accessibility. Three major routes converge here:

**The Coastal Road** connects the Gaplands to settlements further west along the Dragon's Spine.

**The Glog Road** leads east through the forest toward The Screech and the eastern coast.

**The Rosensaw Pass** runs south through the Pinnacles, providing access to the Shasalassere region and eventually to the routes leading to the Shrapnel Strait.

This convergence makes the Gaplands strategically important despite their modest size. Whoever controls the crossroads controls movement along the southern Dragon's Spine.

### Climate

The Gaplands benefit from a microclimate created by their geography. The Pinnacles of Rosensaw block the coldest southern winds; The Glog absorbs moisture before it reaches the grasslands; and the gaps themselves channel air currents that keep temperatures relatively moderate. "Relatively" is key—the region is still cold by most standards, with short growing seasons and harsh winters. But compared to the frozen heights and sodden forests that surround it, the Gaplands feel almost temperate.

The grasslands support limited agriculture—cold-weather grains, root vegetables, and pasturage for hardy livestock. The region can't feed a large population, but it can feed the population it has.

### Settlement

The Gaplands host the densest permanent population on the Dragon's Spine Coast, which means roughly six thousand people scattered across several settlements:

**Gaptown** is the largest—a market settlement at the junction of the three major roads. The name is uninspired but accurate. Population fluctuates seasonally as traders, loggers, and travelers pass through, ranging from about two thousand permanent residents to three times that during summer trading season.

Gaptown has no formal government. A council of the wealthiest merchants theoretically manages civic affairs, but in practice, whoever controls the roads controls the town. Currently that's the **Rosensaw Compact**, a loose alliance of trading families who've maintained dominance for three generations by ensuring the passes stay open and the roads stay safe.

**Birintine** sits at the southeastern corner of the Gaplands where the Birintine River emerges from the Pinnacles. The settlement serves as a staging point for logging operations in The Glog and fishing on Birintine Lake. Population roughly eight hundred.

**Morgan's Landing** occupies the northern Gaplands near the headwaters of the Erginya River. The settlement trades with the few communities that exist along the northern coast and serves as the last reliable supply point for anyone foolish enough to travel that direction. Population roughly four hundred.

Scattered farmsteads and ranches fill the space between these settlements, supporting perhaps another two thousand people in isolated households.

### Economy

The Gaplands function as the commercial hub of the Dragon's Spine Coast, not because they produce much themselves but because everything else flows through them:

**Timber** from The Glog moves west through the Gaplands to markets along the coast.

**Fish** from the eastern coastal villages crosses The Screech and The Glog to reach the Gaplands markets.

**Furs and pelts** from trappers throughout the region are bought, sorted, and shipped from Gaptown.

**Manufactured goods** from more populated regions enter the Dragon's Spine through the Gaplands and distribute from there.

The Rosensaw Compact takes a percentage of everything, which makes them wealthy by local standards and despised by everyone who pays their tariffs.

### Threats

The Gaplands' accessibility cuts both ways. The same routes that bring trade also bring trouble:

**Bandits** work the roads despite the Compact's patrols. The terrain offers too many places to hide, and the traffic offers too many targets. Most bandits are opportunistic locals; some are more organized.

**Pelera** occasionally ranges west from her territory in The Glog. The dragon seems to consider the eastern Gaplands part of her domain, though she doesn't enforce this claim consistently. When she does appear, people take shelter and hope she's not hungry.

**The Shasalassere mermaids** sometimes range north through underground waterways, emerging in streams and small lakes far from their usual territory. Livestock disappears; occasionally people do too.

**Weather** kills more people than any other threat. The region's relative mildness creates complacency; unexpected storms catch travelers between settlements with lethal regularity.

### The Rosensaw Compact

The trading alliance that dominates Gaplands commerce has controlled the region for roughly eighty years. The Compact maintains the roads, operates the major trading houses, and provides the only organized security force in the region—a private militia of about two hundred that patrols the routes and protects Compact interests.

The Compact's leadership rotates among five families: Rosensaw (the founding family, from whom the Pinnacles take their name), Erginya, Morgan, Birintine, and Gap. Each family controls specific routes and territories within the overall alliance. Disputes are settled by council vote, with each family holding one vote regardless of current wealth or influence.

The system is stable but increasingly resented. The Compact's tariffs have risen steadily; their enforcement has grown more aggressive; and their militia has been accused of activities that blur the line between security and extortion. Reform movements exist but lack the organization to challenge entrenched power.

### Hooks

**Compact Politics**: One of the five families is maneuvering to break the alliance and seize control of the entire region. They're hiring outsiders for deniable work—sabotage, intimidation, and eventually something worse.

**The Third Road**: A surveyor claims to have found a pass through the Pinnacles that would bypass the existing Rosensaw Pass entirely, allowing traffic to avoid Compact tariffs. Multiple parties want the surveyor's maps—including the Compact, who want them destroyed.

**Dragon Diplomacy**: Pelera has been ranging further west than usual, and the Compact is considering whether to negotiate, fight, or flee. They're looking for people with dragon experience to advise them—or to deliver a message to the dragon herself.
