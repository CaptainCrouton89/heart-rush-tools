## Pinnacles of Rosensaw

Tags: mountains, geography, trade

A distinctive mountain range between the Gaplands and the Shasalassere Mountains, characterized by needle-sharp spires that rise from gentler slopes like teeth from a jaw. The Pinnacles take their name from the Rosensaw family—traders who first established the passes through these mountains and whose descendants still control regional commerce through the Rosensaw Compact.

### Geography

The Pinnacles run roughly east-west for about forty miles, forming a natural barrier between the relatively hospitable Gaplands to the north and the mermaid-haunted Shasalassere range to the south. The range is notable for its distinctive dual geology: rounded, weathered base mountains topped by sharp granite spires that can reach several hundred feet tall.

Geologists attribute this formation to differential erosion—harder granite cores remaining after softer surrounding stone wore away. Whatever the cause, the visual effect is dramatic. The Pinnacles look artificial from a distance, like fortifications built by giants. Early explorers reportedly spent weeks searching for passages between what they assumed were constructed walls.

The spires make the range appear more impassable than it actually is. The gaps between pinnacles provide natural corridors, and three major passes cut through the range at reasonable elevations:

**Rosensaw Pass** (western) is the most heavily traveled, connecting the Gaplands directly to the northern Shasalassere approaches. The pass was cleared and maintained by the original Rosensaw settlers four generations ago.

**Birintine Gap** (central) follows the river of the same name south toward Birintine Lake and The Glog. The route is less developed than Rosensaw Pass but provides access to the logging regions.

**Eastern Needle** (eastern) offers a secondary route to the Shasalassere Way, useful when the main pass is blocked by weather. The eastern route is steeper and narrower, passing between some of the tallest spires in the range.

### The Rosensaw Legacy

The Pinnacles bear a family name because a family made them passable. Four generations ago, a trader named Kethren Rosensaw led an expedition to find a southern route through the Dragon's Spine that would avoid both Pelera's territory and the coastal hazards. He found the passes, cleared them, and established waypoints that made reliable travel possible.

Kethren's descendants parlayed this advantage into commercial dominance. The Rosensaw family controls the western pass that bears their name, collecting tolls from every merchant who uses it. When they formed the Rosensaw Compact with four other families, they ensured the Pinnacles remained central to their power—whoever controls the passes controls movement through this entire region.

The Compact maintains the passes, operates supply stations at key waypoints, and provides guides for travelers unfamiliar with the terrain. These services aren't cheap, but they're reliable. Before the Rosensaws, crossing the Pinnacles meant risking unmarked routes, hidden crevasses, and frequent disasters. Now it merely means paying the toll.

### The Spires

The granite pinnacles that give the range its name serve no practical purpose but attract considerable interest:

**Climbers** come from across Aboyinzu to attempt the tallest spires. The rock is excellent for climbing—hard granite with abundant handholds—and the vertical challenges range from moderate to essentially impossible. A successful ascent of one of the major spires earns recognition among mountaineering circles; a successful ascent of Rosensaw's Needle (the tallest) earns legend status.

**Scholars** study the spires' unusual acoustic properties. Like The Screech to the east, the Pinnacles produce sounds in wind—but where The Screech screams, the Pinnacles sing. The spaces between spires create resonant chambers that produce tones rather than noise. On particularly windy days, the range seems to hum with harmonics.

**Religious seekers** believe the singing indicates divine presence. Several small hermitages exist among the spires, home to contemplatives who listen for meaning in the wind-song. The hermits are generally harmless, though their tendency to build in precarious locations occasionally requires rescue operations.

### The Birintine River

The Birintine River rises in the central Pinnacles, fed by snowmelt and the numerous springs that emerge from the granite formations. The river flows north through Birintine Gap, passing through the eastern Gaplands before emptying into Birintine Lake at the edge of The Glog.

The river is relatively safe by regional standards—it flows too fast for mermaids, and its course doesn't pass through mermaid-colonized underground systems. Travelers can drink from it, ford it at established crossings, and generally interact with water without the paranoia that characterizes life near the Shasalassere.

The Birintine settlement at the river's emergence from the Gap serves as a transfer point between the Pinnacles routes and The Glog logging operations.

### Wildlife and Hazards

The Pinnacles support limited wildlife—mountain goats on the lower slopes, raptors nesting on the spires, small rodents and their predators in the rocky terrain between. Nothing particularly dangerous lives here by Dragon's Spine standards, which makes the range feel almost safe.

The real hazards are environmental:

**Rockfall** from the spires is a constant concern. The same weathering that created the pinnacles continues to shed material from them. Travelers learn to watch for fresh debris on trails and to avoid camping directly beneath tall formations.

**Weather** changes rapidly in the Pinnacles, with clear skies becoming dangerous storms in less than an hour. The passes can close without warning, stranding travelers between waypoints.

**Hidden crevasses** exist throughout the range—gaps between formations filled with snow or debris that looks solid but isn't. The maintained trails avoid known crevasse areas, but off-trail travel is risky.

### Hooks

**The Bypass**: Someone is developing an alternative route through the Pinnacles—one that would avoid Compact-controlled passes entirely. The Rosensaws want to know who's responsible and how far the project has progressed. They're paying for information, but what they'll do with that information remains unspecified.

**The Singing Spire**: One particular pinnacle has begun producing sounds that listeners interpret as words—not the usual wind-harmonics but what seems like speech in an unknown language. A hermit who lived near the spire has disappeared. Scholars and Compact security are both interested in investigating.

**The Climber's Challenge**: A wealthy patron is offering a substantial prize for the first successful ascent of Rosensaw's Needle—but only if accomplished within the next month, before the seasonal weather closes the high routes. Several climbing teams are assembling. Not all of them plan to win through skill alone.
