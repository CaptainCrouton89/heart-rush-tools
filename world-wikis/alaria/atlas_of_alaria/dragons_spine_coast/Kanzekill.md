## Kanzekill

Tags: dragon, landmark

The lair of Kanzekill, a rust-orange Force dragon who has hunted the hidden fortress of Mountainveil for over four centuries. The lair sits in the southern Dragon's Spine, near the village that bears a corruption of the dragon's name, along the Force leyline she cannot fully master.

The area around the lair experiences constant low-level tremors. Locals have learned to read these vibrations—when they intensify, Kanzekill is hunting; when they turn violent, she's lost the trail again and the mountains will shake with her fury.
