# Dragon's Spine Coast

## Geography

Dragon's Spine is the long, misty, snow-covered mountain range that runs east-west across the entire southern edge of Aboyinzu. This is a cold, dramatic landscape—a stark contrast to the tropical and savanna regions to the north. The mountains eventually fragment into an archipelago stretching eastward, culminating in the Pindolin Islands.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dalizi Highlands and Dalizi Confederation; the Morygun Mountains connect from the northwest
- **East**: The range transitions into archipelago, extending to the Pindolin Islands
- **South**: The Crimson Coast lies below the mountains; beyond that, open southern ocean
- **West**: The southwestern coastline of Aboyinzu

### Climate

Dragon's Spine is substantially colder than the rest of Aboyinzu, especially in its southernmost reaches. The high altitude and southern latitude combine to create a misty, often snow-covered environment. The peaks are frequently shrouded in cloud and fog, making navigation treacherous.

### The Mountain-to-Archipelago Transition

As Dragon's Spine extends eastward, the continuous mountain range gradually breaks apart. The peaks become islands, the ridges become straits, until the mountains have fully transformed into the island chains of the eastern archipelago. The Pindolin Islands represent the farthest extent of this transition—the final fragments of Dragon's Spine scattered across the sea.

### The Pindolin Islands

A large archipelago stretching east and then curving north into the ocean. These islands are the seaward continuation of the Dragon's Spine range, maintaining much of the cold, misty character of the mainland mountains.

## Political Climate

The Dragon's Spine is defined by three powers who mostly ignore each other:

**Kanzekill** rules the surface and sky of the western mountains—a Force dragon consumed by her four-century hunt for Mountainveil, a hidden fortress that holds her stolen true name. She doesn't demand tribute or terrorize for sport; she barely notices the surface kingdoms anymore. Her existence has narrowed to a single obsession. The locals have learned her patterns, built shelters for her rages, and developed expertise in predicting her movements. She's become predictable in her unpredictability.

**The Nydor of Emblydium** rule the deep places—dark dwarves who forge chains and instruments of oppression in lightless halls. They don't interact with Kanzekill; she can't reach their tunnels, and they have nothing she wants. They consider the dragon a convenient surface hazard that discourages rescue missions and invasion attempts. Their slave raids emerge from hidden mountain entrances, take what they need, and vanish back into the dark.

**The Surface Kingdoms** survive through adaptation and moral compromise. Dhabisa, Shunde, and Kaftaulo have learned to read dragon-sign, avoid Nydor territory, and maintain a culture of silence about Mountainveil. They don't rescue escaped slaves—doing so would draw Nydor attention. They don't speak of the hidden fortress—doing so might reach Kanzekill's ears. They've made their peace with evil to survive.

### The Tribute System

The surface states don't pay formal tribute to either threat, but they've developed informal accommodations:

**With Kanzekill**: They stay out of her way. When she hunts, they shelter. When she rages, they rebuild. They share information about her movements freely across political boundaries, because everyone benefits from knowing where the dragon is. No one sells information about Mountainveil—not because they're noble, but because they know their neighbors would kill them before Kanzekill arrived.

**With the Nydor**: They maintain silence. They don't guide surface armies to Emblydium's entrances. They don't harbor escaped slaves conspicuously. They pretend the dark dwarves don't exist, and in exchange, the slave raids take from travelers and frontier villages rather than established settlements. It's an unspoken bargain that everyone hates and no one breaks.

### The Hidden Players

**Mountainveil**: Somewhere in the mountains, eight hundred Vaelish descendants hide behind Force-magic misdirection, guarding the dragon's true name and waiting for... something. They've been waiting for four centuries. They have no plan beyond survival.

**The Kingdom of Vael**: Once controlled the western passes. Destroyed by Kanzekill five centuries ago. Its survivors built Mountainveil; its legacy haunts the region.

## What Makes It Interesting

The Dragon's Spine offers multiple scales of conflict:

**Personal**: A Vaelish defector with failing mind-blocks. A slave who escaped Emblydium and knows too much. A scholar who thinks they can reconstruct the name-stealing ritual.

**Regional**: The Force leyline is shifting; Mountainveil's protections are weakening. A faction inside the fortress wants to use the dragon's name as a weapon. Someone has found a map.

**Continental**: What happens when Kanzekill finds Mountainveil? What happens if someone speaks her name? What would the Nydor do with a bound dragon?

The region's stability is an illusion. Everyone is waiting for the equilibrium to break.

## What Will Go Wrong

**The Leyline Shift**: The Force leyline that protects Mountainveil has been drifting for centuries. The oldest Vaelish mages can feel the difference. The veil requires constant recalibration, and eventually, it will fail.

**Kanzekill's Patience**: Four centuries is a long time, even for a dragon. She's growing desperate, her searches more erratic, her rages more frequent. Something will break—either she finds the fortress, or she decides to start extracting information from the surface kingdoms by force.

**The Name-Speakers**: A faction within Mountainveil believes they should use the true name, bind Kanzekill, and reclaim their ancestral lands. They're gaining support. The Keepers of the Name are losing ground.

**Nydor Expansion**: The dark dwarves have been content with occasional raids, but their forges are always hungry for labor. If they decide the surface kingdoms have grown complacent, if they decide to take rather than raid, the careful balance collapses.

**The Map**: Rumors persist that a map to Mountainveil exists—created by a defector, stolen from the Council of Ash, sold to someone who doesn't understand what they have. If that map reaches Kanzekill, four centuries of hiding end in fire.
