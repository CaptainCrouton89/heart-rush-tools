# Dragon's Spine Coast

## Geography

Dragon's Spine is the long, misty, snow-covered mountain range that runs east-west across the entire southern edge of Aboyinzu. This is a cold, dramatic landscape—a stark contrast to the tropical and savanna regions to the north. The mountains eventually fragment into an archipelago stretching eastward, culminating in the Pindolin Islands.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dalizi Highlands and Dalizi Confederation; the Morygun Mountains connect from the northwest
- **East**: The range transitions into archipelago, extending to the Pindolin Islands
- **South**: The Crimson Coast lies below the mountains; beyond that, open southern ocean
- **West**: The southwestern coastline of Aboyinzu

### Climate

Dragon's Spine is substantially colder than the rest of Aboyinzu, especially in its southernmost reaches. The high altitude and southern latitude combine to create a misty, often snow-covered environment. The peaks are frequently shrouded in cloud and fog, making navigation treacherous.

### The Mountain-to-Archipelago Transition

As Dragon's Spine extends eastward, the continuous mountain range gradually breaks apart. The peaks become islands, the ridges become straits, until the mountains have fully transformed into the island chains of the eastern archipelago. The Pindolin Islands represent the farthest extent of this transition—the final fragments of Dragon's Spine scattered across the sea.

### The Pindolin Islands

A large archipelago stretching east and then curving north into the ocean. These islands are the seaward continuation of the Dragon's Spine range, maintaining much of the cold, misty character of the mainland mountains.
