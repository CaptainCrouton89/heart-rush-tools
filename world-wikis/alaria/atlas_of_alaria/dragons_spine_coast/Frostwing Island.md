## Frostwing Island

Tags: island, geography, wildlife

A large island off the southeastern Dragon's Spine Coast, separated from the mainland by roughly five miles of treacherous water. Frostwing Island earned its name from the vast colonies of seabirds that nest there—white-winged species that look like animated frost when they take flight in their thousands. The island is one of the few places along this coast that remains free of both dragon influence and mermaid threat, making it valuable despite its isolation.

### Geography

Frostwing Island stretches roughly fifteen miles east to west and eight miles north to south, making it substantial enough to support significant settlement if anyone wanted to live there. The terrain is predominantly low hills covered in hardy grass and scrub, with rocky cliffs along most of the coastline. The highest point barely reaches five hundred feet—a gentle landscape compared to the dramatic mainland mountains visible on the northern horizon.

The island has no permanent freshwater sources beyond rainfall and a few small springs. This limitation has historically prevented large-scale habitation, though seasonal camps and small permanent populations have existed at various points.

The surrounding waters are notoriously dangerous. The channel between Frostwing and the mainland is shallow in places, with underwater rocks that have claimed countless vessels. The currents are unpredictable, and the strait funnels wind into concentrated gusts that can capsize boats without warning. Successful crossing requires either deep local knowledge or extraordinary luck.

### The Bird Colonies

What Frostwing lacks in human appeal, it compensates for in avian abundance. The island hosts the largest seabird colonies on the Dragon's Spine Coast—perhaps the largest in southern Aboyinzu. Several species nest here in staggering numbers:

**Frostwings** (the island's namesake) are large, white-winged gulls that nest in colonies of tens of thousands. When disturbed, they rise in clouds that can blot out portions of the sky. Their calls are loud enough to be heard on the mainland when wind conditions are right.

**Storm petrels** nest in burrows along the cliffs, emerging at night to feed and returning before dawn. Sailors consider them omens—their presence supposedly predicts incoming weather.

**Puffins** occupy the rockier sections of coastline, their colorful beaks providing the only visual relief from the island's predominantly gray and white palette.

**Cormorants** fish the surrounding waters in organized groups, their diving patterns visible from shore as dark patches moving across the surface.

The birds produce vast quantities of guano, which has accumulated over centuries into deposits several feet thick in some areas. This guano is valuable as fertilizer, and its harvest represents the island's primary economic activity.

### The Guano Trade

Frostwing Island's isolation might have kept it permanently uninhabited if not for the fertilizer potential of seabird waste. Guano from the island commands premium prices in agricultural regions throughout Aboyinzu—it's more concentrated and effective than any other available fertilizer.

The **Frostwing Guano Company** has operated a seasonal harvesting operation on the island for roughly forty years. Workers arrive in late spring after the breeding season ends, spend the summer digging, drying, and bagging guano, and depart before autumn storms make the crossing impossible. The work is unpleasant—the smell alone drives most laborers away—but pays well enough to attract crews willing to endure it.

The Company maintains a small permanent staff on the island year-round: a caretaker, his family, and a few workers who maintain the facilities and guard the accumulated guano stores. This skeleton crew numbers perhaps a dozen people, making them the island's only permanent residents.

The operation has made the Rosensaw Compact wealthy—they own the Company and control access to the guano trade. This monopoly is a significant source of their regional influence.

### Mermaid-Free Waters

Notably, the Shasalassere mermaids have never been documented in the waters around Frostwing Island. Whether the strait is too shallow, the currents too strong, or some other factor prevents their expansion remains unclear. The result is that Frostwing represents one of the few places in this region where people can safely approach the water's edge.

This safety has made the island valuable for activities impossible on the mainland. Fishing, swimming, and water-based recreation that would be suicidal near the Shasalassere are merely inadvisable here. A few wealthy eccentrics have built seasonal retreats on the island's southern coast, valuing the privacy and the ability to walk the beach without fear of being dragged underwater.

### Other Features

**The Rookery** is the name given to the island's central plateau, where the densest bird colonies concentrate. The noise is overwhelming, the smell is worse, and the ground is covered in several feet of accumulated waste. No one goes there except guano harvesters.

**Shelter Bay** on the island's western coast provides the only reliable anchorage. The guano Company operates from here, and the handful of buildings that constitute the island's only settlement cluster around the bay.

**The Old Tower** on the northeastern point may predate human habitation of the island. The structure is too weathered to date precisely, but its construction doesn't match any known architectural tradition. It contains nothing—no furnishings, no artifacts, no clues to its purpose. Birds nest in its upper levels now.

### Hooks

**The Year-Round Crew**: The island's caretaker has missed his scheduled signal for two weeks. The Company wants someone to investigate, but they don't want to wait for the normal resupply run. They'll pay well for a fast, discreet investigation.

**The Old Tower**: A scholar believes the tower on Frostwing may be connected to pre-Sundering history—possibly a watchtower from the titan era, possibly something stranger. She wants to conduct an archaeological investigation but needs protection from both the elements and whatever caused the tower's original builders to abandon it.

**Breeding Season Disruption**: Something has disturbed the bird colonies, and the birds are not returning to their usual nesting grounds. If the disruption continues, there will be no guano harvest this year—a catastrophe for the Company and everyone who depends on their trade. Finding and eliminating the cause is worth a substantial reward.
