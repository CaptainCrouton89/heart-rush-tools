## Lakes of the Glog Coast

Tags: lakes, rivers, geography, water

The region around The Glog forest contains numerous lakes and rivers, each with distinct character and varying degrees of safety. Understanding these water features is essential for anyone traveling through the area—some are relatively safe; others are death traps for the unwary.

### Lake Morgan and the Erginya River

**Lake Morgan** sits in the northwestern corner of The Glog, a cold, deep body of water approximately two miles across at its widest point. The lake is surrounded by some of the densest forest in the region, with trees growing down to the waterline and blocking most sight lines.

The lake is notoriously murky despite its depth—sediment from the surrounding forest floor clouds the water year-round. Local legend claims something large lives in the depths, and the legends have enough supporting evidence to be taken seriously. Boats that venture to the lake's center have been known to capsize suddenly, with survivors reporting impacts from below. The Glog's loggers avoid the lake entirely.

The **Erginya River** drains Lake Morgan northward, eventually reaching the sea through marshlands that few have mapped. The river is navigable for its first few miles but becomes increasingly difficult as it approaches the coast—tangled with debris, interrupted by beaver dams, and prone to sudden depth changes.

The Erginya fishing communities near the river mouth are small and insular, trading with few outsiders. They claim to know what lives in Lake Morgan. They don't discuss it.

### Birintine Lake and River

**Birintine Lake** lies in The Glog's western reaches, fed by the **Birintine River** that flows down from the Pinnacles of Rosensaw. Unlike Lake Morgan, Birintine is relatively shallow and warmed by geothermal activity beneath the lakebed.

The lake is one of the few water features in this region considered safe for swimming and fishing. The thermal heating creates conditions hostile to the Shasalassere mermaids (they prefer cold water), and the lake's shallow depth limits what else might lurk there. Small fishing communities work the lake during summer months.

The sulfurous smell that characterizes much of The Glog likely originates from the same geothermal activity that warms Birintine Lake. Some find the smell unbearable; others claim you stop noticing after the first day.

### The Lonely Lakes

A chain of small lakes in The Glog's northern forest, the **Lonely Lakes** earned their name because nothing lives in or around them. No fish swim in their waters. No birds nest on their shores. No animals drink from them. The water is clear, cold, and perfectly still.

The phenomenon has never been satisfactorily explained. The water contains no obvious toxins or contaminants—travelers who've drunk from the Lonely Lakes in emergencies suffered no ill effects. Yet every form of wildlife avoids them. Even the omnipresent mosquitoes and flies of The Glog are absent near these waters.

Local superstition holds that the lakes are cursed, that something happened here long ago that the land remembers even if people don't. Scholars prefer theories involving mineral content or subtle magical contamination. Neither group has produced convincing evidence.

Recent reports describe animals found frozen near the Lonely Lakes despite temperatures well above freezing—as if the lakes somehow produce cold rather than merely containing it. These reports remain unconfirmed.

### Shimmer Lake

**Shimmer Lake** lies at The Glog's eastern edge, marking the boundary between forest and the foothills of The Screech. The lake earns its name from the way light plays across its surface—reflections that seem too bright, too active, as if the water itself generates luminescence.

The phenomenon is probably optical, caused by mineral content refracting sunlight in unusual ways. Or it might be magical. The distinction matters because Shimmer Lake is Pelera's lair.

The green dragon has claimed the lake and surrounding territory as her own. The shimmer may be natural, may be a side effect of draconic presence, or may be something Pelera deliberately cultivates. She doesn't explain, and no one asks. What's known is that the lake's boundaries define the core of her territory—anyone entering without her sufferance is either brave, desperate, or unaware of their danger.

The lake supposedly contains a submerged structure of some kind—glimpsed occasionally when the angle of light is right. Whether this is Pelera's actual lair, a pre-existing ruin she's claimed, or a trick of the shimmer effect is unknown.

### Cogspit Lakes

The **Cogspit Lakes** dot the narrow coastal strip east of The Screech, a chain of brackish pools connected to the sea by underground channels. The name comes from the distinctive clicking sound the rocks make when waves withdraw—a mechanical noise that sounds like gears turning.

The sound is entirely natural, produced by rock formations in the underground channels. The tidal action creates pressure differentials that force air and water through narrow gaps, producing the clicking. But the first settlers in this area heard only the sound and assumed machinery—hence "Cogspit," supposedly the noise of some vast underground mechanism spitting up water.

The lakes support modest fishing communities that use the brackish water as a natural fish trap. The underground channels allow small marine species to enter but prevent larger predators from following. What emerges is safe to eat and easy to catch.

### Murky Lakes

South of Cogspit, the **Murky Lakes** occupy depressions where sediment from the Shasalassere Mountains collects. The water here is perpetually clouded—you can't see six inches below the surface. The murk protects the abundant fish population from aerial predators but makes fishing complicated.

The locals have developed specialized techniques involving baited nets and patience. The murk also hides the fish from the Shasalassere mermaids, who hunt primarily by sight and vibration. Whether the mermaids have actually colonized Murky Lakes is unclear—no one has seen them there, but no one can see much of anything there.

Travelers are advised to treat Murky Lakes as potentially mermaid-infested until proven otherwise. The murk that protects fish would equally hide approaching threats.

### Water Safety Summary

For travelers in this region:

- **Safe**: Birintine Lake (thermal), Birintine River (fast-flowing), Cogspit Lakes (brackish/tidal)
- **Uncertain**: Murky Lakes (possible mermaid presence), Erginya River (unknown deeper sections)
- **Avoid**: Lake Morgan (something in the depths), Lonely Lakes (unnatural), Shimmer Lake (dragon territory)
- **Dangerous**: Any water connected to Shasalassere underground systems

When in doubt, don't drink directly from the source, don't wade, don't swim, and don't assume any body of water is safe. The mermaids' range continues to expand, and water that was safe last year may not be safe now.
