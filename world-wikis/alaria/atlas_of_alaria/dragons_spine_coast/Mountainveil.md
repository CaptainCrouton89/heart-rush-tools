## Mountainveil

Tags: fortress, hidden, force-leyline, vael

A hidden fortress in the southern Dragon's Spine, built four centuries ago by survivors of the Kingdom of Vael after Kanzekill destroyed their realm. Mountainveil uses the Force leyline to render itself unfindable—not invisible, but *unreachable*, surrounded by subtle misdirections that turn away anyone who draws near.

### The Veil

Mountainveil doesn't hide behind walls or illusions. It hides behind *redirection*.

The Force leyline runs directly beneath the fortress, and Vael's mages learned to tap it in ways no one has replicated since. The effect is subtle: travelers approaching Mountainveil find their attention wandering. The path they were following seems less promising. Another route looks better. They turn aside, confident in their decision, never realizing they've been pushed.

The effect intensifies with proximity. Those who resist the initial misdirection find stronger compulsions—sudden exhaustion, disorientation, the unshakeable sense that they've already searched this area and found nothing. Even dragons aren't immune. Kanzekill has passed within a mile of Mountainveil dozens of times, her Force-attuned senses screaming that something is *there*, but the veil turns her aside every time.

The cruelest refinement: the fortress uses Kanzekill's own element against her. Her attunement to Force magic, which should help her detect the leyline's manipulation, instead makes her more susceptible. She can feel the wrongness but cannot pinpoint it. The veil speaks her language and lies in it.

### The Fortress

Mountainveil itself is unremarkable—a stone fortress built into a cliffside, large enough to house perhaps a thousand people, supplied by mountain streams and terraced gardens hidden in the surrounding peaks. It was constructed in haste by refugees who expected pursuit, and it shows: functional architecture, minimal ornamentation, everything designed for concealment and defense.

What makes Mountainveil extraordinary is what it contains:

**The Survivors of Vael**: Descendants of the kingdom Kanzekill destroyed, now five centuries removed from the original refugees. They've maintained their identity, their rituals, and their purpose: keep the dragon's name hidden, keep the fortress secret, wait for... something. The original plan, if there was one, has been lost to time. Now they simply endure.

**The Enumerable Riches**: The treasure Kanzekill seeks isn't gold—it's the accumulated knowledge of Vael, including the ritual that stole her true name. Books, artifacts, magical implements salvaged during the flight. And somewhere among them, the vessel containing the name itself.

**The Weapon**: Anyone who holds Kanzekill's true name could theoretically command her. The Vaelish have never used this power—speaking the name would reveal the fortress's existence—but they've maintained the capability for four hundred years. If the dragon ever finds them, they have one final defense.

### The People

The Vaelish number perhaps eight hundred, descended from the few thousand who survived Vael's destruction. They're insular by necessity, suspicious of outsiders, and bound by traditions that have calcified over centuries of isolation.

Life in Mountainveil is structured around secrecy. Children learn never to speak of the fortress to strangers. Trade with the outside world happens through intermediaries who don't know where their Vaelish contacts live. The few who leave—and some do, unable to bear the isolation—are given rituals to forget the fortress's location, mental blocks that activate if anyone tries to extract the information.

The Keepers of the Name are a hereditary priesthood who maintain the vessel containing Kanzekill's true name. They alone know how to speak it, how to command the dragon, how to destroy the name if the fortress falls. They've never used this knowledge. They hope they never will.

Leadership falls to the Council of Ash—seven elders who make decisions for the community. They're conservative, cautious, and terrified of change. For four hundred years, their strategy has been simple: hide, wait, survive. They have no plan for what comes next.

### What Will Go Wrong

Mountainveil is stable but stagnant. Several pressures threaten to shatter the equilibrium:

**The Leyline Shifts**: Force leylines aren't permanent. They drift over centuries, and the one beneath Mountainveil has been moving—slowly, imperceptibly, but the oldest mages can feel the difference. The veil requires constant adjustment. Eventually, the leyline may shift enough that the fortress's protections fail entirely.

**Generational Drift**: The younger Vaelish didn't choose this life. They were born into hiding, raised on stories of a kingdom destroyed before their great-great-grandparents were born, taught to fear a dragon they've never seen. Some question the purpose. Some want to leave. Some wonder if Kanzekill even still hunts them.

**The Name's Temptation**: Controlling a dragon would mean power beyond imagining. Not everyone in Mountainveil believes that power should remain unused. Factions have formed—those who want to speak the name, bind Kanzekill, and use her as a weapon to reclaim their ancestral lands. The Keepers resist, but the pressure grows.

**Outside Discovery**: The surface kingdoms know Mountainveil exists as rumor. If someone found proof—a map, a captured Vaelish, a lucky guess—and sold that information to Kanzekill, four centuries of hiding would end in fire and thunder.

### Hooks

- **The Defector**: A young Vaelish has fled Mountainveil, their mind-blocks failing. They know where the fortress is—or they know enough to lead someone close. Kanzekill would pay anything for this information. The Vaelish would kill to prevent its spread.

- **The Shifting Leyline**: The Force leyline has moved enough that Mountainveil's protections are weakening. The Council needs outside help—a mage who understands leylines, someone who can recalibrate the veil. But bringing an outsider inside means trusting them with everything.

- **The Name-Speakers**: A faction within Mountainveil has decided to use the name. They'll bind Kanzekill and send her against their enemies—the Nydor, perhaps, or a surface kingdom that wronged them. The Keepers are trying to stop them, but they're outnumbered.

- **Kanzekill's Ultimatum**: The dragon has captured someone who claims to know where Mountainveil is. She offers a trade: bring her proof of the fortress's location, and she'll spare the region. Refuse, and she begins systematic destruction until someone talks.

### Location

Mountainveil lies somewhere in the southern Dragon's Spine, within a day's flight of Kanzekill's lair. The exact location is unknown to everyone outside the fortress—and to most inside, who have never left and couldn't retrace the route if they tried.

The Force leyline passes directly beneath it, continuing east toward the city-state that bears the fortress's name: Mountainveil the city, which has no connection to Mountainveil the fortress beyond an ironic coincidence of naming.
