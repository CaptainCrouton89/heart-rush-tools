## Bellowing Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, gondurak, fengruk

A harsh range of peaks in the eastern Dragon's Spine, rising between the Hills of Sarrow to the north and the Pale Peaks to the south. The Bellowing Mountains are perpetually cold—snow blankets the upper slopes year-round, and the valleys rarely see temperatures above freezing even in summer. This is Gondurak, homeland of the Fengruk dwarves and site of the three great forges.

### The Sound

The mountains earned their name from the noise they make. On still days, a deep rhythmic rumbling echoes through the valleys—not thunder, not earthquakes, but the collective hammering of the Fengruk forges reverberating through the stone. The titans built these mountains hollow, riddling them with forge-chambers and ventilation shafts that carry sound for miles. When the forges are at full operation, the entire range seems to breathe with each hammer stroke.

The effect is disorienting for first-time visitors. The sound comes from everywhere and nowhere, rising and falling in patterns that seem almost musical. Fengruk children learn the rhythms—they can identify which forge is operating, how many smiths are working, sometimes even what they're making, all from the quality of the echoes.

During the rare periods when all three forges fall silent simultaneously—for holy days or emergencies—the quiet is described as oppressive. The mountains feel wrong without their voice.

### Geography

The Bellowing Mountains are geologically distinct from the surrounding Dragon's Spine. Where the Pale Peaks are ice-wrapped granite and the Silver Slopes are metal-veined sedimentary stone, the Bellowing Mountains are primarily volcanic—ancient basalt and pumice shot through with veins of exotic minerals. The titans chose this location deliberately; the volcanic activity provides natural heat for the deep forges, and the mineral deposits include materials found nowhere else on Alaria.

Three major peaks anchor the range: Sildraz's Crown in the center (where the World Forge burns), Durkarn's Fang to the northwest, and Morgrun's Pillar to the northeast. Between them spread lesser peaks, glacier-filled valleys, and the entrances to the dwarven cities that honeycomb the stone.

The southern slopes descend toward the Shrapnel Strait, cut by numerous streams that eventually feed into the eastern channels. The northern slopes give way to the Hills of Sarrow, a gradual transition from frozen peaks to windswept grassland. The eastern reaches extend toward the Shirik River headwaters before giving way to territories beyond Fengruk control.

### Climate

The Bellowing Mountains sit far enough south that winter darkness lasts for months, and summer brings only a few hours of twilight rather than true night. The cold is relentless—exposed skin freezes in minutes during deep winter, and even summer temperatures hover near freezing at the lower elevations.

The Fengruk have adapted thoroughly. Their cities are almost entirely underground, warmed by forge-heat and geothermal vents. Surface structures are limited to observation posts, watchtowers, and the heavily-insulated gates that control access to the interior. Visitors who arrive expecting dwarven architecture on display find only ice-crusted rock and carefully hidden doorways.

### The Forge Cities

**Sildraz** crowns the central peak, built around the World Forge—a titan-constructed facility capable of casting metal in quantities no other forge can match. The city is the largest Fengruk settlement, home to roughly fifteen thousand dwarves and the seat of Gondurak's government.

**Durkarn** occupies the northwestern peak, built on an ancient dragon graveyard. The forges here specialize in incorporating dragon bone and scale into metalwork, producing weapons and armor with properties that pure metal can't achieve. The city is smaller than Sildraz but arguably more influential in martial circles.

**Morgrundar** rises from the northeastern peak, built on massive deposits of Malstaric ash. The forges here work with this otherworldly material, creating items with subtle connections to the shadow plane. The work is dangerous and the results unpredictable, but demand from collectors and practitioners of dark arts keeps the forges busy.

### Trade Routes

The primary route into Gondurak follows the eastern valleys from the Dalizi lowlands, skirting the Hills of Sarrow before ascending through a series of switchbacks to Sildraz's main gate. This route is passable most of the year, though winter storms can close it for weeks at a time.

A secondary route connects to Sweivyon and the Silver Slopes via mountain passes—shorter but steeper, used primarily by traders bringing raw silver to the Fengruk smiths. This route closes entirely during winter.

No maintained route leads south toward the Pale Peaks. The Fengruk have deliberately not built one.

### Azanfrain

The fortress of Azanfrain sits at the southern edge of Fengruk territory, built into a spur of rock overlooking the northern Shrapnel Strait. From here, watchers monitor the ice conditions, track creature movements on the Pale Peaks slopes, and coordinate responses when frostwalkers or ice wyrms attempt to migrate north.

Azanfrain is not a comfortable posting. The garrison rotates every six months—longer deployments tend to produce psychological effects the Fengruk euphemistically call "ice-sight." But the work is necessary. Without Azanfrain, threats from the peaks would reach the forge cities unchallenged.

### What Lies Beneath

The titan-era tunnel systems extend far deeper than the Fengruk currently occupy. The forges themselves are relatively shallow—built for titan convenience rather than dwarven preference—but shafts descend into darkness that no one has fully explored. The Fengruk have sealed most of these lower passages, not from fear of what might be down there, but from respect for whatever the titans were keeping separate from the working levels.

Occasionally, sounds rise from the sealed depths. Not forge-sounds—something else. The Fengruk don't discuss this publicly. The mountains bellow, they say. That's all.
