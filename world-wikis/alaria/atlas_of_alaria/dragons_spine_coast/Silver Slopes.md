## Silver Slopes

Tags: mountains, geography, mining

A mineral-rich stretch of the central Dragon's Spine where silver veins run so thick that exposed rock faces gleam in sunlight. The Silver Slopes have attracted miners for as long as anyone can remember, and the city-state of Sweivyon has grown wealthy controlling access to the richest deposits.

### The Silver Seams

The geology here differs from the surrounding Dragon's Spine. Whatever forces created the Shrapnel Strait—the Fengruk blame the titan Vorukar's death—also heaved deep mineral deposits to the surface. Silver is the most abundant, but the slopes also yield lead, zinc, and occasional pockets of raw gemstones. The Sunbeam River carries so much mineral runoff that its bed glitters.

Mining operations dot the slopes at various elevations, from small family claims worked with picks and baskets to industrial excavations employing hundreds. Sweivyon regulates the larger operations through a licensing system, collecting fees and mandating safety standards that are routinely ignored. Smaller claims operate in a legal gray zone—technically requiring permits, practically too numerous and remote to police.

The highest-quality silver comes from the deep mines near Sweivyon itself, where the veins run pure enough to require minimal refining. This "slope silver" commands premium prices in markets across Alaria, prized by jewelers and alchemists for its purity. The city-state guards its reputation jealously, assaying all exports and branding approved ingots with the Sweivyon stamp.

### Working the Slopes

Mining the Silver Slopes is dangerous work. The rock is unstable—riddled with the same fractures that characterize the Shrapnel Strait coastline—and cave-ins claim lives every season. The altitude brings harsh weather, and the remoter claims can be cut off by snow for months at a time. Bandits prey on ore shipments, and the occasional monster wanders up from the deeper tunnels.

Despite this, the slopes attract a steady stream of fortune-seekers. A good strike can set a family up for generations. A mediocre strike can still fund a comfortable retirement. Even a poor strike usually produces enough to pay off debts and try again somewhere else. The mathematics of hope keeps the camps populated.

The mining camps have developed their own rough culture: claims courts that settle disputes, mutual aid societies that care for injured miners, informal militias that patrol the roads. Sweivyon provides oversight in theory, but the city-state's authority diminishes rapidly with distance from its walls.

### The Sunbeam Catchment

Sweivyon has constructed an elaborate system of sluices and settling pools along the upper Sunbeam River, capturing mineral wealth that would otherwise wash down to the strait. The catchment system employs hundreds—dredgers, sluice operators, refiners, guards—and produces a significant fraction of the city-state's income.

The catchment also serves a political function. By controlling what reaches the lower river, Sweivyon limits the opportunities for independent prospectors to profit from runoff. This has created tension with the glitter-panners who work the river mouth, and occasional conflicts over water rights have escalated to violence.

### Relation to Neighbors

The Silver Slopes sit between the Miramar Peaks to the west and the Bellowing Mountains to the east. Sweivyon maintains cordial trade relations with Gondurak—Fengruk metalwork complements slope silver nicely—while keeping a wary distance from the Miramar region and its dragon problems. Kanzekill has never shown interest in the slopes' mineral wealth, but Sweivyon's leaders prefer not to test that indifference.
