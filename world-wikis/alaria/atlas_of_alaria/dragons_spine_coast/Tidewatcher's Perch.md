## Tidewatcher's Perch

Tags: poi, pindolin-islands, curse

A wooden platform on the highest point of an unnamed island in the central Pindolins, where a man has been watching the tides for eleven hundred years because he won a bet and can't stop.

### The Wager

His name was Korvo Maelish, and he was a navigator. A good one—possibly the best of his generation, definitely the most arrogant. He could read currents, predict storms, and calculate tidal patterns with uncanny accuracy. He bragged about it constantly.

Something heard him.

The stories don't agree on what. Some say a kraken-matriarch surfaced alongside his ship and spoke in a voice like grinding coral. Others claim it was something older, something that lived in the tidal patterns themselves. One account says it was just a stranger in a port tavern, a woman with eyes like still water who smiled when Korvo boasted.

Whatever it was, it made him an offer: predict the tides correctly for one hundred years, and receive a navigator's perfect knowledge—every current, every storm, every safe passage in every sea. Fail once, and belong to the deep forever.

Korvo accepted. He was that certain.

### The Victory

He won.

For one hundred years, Korvo sat on this island and predicted every tide. High tide, low tide, neap tide, spring tide—the exact minute, the exact height, accounting for storms and earthquakes and the gravitational pull of both moons. He built the platform himself in the first year. He carved tally marks into the wood. He watched.

By year thirty, his crew had abandoned him. By year fifty, everyone who knew his name was dead. By year eighty, he'd stopped speaking aloud because there was no one to hear. But he kept predicting. He kept *winning*.

On the final day of the hundredth year, the tide came in exactly as he'd said it would: seventeen minutes past the fourth hour, three feet above the median line, carrying the corpse of a whale that had died somewhere in the Abyssal current. The bet was over. He'd won.

The prize never came.

### The Terms

Korvo had been so focused on winning that he hadn't considered what "navigator's perfect knowledge" actually meant. He'd assumed it was something that would be *given* to him—a gift, a blessing, knowledge poured into his mind.

Instead, he discovered he couldn't stop.

The knowledge was there. He could feel it—every current in every sea, every tide that would ever rise or fall. But accessing it required *watching*. The moment he looked away from the water, the moment he stopped predicting, the knowledge began to fade. And the terms of the bet hadn't included an ending clause.

He'd won the right to perfect knowledge. He hadn't won the right to stop having it.

### The Perch Today

Korvo Maelish is still there.

He sits on a wooden platform that shouldn't have survived a century of salt air, let alone eleven of them. The wood is gray and smooth, worn by wind rather than rot. The chair is simple—he built it himself, and he's rebuilt it several times when storms took it, always in the same design because changing anything feels wrong now.

He doesn't eat. He doesn't sleep. He doesn't die. These things require looking away from the water, and he can't look away from the water.

Visitors describe him as thin but not skeletal, weathered but not decayed. His eyes are open and focused on the horizon. His lips move constantly, mouthing numbers and predictions in a language that stopped being spoken eight centuries ago. If you get close enough, you can hear him: *"Seven minutes, two feet four inches, eastward current at four knots carrying debris from the Shallows..."*

He's aware of visitors. Sometimes.

### Interaction

Approaching the Perch is safe. Korvo doesn't attack, doesn't threaten, doesn't even seem to notice most people. He's watching the tides.

Speaking to him occasionally produces responses. He'll answer questions about navigation, currents, and safe passages with perfect accuracy—but only if you can get his attention between predictions, which means waiting for a moment of calm water (rare in the Pindolins) and speaking quickly before the next tide shift captures him.

**The danger is sitting down.**

The chair holds one person. Korvo sits in it. But sometimes, when visitors come, he shifts slightly—just enough to make room. An invitation, or an accident, or a reflex he doesn't control anymore.

People who sit with him start watching the tides. Just for a moment, they tell themselves. Just to see what he sees. The knowledge is *there*, right there, every current in every sea—

Three visitors have sat down in recorded history. None have stood up. They're part of the Perch now, still watching, still predicting, pressed against Korvo on a chair that somehow has room for all of them.

### What He Knows

Korvo Maelish has perfect navigational knowledge of every sea in Alaria. He knows:

- Safe passages through the Abyssal currents that no living navigator has discovered
- The movement patterns of every kraken-matriarch in the southern oceans
- Where the Seafloor Giants walk and when they surface
- Exactly when and where the next major storm will strike any coastline
- The location of every ship that's sunk in Pindolin waters for the past eleven centuries

Getting this information out of him is the challenge. He can't write it down—that would require looking away. He can barely speak it—the predictions take priority. The most successful method involves asking very specific questions during the brief calm periods and transcribing his mumbled answers quickly.

Some navigators make the journey specifically to consult him. Most don't survive the Pindolins long enough to reach the Perch. The ones who do, and who resist the urge to sit, sometimes come away with knowledge worth the trip.

### The Question No One Asks

Whatever made the bet with Korvo is still out there. It got what it wanted—a perfect navigator, watching forever, bound to the tides it perhaps embodies or controls.

But the bet had terms. Korvo won. The prize was promised.

Some scholars theorize that the entity *can't* give the prize until Korvo stops watching—creating an impossible loop. Others suggest the knowledge itself was always the trap, and the entity never intended to offer anything else. A few believe Korvo could break free if he simply chose to look away, accepting the loss of knowledge he's spent eleven centuries accumulating.

Korvo has never tried. He won the bet. He's not giving up now.
