## Oboros, the Cunning

Tags: dragon, water, pindolin-islands

A Water dragon who controls the central Pindolin Islands, moving through the Water leyline like a current himself. Oboros is the oldest dragon in the archipelago, the most patient, and the most likely to talk before killing—though talking to Oboros has its own dangers.

### Appearance

Oboros is blue in the way deep water is blue—not the bright azure of tropical shallows but the dark, cold blue of oceanic depth. His scales are smooth and close-fitted, offering no purchase for barnacles despite centuries in salt water. His eyes are luminous, self-illuminating, visible from hundreds of feet away in murky water.

He's large, though smaller than he was. Water dragons don't age the way other dragons do—they don't weaken, but they condense. Oboros at five hundred years is denser than Oboros at two hundred, each scale packed with compressed vitality. He looks merely huge now. He feels like a depth charge waiting to detonate.

When he moves through water, he doesn't displace it—he becomes part of its flow, accelerating along the leyline at speeds that shouldn't be possible for something his size. On the rare occasions he surfaces, the water doesn't fall from him so much as reluctantly release him.

### The Lair

Oboros lairs in a flooded volcanic caldera in the central Pindolins—a near-perfect circle of sheer cliffs surrounding a deep, dark lake connected to the ocean through underwater tunnels. The Water leyline runs directly through the caldera's heart.

The lake looks empty from above. It isn't.

The caldera extends hundreds of feet below sea level, the volcanic crater continuing downward into a complex of flooded chambers. Oboros has expanded these over centuries, carving with water-pressure and patience, creating a palace of smooth stone and channeled currents.

**The Receiving Chamber**: A partially flooded cavern where Oboros conducts business with surface-dwellers. Air pockets along the ceiling allow breathing; ledges allow standing; the entire space is designed to make visitors feel precisely as small and vulnerable as they are.

**The Current Paths**: A network of tunnels optimized for rapid movement, connecting the caldera to dozens of locations throughout the central Pindolins. Oboros can travel miles in minutes through these channels, emerging anywhere within his territory without warning.

**The Depths**: The lowest chambers, where Oboros keeps things he values. No air-breather has seen these and reported back. Their contents are the subject of extensive speculation.

### What He Values

Oboros collects debts.

Not gold—gold doesn't interest him. Not magical artifacts—he has enough. What Oboros accumulates is *obligation*. Favors owed. Services promised. Binding agreements etched into his memory and, he claims, into the leyline itself.

Over five centuries, Oboros has bargained with sailors, merchants, pirates, mages, minor nobles, and at least three other dragons. He's traded safe passage for future considerations. He's provided information in exchange for unnamed services. He's rescued drowning crews who then owed him everything.

Most of his debtors are dead, their obligations long since discharged or simply expired. But some aren't. Oboros maintains a mental ledger of outstanding debts, and he calls them in without warning, sometimes generations after the original agreement.

The grandson of a man Oboros saved in 2847 SD might wake to find a blue-scaled head surfacing beside his ship, politely requesting the assistance that was promised.

### Bargaining With Oboros

Anyone can bargain with Oboros. He encourages it.

The problem is the terms.

Oboros is intelligent, patient, and operates on timescales humans don't naturally consider. A deal that seems favorable today may become catastrophic decades later when circumstances change. He never lies—he considers it inefficient—but he chooses his words with precision that would impress a Deoric practitioner.

**What he offers**:
- Safe passage through central Pindolin waters
- Information about the archipelago's dangers and opportunities
- Access to the Water leyline's enhancement effects for mages
- Recovery of sunken cargo, vessels, or persons
- Destruction of your enemies (if they're in his waters)

**What he wants**:
- Unspecified future services (his favorite)
- Information about mainland politics, trade, and conflicts
- Objects of curiosity from the surface world
- Occasionally, specific targets delivered to him alive

**The trap**: Oboros phrases his requests as options, his terms as suggestions. He never demands. He presents alternatives that all somehow lead to the outcome he wanted. Negotiating with him feels collaborative until you realize you've agreed to exactly what he intended from the start.

### The Cunning

Oboros earned his epithet through centuries of demonstrated intelligence:

**The Vetralian Treaty**: When triton forces from Vetral attempted to claim the central Pindolins for their oceanic expansion, Oboros negotiated instead of fighting. The resulting agreement—still technically in force—grants Vetral theoretical sovereignty over Pindolin waters in exchange for Oboros having actual control. The tritons get to claim territory on their maps. Oboros gets to do whatever he wants. Both parties consider this a victory.

**The Elebria Arrangement**: When Elebria established herself in the volcanic south, territorial conflict seemed inevitable. Oboros instead proposed a gift exchange—a complicated tradition that established non-aggression without the humiliation of formal treaty. Elebria, who doesn't think in these terms, accepted without fully understanding she'd agreed to anything. They haven't fought since.

**The Information Network**: Oboros maintains contacts among sailors, fishermen, and smugglers throughout the Dragon's Spine Coast. He trades trivial favors for news, assembling a picture of mainland affairs that most surface rulers would envy. He knows about events sometimes before they happen, extrapolating from currents of trade and tension the way he reads currents of water.

### Combat

Oboros avoids direct combat. Not because he can't win—he can, against most opponents—but because combat is wasteful, unpredictable, and rarely accomplishes goals as efficiently as other methods.

When combat becomes unavoidable:

**Control the water**: In his territory, Oboros commands the currents. He can create whirlpools, reverse tides, and generate focused pressure capable of crushing ships or shattering bone. Fighting him in water is suicide.

**Depth advantage**: He can drag opponents down. Water pressure at depth does his killing for him.

**The leyline**: Near the Water leyline's strongest points, his power amplifies dramatically. Ships have simply *vanished* when they caught him near a convergence—compressed into wreckage, their crews dissolved into the sea.

**Escape**: If somehow outmatched, Oboros can exit through his current paths faster than any pursuer could follow. He's never needed to, but the option exists.

### Relationships

**Findra**: He finds her interesting. A blind dragon who rebuilt her senses is an achievement worth respecting. They've bargained twice—once for territorial boundaries, once for information about deep-sea creatures Findra killed and Oboros wanted examined. Both exchanges were businesslike. Neither owes the other anything currently, which both find comfortable.

**Elebria**: He considers her simple, which isn't an insult—simplicity makes her predictable, which makes her manageable. She wants to be left alone in her volcanic territory. He has no interest in volcanic territory. The arrangement works.

**Kanzekill**: He knows more about her situation than she realizes. The Force leyline's shifting, Mountainveil's vulnerability, the factions within—Oboros has assembled these pieces over decades. He hasn't decided what to do with the information. Options have value.

### What He Knows

Oboros has spent five centuries in the Pindolins and centuries before that elsewhere. His knowledge is extensive:

- The complete current system of the southern ocean, including routes that don't appear on any chart
- The location and migration patterns of every kraken-matriarch within five hundred miles
- Which mainland ports are most vulnerable to naval attack (theoretical interest only, he claims)
- The history of several sunken civilizations whose ruins dot the Pindolin seabed
- Where the Water leyline's power is strongest and how it's shifted over centuries
- Korvo Maelish's exact location and the nature of his curse (they've met; Oboros found the navigator's situation fascinating)

This information is available, for a price. The price is always reasonable at first.
