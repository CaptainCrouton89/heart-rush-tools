## Sweivyon

Tags: city-state, settlement, silver-slopes

A city-state of approximately twelve thousand occupying a defensible shelf between two peaks in the Silver Slopes. The city controls the region's richest silver deposits and dominates the precious metal trade throughout the southern Dragon's Spine.

### Location

Sweivyon sits at roughly 6,500 feet elevation, accessible only through a handful of mountain passes that ice over completely during winter months. The Sunbeam River originates in glaciers above the city and flows south toward the Shrapnel Strait, carrying mineral runoff that the city captures through an elaborate catchment system.

The city's de facto port is Glintwater, a smaller settlement at the Sunbeam's mouth where the river becomes navigable. A portage road connects the two.

### Character

Sweivyon smells like money and sulfur—the refineries run constantly, and the wealth shows in silver-inlaid architecture, ostentatious markets, and the calculating demeanor of a population raised to think in terms of investments and returns.
