## Rivers of the Shrapnel Coast

Tags: rivers, geography

Three major rivers drain the central Dragon's Spine into the Shrapnel Strait, each with distinct character shaped by the terrain it traverses. The Fengruk name them collectively the "Three Veins of Vorukar," claiming they follow channels carved by the titan's blood as it poured from the Sundering wound.

### Slickrun

The westernmost river descends from the Miramar Peaks through a channel of metamorphic stone polished to an almost glassy smoothness by millennia of meltwater. The Slickrun earns its name from this stone—and from the speed of the current, which moves far faster than its placid surface suggests.

Travelers who attempt to ford the Slickrun often don't survive the experience. The smooth riverbed offers no purchase, and what looks like knee-deep water can sweep a person off their feet and carry them half a mile before depositing them against a rock or into the strait. Local guides mark safe crossing points with cairns, but the markers shift seasonally as the river's channel migrates.

The Slickrun's mouth opens into a relatively calm bay on the western edge of the strait, where the fishing village of Polished Stone has grown up around the pilot trade. The villagers have developed a unique method of "skating" the river using flat-bottomed sledges, riding the current down from the mountains in a fraction of the time it takes to climb back up.

### Sunbeam River

The central river flows down from the Silver Slopes, and its name requires no explanation to anyone who sees it at midday. The riverbed is dense with mica, pyrite, and actual silver flake—runoff from the mining operations around Sweivyon. When the sun hits the water at the right angle, the entire river blazes with reflected light, visible for miles.

Sweivyon has built its economy partly on controlling Sunbeam River access. The city-state operates a series of sluice gates and settling pools upstream, capturing the heavier metals before they wash out to sea. What escapes the sluices supports a secondary economy of "glitter-panners"—independent prospectors who work the lower river and strait-mouth, recovering what Sweivyon's filters miss.

The Sunbeam is navigable for shallow-draft vessels up to about fifteen miles inland, where rapids begin. A portage road connects the navigable lower river to Sweivyon proper, facilitating the silver trade. The river-mouth settlement of Glintwater serves as Sweivyon's de facto port.

### River of Blades

The easternmost river has earned its grim name honestly. It flows through the Glass Fields—a stretch of volcanic obsidian that the Sundering exposed and subsequent eruptions expanded. The riverbed is littered with natural glass shards ranging from pebble-sized splinters to blade-length fragments, all edges keen enough to slice leather.

No one boats the River of Blades. The glass would shred any hull within minutes. Fording is possible only at specific points where the Fengruk have laid down iron grates, and even then, a fall means cuts that take weeks to fully heal. The river runs red after storms, not from mineral content but from the blood of animals foolish enough to drink from its banks.

Despite—or because of—its dangers, the River of Blades attracts a specific clientele. Weaponsmiths prize volcanic obsidian for certain ritual blades, and the Glass Fields produce some of the finest natural specimens in Alaria. Collection expeditions from Durkarn make the journey several times a year, harvesting glass under the protection of heavily armored handlers. The obsidian trade is small but lucrative.

The river empties into the strait through a delta of black sand—pulverized glass worn down by the current. The delta settlement, if it can be called that, is a seasonal camp of obsidian traders and the few pilots willing to navigate the eastern strait channels. They call the place Blackmouth, and it has no permanent structures.

### The Confluence Myth

Local legend holds that the three rivers once met underground before emerging as a single waterway, and that the Sundering split them apart along with the mountain. Some Fengruk scholars believe the titans built something at the original confluence point—a structure now buried beneath the strait or hidden in the subterranean channels that still connect the river systems.

Expeditions to find this theoretical "Confluence Hall" have produced nothing conclusive, though cave systems beneath all three river valleys do show signs of ancient worked stone. Whether this represents titan construction or merely Fengruk ancestors remains disputed.
