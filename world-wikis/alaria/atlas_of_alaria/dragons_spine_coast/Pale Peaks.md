## Pale Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography, frontier

The southernmost mountains of the Dragon's Spine, rising beyond the Shrapnel Strait in a wall of ice-sheathed stone. The Pale Peaks mark the edge of the known world in this region—beyond them lies only the southern polar waste, a frozen expanse that no expedition has successfully crossed. The Fengruk of Azanfrain watch these mountains constantly, because what lives in them occasionally decides to come north.

### The Color of Death

The peaks earned their name from the quality of light that reflects off their ice-fields. The glaciers here are ancient, compressed over millennia into ice so dense it absorbs most color, reflecting back only a cold, gray-white pallor. Even in full sunlight, the Pale Peaks look drained, as if something has leached the warmth from the stone itself.

Fengruk geologists attribute this to the ice composition—high mineral content creates optical effects unlike normal glaciers. Local superstition offers a different explanation: the peaks are pale because they're dead. Whatever vital force animates the rest of the world doesn't reach this far south. The mountains are corpses, and corpses don't hold color.

### The Frozen Frontier

The Pale Peaks are technically traversable during summer months, when the ice retreats enough to expose passes through the range. Explorers have documented routes leading south, mapped the near glaciers, and catalogued the wildlife—mostly arctic-adapted predators and the herds of ice-dwelling ungulates they hunt.

No one has returned from attempting to cross the polar waste beyond. Expeditions that venture more than a hundred miles south of the peaks simply vanish. The Fengruk stopped sending exploratory parties three centuries ago after losing four in succession. They've concluded that whatever lies beyond the Pale Peaks doesn't want to be found.

### The Threats

Azanfrain exists because the Pale Peaks occasionally disgorge creatures that don't belong in the warmer north. The Fengruk classify these threats into two broad categories:

**Frostwalkers** are humanoid figures of animated ice and frozen flesh—not undead in the traditional sense, but not alive either. They appear during deep winter, crossing the frozen strait in groups of three to twelve, and seem drawn toward heat sources. A frostwalker that reaches a settlement will attempt to extinguish every fire, kill every warm-blooded creature, and freeze every building before moving on to the next target. They don't communicate, don't negotiate, and don't retreat.

The Fengruk believe frostwalkers are corpses animated by the polar cold itself—bodies of explorers and animals that died in the southern waste, somehow preserved and mobilized by whatever force rules there. This theory is unproven but widely accepted.

**Ice wyrms** are serpentine creatures ranging from twenty to over a hundred feet in length, capable of swimming through ice as easily as fish swim through water. They're not dragons—they have no wings, no breath weapons, no apparent intelligence—but they're large enough and dangerous enough that the distinction matters little when one surfaces beneath a village.

Ice wyrms hunt by vibration, targeting the movement of feet on frozen ground. They surface, strike, and submerge in seconds. Azanfrain's fortifications include vibration-dampening floors and specialized harpoons designed to anchor in ice-wyrm hide before the creature can retreat.

### What Killed Vorukar

Fengruk mythology holds that the titan Vorukar fell fighting something that emerged from the Pale Peaks during an ancient winter—something far larger and more terrible than the frostwalkers and ice wyrms that occasionally trouble the modern era. The stonescripts don't name this enemy; they describe it only as "the Cold That Hungers."

Whether this entity still exists, whether it's connected to the ongoing threats from the peaks, and whether the Sundering somehow wounded or contained it—these questions have occupied Fengruk scholars for millennia. The priests of Azanfrain maintain vigil partly in case the answer is yes. They watch for signs of something worse than frostwalkers. They hope they never see them.

### The Ice Bridge

During the coldest winters, the Shrapnel Strait freezes solid enough to walk on. This creates a temporary land bridge between the Pale Peaks and the rest of the Dragon's Spine—a bridge that frostwalkers and occasionally ice wyrms use to migrate north.

Azanfrain's garrison doubles during freeze periods, and the fortress maintains stocks of alchemical fire specifically for breaking ice bridges before they fully form. The goal is to maintain enough open water that creatures from the peaks can't simply walk north. This works most years. Some years, the cold comes too fast.

### The Bleached Ruins

Several structures dot the northern slopes of the Pale Peaks—walls, foundations, the remains of towers. They're clearly artificial, clearly ancient, and clearly built by something other than Fengruk. The stonework is too large, the architecture too alien. The structures are thoroughly frozen, covered in permanent ice that no summer thaw has ever removed.

The Fengruk don't know who built them or why. They don't investigate. Some doors, they say, are better left frozen shut.
