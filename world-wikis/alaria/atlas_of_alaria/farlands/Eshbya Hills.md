## Eshbya Hills

Tags: hills, geography, ruins, contaminated

A region of low hills in the southern foothills of the Kelder Mountains, within Deo Esari's claimed territory. Once home to several titan-bone harvesting villages. Abandoned 200 years ago after the contamination spread.

### Geography

The Eshbya Hills lie west of the main Kelder range, in the transitional zone between mountain and lowland. The terrain is rolling, forested in places, with numerous exposed rock formations where titan bones were once quarried.

### The Contamination

The southern harvesting disaster struck the Eshbya Hills hardest. The villages of Novranas, Salenial, and Myrth all had to be evacuated when workers began showing symptoms: wasting sickness, skin discoloration, children born wrong.

The specific cause remains sealed in priesthood archives. What's known publicly is that certain titan remains in this region were contaminated—not with anything so simple as disease, but with something that spread through contact and persisted across generations.

### Current State

The villages still stand. The priesthood maintains warning markers at every approach. The contamination may have faded after two centuries—or it may be waiting. No one has been willing to test it.

Occasionally, desperate treasure-hunters or scholars petition the priesthood for permission to explore the ruins. They are refused. The priesthood's position is that the abandoned lands remain closed until someone develops a reliable way to detect and neutralize the contamination. No such method exists.

### Ruined Settlements

- **Novranas**: Largest of the three villages. Administrative center for the southern harvesting operations.
- **Salenial**: Mining village focused on a particularly rich titan deposit.
- **Myrth**: Processing settlement where raw bone was prepared for transport.

All three are intact, frozen in time. Personal belongings remain where they were left. The evacuation was orderly but permanent.
