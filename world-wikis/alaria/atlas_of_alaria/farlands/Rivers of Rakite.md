## Rivers of Rakite

Tags: rivers, geography, rakite

Three major rivers drain the Rakiten plains, flowing generally eastward from the Vokas Enrisikna mountains to the Bejeweled Sea. In a land without permanent settlements, these waterways serve as the closest thing to roads—fixed paths through an otherwise featureless landscape.

### Ver Kanis

The northern river, originating high in Vokas Enrisikna and flowing east through Tyror Miig before turning southeast toward Kro Shiik. "Kanis" means "cold" in Rakiten; the river runs icy year-round, fed by snowmelt that never fully warms.

The Ver Kanis marks the boundary between the open plains and the Ektolmni Grif hills. Its banks are the primary summer gathering sites for the northern tribes, and the Ver Kanis Ford is the traditional meeting place for inter-tribal trade.

The Palace of Flickering Lights stands near the river's headwaters, though the Sarakiel inside don't use the water—they have their own sources, presumably, and the Rakiten don't ask.

### Ver Pes

The central river, rising in the foothills where Vokas Enrisikna meets Vokas Pendi and flowing east through the Extolmni Furis before feeding Kro Shiik. "Pes" means "brown" in Rakiten; the river carries heavy sediment from the forested hills, running murky most of the year.

The Ver Pes valley provides the only reliable route through the Extolmni Furis, and tribes migrating between summer and winter grounds follow its course. The river is wider and slower than Ver Kanis, fordable in many places during dry months but treacherous after heavy rain.

The Kro Shiik convocation grounds lie where the Ver Pes enters the central lake, and the river's condition each autumn is taken as an omen for the year ahead. High water means conflict; low water means hardship; normal water means the spirits are content.

### Ver Neles

The eastern river, draining Kro Shiik and flowing southeast to the sea. "Neles" means "lazy" in Rakiten; the river meanders across the coastal plains, its course shifting year to year as floods cut new channels.

The Ver Neles passes through the territory now occupied by Roule colonists. The halfling village of Golyayla sits on its banks, using the river for irrigation and transport. Before the colonists came, this was marginal Rakiten territory—too far from the core grasslands to matter much.

Now it matters. The Roule are damming the Ver Neles to control flooding in their fields. The Rakiten downstream haven't noticed yet—they rarely venture this far east—but when they do, the dams will become another grievance.

### River Traditions

The Rakiten don't own the rivers—land and water belong to no one—but they do observe traditions about their use.

**Drinking**: Anyone may drink from any river. Water is life; denying it is murder.

**Fishing**: The tribe currently camped closest to a stretch of river has priority for fishing. Others may fish with permission.

**Crossing**: Anyone may cross any river at any time. Blocking passage is an act of war.

**Fouling**: Deliberately fouling water—with waste, poison, or corpses—is the gravest crime a Rakiten can commit. The punishment is exile and the erasure of one's scars from tribal memory.

The Roule colonists, of course, know nothing of these traditions. Their dams block passage. Their farms foul water with runoff. Every day they break laws they've never heard of, and every day the Rakiten have to decide whether to explain or retaliate.

So far, they've done neither. That can't last.
