## Enera Savaci

Tags: poi, fae, sacred

The heart of Amholia Greras. Home to the fae court and the queen of the forest.

### Location

Enera Savaci sits at the absolute center of Amholia Greras, roughly 70 miles from the nearest elven settlement (Imyena Edhil) through trackless forest. No trails lead here. No maps mark the route. The elves do not visit uninvited, and no invitation has been extended in living memory.

### What Little Is Known

The elves know Enera Savaci exists because the fae have told them so. They know a queen rules from there because she has been referenced in the few communications the fae have deigned to share. Beyond that, details are scarce.

The fae court's relationship with the elven confederation is old—older than the Three Kingdoms Treaty, older than the individual kingdoms themselves. The fae were here when the elves arrived. They permitted settlement in certain areas. They did not explain their reasons.

### The Queen of the Forest

She has no name the elves are permitted to use. She rules the fae of both Amholia Greras and Iyaklomori Grera—possibly others beyond elven knowledge. Her authority is absolute within her domain.

The queen has never met directly with elven representatives. Communications come through intermediaries: lesser fae who speak on her behalf, messages delivered through strange means. What she wants, what her goals are, what her relationship is with the elves—these are questions the elves have learned to stop asking.

The arrangement works. The treaties hold. The elves don't pry.

### For Adventurers

Reaching Enera Savaci would be an extraordinary feat. The forest itself resists uninvited approach—trails that seem to lead toward the center curve away. Directions become unreliable. Time passes strangely.

If you somehow reached it, you would be entirely at the mercy of the fae court. The queen's hospitality is not guaranteed. Her justice follows no logic outsiders understand. You might be honored guests. You might be entertainment. You might be examples.

No one has tried in centuries. The elves consider such an attempt to be either suicidally foolish or a very slow method of suicide.

### Speculation

Some scholars theorize that the queen's domain extends beyond the physical forests—that she claims something deeper, something tied to the land itself rather than just the trees growing on it. This would explain why the fae tolerate the elves at all: they're not competing for the same resources.

Others believe the queen is waiting for something. The arrangement with the elves is temporary, on a timescale the short-lived don't perceive as temporary. Someday the patience will end.

These theories are not discussed openly. The fae may be listening.
