## Palace of Flickering Lights

Tags: poi, sarakiel, rakite

A marble fortress at the northern edge of Tyror Miig, where the plains give way to the Ves Kanis headwaters. Home to a community of fallen Sarakiel who've been here for a thousand years, slowly forgetting what they used to be.

The Palace sits at the intersection of the Light and Void leylines—where Kunus and Nilus cross. The original Sarakiel didn't choose this location by accident.

### The Structure

The Palace is unmistakably not of this world. White marble walls rise sixty feet from the grassland, polished smooth as glass and carved with geometric patterns that hurt to look at too long. The architecture makes no concessions to the local environment—no windows facing the prevailing winds, no consideration for rain or snow, no practical features at all. It was built by beings who expected to fly.

The walls glow. Faintly during the day, more noticeably at dusk and dawn, brilliantly on moonless nights. The light flickers—hence the name—in patterns that might be random or might be communication. The Rakiten don't know. They don't watch long enough to find out.

The leyline intersection produces stranger effects. Shadows inside the Palace fall in impossible directions—sometimes toward light sources, sometimes perpendicular to any visible illumination, occasionally not at all. Objects left in certain chambers lose their shadows permanently. Others acquire too many. The Sarakiel have mapped which rooms are safe and which require caution, though the geography shifts with the seasons.

Inside, the Palace is a maze of high-ceilinged chambers and narrow corridors, all marble, all glowing. There are no stairs—the original inhabitants didn't need them—but ladders and rope bridges have been added over the centuries. The current residents have adapted, but the architecture remains a reminder of what they've lost.

### The Inhabitants

Approximately two hundred Sarakiel live in the Palace, the descendants of a squadron that fell a thousand years ago. They still have wings—vestigial things now, too weak to lift them but too much a part of their identity to remove. They still have the pale skin and luminous eyes of their celestial ancestors. They still practice the rituals of purification that Sarakiel believe will one day restore them to the stars.

But they've been on the ground a long time.

The original Sarakiel chose this location because it was empty and defensible—a place to rebuild in isolation. They forbade contact with mortals, considering it contamination. Over generations, "forbidden" became "discouraged" became "pointless"—they had nothing to say to the Rakiten, and the Rakiten had nothing to say to them.

Then some of the younger angels started leaving the Palace. Curiosity, boredom, desperation—the reasons varied. Most were killed by Rakiten hunters who didn't know what they'd found. A few were captured and never seen again. One came back with information about the outside world, and the elders declared it dangerous knowledge.

The prohibition became absolute. No one leaves. No one enters. The Palace is the world.

### The Faith

The Sarakiel of the Palace practice a degraded form of celestial religion—rituals whose original meanings have been lost, purifications performed by rote, prayers to a heaven that stopped answering centuries ago.

They believe they're in exile. They believe obedience will restore them. They believe the flickering light of their walls is a sign that the stars haven't forgotten them.

They're probably wrong about all of it, but the faith holds the community together. Without it, they'd have to face what they've become: not fallen angels awaiting redemption, but mortals with useless wings living in a monument to their ancestors' hubris.

### The Change

Something has shifted recently.

The angels have been seen at the windows, watching the plains. They've never done that before—or if they did, they were never noticed. Now, Rakiten scouts report pale faces in the upper chambers, tracking the herds, observing the tribal camps, staring east toward the Roule villages.

One angel—a young female with cropped wings—broke the prohibition and walked into the grassland two months ago. She spoke to a Rakiten hunting party in passable Elvish, asked strange questions about the halflings to the east, and returned to the Palace before sunset. The hunters reported the encounter to their tribal elders. The elders didn't know what to make of it.

The Palace is waking up. The angels are thinking about the outside world for the first time in centuries. Whether this is good or catastrophic depends on what they decide to do next.

### What They Want

Unknown—even to them, probably. The younger Sarakiel want to leave, to explore, to find purpose beyond endless purification rituals. The elders want to maintain the prohibition because change is terrifying.

Some whisper about the Roule. The halflings are burning the plains, disrupting the land, drawing attention. If outsiders keep coming, the Palace's isolation ends whether they want it or not. Better to act now, while they still have choices.

Others whisper about the leylines. The intersection of Light and Void that powers their Palace—illumination and negation, presence and absence—represents something the Sarakiel once understood intuitively. They've lost that understanding, but the power remains. If they could reclaim their connection to Kunus, perhaps even harness the paradox of the intersection, they might become something more than fallen angels waiting for redemption that will never come.

And a few—the oldest, the most devout—whisper about return. Not to the stars, but to relevance. A thousand years of hiding has accomplished nothing. Maybe it's time to be angels again, even if they have to do it on foot.
