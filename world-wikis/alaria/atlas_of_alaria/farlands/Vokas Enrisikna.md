## Vokas Enrisikna

Tags: mountains, geography, rakite, farlands

The western mountain barrier of Rakite—a rugged north-south range separating the plains from the Jeh Bli wilderness beyond. The name means "grey wall" in Rakiten, and the description is apt: the mountains present a uniform face of grey stone and sparse vegetation, discouraging passage in either direction.

### Character

Vokas Enrisikna is not a dramatic range. The peaks are modest—rarely exceeding six thousand feet—and the slopes are more grinding than spectacular. But the mountains are wide, the valleys few, and the passes treacherous. There's no good route through.

The eastern slopes descend gradually into the Ektolmni Grif hills before giving way to the plains. This transition zone provides hunting grounds for Rakiten parties willing to venture into the broken terrain—deer, mountain goats, and the occasional bear.

The western slopes drop into the wilderness around Jeh Bli and the Butterfly Forest. No Rakiten goes there. The Xi'ivrach orcs occasionally appear on the mountain ridges, watching the plains, but they never descend into Rakite territory. The two peoples are aware of each other and mutually uninterested.

### The Ver Kanis Source

The Ver Kanis river begins high in Vokas Enrisikna, fed by snowmelt and mountain springs. The headwaters are inaccessible for most of the year—steep terrain, unstable rock, and winter snow make the upper valleys impassable.

In late summer, Rakiten hunting parties sometimes venture into the lower canyons where the Ver Kanis descends. The fishing is excellent, and the valleys shelter game that's migrated up from the plains. But no one stays long. The mountains feel watched in ways the open plains don't.

### What Lives There

The mountains host the usual alpine wildlife—elk, mountain goats, marmots, eagles. Nothing unusual, nothing dangerous beyond what you'd expect from wilderness terrain.

Except for the sounds.

Rakiten hunters in Vokas Enrisikna report hearing things at night. Voices echoing off canyon walls, speaking languages that don't sound like Orcish or Elvish or anything recognizable. Drumming that seems to come from inside the mountains. Occasionally, light glimpsed on distant peaks where no fire should be burning.

The orcs claim the mountains are *keth-vorai*—"stone that remembers." The Rakiten have their own word: *enris-weklis*, "grey sleep." Neither people investigates further. Some things are better left unknown.
