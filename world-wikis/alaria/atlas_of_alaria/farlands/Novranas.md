## Novranas

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

The largest of the abandoned villages in Eshbya Hills. Once the administrative center for the southern harvesting operations. Evacuated 200 years ago when the contamination spread.

### History

Novranas was the hub of southern titan-bone harvesting. While Salenial and Myrth focused on extraction and processing, Novranas handled logistics: coordinating shipments, housing visiting priests, maintaining records of what was found where.

When the contamination appeared, Novranas had the largest population of the three villages. It also had the most contact with materials from across the southern sites—workers passed through regularly, materials were stored here temporarily. If the contamination spread through contact, Novranas was perfectly positioned to receive it from everywhere.

### The Evacuation

The evacuation was orderly. The priesthood gave everyone time to pack essential belongings. They were relocated to quarantine settlements in the high mountains.

Most of the evacuees died within a generation. The contamination had already taken hold. Novranas was left behind—buildings intact, streets empty, records still filed in the administrative halls.

### Current State

Novranas stands frozen. Two centuries of weather have weathered the exteriors, but the buildings remain structurally sound. Inside, according to the few authorized observers who've looked from a distance, everything appears largely undisturbed.

The village is off-limits. Warning markers surround it. The priesthood's position is absolute: no entry, no exceptions, until the contamination can be reliably detected and neutralized.

### What Remains

Administrative records. Personal effects. Equipment. Two hundred years of accumulated dust on everything the evacuees couldn't carry.

Some scholars argue that Novranas's records could be invaluable—they might explain exactly what was found where, which deposits proved dangerous, what patterns the priests noticed before the evacuation. The priesthood refuses all requests to retrieve them. The risk isn't worth it.
