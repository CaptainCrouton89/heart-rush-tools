## Kirthdron Soytas

Tags: region, geography, ruins, contaminated

The southernmost of the abandoned harvesting regions in Deo Esari's territory. Contains the ruins of Sarki Tulo and sits at the transition between the Kelder range and the Mathavia Mountains.

### Geography

Kirthdron Soytas marks where the Kelder Mountains give way to the Mathavia range. The terrain is steep and broken—good for finding exposed titan remains, difficult for sustained habitation. This was frontier territory even before the contamination.

### The Contamination

Kirthdron Soytas was evacuated along with the other southern sites 200 years ago. The region may have been the last to show contamination symptoms, or it may simply have had a smaller population to evacuate. Either way, it's been closed ever since.

### Current State

Warning markers surround the region. The priesthood has declared it permanently off-limits. No exceptions.

### Sarki Tulo

The only significant settlement in Kirthdron Soytas. Sarki Tulo was a support village for harvesting operations in the deeper mountains. It sits abandoned now, like all the southern sites—intact, empty, waiting.

Some expedition proposals have focused on Sarki Tulo specifically, arguing that its position at the edge of the contaminated zone might make it safer to explore. The priesthood has rejected all such proposals. The contamination doesn't respect convenient boundaries.
