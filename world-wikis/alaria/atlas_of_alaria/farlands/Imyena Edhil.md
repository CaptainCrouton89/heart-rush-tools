## Imyena Edhil

Tags: city, lenora, exile, sacred

The City of the Grieving. A port in southern Lenora, accessible only by river (Kilgre Thovrys) or sea. No roads connect it to the rest of the kingdom. This isolation is deliberate—Imyena Edhil exists to contain those who have committed an unforgivable sin.

### The Grieving

In elven belief, every person's spirit persists in Celestia so long as their true name is remembered. When the last person who knows a name forgets it, that spirit is lost forever—the most permanent death possible, beyond any resurrection or communion.

If you are responsible for such a loss—through negligence, malice, or simple failure of memory—you have committed something unforgivable. You are **Grieving**. Your presence is spiritually contaminating. Prolonged contact with you might cause others to forget.

The Grieving are exiled to Imyena Edhil. They may never leave.

### The City

Imyena Edhil is walled. The walls aren't to keep enemies out—they're to keep the Grieving in. Gates open to receive new exiles and to allow limited trade at the river docks. They do not open for residents to depart.

But Imyena Edhil is a city, not a prison:
- The Grieving have children, and those children inherit the stain
- The city has existed for millennia; thousands of elves live here now
- They've built their own society: fishing, river trade within limits, crafts, art
- They have festivals, families, schools, temples—all the trappings of civilization
- Ships can dock at the river mouth, but outsiders rarely enter the walls

The city is beautiful. The Grieving have had centuries to build. Their architecture is distinctive—there's a tradition of elaborate memorial structures, honoring names that might otherwise be lost.

But there's a weight to the place. Everyone knows why they're there. Everyone knows they'll never leave. Visitors describe Imyena Edhil as melancholy but not miserable—like a funeral that has lasted for generations and become its own form of life.

### Escape and Pursuit

Anyone who flees Imyena Edhil is hunted. Not killed—returned. The other cities don't want the Grieving among them.

The pursuit is relentless. Escaped Grieving have been tracked across continents. The Lenorans view this as necessary spiritual quarantine, not cruelty. The Grieving themselves mostly accept their fate—they were raised to understand it, after all.

Occasionally someone tries anyway. They rarely get far.

### Trade and Contact

Ships can approach the river docks, but most captains avoid Imyena Edhil if they can help it. The stigma extends to those who associate too closely with the Grieving.

Those who do trade here find the Grieving are excellent craftspeople—they have time, after all, and nothing else to do. Imyena Edhil produces some of Lenora's finest textiles, jewelry, and carved work. The items are sometimes considered unlucky outside the city, but they sell regardless.

### For Adventurers

Imyena Edhil is not forbidden to visitors. You can dock, enter the walls, conduct business, and leave. The Grieving are polite hosts—they don't see many outsiders and tend to be curious about the world beyond their walls.

Just don't stay too long. Don't form attachments. And understand that if you help a Grieving escape, you'll make enemies of every elf who considers the contamination real.

Potential hooks:
- Someone important to the party is Grieving—can they be extracted?
- A Grieving elder holds information the party desperately needs
- An escaped Grieving has hired the party to protect them from pursuit
- The party is hired TO pursue an escaped Grieving—do they return them?

### Questions Without Answers

Some younger Lenorans, far from Imyena Edhil, quietly question whether the contamination is real. Whether exile is just. Whether children should pay for their ancestors' sins.

These questions are dangerous to voice. The system has worked for millennia. The Grieving accept their fate. Challenging it challenges the entire elven understanding of names, spirits, and death.

But the questions persist anyway, in whispers, in academic texts that circulate privately, in the minds of elves who've met the Grieving and found them no different from anyone else.
