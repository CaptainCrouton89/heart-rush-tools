## Sunset Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, wilderness

A coastal mountain range running the length of the western Farlands, separating the interior from the Ocean of Elorinia. The mountains catch the last light of day, burning orange and red against the darkening sky—hence the name, given by sailors who've never set foot on them.

No one lives here. No one has ever lived here.

### Character

The Sunset Mountains are young and vicious—sharp peaks, unstable slopes, narrow valleys choked with scree. The rock is a dark volcanic basite shot through with veins of copper that have never been mined. Snowmelt feeds seasonal streams that carve new channels every spring, making the terrain unpredictable even to those who've crossed it before.

The western slopes drop directly into the sea in most places, offering no harbors, no beaches, just cliffs and crashing waves. The eastern slopes are gentler but still brutal—dense scrub gives way to rockslides gives way to the Butterfly Forest at the mountain's feet.

### Why No One Settles

The mountains offer nothing worth the trouble of taking it. The copper is too diffuse to mine profitably. The soil is too thin to farm. The slopes are too steep to graze. There's no pass worth defending because there's nothing on the other side except the ocean.

The Jeh Bli orcs hunt in the foothills occasionally, but even they don't venture into the heights. Their shamans say the mountains are *keth-vorai*—"stone that remembers"—though what the stone remembers, they won't say.

### What Lives There

The mountains are not empty, just uninhabited by anything that builds.

**Stonewings** nest in the high cliffs—large predatory birds with feathers the color of granite. They hunt by dropping from tremendous heights onto prey below, striking with enough force to shatter bone. A full-grown stonewing can carry off a goat; a mated pair working together can take down an elk.

**Ridgebacks** are the apex predators: massive six-legged reptiles that blend into the volcanic rock. They're ambush hunters, lying motionless for days until something edible passes within striking distance. The Jeh Bli consider ridgeback hide extremely valuable and ridgeback hunting extremely fatal.

Something larger moves through the deeper valleys—tracks too big to be ridgebacks, claw marks on cliff faces twenty feet up. The orcs call it *Ghural-thek*, "the thing that walks standing up," and they don't go looking for it.

### Ruins

There are structures in the mountains—old ones, older than the elves claim to have been here. Square foundations of fitted stone, carved channels that might have been aqueducts, the occasional staircase leading nowhere. Whoever built them is long gone, and the mountains have been pulling them apart ever since.

The orcs say the ruins are unlucky. The stonewings nest in some of them. The ridgebacks lair in others. And *Ghural-thek* has been seen near the largest ruin, a roofless complex of interconnected chambers in the heart of the range.

No one has explored the complex and returned to describe it. This doesn't mean no one has explored it.
