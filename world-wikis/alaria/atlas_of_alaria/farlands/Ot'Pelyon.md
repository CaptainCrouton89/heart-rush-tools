## Ot'Pelyon

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined mining village in Tomgryir Eror, within Deo Esari's territory. Possibly the origin point of the southern contamination.

### History

Ot'Pelyon was a mining village in the eastern valley of Tomgryir Eror. It worked some of the oldest titan deposits in the southern region—remains that had been buried deeper and longer than most.

According to sealed priesthood records, Ot'Pelyon was the first settlement to report contamination symptoms. Workers began showing signs of wasting sickness before anyone in Eshbya Hills or Kirthdron Soytas. If the contamination had a single source, Ot'Pelyon's quarries are the most likely candidate.

### The Evacuation

Ot'Pelyon was evacuated early in the crisis—possibly before anyone fully understood what was happening. The population was relocated to quarantine settlements. Most died quickly; their exposure had been severe.

### Current State

The village stands in the Tomgryir valley, warning markers surrounding it at a considerable distance. The priesthood treats Ot'Pelyon as the most dangerous site in the contaminated zone.

No observation teams approach the village itself. Distant surveillance only. The assumption is that whatever started here might still be active.

### The Question

No one knows exactly what the miners found at Ot'Pelyon. The deposits they were working were old—titans that had been dead since the earliest phase of the God War, perhaps. Something in those ancient remains was different. Wrong.

The priesthood has theories, locked in their archives. They don't share them. The official position is that it doesn't matter what caused the contamination—what matters is that the area remains closed until the danger can be proven gone.

Some suspect the priests know exactly what happened and are keeping it secret to prevent panic, or to protect knowledge that shouldn't be spread. Others believe they're as ignorant as everyone else and simply won't admit it.
