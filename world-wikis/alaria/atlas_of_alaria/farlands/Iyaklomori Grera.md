## Iyaklomori Grera

Tags: forest, fae, sacred, illron

The great forest at the heart of Illron. Unlike Elorshianod in Lenora, which is settled and worked, Iyaklomori Grera is empty of elven habitation. It belongs to the fae under a treaty older than the elven confederation itself.

### Geography

Iyaklomori Grera fills most of Illron's nominal territory—hundreds of square miles of old-growth forest. Three rivers run through it: Kilgre Venora in the north, Ver Ta'Eres in the center, and Ver Suterela in the south. Any of these could support thriving settlements. None do.

The forest is bounded by the Ocean of Elorinia to the west, the Poscuni Gretanu grasslands to the east (transitioning to Amholia Greras), and coastal scrubland to the south near Hassera.

### The Fae Treaty

The Illronese have a treaty with the fae court. The terms are simple:

1. Elves may travel on two designated routes: the river-road along Kilgre Venora (connecting Ishla'Anore to A'valenor), and the diagonal trail from Hassera to E'lethelas
2. Elves may not settle, build, or clear any part of the forest
3. Elves may not hunt, harvest, or take anything that grows within the bounds
4. In exchange, the fae leave the coastal settlements and eastern edge alone

The treaty predates the Three Kingdoms Treaty by at least a millennium. When the confederation was formed, Illron's representatives insisted that their prior obligations be acknowledged. Lenora and Deo Esari agreed—the forest wasn't theirs anyway.

### Enforcement

Breaking the treaty's terms is not punished by elven law. The fae handle enforcement themselves.

Travelers on the legal routes report being watched constantly. Movement in peripheral vision. Laughter at night. The sensation of attention from all directions. Nothing directly hostile—but nothing welcoming either.

Those who stray from the paths, or who take something, or who linger too long, mostly are never seen again. The few who return are changed—silent, hollow, wrong in ways that are hard to articulate. They live out their remaining years but never speak of what happened.

The Illronese don't ask questions. They stay on the paths. They keep moving. They've learned.

### The Diagonal Trail

The 180-mile trail from Hassera to E'lethelas crosses the forest's heart. It exists because sometimes people need to cross—emergencies, military necessity, official business that can't wait for the longer coastal route.

The journey takes 8-10 days. Most elves who've walked it once refuse to do it again. The watching is constant. Sleep comes hard. The forest feels wrong—not aggressive, exactly, but attentive. Hungry, maybe. Patient.

There are no inns, no rest stops, no designated campsites. Travelers bring everything they need and move as quickly as they can.

### Kilren's Palace

At the forest's center, on the banks of the Ver Ta'Eres, stands the ruins of Kilren's Palace. Built 3,000 years ago by King Kilren in defiance of the treaty. Now a monument to what happens when elves forget their place.

See the Kilren's Palace entry for the full story. In brief: ten thousand soldiers vanished overnight. The king returned mute and hollow. The finest titan-bone armory ever assembled sits untouched in the fortress, and will remain so forever, because no one who enters comes back unchanged.

### Why the Elves Accept This

Outsiders sometimes ask why Illron tolerates a treaty that gives most of their territory to the fae. The answer is simple: they tried the alternative.

Before the treaty, the elves attempted to settle Iyaklomori Grera. Every attempt failed. Not through direct violence—the fae don't fight wars in the conventional sense—but through attrition, madness, disappearance, and the slow erosion of will. Settlements that should have thrived withered. Populations declined. People forgot why they'd come.

Eventually, the elves negotiated. The treaty gave them the edges—the coast, the eastern margin. It gave them safe passage on designated routes. In exchange, they accepted that the forest would never be theirs.

It's not a good deal by any measure except one: it's better than the alternative.
