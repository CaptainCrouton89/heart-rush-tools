## Mosimor

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined processing settlement in Tomgryir Eror, within Deo Esari's territory. Abandoned 200 years ago after the contamination spread from nearby Ot'Pelyon.

### History

Mosimor served a similar function to Myrth in Eshbya Hills—it processed raw titan bone extracted from the surrounding quarries. The village handled materials from Ot'Pelyon and other Tomgryir sites.

When contamination symptoms appeared in Ot'Pelyon, Mosimor was next. The processing specialists who'd been handling Ot'Pelyon's output began showing signs within weeks. The evacuation order came shortly after.

### The Evacuation

Mosimor was evacuated along with Ot'Pelyon. The processing facilities were abandoned mid-operation. Materials from Ot'Pelyon—possibly the most contaminated in the entire southern region—sat in the workshops when everyone left.

### Current State

Mosimor remains off-limits. Given its proximity to Ot'Pelyon and the likelihood that it was processing the original contaminated materials, the priesthood considers it extremely hazardous.

Observation teams don't approach. The village is surveyed from ridge lines at distance. No one has entered in two centuries.

### The Processing Facilities

Mosimor's workshops may contain materials from the original Ot'Pelyon deposits—the same remains that started the contamination crisis. If anyone wanted to study the source of the disaster, this is where they'd find samples.

The priesthood has no interest in such studies. Their position is that understanding the contamination's exact nature serves no practical purpose. The southern sites are closed. They'll stay closed. Knowing more won't change that.
