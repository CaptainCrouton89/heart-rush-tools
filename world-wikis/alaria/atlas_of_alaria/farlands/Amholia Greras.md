## Amholia Greras

Tags: forest, fae, sacred

The central forest of the Farlands, positioned between all three elven kingdoms. Amholia Greras is fae territory—has been for longer than the elves have records. Unlike Iyaklomori Grera to the south, where no settlement is permitted, Amholia Greras allows elves to pass through and even to gather at designated sites. Non-elves are another matter entirely.

### Geography

Amholia Greras occupies the lowlands between Lenora's Starluck Hills to the north, Illron's Poscuni Gretanu grasslands to the south, and the Kelder foothills to the east. The forest is dense, old-growth, and thoroughly inhabited by creatures that do not welcome uninvited guests.

Trails lead from each of the three elven capitals to Laeroth Esori, the confederation's meeting ground. These trails are maintained by the elves but exist at the fae's sufferance. Beyond the trails, the forest is trackless.

### The Fae Presence

All variety of fae creatures dwell within Amholia Greras. Some are merely mischievous; others are genuinely dangerous. The forest operates on fae logic: hospitality is sacred, rudeness is punished, and outsiders who don't understand the rules suffer for their ignorance.

Elves are considered guests of a sort—tolerated, even protected, so long as they follow the ancient protocols. They stay on the trails. They don't take what isn't offered. They don't linger longer than necessary.

Non-elves have no such protection. Travelers who enter Amholia Greras uninvited are fair game for the forest's inhabitants. Some are merely tormented—led in circles, frightened by illusions, robbed of food and gear. Others are never seen again. The fae don't explain their criteria.

### Enera Savaci

At the forest's heart, 70 miles from any settlement through trackless woods, lies Enera Savaci—seat of the fae court and home to the queen of the forest. No trails lead there. The elves do not visit.

What the fae do in their court, what the queen wants, what her relationship is with the elven confederation—these are questions the elves have learned not to ask. The arrangement works. The elves don't pry.

### Laeroth Esori

The confederation's sacred meeting ground sits within Amholia Greras, at a site geometrically centered between the three capitals. Trails from Jien Asari, Ishla'Anore, and Thillesari converge here.

Laeroth Esori is covered in detail in its own entry. In brief: it is one of the safest places in the world, enchanted over millennia, where the ancestors witness all agreements.

### For Adventurers

Amholia Greras is not a place to wander casually. Non-elven parties entering the forest should expect:
- Getting lost (the forest shifts for those without permission)
- Fae encounters (ranging from annoying to lethal)
- No help from the elves (who won't risk their relationship with the fae for outsiders)

If you must enter, bring offerings. Be unfailingly polite. Don't take anything. Don't stay past nightfall if you can help it. And understand that the fae may simply decide you don't leave.
