## Illron

Tags: state, nation, elven, confederation, fae

The southernmost and most traditional of the three elven kingdoms. Most of Illron's nominal territory is Iyaklomori Grera—a vast forest that belongs to the fae under an ancient treaty. The elves live only on the edges.

For full political and cultural details, see the [Illron state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Illron.md).

### Geography

Illron is bounded by the Ocean of Elorinia (west), Amholia Greras (north), Wycendeula (south), and the Kelder foothills (east). Most of the interior is fae territory that the elves may cross but not settle.

**Major Features:**

- **Iyaklomori Grera**: The great forest at Illron's heart. Fae territory. Three rivers run through it but no elven settlements exist within.
- **Poscuni Gretanu**: Grasslands on the northeastern edge, transitioning to Amholia Greras.
- **Kilren's Palace**: Ruined fortress in the forest's center. Contains the finest titan-bone armory ever assembled—untouched because anyone who enters doesn't return unchanged.

**Rivers:**

- **Kilgre Venora**: Northern river, one of two legal travel routes through fae territory
- **Ver Ta'Eres**: Central river, site of Kilren's Palace
- **Ver Suterela**: Southern river

### Major Settlements

Illronese settlements are arranged on the forest's edges, never within:

- **Ishla'Anore**: Capital, eastern edge
- **E'lethelas**: Secondary city, south of capital
- **A'valenor**: Northern coast, on the Air astral current
- **Olymethemar**: Central coast
- **Hassera**: Southern tip

### Character

Illron is defined by what it doesn't use. Most of the kingdom is forest the elves have agreed not to settle. They follow the old ways because they've seen what happens when they don't—Kilren's Palace stands as permanent reminder.
