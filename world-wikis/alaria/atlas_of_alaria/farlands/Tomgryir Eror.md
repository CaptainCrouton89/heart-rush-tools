## Tomgryir Eror

Tags: region, geography, ruins, contaminated

A hilly region in the southern Kelder foothills, within Deo Esari's territory. Once productive titan-bone harvesting ground. Abandoned 200 years ago after the contamination spread through the southern sites.

### Geography

Tomgryir Eror sits between the Eshbya Hills to the north and Kirthdron Soytas to the south. The terrain is rougher here—steeper slopes, deeper valleys, more exposed titan remains. This was considered prime harvesting territory before the disaster.

### The Contamination

Like the other southern sites, Tomgryir Eror was evacuated when workers began showing symptoms. The villages of Ot'Pelyon and Mosimor were both abandoned within months of each other.

The contamination in Tomgryir Eror may have been the original source—some priestly records suggest the first cases appeared here before spreading to neighboring regions. If true, this area may be more dangerous than the others.

### Current State

Warning markers surround the region. The priesthood has declared it permanently off-limits. Unlike some other abandoned sites, there's no serious debate about reclaiming Tomgryir Eror—the consensus is that whatever started here should stay buried.

### Ruined Settlements

- **Ot'Pelyon**: Mining village in the eastern valley. First to report symptoms.
- **Mosimor**: Processing center. Evacuated after Ot'Pelyon's population began dying.

Both settlements remain intact. The priesthood occasionally sends observation teams to the region's edges to confirm the ruins haven't been disturbed.
