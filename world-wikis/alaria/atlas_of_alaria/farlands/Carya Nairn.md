## Carya Nairn

Tags: region, geography, ruins, contaminated, revenant

A small region in the southern Kelder foothills, between Eshbya Hills and Tomgryir Eror. Part of the contaminated zone abandoned 200 years ago. Notable for containing Yzre's Grave.

### Geography

Carya Nairn is a single valley system with surrounding ridges. It was never heavily settled, but it contained important titan deposits that were being actively worked when the contamination spread.

### The Contamination

Carya Nairn was evacuated along with the other southern sites. The region now sits within the larger quarantine zone, accessible only to authorized priesthood observation teams—and they don't stay long.

### Yzre's Grave

The most notable location in Carya Nairn is Yzre's Grave—the burial site and eternal haunt of an ord goldminer who predates the elven harvesting operations.

Yzre arrived in these hills convinced they contained gold deposits. He spent his life's fortune searching. Found nothing. Grew bitter. Never left. When he died, the locals (then still living) buried him where he fell.

He rose as a revenant, still searching for gold that was never there. Still bitter about his failure. Still unwilling to accept that he wasted his life.

The contamination may have affected him—or revenants may be immune to whatever lingers here. Either way, Yzre still wanders Carya Nairn, and he's not friendly to visitors. He cannot be destroyed through conventional means. The priesthood's warning markers apply to him as much as to any other hazard.

### Current State

Closed, like all the southern sites. Doubly hazardous due to Yzre's presence. Anyone entering Carya Nairn risks both the contamination and an encounter with a hostile, unkillable revenant who's had two centuries to grow more bitter.

The priesthood doesn't enter this region at all anymore. Observation is conducted from the ridgelines, at distance.
