## Ves Neles

Tags: river, geography, rakite, roule

The contested river of eastern Rakite, flowing from Kro Shiik toward the sea through what is now Roule colonial territory. "Ves Neles" means "leaving water" in Rakiten—water that departs the homeland.

### Source and Course

Ves Neles drains Kro Shiik from its eastern end, carrying the gathered waters of central Rakite toward the coast. The river begins wide and slow, meandering through Tyror Weklis—the southern grasslands that serve as winter territory for the buffalo herds.

The course runs roughly east-southeast, cutting through increasingly contested ground. Twenty years ago, this was empty prairie visited only by Rakiten hunting parties following the herds. Now the river passes within sight of halfling farms, its waters diverted into irrigation channels that feed foreign crops.

### The Colonial Stretch

The lower Ves Neles flows through the heart of Roule's Rakite holdings. The three villages—Kilik, Ilyasca, and Golyayla—all draw water from the river or its tributaries.

**Kilik**, the oldest and largest settlement, sits at a natural ford where the river widens and shallows. The halflings built their first permanent structures here, and the village has grown into something approaching a proper town—wooden buildings, a central square, a small temple to Gythry. The ford is now a bridge.

**Ilyasca** lies downstream, where the river passes through low hills before reaching the coastal plain. The settlers chose this location for its defensible position; the hills provide warning of approach from any direction. Ilyasca is the most nervous of the three villages, its inhabitants convinced that something watches them from the grass.

**Golyayla**, the easternmost settlement, occupies the river's mouth where it meets the sea. A fishing village primarily, with boats that work the coastal waters and a small dock that receives supply ships from Roule proper. The colonists here spend more time looking seaward than inland.

### The Problem

The Rakiten have noticed.

For years, the tribes treated the Roule settlements as a curiosity—strange little people who burned the grass and built pointless structures on good grazing land. The traditional response to problems is withdrawal: move the herds, find new territory, let the difficulty resolve itself.

But Ves Neles is different. The river connects Kro Shiik to the sea—the sacred gathering lake to the departing water. When Roule diverts the river, they interrupt a flow that has spiritual significance beyond practical water rights.

Young hunters have begun watching the settlements. Not attacking—the Rakiten gift-giving culture makes unprovoked violence shameful—but observing. Counting. Learning the halflings' routines. When the tribes finally decide to act, they'll know exactly where every colonist sleeps.

The Roule colonists, for their part, believe the land was empty when they arrived. They don't know the Rakiten exist. They don't know they're drinking contested water. They don't know that the occasional missing goat or unexplained fire isn't bad luck.

### Significance

Ves Neles represents everything wrong with Roule's expansion: the casual assumption that unclaimed land is empty land, the failure to notice the people already using it, the incremental encroachment that feels like natural growth to the encroachers and deliberate theft to the displaced.

The river will eventually force a confrontation. Either the Rakiten will act, or the colonists will push far enough inland to discover Kro Shiik itself. Neither outcome ends well for anyone.
