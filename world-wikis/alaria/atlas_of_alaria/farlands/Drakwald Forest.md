## Drakwald Forest

Tags: forest, geography, rakite, dangerous

A dense woodland in the southwestern corner of Rakite, where the Tyror Weklis plains meet the Vokas Pendi foothills. The Rakiten don't enter it. They don't talk about why.

### Character

The Drakwald is wrong in ways that are hard to articulate. The trees are ordinary enough—oak and ash and hornbeam, the same species that grow in scattered copses across the plains. But they grow too close together, their branches interlocking overhead to block the sky. The undergrowth is too thick, too tangled, too resistant to passage.

And it's quiet. The plains are full of sound—wind in the grass, bird calls, the distant rumble of herds. The Drakwald swallows noise. Step under those trees and the world goes silent, as if someone had stuffed cotton in your ears.

The Rakiten have a word for places like this: *weklis-void*, "sleeping emptiness." Locations where something used to be and isn't anymore, leaving a hole in the world. The Drakwald feels like a hole.

### The Boundary

The forest edge is remarkably sharp. Grass grows right up to the treeline, then stops. There's no transition zone, no scattered saplings, no gradual thickening—just plains, then forest, as if someone had drawn a line.

Buffalo won't cross that line. Horses balk and refuse. Dogs whine and pull toward home. Even insects seem reluctant—the grasshoppers and beetles that fill the plains become sparse within a hundred yards of the trees.

The Rakiten respect these warnings. Their oral tradition includes half-remembered stories of hunters who followed wounded game into the Drakwald and never emerged. Not "died in the forest"—*never emerged*. Their trails simply ended at the treeline, as if they'd stepped into another world.

Some elders say the forest is a door to somewhere else. Others say it's a trap that looks like a door. No one suggests finding out which is true.

### What's Inside

Unknown. The Rakiten prohibition against entering has held for generations, and outsiders who stumble across the Drakwald rarely care enough to explore.

From the edge, the forest floor is visible for perhaps fifty feet before the undergrowth blocks the view. It looks normal—leaf litter, fallen branches, the occasional mushroom cluster. But the light is wrong. Even on bright days, the interior is dim, the shadows too deep for the canopy overhead.

Rakiten scouts have reported seeing movement in those shadows. Not animals—nothing with a recognizable shape—just motion at the edge of perception, there when you look away and gone when you look back.

One scout claimed he heard voices. Not words—just the rhythm of speech, rising and falling, too faint to understand. He refused to say more, and he died that winter in an unrelated hunting accident. The elders noted the timing but drew no conclusions.

### Theories

**The Rakiten View**: The Drakwald is *weklis-void*, a wound in the world where something was removed. What was removed, and by whom, is forbidden knowledge—or more likely, lost knowledge that the prohibition has reframed as forbidden.

**The Lenoran View**: The few elven scholars who've heard of the Drakwald dismiss it as superstition. Forests are forests. The Rakiten are primitive grassland dwellers who fear trees because they're unfamiliar. (No Lenoran has visited the Drakwald to confirm this assessment.)

**The Concerning View**: The Drakwald occupies the borderland between Rakite and Lenora, between the plains and the mountains, between the leyline of Light and the leyline of—something else. It might be a natural boundary phenomenon, a place where magical currents cancel each other out. It might be something that's supposed to stay in the forest, and the wrongness is what keeps it contained.

### Why It Matters Now

The Roule colonists have been burning grassland. So far, they've stayed on the eastern peninsula, far from the Drakwald. But if they keep expanding westward—if they decide the forest is just timber waiting to be harvested—they might cut those trees.

The Rakiten elders have considered warning them. They've decided against it. If the halflings are foolish enough to enter the Drakwald, perhaps the problem will solve itself.

This might be wisdom. It might be cowardice. It might be the Rakiten's cultural aversion to confrontation preventing them from doing the right thing.

Or it might be that the Drakwald is just a forest, and generations of Rakiten have been afraid of their own shadows.

There's one way to find out. No one's volunteering.
