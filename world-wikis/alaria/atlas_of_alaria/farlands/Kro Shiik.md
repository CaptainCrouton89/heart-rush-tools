## Kro Shiik

Tags: lake, geography, rakite

The central lake of Rakite—a long, shallow body of water fed by the Ver Pes river and drained toward the eastern coast. "Kro Shiik" means "gathering water" in Rakiten, and the name reflects its primary purpose: this is where the tribes meet.

### Character

Kro Shiik is unremarkable by the standards of lakes. It's perhaps five miles long and a mile wide, oriented roughly east-west. The water is brown with sediment most of the year, clearing briefly in late winter before spring runoff muddies it again. The shores are marshy in places, firm in others, and lined with the only significant tree growth for miles—cottonwoods and willows that draw on the shallow water table.

The lake is shallow—rarely more than fifteen feet at its deepest—and warm enough for comfortable swimming in summer. Fish are plentiful but small, mostly carp and perch. Waterfowl nest in the marsh sections, providing eggs and meat for tribes camped nearby.

It's a practical place, not a sacred one. The Rakiten value Kro Shiik for what it provides: water, food, and a fixed point in a landscape that otherwise has none.

### The Convocation

Once a year, at the autumn equinox, tribal leaders gather at Kro Shiik for the annual convocation—the only time all Rakiten tribes come together in one place. Camps ring the lake, arranged by tradition: each tribe has its customary location, and disputes over placement have been known to derail entire gatherings.

The convocation lasts five days. The first is for arriving and establishing camps. The second through fourth are for discussion, negotiation, and the resolution of inter-tribal disputes. The fifth is for leave-taking and the ceremonies that mark the end of gathering season.

Decisions at the convocation are made by consensus. In practice, this means most decisions aren't made—the tribes are too independent, too suspicious of each other, too committed to their own ways. But the gathering serves other purposes: marriages are arranged, trading conducted, news exchanged, and alliances quietly formed.

### The Bone Shore

The southeastern shore of Kro Shiik is called the Bone Shore—a stretch of marshy ground where buffalo occasionally die during winter crossings. The carcasses accumulate over years, their bones eventually washing into shallow water or sinking into the mud.

The Rakiten consider the Bone Shore sacred. The spirits of the dead buffalo are believed to linger here, and their blessing is sought before major hunts. Offerings are left at the water's edge: tobacco, carved bone, occasionally drops of blood.

Some tribes believe that a white buffalo died here in the mythic past, and its spirit guards the lake. Others say the Bone Shore is simply where death gathers, and the spirits are hungry rather than benevolent. The practical result is the same: no one fishes or hunts near the southeastern shore, and camps avoid the area.

### The Current Problem

The Roule colonial villages are visible from Kro Shiik on clear days—thin columns of smoke on the eastern horizon, marking where the halflings have burned the grass.

At last year's convocation, the smoke was a constant presence. The tribes debated what to do about it for three days and reached no conclusion. The isolationist faction argued for continued withdrawal. The militant faction argued for war. The largest faction—the one that couldn't agree on anything—argued for more discussion.

This year's convocation is approaching. The smoke will be closer. The debate will be louder. And eventually, someone will have to decide.
