## Ves Pes

Tags: river, geography, rakite

The principal river of central Rakite, flowing from Vokas Pendl through the forested hills of Extolmni Furis to feed Kro Shiik, the sacred gathering lake. "Ves Pes" means "brown water" in Rakiten—an accurate description for most of the year.

### Source

Ves Pes begins as snowmelt and spring seepage in the gentler slopes of Vokas Pendl. Unlike the dramatic mountain springs of Ves Kanis to the north, these headwaters emerge gradually—dozens of small streams collecting in high meadows before joining into a recognizable river.

The source region is prime summer hunting ground. Elk and deer congregate in the alpine meadows, and the clear upper streams hold trout worth catching. Tribes rotate through traditional camping sites, each family knowing which pools their grandparents fished.

### The Forest Passage

The middle course of Ves Pes cuts through Extolmni Furis, the forested hills that give central Rakite its unsettled character. Here the river runs between dense oak and beech, its banks tangled with brush and deadfall. The water darkens as it picks up sediment and tannins from the forest floor.

Rakiten hunters follow the river through Extolmni Furis but don't linger. The *furis-keth*—those moss-covered stones in forest clearings where animals refuse to go—cluster near the riverbanks. Some say the stones drink from Ves Pes. Others say the river learned its brown color from them. Either way, the forest passage is for travel, not camping.

The Void leyline crosses Ves Pes somewhere in these hills. The exact location shifts, or the Rakiten who know won't say. Hunters report stretches where the water runs colder than it should, where fish float belly-up for no visible reason, where the reflection in the water shows a different sky than the one overhead.

### Kro Shiik

The river empties into Kro Shiik from the southwest, spreading into a marshy delta before joining the lake proper. This junction is considered the boundary between wild country and civilized space—or as civilized as Rakite gets.

During the annual convocation, tribes camped near the river mouth have traditional rights to the freshest water. Disputes over these positions have shaped Rakiten politics for generations. Control of the Ves Pes delta doesn't confer military advantage—the Rakiten don't think that way—but it demonstrates that your ancestors earned something worth keeping.

### Character

Ves Pes runs brown with sediment from spring through autumn, clearing only in winter when flow drops and the source pools freeze over. The water is drinkable but tastes of earth and leaf rot. Fish are plentiful in the lake-adjacent stretches—carp and perch that tolerate the murky conditions—but sparse in the forest passage.

The river floods unpredictably. Snowmelt years bring high water that reshapes the delta and drowns established camps. Dry years reduce Ves Pes to a series of connected pools. The Rakiten treat this variability as natural and plan accordingly; outsiders expecting reliable water levels are consistently disappointed.
