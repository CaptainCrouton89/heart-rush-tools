## Kilren's Palace

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi, fae, treasure

A ruined fortress in the heart of Iyaklomori Grera, standing on the banks of the Ver Ta'Eres river. Built 3,000 years ago by King Kilren of Illron in defiance of the fae treaty. Now empty, preserved, and extremely dangerous to enter.

### History

King Kilren was young, ambitious, and frustrated. His ancestors had accepted a treaty that gave most of Illron's territory to the fae. Kilren believed the stories were exaggerated, the fae overrated, the restrictions unnecessary. He decided to prove it.

He marched 10,000 soldiers into Iyaklomori Grera. He brought the royal armory—the finest weapons the elves had ever forged, many worked from titan bone and blood. He intended to establish a permanent military presence and demonstrate that elves could reclaim their own land.

The forest let them enter. Let them clear a site on the Ver Ta'Eres. Let them quarry stone from the riverbed. Let them build. Kilren's Palace rose over the course of a year: proper fortress walls, garrison quarters, armories, storage. Ten thousand elves settled in.

For one full year, nothing happened. Kilren began to believe he had won.

Then, one night, everyone inside vanished.

Not killed—gone. The fortress stood empty the next morning. Food sat uneaten on tables. Weapons hung in racks. Personal effects lay where they'd been left. Ten thousand elves had simply ceased to be present.

King Kilren was found a week later, walking out of the forest toward Ishla'Anore. He couldn't speak. He never spoke again—never wrote, never gestured meaningfully, never communicated in any way for the remaining forty years of his life. When he died, he was buried without ceremony. His name is not among those the Illronese remember.

### The Armory

Kilren brought the finest weapons the elves possessed:

- **Titan-bone blades**: Swords, spears, axes forged from processed titan bone. Lighter than steel, harder than anything, and effectively eternal. Dozens of them.
- **Titan-blood armor**: Worked with blood from the titan remains, giving the metal a dark red sheen. Highly resistant to both physical and magical damage.
- **Siege equipment**: Ballistae with titan-sinew cables, rams with titan-bone heads.
- **The King's Own**: Kilren's matched set—a blade and bow of legendary craftsmanship, said to be the finest weapons ever produced by elven hands.

All of it is still there. Untouched. Undisturbed. Worth more than most kingdoms' treasuries.

The elves won't touch it. Taking anything from the palace would violate the treaty with the fae, and the lesson of what happens when you violate that treaty is standing right there.

### What Happens to Those Who Enter

The few outsiders who learn about the treasure and attempt to claim it almost never return.

Those who do return are:
- **Like Kilren**: Mute, hollow, unable or unwilling to communicate. They live out their remaining years in silence.
- **Worse**: Changed in ways that are difficult to describe. Wrong. Something behind their eyes that wasn't there before.
- **Missing time**: They went in yesterday and emerged a decade later. Or the reverse—spent what felt like years inside and emerged the same day.

The fae don't seem to kill intruders. They do something else. No one's entirely sure what. The result is that the armory remains fully stocked despite being common knowledge among treasure-hunters and adventurers.

### The Palace Today

Kilren's Palace still stands, preserved as if the centuries haven't passed. Vines don't grow on the walls. Animals don't nest in the rafters. The clearing around it never closes in.

The fortress sits in silent waiting. For what, the Illronese don't know. They don't want to know. They're content to let the palace remain exactly as it is, forever, as monument and warning.

### For Adventurers

If you're determined to try:
- The palace is roughly 90 miles from the nearest settlement through fae-controlled forest
- The legal trails don't go anywhere near it
- The fae know when someone enters with intent to take
- No amount of magical protection has ever been sufficient
- Even if you retrieve something, where do you sell titan-bone weapons when the only people who can identify them are the elves who want you dead?

The smart play is to admire the legend from a distance and seek treasure elsewhere.
