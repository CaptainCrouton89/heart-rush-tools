## Salenial

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined mining village in Eshbya Hills, within Deo Esari's territory. Abandoned 200 years ago during the southern contamination crisis.

### History

Salenial was a mining village—focused on extraction rather than processing. It sat near a particularly rich titan deposit, one of the most productive in the southern region. Workers here handled raw bone daily, moving it from quarry sites to the processing facilities at Myrth.

The village prospered for generations. Then the contamination appeared.

### The Evacuation

Salenial was evacuated along with Novranas and Myrth. The miners and their families were relocated to quarantine settlements. Most didn't survive long—their daily contact with the contaminated materials had exposed them heavily.

The village was left behind. The quarries were abandoned mid-operation. Equipment sits where it was dropped.

### Current State

Salenial remains off-limits under the priesthood's quarantine orders. The rich titan deposits that made it valuable are still there, untouched for two centuries.

Occasionally, someone proposes that the Salenial deposits might be safe now—that the contamination was specific to certain remains, or that it's faded over time. The priesthood points out that no one has developed a way to test this theory safely. The deposits can wait. They're not going anywhere.

### The Quarries

The actual extraction sites near Salenial are exposed pits and tunnels where titan bone was removed from the earth. Some of these may have been the source of the contamination. Others may be perfectly safe. Without a way to tell the difference, the priesthood treats all of them as equally hazardous.
