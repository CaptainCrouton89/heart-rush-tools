## Myrth

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined processing settlement in Eshbya Hills, within Deo Esari's territory. Abandoned 200 years ago during the southern contamination crisis.

### History

Myrth was where raw titan bone became usable material. The village housed workshops, kilns, and storage facilities where bone was cleaned, treated, and prepared for transport to the main Kelder settlements.

Processing was delicate work. The priests who specialized in it spent their lives learning the proper techniques. When the contamination appeared, these specialists were among the first to show symptoms—they'd been handling concentrated materials from across the southern sites.

### The Evacuation

Myrth was evacuated along with Novranas and Salenial. The processing equipment was left behind. Partially processed materials sat in the workshops, never completed.

The priests and workers were relocated to quarantine settlements. Their specialized knowledge died with them over the following decades.

### Current State

Myrth remains off-limits. The processing equipment is still there—valuable in itself, representing techniques that took generations to develop. But it's all potentially contaminated, and the priesthood won't risk recovering it.

Some of the partially processed materials in the workshops may still be dangerous. Some may be perfectly safe. The priesthood's approach is to assume everything in Myrth is hazardous until proven otherwise.

### Lost Knowledge

The contamination didn't just kill people. It killed expertise. The priests who knew how to process southern deposits, who understood the subtle differences between sites, who could identify dangerous material by sight—they're gone. Two centuries of accumulated knowledge, lost.

Modern Deo Esari works the northern Kelder sites using techniques that may be less refined than what the southern specialists developed. The priesthood acknowledges this. They consider it an acceptable cost.
