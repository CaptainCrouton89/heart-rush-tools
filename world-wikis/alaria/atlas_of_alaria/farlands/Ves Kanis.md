## Ves Kanis

Tags: river, geography, rakite

The clearest water in Rakite flows from the Vokas Enrisikna mountains through the northern plains. "Ves Kanis" means "speaking water" in Rakiten—named for the sounds it makes tumbling over stones in its upper reaches, which the tribes say carries messages from the mountain spirits.

### Source

The river originates in a cluster of spring-fed pools high in the Vokas Enrisikna. The Rakiten call these the Listening Pools—cold, clear water emerging from rock that supposedly "remembers" everything said near it. Hunters visiting the headwaters speak softly or not at all. Some claim the water repeats words spoken centuries ago, though no one admits to hearing anything specific.

The Light leyline passes directly through the source pools. On clear nights, the water takes on a faint luminescence—barely visible, but unmistakable to anyone who knows to look. The Rakiten avoid the headwaters after dark.

### Course

Ves Kanis flows northeast from its mountain source, cutting through the edge of Vokas Enrisikna before emerging onto Tyror Miig. The river is narrow and fast in the mountains—dangerous to cross except at established fords—then widens and slows as it reaches the grassland.

The middle course provides the only reliable year-round water source in northern Rakite. Summer camps cluster along its banks at Ver Kanis Ford, where the river spreads shallow enough for horses to cross safely. The surrounding meadows are prime grazing, and hunting parties use the river as a landmark in the featureless grass.

### The Palace

The Ves Kanis passes directly beneath the Palace of Flickering Lights, where the Light and Void leylines intersect. Here the river behaves strangely. Water flows slower near the Palace walls, as if reluctant to pass. Shadows fall in wrong directions—sometimes upstream, sometimes perpendicular to the sun. Fish avoid this stretch entirely.

The fallen Sarakiel who inhabit the Palace draw their water from the river but never bathe in it. They say the water near the intersection carries both illumination and erasure—that drinking too much shows truths better left hidden, while immersion risks losing memories entirely. Whether this is superstition or observed fact, the angels aren't saying.

### Terminus

The river disperses into marshy ground north of Tyror Miig, eventually draining into the coastal waters. No settlements exist at its mouth—the land is too wet, the grass too thick, and the Rakiten have no use for permanent structures anyway.

### Significance

Ves Kanis defines the northern limit of practical Rakiten territory. Beyond it lies the Palace (avoided), the coast (useless to horse nomads), and eventually the sea. The river itself is considered neutral ground—no tribe claims the water, and conflicts are suspended while drinking from its banks.

The Light leyline's presence makes the entire river corridor subtly wrong. Colors seem sharper near the water. Sounds carry further than they should. Dreams come more vividly to those who sleep on its banks. Most Rakiten treat this as unremarkable—just how the river is—but outsiders find it unsettling.
