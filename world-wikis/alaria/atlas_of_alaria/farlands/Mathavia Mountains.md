## Mathavia Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A north-south mountain range forming the boundary between the elven territories of the Farlands and the Giant Lands to the east. The Mathavia Mountains are old and weathered, their peaks lower than the Drystone range but still formidable barriers to travel. Dense forests cover the western slopes (within elven territory), while the eastern slopes descend into the scrublands bordering the Xeltri Plateau and Malo Kon Greikh.

### Strategic Position

The Mathavia Mountains serve as a natural defensive barrier for the elven kingdoms. Few passes exist, and those that do are closely watched. The giants of Malo Kon Greikh have learned to avoid the mountain approaches—elven archers in forested mountain terrain are a nightmare even for creatures of giant size.

### Choking Mines

Located at the southwest point of the Marthavia Mountains, at the precise intersection of void and air leylines, the Choking Mines are among the most dangerous mining operations in Shyona. The intersection of these leylines causes air to spontaneously appear and cease to exist—miners can be breathing normally one moment and instantly choking the next as the air vanishes from their lungs.

The unpredictable nature of the void-air interaction makes the mines extremely sketchy. Many elves have died here, their bodies found frozen in poses of sudden suffocation. Despite the extreme danger, the mines contain valuable magical minerals and crystals formed by the leyline convergence, drawing prospectors willing to risk their lives for wealth.
