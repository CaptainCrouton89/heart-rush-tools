Tags: state, nation, elven, confederation, titans

The mountain kingdom, occupying the Kelder Mountains along the eastern edge of the Farlands. Governed by the Titanic Priesthood, keepers of the titan bones. Source of approximately 95% of the world's titan-bone supply.

### Geography

Deo Esari occupies the bracket-shaped Kelder Mountain range and its southern extension, the Mathavia Mountains. The terrain is alpine—high peaks, narrow valleys, scattered settlements built near harvesting sites.

**Major Features:**

- **Kelder Mountains**: The entire range along the Farlands' eastern edge. Titan bones throughout.
- **Mathavia Mountains**: Southern extension, including contaminated zones.
- **The Abandoned Lands**: Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—southern foothills closed 200 years ago after the contamination disaster.

**Rivers:**

- **Ver Pyur**: Flows from Isyherius southward
- Various mountain streams feeding lowland rivers

### Major Settlements

Deo Esari has cities and towns but relatively few villages—mountain living concentrates population:

- **Thillesari**: Capital, central Kelder range
- **Isyherius**: Northernmost city, source of Ver Pyur
- **Mysaneas**: Secondary administrative center
- **Leleth Serine**: Major harvesting hub
- **Ryhaneas, Eyslon, Iyathelneor**: Range settlements
- **Ulfe Alari**: Southernmost active settlement (above contaminated zone)

### The Southern Disaster

Two centuries ago, contamination spread through the southern harvesting villages. The cause is sealed in priesthood archives; the effects were wasting sickness, children born wrong, death across generations. The southern sites—Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—were evacuated and remain closed.

This disaster cut harvesting capacity by ~40%, driving worldwide titan-bone prices to unprecedented heights.

### Character

Deo Esari is the most insular and tradition-bound of the three kingdoms. They guard the titan bones as sacred trust, forbid outsiders entirely, and hunt defectors relentlessly. The southern disaster only reinforced their conservatism.
