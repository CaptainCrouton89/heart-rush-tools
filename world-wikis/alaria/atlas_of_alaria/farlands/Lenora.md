## Lenora

Tags: state, nation, elven, confederation

The agricultural heartland of the elven confederation, occupying the fertile lowlands and coastal forests of the western Farlands. Largest of the three kingdoms by population (~400,000), governed by the Landsmeet—a council of landholders.

### Geography

Lenora occupies the territory between the Ocean of Elorinia (west), the Kelder Mountains (east), and the Amholia Greras forest (south). The terrain is primarily forested lowland and fertile plains.

**Major Features:**

- **Elorshianod**: Coastal forest running north-south along the western shore. Unlike Illron's Iyaklomori Grera, Elorshianod is settled and worked—river towns dot the banks of the Kilgre Kevi and Kilgre Apnuk.
- **Starluck Hills**: Southern hill country separating Lenora from Amholia Greras. Named for phosphorescent fungi that bloom on autumn nights.
- **Vokas Pendl**: Northern mountain spur where the Kilgre Kevi originates.
- **Drakwald Forest**: Northern forest bordering the empty wilderness.

**Rivers:**

- **Kilgre Kevi**: Northern river, from Vokas Pendl through Elorshianod to coast
- **Kilgre Apnuk**: Central river with many tributaries, feeds the capital at Jien Asari
- **Kilgre Thovrys**: Southern river, feeding the isolated port of Imyena Edhil

### Major Settlements

- **Jien Asari**: Capital, inland on the Kilgre Apnuk
- **Eilren Thalas**: Primary port, southwestern coast
- **Imyena Edhil**: The City of the Grieving, isolated port accessible only by river or sea
- **Galaena Ancalen, Imsegroth, Ufa Caelora**: Coastal settlements along Kilgre Kevi

### Character

Lenora is the productive, populated heartland—dense settlement, cleared farmland, road networks. The kingdom feeds the entire confederation and resents not having proportional influence in its governance.
