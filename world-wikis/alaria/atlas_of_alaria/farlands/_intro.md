# Farlands

## Geography

The Farlands occupy the entire western coastal region of Upoceax—a land of ancient forests dominated by the three Elven Kingdoms. This is one of the oldest civilized regions of the continent, where elven cultures have flourished for millennia.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Transitions into the Seacleft Coast
- **East**: The Kelder Mountains and Sand Reach Mountains
- **South**: Wycendeula forests
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

### The Three Elven Kingdoms

The Farlands are politically defined by three major elven states, arranged roughly from south to north:

- **Illron**: The southernmost elven kingdom
- **Lenora**: The middle kingdom, north of Illron
- **Deo Esari**: The northernmost kingdom, centered in the Kelder Mountains—the north-south range that runs along the eastern edge of the Farlands and is bisected by the Sand Reach Range

### The Kelder Mountains

A major north-south mountain range along the eastern boundary of the Farlands. This range is bisected by the Sand Reach Mountains where they meet. The Deo Esari elves have made these mountains their home, establishing one of the most ancient elven kingdoms in the known world.

- Extensive coastal forests
