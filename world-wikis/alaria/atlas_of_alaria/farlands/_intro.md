### Geography

The Farlands is a vast eastern region dominated by the Elven States and the human realm of Rakite. Mountain ranges including the Sunset Mountains, Vokas Enrisikna, and Vokas Pendl frame expansive plains like Tyror Miig and Tyror Weklis. The region contains numerous elven territories—Deo Esari, Lenora, and Illron—each with their own forests, hills, and ancient ruins. The Butterfly Forest and Amholia Greras are among the notable woodlands, while the Painted Hills and Peleletra Hills mark the region's borders.
