# Farlands

The Farlands occupy the western coastal region of Upoceax—a vast stretch of land running nearly 600 miles from north to south. Despite its size, civilization clings only to the southern reaches. The northern two-thirds of the region is empty wilderness: uninhabited mountains, trackless forests, and lonely coastline.

## Geography

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Troikan Strait separates the Farlands from the Seacliff Coast islands
- **East**: The Kelder Mountains, continuing south into the Mathavia range
- **South**: Transitions into Wycendeula
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

### The Empty North

The northern Farlands are wilderness. The Sunset Mountains run along the western coast—a jagged, uninhabited range with no passes worth using and no settlements worth supplying. East of the mountains, the Butterfly Forest covers the lowlands, equally empty of permanent habitation.

The only exception is **Jeh Bli**, a Xi'ivrach orc city-state built on the shores of Lake Kro Nymos. It sits in complete isolation, hundreds of miles from the nearest civilization. Why the orcs settled here, and how they sustain themselves so far from anyone else, are questions the elves to the south have never bothered to answer.

The Troikan Strait to the north is unremarkable—just water separating the Farlands from Ios and the other Seacliff states. There's no meaningful trade through the strait; it's simply not on the way to anywhere.

### The Three Elven Kingdoms

Civilization begins south of the Vokas Pendl mountains. Here, three elven polities share the more hospitable terrain, bound together by the Three Kingdoms Treaty signed at Laeroth Esori approximately 4,000 years ago:

**Lenora**: The agricultural heartland, occupying the fertile lowlands and coastal forests. A Landsmeet council of landholders governs; the kingdom serves as breadbasket for the confederation. Three great rivers—Kilgre Kevi, Kilgre Apnuk, and Kilgre Thovrys—water the territory. Largest population of the three kingdoms (~400,000).

**Illron**: The southernmost kingdom, following the old ways. Most of Illron's territory is Iyaklomori Grera—a vast forest that belongs to the fae under an ancient treaty. The elves live only on the edges: coastal settlements (A'valenor, Olymethemar, Hassera) connected by road, and eastern settlements (capital Ishla'Anore, E'lethelas) on the forest's margin. Smallest active territory despite considerable nominal borders.

**Deo Esari**: The mountain kingdom, occupying the Kelder range. Governed by the Titanic Priesthood, keepers of the titan bones buried throughout the peaks. Source of ~95% of the world's titan bone—material so sacred it never leaves the confederation except through defectors. The southern harvesting grounds were abandoned 200 years ago after a contamination disaster.

A fourth elven group, **Rakite**, occupies the plains east of the Kelder Mountains. They follow the buffalo herds, practice a gift-economy distinct from the settled kingdoms, and do not participate in the confederation. Trade with Rakite is formal but friendly.

### Key Geographic Features

**Forests**:
- **Elorshianod**: Coastal forest of Lenora, settled and worked for timber and river-town life
- **Iyaklomori Grera**: Sacred forest of Illron, fae territory, no elven settlement permitted
- **Amholia Greras**: Central forest between all three kingdoms, home to the fae court at Enera Savaci
- **Drakwald Forest**: Northern forest of Lenora, bordering the wilderness

**Mountains**:
- **Vokas Pendl**: Northern spur, source of the Kilgre Kevi
- **Kelder Mountains**: Bracket-shaped range along the eastern edge, titan bone territory
- **Mathavia Mountains**: Southern extension of the Kelder, including contaminated zones

**Rivers** (Lenora):
- **Kilgre Kevi**: Northern river, from Vokas Pendl through Elorshianod to coast
- **Kilgre Apnuk**: Central river with many tributaries, feeds capital Jien Asari
- **Kilgre Thovrys**: Southern river, feeds isolated port of Imyena Edhil

**Rivers** (Illron):
- **Kilgre Venora**: Northern river, one of two legal travel routes through fae territory
- **Ver Ta'Eres**: Central river, site of Kilren's Palace
- **Ver Suterela**: Southern river

### The Confederation

The three kingdoms maintain a loose confederation, meeting at Laeroth Esori to coordinate on matters affecting all. The site is neutral ground—geometrically centered between the kingdoms—and has been enchanted over millennia to serve as one of the safest places in the world for diplomatic negotiation.

The confederation operates on a one-kingdom-one-voice principle: each polity sends four representatives (two men, two women) to deliberations. This arrangement favors Illron, which has the smallest population, and frustrates Lenora, which has the largest. Deo Esari typically sides with Illron on matters of tradition.

Rakite exists outside this system entirely. Jeh Bli, to the north, is simply too far away to matter.

## Notable Locations

### Sacred and Dangerous Sites

**Laeroth Esori**: The confederation meeting ground in Amholia Greras. Enchanted over 4,000 years—truth-binding, memory preservation, violence dampening, weather control. Treaties made here are witnessed by the ancestors. One of the safest places in the world.

**Enera Savaci**: Heart of Amholia Greras. Home to the fae court and queen of the forest. No trails lead here—70 miles through trackless woods from the nearest settlement. Elves do not visit uninvited.

**Kilren's Palace**: Ruined fortress in Iyaklomori Grera. Built 3,000 years ago by King Kilren in defiance of the fae treaty. Ten thousand soldiers vanished overnight; the king returned mute and hollow. Contains the finest titan-bone armory ever assembled—untouched, because anyone who enters suffers Kilren's fate or worse.

**Imyena Edhil**: The City of the Grieving. Southern Lenora, accessible only by river or sea—no roads. Home to elves exiled for forgetting true names. Walled to keep inhabitants in, not enemies out.

### The Abandoned Lands

The southern foothills of the Kelder Mountains—Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—were abandoned 200 years ago after titan-bone contamination spread through the harvesting villages. The settlements still stand, empty and intact. The priesthood maintains warning markers. No one knows if the contamination has faded.

## What Makes It Interesting

The Farlands are a study in restraint and consequence. Three ancient kingdoms bound by older oaths. A forest no one will settle because of what happened when they tried. Mountains full of treasure that kills those who handle it carelessly. A city of exiles no one can leave.

For players, the region offers:
- **Political intrigue** within the confederation's archaic voting disputes
- **Dungeon delving** into Kilren's Palace (if they're brave or foolish)
- **Mystery** in the abandoned southern villages and what contaminated them
- **Moral complexity** around the Grieving of Imyena Edhil
- **Faction play** between tradition-bound kingdoms with genuine disagreements

## What Will Go Wrong

- The succession question in Lenora is reaching a breaking point; some families are considering drastic action
- Defectors from Deo Esari are increasing as titan-bone prices rise worldwide
- Someone always eventually decides Kilren's treasure is worth the risk
- The contaminated lands may hold answers—or may hold something worse
- The fae queen at Enera Savaci has her own agenda, and the elves are not privy to it
