# Crimson Coast

## Geography

The Crimson Coast is the southernmost coastal region of Aboyinzu, positioned south of the Dragon's Spine mountains. This is a haunted land—marked by cursed waterways, mystical forests, and a dark history that permeates the very landscape.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dragon's Spine mountains form an imposing barrier
- **East**: Eastern coastline
- **South**: Southern ocean
- **West**: Western coastline, wrapping around the southwestern tip of Aboyinzu

### Character

The Crimson Coast takes its name from the dark history that stains the region. The River of Wights and the Pools of Tragedy speak to ancient tragedies and ongoing supernatural threats. Hilda's Forest contains the mysterious Hildaneir, and the entire region carries an atmosphere of foreboding.

### Terrain

The coast features:
- Haunted waterways and cursed rivers
- Mystical forests with dangerous inhabitants
- Rolling hills
- Coastal territories divided among competing states

### States

Several states control portions of the Crimson Coast:
- **Tangiern**
- **Klevnaf**
- **Istora**

These states maintain an uneasy existence in the shadow of Dragon's Spine, navigating both the supernatural threats of their homeland and the political pressures from the larger powers to the north.
