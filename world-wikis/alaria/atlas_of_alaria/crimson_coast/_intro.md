# Crimson Coast

The Crimson Coast earns its name honestly. This is a land stained by centuries of bloodshed—ancient regicides, fractured kingdoms, and the slow grinding violence of elven civil war. South of the Dragon's Spine mountains, three states cling to existence in a region where the very rivers remember old murders and the forests harbor things that predate the elves themselves.

## Geography

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dragon's Spine mountains form an impassable barrier, their southern faces dropping into the Hag Hills and the headwaters of the region's rivers
- **East**: The Dragon's Spine Coast, where Thraken Lake marks the transition to different political realities
- **South**: The Void—the great purple-dark ocean that bounds all of southern Aboyinzu
- **West**: The coastline curves around Tangiern's western reaches, past the Pools of Tragedy

The region occupies the southwestern tip of Aboyinzu, isolated from the continent's larger powers by the Dragon's Spine. This geographic isolation has allowed the Crimson Coast's internal conflicts to fester without outside intervention—or resolution.

### Terrain

The Crimson Coast is dominated by vast conifer forests broken by river valleys and coastal hills. Moving west to east:

**Western Forests**: The enormous Fragenstor Mielthøn covers most of Tangiern, a seemingly endless expanse of dark pine and spruce. Hilda's Forest occupies the northwestern corner, older and stranger than its neighbor.

**Central Hills**: The Suftos Hills run north-south through the region's heart, forming the contested border between Klevnaf and Istora. The Hulry Hills anchor the northwest.

**Eastern Woodlands**: Whitewood (in Klevnaf) and Winterwood (in Istora) are smaller but no less significant—sacred groves to the Winter Elves who once ruled the entire region.

**Waterways**: Rivers carve through the landscape in patterns that mirror political divisions. The River of Wights flows from haunted sources in the northwest. Murder Creek divides what remains of the old elven kingdom. The Sova Chyda sustains Istora's settlements. The Rabbit River provides Tangiern's primary trade route to the sea.

### Climate

Cold maritime conditions prevail. Winters are long and bitter, with snow lingering in the forests from late autumn through early spring. Summers are brief and cool, with frequent fog rolling in from the Void. The Dragon's Spine creates a rain shadow that makes the eastern reaches slightly drier than the perpetually damp western forests.

## States

Three nations control the Crimson Coast, each shaped by the region's bloody history:

### Tangiern

The largest state by territory, Tangiern is a human kingdom occupying the western two-thirds of the region. Its people—hardy foresters and hunters—have carved settlements from the vast Fragenstor Mielthøn over generations. Capital: **Nøsen**.

*See: [Tangiern](./Tangiern.md)*

### Klevnaf

A Winter Elf kingdom controlling the central coastal strip. Klevnaf claims legitimacy through Prince Taoinor, uncle to the murdered King Istor XXVI. They hold Murder Creek and the cursed ground where ancient King Ghy fell. Capital: **Svedlind**.

*See: [Klevnaf](./Klevnaf.md)*

### Istora

The eastern Winter Elf kingdom, ruled by Queen Lamenrae—daughter of the murdered Istor XXVI. The Istori consider Klevnaf traitors and usurpers. Their realm follows the Sova Chyda river from the Suftos Hills to the sea. Capital: **Tuur**.

*See: [Istora](./Istora.md)*

## Political Climate

The Crimson Coast exists in a state of cold war that periodically turns hot.

**The Succession Crisis**: When Istor XXVI was murdered, his daughter Lamenrae accused her uncle Taoinor of the crime and refused him the throne. Taoinor's supporters—primarily those in the western territories—rejected her authority. The kingdom split along Murder Creek, with each faction claiming to be the true continuation of the Winter Elf realm.

**Tangiern's Position**: The human kingdom watches the elven civil war with calculated interest. They've historically paid tribute to the unified elven crown; now both Klevnaf and Istora demand that tribute, and Tangiern pays neither. This cannot last. Whichever elven faction wins will turn its attention west—and Tangiern's King Halvard knows it.

**The Suftos Buffer**: The hills between Klevnaf and Istora have become a depopulated no-man's-land. Villages were evacuated or destroyed in the first years of the split. Now it's patrol territory—elven rangers from both sides hunting each other through the rocks and scrub.

## What Makes It Interesting

**A War With No Good Guys**: Lamenrae may be right that Taoinor murdered her father—but Taoinor may be right that a queen is an unacceptable break with tradition. Players can support either claim without being obviously wrong.

**Cursed Geography**: Murder Creek, the Pools of Tragedy, the River of Wights—the land itself remembers violence. This creates supernatural hazards alongside political ones. Drinking from the wrong stream might show you visions of an ancient assassination.

**The Third Player**: Tangiern has survived by staying out of elven politics. But with the succession crisis dragging on, they're being forced to choose sides—or make a bid for regional dominance themselves.

**Ancient Secrets**: Hilda's Forest and the ruins of Hildaneir predate even the Winter Elves. The Fragenstor Mielthøn hides things that remember when this land had different masters.

## What Will Go Wrong

**Escalation**: The cold war is heating up. Border skirmishes are becoming more frequent. One major incident—an assassination, a massacre, a perceived betrayal—could trigger open warfare.

**Tangiern's Choice**: King Halvard can't stay neutral forever. When he picks a side, the other elven faction will consider it an act of war. And if he tries to play both sides, eventually both will realize it.

**The Curse Spreads**: Murder Creek's waters are spreading their influence. Wells near the creek are going dark. People are having visions they shouldn't have. Something is using the old curse for new purposes.

**Dragon's Spine Stirring**: The mountains to the north have been quiet for generations. That's changing. Refugees from the Dragon's Spine Coast bring stories of increased activity—and whatever's waking up there will eventually look south.

## Rivers

### River of Wights

Flows from the northwestern highlands past the Pools of Tragedy and into the Void. The name is earned—the river's upper reaches are genuinely haunted, and bodies dumped in the river don't always stay down. Fishermen along its lower stretches learn quickly which stretches to avoid after dark.

### Murder Creek

The most infamous waterway in the Crimson Coast. This river runs through the heart of Klevnaf, its waters permanently darkened by an ancient curse. King Ghy the Elder—the last ruler of the unified Winter Elves—was murdered on its banks over a thousand years ago. The creek remembers. Those who drink from it experience vivid hallucinations of the assassination, seeing it from different perspectives each time. The elves consider the water sacred and profane simultaneously.

### Sova Chyda

Istora's lifeline. This clear river flows from springs in the Suftos Hills through the Winterwood and past Tuur to the sea. The Istori have built their civilization along its banks—it provides drinking water, irrigation, and transport. Unlike Murder Creek, its waters are pure. The elves say this proves their faction's righteousness.

### Rabbit River

Tangiern's primary trade artery. Rising in the southern Fragenstor Mielthøn, it flows south through the kingdom's heartland past Nøsen and into the Void. Named for the abundance of snowshoe hares along its banks, though locals claim the name actually references how quickly it floods—here one moment, everywhere the next.

### Magrask

A mountain-fed river descending from the Dragon's Spine into northeastern Tangiern. Cold, fast, and prone to flash floods during snowmelt. The Magrask valley provides one of the few routes through the northern mountains, though "route" is generous—it's more a series of treacherous scrambles alongside waterfalls.

### Mercy Falls

Not a river but a spectacular waterfall where the Suftos Hills drop toward the coast. Water from the highland streams plunges several hundred feet into a mist-shrouded pool. The name is bitterly ironic—during the early years of the elven civil war, prisoners were thrown from the falls rather than fed through winter.

## Lakes

### Pools of Tragedy

A cluster of dark lakes in the northwestern Crimson Coast, fed by the River of Wights. Local legend holds that each pool marks where a great sorrow occurred—a massacre, a suicide, a betrayal. The water is safe to drink but tastes of grief. Travelers who camp near the pools report dreams of losses they've never experienced, mourning people they've never known.

### Lake of Rainbows

A surprisingly beautiful lake in western Tangiern, its waters producing prismatic effects in the morning light due to mineral content from surrounding springs. The cheerful name feels incongruous in the Crimson Coast—locals say the lake predates the region's troubles, a remnant of when this land was something other than what it's become.

### Thraken Lake

Technically in the Dragon's Spine Coast region to the east, but visible from Istora's highlands. A large mountain lake that marks the boundary between regions. The Istori consider it the edge of their world—beyond Thraken, different powers hold sway.

## Hills

### Hulry Hills

Rolling highlands in the northwestern Crimson Coast, between Hilda's Forest and the Dragon's Spine foothills. Sheep and goat herding country, sparsely populated. The hills provide early warning of anything coming down from the mountains.

### Suftos Hills

The contested spine of the region, running north-south between Klevnaf and Istora. Rocky, scrub-covered terrain broken by sudden ravines and hidden valleys. Before the split, this was hunting ground for the Winter Elf nobility. Now it's a war zone—depopulated, dangerous, and haunted by the ghosts of the conflict's early casualties.

### Hag Hills

Foothills of the Dragon's Spine in the northeast, marking the transition from Crimson Coast to Dragon's Spine Coast. Named for the old women who supposedly live there, dispensing prophecy and curses in equal measure. Whether these hags are real, metaphorical, or something else entirely depends on who you ask.

## Forests

### Fragenstor Mielthøn

The great forest of Tangiern—hundreds of square miles of dark conifer woodland covering most of the kingdom's territory. The name is Old Tangier for "Forest of a Thousand Thoughts," referencing the forest's reputation for inducing strange mental states in those who travel too deep. Most of Tangiern's population lives at its edges or along river clearings; the deep forest remains largely unexplored and is said to contain ruins from before human settlement.

### Hilda's Forest

An ancient woodland in the northwest, smaller but older than the Fragenstor Mielthøn. The forest takes its name from a legendary figure—Hilda the Wanderer, who supposedly lived here before the Winter Elves arrived. The ruins of Hildaneir lie within, though what Hildaneir was remains debated. The elves avoided this forest even when they ruled the entire region.

### Whitewood

A silver-barked forest in Klevnaf, sacred to the Winter Elves. The trees here are pale as bone, their leaves producing a distinctive rustling that the elves interpret as ancestral voices. Logging is forbidden; the forest is maintained as a shrine to the old ways. Taoinor's faction draws spiritual legitimacy from their control of Whitewood.

### Winterwood

Istora's sacred forest, a dense evergreen woodland along the Sova Chyda's middle reaches. Unlike Whitewood's pale trees, Winterwood is dark and thick—a forest of shadows even at midday. The Istori believe their ancestors' spirits dwell here between incarnations. Queen Lamenrae's coronation took place within Winterwood, defying tradition that demanded the ceremony occur in the now-Klevnaf-controlled ancestral capital.

## Points of Interest

### Hildaneir

Ruins within Hilda's Forest, marked on maps but rarely visited. The structures predate elven settlement—their architecture matches nothing else in the region. Some scholars believe Hildaneir was a temple; others think it was a prison. The Winter Elves have legends about something being "kept" here before their arrival. Whatever it was, it's gone now. Probably.

### Feycreek

A small stream in western Tangiern where fey activity is unusually high. Travelers report encounters with sprites, will-o'-wisps, and stranger things. The creek itself seems to move—maps disagree about its location, and locals claim it flows to different places on different days.
