## Klevnaf

Tags: state, nation, winter-elf, istori

The western remnant of the once-unified Winter Elf kingdom, Klevnaf claims legitimacy through Prince Taoinor—uncle to the murdered King Istor XXVI. They control Murder Creek and the sacred Whitewood, drawing spiritual authority from their possession of the land where the ancient kings fell. But legitimacy built on cursed ground comes at a cost.

### Geography

Klevnaf occupies the central coastal strip of the Crimson Coast, wedged between Tangiern to the west and the contested Suftos Hills to the east. The realm follows Murder Creek from its highland sources to the sea, with the sacred Whitewood anchoring its southern territory.

**Key Features:**
- **Murder Creek**: The cursed river that defines and divides the realm
- **Whitewood**: Sacred silver-barked forest, spiritual heart of the kingdom
- **Suftos Hills (western slopes)**: Contested borderland with Istora
- **Mercy Falls**: Waterfall at the Suftos escarpment, site of wartime atrocities

### Settlements

#### Svedlind (Capital)

Population: ~2,500

Built directly on Murder Creek's banks, Svedlind is a city defined by its proximity to cursed water. The Winter Elves here have learned to live with the visions—children are warned not to drink directly from the creek, and the city draws its water from wells fed by cleaner tributaries. But the curse seeps. Long-term residents report dreams of King Ghy's assassination even without drinking the water.

The royal palace—such as it is—occupies an island in the creek, connected to both banks by graceful bridges. Prince Taoinor rules from here, though he rarely appears in public. His advisors handle most governance while he broods over maps and reports from the eastern front.

Svedlind's architecture reflects elven aesthetics modified by centuries in this harsh climate: elegant curves in thick-walled stone, windows oriented to catch the brief summer sun, gardens that bloom in defiance of the perpetual grey.

#### Wurnfleur (Town)

Population: ~700

A coastal town south of Svedlind, serving as Klevnaf's primary connection to the sea. Wurnfleur's harbor is better protected than Tangiern's rocky coast, and in peacetime the town would thrive on fishing and trade. The civil war has reduced traffic to a trickle—no merchant wants to be caught between elven factions.

The town maintains a small fleet of war-galleys, crewed by elves trained in naval combat. If Istora ever threatens from the sea, Wurnfleur would be the first defense.

#### Snøvgar (Village)

Population: ~200

A fishing village north of Svedlind, clinging to the coast where Murder Creek empties into the Void. The villagers are hardened by proximity to both cursed water and open sea. They catch silverfin in waters other fishermen avoid, claiming the fish here taste better—touched by the creek's strange power without being poisoned by it.

#### Avuul (Village)

Population: ~180

A highland village in the Suftos Hills, positioned to watch the eastern approaches. Avuul has been evacuated and resettled three times during the civil war as the front lines shifted. The current residents are mostly soldiers and their families—civilians who can handle themselves in a fight.

### Economy

Klevnaf's economy is strangled by war. The kingdom traditionally relied on trade with Istora (before the split), tribute from Tangiern (now suspended), and the harvest of the Whitewood's unique timber (sacred, not for sale). What remains is subsistence fishing, limited agriculture in cleared lowlands, and whatever can be looted or salvaged from border skirmishes.

The Whitewood could fund the war effort—its silver-barked trees are valuable beyond measure—but Taoinor has forbidden logging in the sacred forest. This decision is popular with traditionalists but increasingly resented by soldiers who see their equipment wearing out while priceless trees stand untouched.

### Politics

**Prince Taoinor** rules Klevnaf, though "rules" may be generous. He's an aging elf who expected to live out his days as a respected elder, not fight a civil war for a throne he's not certain he wanted. His court is divided between:

- **Hawks**: Military officers who want to push east, crush Istora, and reunify the kingdom by force
- **Doves**: Counselors who believe the war is unwinnable and seek negotiated settlement
- **Traditionalists**: Those focused on maintaining elven customs regardless of the war's outcome

Taoinor vacillates between factions, making decisions slowly and often reversing them. This frustrates everyone but may be intentional—a leader who commits to nothing can't be blamed for failure.

**The Accusation**: Lamenrae claims Taoinor murdered her father. Taoinor denies it. The truth is genuinely uncertain—there were witnesses to Istor XXVI's death, but their accounts conflict, and murder by poison leaves few traces. What's clear is that Taoinor benefited from the death and that Lamenrae had every reason to blame him regardless of guilt. Justice may be impossible; the war will likely end through exhaustion or extinction rather than resolution.

### Culture

Klevnaf represents the conservative wing of Winter Elf society. They venerate the old ways: the sacred forests, the ancestral spirits, the traditions that predate human contact. The Whitewood is the physical manifestation of these values—a forest where the ancestors' voices can still be heard in rustling leaves.

The curse of Murder Creek has become woven into this traditionalism. Rather than flee the cursed land, Klevnaf's elves have embraced it. They see the visions as sacred—painful connections to their murdered king. Some deliberately drink from the creek before battle, seeking Ghy's guidance through hallucination.

Foxes and snowy owls serve as companions and messengers, a tradition shared with Istora that predates the split. The animals don't understand the civil war; they still carry messages between factions when their masters aren't paying attention.

### Military

Klevnaf fields perhaps 800 trained soldiers—a significant force for a small kingdom but not enough to decisively defeat Istora. Their strength lies in defensive terrain: Murder Creek provides a natural barrier, and the Whitewood offers endless opportunities for ambush.

Their weakness is supply. The war has dragged on long enough that equipment is wearing out, stockpiles are depleted, and young elves who should be training are instead farming or fishing to keep the kingdom fed.

### Points of Interest

#### The Mercy Falls

The waterfall where the Suftos Hills drop toward the coast has become a monument to wartime atrocity. During the first winter of the split, when the front lines were fluid and mercy was in short supply, both factions threw prisoners from the falls rather than feed them through the cold months. The practice has stopped, but the falls are now considered cursed—another stain on a region that collects them.

#### The Listening Grove

A clearing in Whitewood where the ancestral voices are said to be clearest. Elves come here to commune with the dead, seeking guidance or simply comfort. Since the split, the grove has been off-limits to non-Klevnaf elves—a source of bitter resentment for Istora's traditionalists, who consider it their heritage too.
