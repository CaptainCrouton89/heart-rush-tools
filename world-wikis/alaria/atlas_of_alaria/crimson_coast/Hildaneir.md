## Hildaneir

Tags: ruins, poi, hilda's-forest, crimson-coast

Ruins within Hilda's Forest, marked on maps but rarely visited. The structures predate elven settlement—their architecture matches nothing else in the region. Some scholars believe Hildaneir was a temple; others think it was a prison. The Winter Elves have legends about something being "kept" here before their arrival. Whatever it was, it's gone now.

Probably.

### The Ruins

Hildaneir consists of several stone structures arranged in a pattern that becomes clear only from above—a spiral, or possibly a coil, with a central building surrounded by progressively smaller outlying structures. The architecture is unlike anything else in Alaria: no right angles, no straight walls, everything curved and flowing.

The stone itself is unusual—a dark material that doesn't match local geology, cold to the touch even in summer, and marked with symbols that no one has successfully translated. The symbols aren't decorative; they're too deliberately placed, too consistently spaced. They mean something. What they mean is unknown.

### History (What Little Is Known)

The ruins predate the Winter Elves' arrival on the Crimson Coast—at minimum several thousand years old, possibly far older. Elven records mention Hildaneir with unusual caution, describing it as a "place of keeping" without specifying what was kept.

**Hilda herself** appears in Tangier legends as a wanderer who lived in the forest before humans arrived—possibly a fey entity, possibly something stranger. The ruins bear her name, but the connection is unclear. Did she build them? Guard them? Escape from them?

The elves left Hildaneir alone. They controlled the rest of the Crimson Coast but established no settlements in Hilda's Forest, built no roads through it, conducted no logging or hunting within its bounds. This was unusual enough that historians have noted it—a forest untouched by a civilization that touched everything else.

### Current State

Hildaneir has been explored perhaps a dozen times in recorded history. Each expedition has produced different findings:

- A 3rd century SD party found the central building sealed and the outlying structures empty
- A 27th century SD expedition found the central building open but couldn't enter—the interior was "wrong" in ways they couldn't describe
- The most recent expedition (early 34th century SD) found evidence of recent activity—cleared paths, disturbed dust—despite no one admitting to having visited

The ruins are generally considered dangerous without being specifically threatening. No expedition has been attacked; several have simply... failed, their members returning confused, their notes incomplete, their memories uncertain.

### What The Symbols Say

Multiple scholars have attempted to translate the Hildaneir symbols. Their conclusions are contradictory:

- **Binding formulae** for containing something powerful
- **Warning text** describing what happens to trespassers
- **Instructions** for operating the site as some kind of device
- **Names**—hundreds of them, listed in spiral patterns that mirror the building arrangement

The truth may include all of these. Or none of them. The symbols resist magical analysis; divination directed at them produces headaches and nosebleeds rather than information.

### Adventure Hooks

- The ruins have become active—lights visible at night, sounds audible from the forest edge. Someone or something is using Hildaneir for the first time in millennia.
- A scholar believes she's cracked the symbol translation and needs protection while she confirms her theory on-site.
- An expedition went in three weeks ago and hasn't returned. Their employer wants to know what happened—and wants whatever they found.
- Something has begun speaking to those who camp near the ruins, offering knowledge in exchange for... something.
