## Hilda's Forest

Tags: forest, crimson-coast, ancient

An ancient woodland in the northwestern Crimson Coast, smaller but far older than the neighboring Fragenstor Mielthøn. The forest takes its name from a legendary figure—Hilda the Wanderer, who supposedly lived here before the Winter Elves arrived, before humans crossed the Dragon's Spine, before recorded history began.

### Character

Where the Fragenstor Mielthøn is oppressive in its vastness, Hilda's Forest is oppressive in its intensity. The trees are older here—gnarled oaks and twisted pines that look like they've been growing since the world was young. The canopy blocks almost all light; the undergrowth is thick and tangled; the paths (such as they are) seem to shift between visits.

The forest feels *aware* in a way the Fragenstor doesn't. Travelers report being watched, being followed, being *considered* by something that decides whether to let them pass. Most are let pass. Some aren't.

### Hilda the Wanderer

Tangier legends describe Hilda as:
- A woman who lived alone in the forest for centuries before humans arrived
- A fey creature who guarded the woodland against outsiders
- A prisoner kept in the forest by ancient powers
- Something that merely wore the shape of a woman

The legends don't agree on details, but they agree on this: Hilda was here first, and the forest belongs to her. Even now, centuries or millennia after her disappearance (if she ever existed), locals leave offerings at the forest edge—bread, honey, small coins—before entering.

### The Elven Avoidance

The Winter Elves avoided Hilda's Forest entirely. They claimed the rest of the Crimson Coast, built settlements, extracted tribute, shaped the land to their purposes—but never touched this forest. Their records mention it only to note its existence and warn against entry.

This restraint is remarkable. The elves had the power to clear the forest, the need for its timber, the curiosity to explore its mysteries. They did none of these things. Either they knew something about Hilda's Forest that made leaving it alone worth the cost, or they tried to claim it and failed badly enough that no record survives.

### Hildaneir

The ruins of Hildaneir lie within the forest, perhaps a day's travel from the edge for those who can find the way. The ruins predate the forest—or rather, the forest grew up around them, consuming what was once cleared land. See [Hildaneir](./Hildaneir.md) for details.

### Current Status

Hilda's Forest is technically within Tangiern's borders but functionally independent. The Tangier people don't log here, don't hunt here, don't claim to control it. They maintain a respectful distance, and in return the forest doesn't expand into their territories or produce threats that require response.

This arrangement has held for centuries. Whether it will continue holding depends on factors no one fully understands.

### Entering the Forest

Those who enter Hilda's Forest report:
- **Disorientation**: Compasses spin; the sun seems to move too fast or too slow; landmarks appear in the wrong places
- **Observation**: The constant sense of being watched by something intelligent
- **Testing**: Small challenges—paths that lead in circles, obstacles that require specific solutions, moments where giving up would be the easy choice
- **Judgment**: Those who pass the tests may proceed; those who don't find themselves back at the forest edge with no memory of the journey

The forest seems to evaluate visitors and decide whether they deserve passage. The criteria are unclear; worthy visitors have included scholars, criminals, children, and at least one war party that entered seeking conquest and emerged seeking peace.

### Adventure Hooks

- The offerings at the forest edge have been disappearing—not consumed, not scattered, simply gone. Someone or something is collecting them.
- A child entered the forest three days ago and hasn't returned. The forest usually sends children back immediately; this time it hasn't.
- A scholar claims to have found evidence that Hilda wasn't a person but a title—and that the position has been vacant for too long.
