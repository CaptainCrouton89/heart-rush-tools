## Fragenstor Mielthøn

Tags: forest, tangiern, crimson-coast

The great forest of Tangiern—hundreds of square miles of dark conifer woodland covering most of the human kingdom's territory. The name is Old Tangier for "Forest of a Thousand Thoughts," and the forest earns it. Those who travel too deep report strange mental states: vivid dreams, borrowed memories, conversations with people who aren't there.

### Character

Fragenstor Mielthøn is oppressively vast. Standing at its edge, the trees stretch to the horizon in every direction except behind you. Dark pines and spruces crowd together, blocking sunlight even at midday. The forest floor is a carpet of needles, centuries deep, that muffles footsteps and makes tracking difficult.

The silence is the first thing travelers notice. Then the sounds that break it—distant calls that might be birds or might be something else, the creak of wood that sounds almost like speech, the rustle of movement where nothing visible moves.

### The Thousand Thoughts

The forest's name references its documented psychological effects. Extended time in the deep forest produces:

- **Vivid dreams** featuring locations the dreamer has never visited
- **Intrusive thoughts** that feel like someone else's memories
- **Conversations** with absent people, remembered perfectly despite never happening
- **Temporal confusion** about how long one has been traveling

These effects are harmless in short exposure—a few days produces interesting dreams and nothing more. Longer stays produce more intense symptoms. The foresters who work the deep woods rotate out regularly; those who don't eventually stop making sense.

The Tangier people consider these effects natural, like altitude sickness in mountains. Outsiders suspect something more deliberate—the forest testing intruders, or remembering them, or preparing something.

### Settlements

Most of Tangiern's population lives at the forest's edges or along river clearings. The deep interior is effectively uninhabited—work parties enter for specific tasks and leave. Permanent settlement in the deep forest is theoretically possible but practically foolish.

**Nøsen**, the capital, sits where the Rabbit River provides a natural clearing. **Aspenthar** and the other logging towns occupy similar river valleys. The forest allows these intrusions but doesn't encourage them.

### What Lies Within

The foresters tell stories of things in the deep forest:

- **Ruins** that don't match any known civilization, overgrown but not quite consumed
- **Clearings** where nothing grows, the soil black and the air cold
- **Structures** glimpsed between trees that vanish when approached directly
- **Creatures** that might be animals or might be something wearing animal shapes

Nobody has mapped the deep forest comprehensively. Expeditions that venture too far don't always return, and those that do report contradictory geography—as if the forest rearranges itself between visits.

### Logging

Tangiern's economy depends on timber from the Fragenstor Mielthøn. The kingdom has developed sustainable harvesting practices that avoid the deep forest entirely—working the edges, replanting aggressively, treating the forest as a resource to be managed rather than conquered.

This approach has worked for centuries. The forest tolerates the edge-harvesting; it hasn't tolerated deeper incursions. Three major attempts to establish logging operations in the interior ended badly enough that nobody has tried since.

### Relation to Hilda's Forest

The northwestern corner of the Crimson Coast contains a separate, older forest—Hilda's Forest, which predates the Fragenstor Mielthøn and operates by different rules. The two forests don't quite touch; a narrow strip of cleared land separates them. The Tangier people maintain this buffer carefully, though they can't articulate exactly why.
