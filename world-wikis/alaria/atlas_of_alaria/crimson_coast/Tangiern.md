## Tangiern

Tags: state, nation, human

The largest state on the Crimson Coast by territory, Tangiern is a human kingdom that has carved civilization from the vast Fragenstor Mielthøn forest over centuries. While their elven neighbors tear themselves apart in civil war, the Tangier people watch and wait—knowing their survival depends on choosing the right moment to act.

### Geography

Tangiern occupies the western two-thirds of the Crimson Coast, bounded by the Dragon's Spine to the north, the Void to the south, and the elven territories to the east. The landscape is dominated by the enormous Fragenstor Mielthøn—a dark conifer forest covering most of the kingdom. Settlements cluster along rivers and the southern coast, with the deep forest interior remaining largely unexplored.

**Key Features:**
- **Fragenstor Mielthøn**: The great forest, covering most of the kingdom
- **Hilda's Forest**: Ancient woodland in the northwest, avoided even by locals
- **Hulry Hills**: Northern highlands used for grazing
- **Rabbit River**: Primary trade route from the interior to the coast
- **Magrask River**: Mountain-fed tributary from the Dragon's Spine
- **Lake of Rainbows**: Western lake known for prismatic morning effects
- **Pools of Tragedy**: Haunted lakes in the northwest

### Settlements

#### Nøsen (Capital)

Population: ~4,000

The capital sits at the junction of the Rabbit River and its primary tributary, controlling both the main north-south trade route and access to the eastern forest roads. Nøsen began as a logging camp and still feels like one—wooden construction predominates, streets are muddy half the year and frozen the other half, and the smell of pine resin permeates everything.

The royal seat is the Timberhall, a massive lodge constructed from the largest trees ever felled in the Fragenstor Mielthøn. King Halvard holds court here, though "court" is generous—Tangier governance is practical rather than ceremonial.

#### Frostrien (Town)

Population: ~1,200

A fortified town on the eastern road, Frostrien marks the edge of settled Tangiern territory. Beyond it lies increasingly wild forest, then the contested borderlands with the elven realms. The town maintains a permanent garrison and serves as the staging point for any military action eastward.

#### Aspenthar (Town)

Population: ~900

A logging town along the Rabbit River's middle reaches. Aspenthar processes timber from the surrounding forest and ships it downstream to Nøsen. The town's sawmills run constantly during the brief summer months, stockpiling lumber against the long winter.

#### Tirenthar (Town)

Population: ~800

The southernmost town of significance, Tirenthar sits near the coast where the Rabbit River empties into the Void. It functions as Tangiern's primary port—though "port" oversells it. The coastline is rocky and treacherous, and most trade still moves overland.

#### Mornigster (Village)

Population: ~300

An isolated village in the northeastern forest, positioned along the Magrask River valley. Mornigster exists primarily to monitor the mountain passes and provide early warning of anything coming down from the Dragon's Spine. It's a hardship posting; residents rotate out after a few years.

#### Favind (Village)

Population: ~250

A small settlement east of Nøsen, on the road toward Frostrien. Favind serves travelers and maintains the road through an otherwise uninhabited stretch of forest. The village has an inn, a blacksmith, and little else.

### Economy

Tangiern's economy is built on timber, furs, and survival. The Fragenstor Mielthøn provides seemingly endless lumber, and the kingdom exports processed wood to markets around the Void's shores. Hunting and trapping supplement the timber trade—Tangier furs are prized for their quality.

Agriculture is limited by climate and terrain. The growing season is short, the soil is acidic from pine needles, and cleared land tends to revert to forest within a generation if not constantly maintained. Most food is imported or hunted.

### Politics

King Halvard III rules Tangiern, the latest in a dynasty that has held power for six generations. His position is more chief-among-equals than absolute monarch—the jarls who control the major towns retain significant autonomy, and the king's authority extends mainly to military matters and foreign relations.

**The Elven Question**: Tangiern historically paid tribute to the unified Winter Elf crown in exchange for being left alone. The elven civil war has freed them from this obligation—neither Klevnaf nor Istora can enforce tribute collection while fighting each other. But Halvard knows this freedom is temporary. When the elves reunify (or when one side decisively wins), they'll want their tribute back. His choices are:
1. Pick a side now, helping one faction win and hoping for gratitude
2. Stay neutral and prepare to fight whoever emerges victorious
3. Use the chaos to expand Tangier territory while the elves are distracted

He's currently pursuing option 2 while keeping options 1 and 3 available.

### Culture

The Tangier people are practical, suspicious of outsiders, and deeply connected to their forest. They worship a mix of nature spirits and ancestor veneration, with little interest in the formal religions of other lands. Their festivals mark the seasons—the return of light in spring, the hunt in autumn, the long darkness of winter.

They view the elves with a mixture of resentment (for centuries of tribute extraction) and respect (for their obvious power). The elven civil war has shifted this toward cautious optimism—maybe the elves will destroy each other and leave Tangiern free.

### Points of Interest

#### Hildaneir

Ruins in the northwest, within Hilda's Forest. The Tangier people avoid this place; their grandparents' grandparents told stories about why it should be left alone, though the specific reasons have been lost. Occasionally adventurers or scholars investigate. Most return changed; some don't return at all.
