## Istora

Tags: state, nation, winter-elf, istori

The eastern successor to the unified Winter Elf kingdom, Istora is ruled by Queen Lamenrae—daughter of the murdered Istor XXVI and the first woman to claim the elven throne. Her realm follows the Sova Chyda river from the Suftos Hills to the sea, with the sacred Winterwood as its spiritual heart. The Istori were once known for regal calm; the succession crisis has made them something harder.

### Geography

Istora occupies the eastern portion of the Crimson Coast, bounded by the contested Suftos Hills to the west, the Dragon's Spine Coast to the east, and the Void to the south. The kingdom is defined by the Sova Chyda river system—settlements cluster along its banks, and the sacred Winterwood straddles its middle reaches.

**Key Features:**
- **Sova Chyda River**: Clean water and the kingdom's lifeline
- **Winterwood**: Sacred evergreen forest, home to ancestral spirits
- **Suftos Hills (eastern slopes)**: Contested borderland with Klevnaf
- **Hag Hills (southern reaches)**: Wild highlands on the Dragon's Spine border
- **Thraken Lake**: Mountain lake marking the eastern boundary

### Settlements

#### Tuur (Capital)

Population: ~3,000

The capital sits where the Sova Chyda emerges from the Winterwood, commanding both the river trade and access to the sacred forest. Tuur is older than the split—it served as the summer residence of the unified kingdom's monarchs, who wintered in what is now Klevnaf-controlled territory. That history makes Istora's claim to legitimacy complicated; they hold the summer palace but lost the ancestral seat.

Queen Lamenrae rules from the Palace of Seasons, a graceful complex of white stone towers connected by covered bridges. The architecture reflects centuries of wealth and peace now interrupted. Recent construction—walls reinforced, towers converted to watchtowers—shows the war's impact.

Tuur's population has swelled with refugees from the contested hills and elves who chose Lamenrae's faction when the kingdom split. Housing is tight; tempers are short.

#### Bejakørn (Town)

Population: ~600

A highland town in the eastern reaches, positioned where the Sova Chyda descends from its mountain sources. Bejakørn serves as Istora's gateway to the Dragon's Spine Coast—limited trade still flows through here, and the town's inns host travelers heading east or west.

The town also houses Istora's armories and training grounds, positioned far from the front lines where they can operate without interruption. Young elves from across the kingdom come here to learn the warrior's arts before deployment to the Suftos line.

#### Asgrael (Village)

Population: ~250

A village along the Sova Chyda's middle reaches, within sight of the Winterwood's edge. Asgrael serves pilgrims traveling to the sacred forest and foresters who harvest timber from the woodland's outer edges. (Unlike Klevnaf's total prohibition on logging, Istora permits sustainable harvesting from Winterwood's periphery—a theological difference that both sides consider evidence of the other's corruption.)

#### Bjornheim (Village)

Population: ~200

A frontier village in the southern reaches, positioned to watch the wild country between Istora and the Dragon's Spine Coast. Bjornheim's residents are hardened—the village has been raided by bandits, monsters from the mountains, and (once) a Klevnaf war party that got lost. They trust no one who isn't family.

### Economy

Istora's economy is better positioned than Klevnaf's, though "better" is relative during wartime. The Sova Chyda provides irrigation for limited agriculture, the Winterwood offers sustainable timber, and the eastern trade routes to the Dragon's Spine Coast remain open.

The kingdom exports carved woodwork—Istori craftsmen are renowned for their detailed work with Winterwood timber—and imports food, metal goods, and weapons. The war has made these imports more expensive, but they still flow.

Fishing provides protein; the Sova Chyda and the coastal waters support significant catches. The elves have developed preservation techniques that allow fish to last through the long winters.

### Politics

**Queen Lamenrae** is the first woman to rule the Winter Elves—a break with tradition that her supporters call necessary evolution and her opponents call unforgivable deviation. She's young for an elf (perhaps two centuries), sharp-minded, and angry. Her father was murdered, her uncle stole half her kingdom, and tradition demands she be grateful for what remains.

Her court is divided differently than Taoinor's:

- **Progressives**: Those who see the succession crisis as an opportunity to reform elven society
- **Revanchists**: Those focused entirely on defeating Klevnaf and reunifying the kingdom
- **Pragmatists**: Those who want to stabilize what they have before worrying about what they've lost

Lamenrae herself is a revanchist wrapped in progressive rhetoric. She speaks of reform but spends most of her energy on the war effort. Her advisors worry she's so focused on vengeance that she's neglecting governance.

**The Accusation**: Lamenrae believes absolutely that Taoinor murdered her father. She has witnesses—servants who saw Taoinor near the king's chambers that night, a cupbearer who noticed something strange about the wine. But none of it is conclusive, and Taoinor's supporters dismiss the witnesses as bought or coerced. The truth may never be established to everyone's satisfaction. Lamenrae has moved past caring about proving her case; she just wants Taoinor dead.

### Culture

Istora represents the reformist wing of Winter Elf society—by necessity if not conviction. A queen requires new theology; new alliances require new customs; survival requires adaptation. The elves here have begun questioning traditions that Klevnaf holds sacred.

The Winterwood remains central to their spirituality, but Istori interpretation has shifted. Where Klevnaf sees the ancestral voices as commands to be obeyed, Istora increasingly treats them as guidance to be considered. The dead advise; the living decide. This theological innovation horrifies Klevnaf's traditionalists.

Foxes and snowy owls still serve as companions—this tradition crosses factional lines—but Istora has begun training hawks and wolves as well. Practical needs override ancestral preferences.

The Istori have "become much nastier" since the split, as outsiders describe it. Centuries of regal calm have given way to siege mentality. Strangers are suspected; questions are threats; mercy is weakness. A people who once prided themselves on composure now pride themselves on survival.

### Military

Istora fields roughly 1,000 trained soldiers—slightly larger than Klevnaf's force, reflecting their larger population and better supply situation. Their strength lies in discipline and equipment: the Bejakørn training grounds produce skilled warriors, and the eastern trade routes keep weapons and armor flowing.

Their weakness is terrain. Attacking across the Suftos Hills means advancing uphill into prepared defenses. The war has settled into stalemate because neither side can project force effectively into the other's territory.

### Points of Interest

#### The Palace of Seasons

Tuur's royal complex, built over centuries to house the Winter Elf monarchy during summer months. Four wings correspond to the quarters of the year, each with distinct architecture and gardens. The Winter Wing was never completed—construction halted when the split occurred, and the scaffolding still stands, a monument to interrupted ambition.

#### The Coronation Grove

A clearing in Winterwood where Lamenrae was crowned, breaking tradition that demanded the ceremony occur in the ancestral capital (now in Klevnaf). The grove has become a pilgrimage site for Istora's loyalists—they come to see where their queen claimed power in defiance of those who would deny her.

#### The Shrine of Reflections

A temple along the Sova Chyda where elves come to contemplate the river's clear waters. The shrine predates the split and was traditionally used for meditation and prophecy. Since the war began, its priests have reported darker visions—death, fire, a figure in the mist who might be Ghy or might be Istor XXVI or might be someone yet to die.
