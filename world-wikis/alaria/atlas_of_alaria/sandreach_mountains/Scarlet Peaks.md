## Scarlet Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography

A dramatic mountain range in the southeastern Sandreach Mountains, known for the distinctive red-orange coloration of its rock faces. The color comes from iron-rich stone that oxidizes in the dry mountain air, giving the peaks a bloody appearance at sunset that inspired their name.

### Geography

The Scarlet Peaks rise sharply from the surrounding terrain, forming a barrier between the Drystone Mountains to the north and the coastal lowlands of Siquestrya to the southeast. The range is younger and more jagged than the weathered Drystone, with sheer cliff faces and narrow passes that make travel difficult.

The fire leyline passes through the western Scarlet Peaks before continuing south toward Wycendeula, and pockets of volcanic activity dot the range—hot springs, sulfur vents, and the occasional minor eruption. The iron in the stone may itself be a product of ancient volcanic activity.

### Viktryapos

A tower carved into the red mountainside of the central Scarlet Peaks, rising from a high ridge with commanding views of the surrounding terrain. Viktryapos is a wizard's sanctum—home to a reclusive mage who chose this isolated location for the convergence of elemental energies where the fire leyline passes through iron-rich stone.

The tower's exterior is deceptively simple: a single spire of worked red rock that seems to grow from the mountain itself. Inside, the structure extends both upward and downward into the mountain, with laboratories, libraries, and chambers whose purposes visitors can only guess at. The wizard of Viktryapos is not hostile to travelers who approach respectfully, but neither is the tower a waystation—those seeking shelter or supplies are turned away, politely but firmly.

What draws a wizard to such an isolated place? The Scarlet Peaks offer something rare: the interaction between fire leyline energy and the iron deposits in the rock creates unique magical conditions. Spells cast here behave differently. Enchantments take hold more readily. And certain experiments that would be impossible elsewhere become merely dangerous.

The wizard's name and specific pursuits are not widely known. Those who've dealt with the tower's occupant describe someone old, patient, and utterly uninterested in the politics of the lowlands. The tower has stood for at least two centuries; whether the same wizard has occupied it the entire time is a matter of speculation.

### Bettle Lake

A mountain lake in the northeastern Scarlet Peaks, one of the few permanent water sources in the range. Bettle Lake sits in a high valley accessible only through narrow passes, making it naturally defensible. A small community of herders lives near the lake, raising hardy mountain goats and trading wool and cheese with travelers.

The lake is unusually clear and cold, fed by underground springs rather than surface runoff. Local legend claims something lives in the depths—not hostile, but watchful. Herders report seeing large shapes moving beneath the surface on moonlit nights, though no one has ever been attacked.
