## Triuci

Tags: region, giants

A hilly region in the northern Sandreach Mountains, home to hill giant clans known throughout the region for their aggression and brutality. The Triuci giants are smaller than their southern cousins in Malo Kon Greikh but make up for it with numbers, viciousness, and a complete lack of restraint.

### The Triuci Giants

The hill giants of Triuci are considered primitive even by giant standards—emotionally stunted, quick to violence, and incapable of the sophisticated politics that characterize Malo Kon Greikh. They organize into loose clan structures held together by the biggest and meanest giant at any given time. Leadership changes frequently and violently.

A few years ago, a massive warband of Triuci giants swept south onto the Xeltri Plateau, demolishing the ogre city-states that had existed there for centuries. The giants showed no interest in occupying the territory—they simply destroyed everything, took what they wanted, and retreated back to their hills. The ruined ogre cities remain, picked over by scavengers but largely abandoned.

### Relations

The Triuci giants raid neighboring territories constantly—the Hills of Gezzeri, the edges of Breia, and occasionally even into Malo Kon Greikh (though the larger giants there usually repel them). They don't trade, don't negotiate, and don't take prisoners except as food. Travelers give Triuci a wide berth.
