## Breia

Tags: state, nation

A mountain state nestled within the Drystone Mountains, notable for its ancient ruins and dangerous magical sites. Breia occupies a series of interconnected valleys in the central Drystone range, protected from the worst desert winds by the surrounding peaks but still harsh and isolated.

### Geography

Breia sits athwart the fire leyline that runs from Belu Jenari southward through the mountains. This leyline's presence has shaped the region's history—ancient civilizations built here to tap its power, and their ruins still dot the landscape. The terrain is rugged: steep mountain valleys, dry riverbeds that flash-flood during rare storms, and exposed ridgelines where nothing grows.

Water is scarce but not absent. Several seasonal streams flow through Breia's valleys, and the settlements cluster around reliable springs or wells. The fire leyline's influence keeps the region warmer than surrounding areas, which paradoxically makes survival harder—evaporation is relentless.

### Capital: Iara

Iara is Breia's largest settlement and seat of governance, built in a sheltered valley in the eastern part of the state. The city developed around a cluster of hot springs heated by the fire leyline's proximity—providing year-round water and warmth that made permanent habitation possible.

The government of Breia operates from Iara, though "government" may be too strong a word. Breia is more a loose confederation of settlements that acknowledge Iara's leadership in matters of external trade and defense, while managing their own internal affairs.

### Settlements

#### Jamtaland

A northern mountain town positioned at a key pass through the Drystone Mountains. Jamtaland serves as Breia's gateway to the northern desert, and most trade entering or leaving the state passes through its markets. The town is fortified—not against armies, but against the rocs and other flying predators that hunt the mountain passes.

#### Kopanes

A mining settlement in the western valleys, where Breian prospectors extract copper and tin from the mountain rock. The mines here are ancient—some shafts date back to whoever built Shtaneres—and occasionally break through into older workings with their own dangers. Kopanes is known for practical, hard people who don't ask too many questions about what their ancestors left behind.

#### Dalir

A central settlement positioned in the largest of Breia's interior valleys. Dalir is the agricultural heart of the state, such as it is—terraced gardens and hardy goat herds provide food for the other settlements. The valley's relative flatness makes it vulnerable to raids from the Dnykuul hills to the south.

#### Eyrar

A southwestern settlement near the edge of Breian territory, where the Drystone Mountains begin their descent toward the Giant Lands. Eyrar's people have the most contact with the giants and their vassals, trading mountain goods for lowland products. It's a rough town, accustomed to dealing with beings much larger than themselves.

### Notable Locations

#### Shtaneres

The ruins of an ancient city in eastern Breia, built at the intersection of fire and air leylines. The city was destroyed long ago, its structures reduced to rubble by magical catastrophe. See the full entry in the Sandreach introduction for details on Hermelia's Lair.

#### Enki's House

A mysterious structure in the southwestern mountains, near Eyrar. Enki's House appears to be a single building of unusual architecture—curved walls, no visible doors at ground level, and windows placed too high for human use. Local legend holds it was built by a giant or titan named Enki who retreated here in ancient times.

The house is larger inside than outside. Explorers who have entered through the high windows report corridors that loop back on themselves, rooms that appear in different configurations on subsequent visits, and the persistent sense of being watched. Some claim to have heard breathing from behind the walls.

Whatever Enki was, if Enki ever existed, the house remains. Breians avoid it. The few treasure hunters who've gone in searching for giant artifacts have emerged empty-handed and shaken—or haven't emerged at all.
