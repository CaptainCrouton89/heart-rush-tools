## Caffas Mountains

Tags: mountains

A mountain range in the southern portion of the Sandreach Mountains system, positioned between the Grognil Mountains to the west and the coastal lowlands to the east. The Caffas are notable for the elemental leylines that run through them—both fire and force leylines cross here, and the region's inhabitants have adapted to harness that power.

### The Two Tribes

The Caffas Mountains are dominated by two major tribal confederations whose rivalry defines the region:

**The Flame Kindred** occupy the eastern Caffas, where the fire leyline runs strongest. Their settlements cluster around thermal vents and hot springs, and their warriors train in fire magic from childhood. The Flame Kindred are aggressive expansionists who believe the mountains rightfully belong to fire alone.

**The Ironbound** hold the western Caffas, drawing power from the force leyline. Their magic emphasizes durability, strength, and kinetic manipulation—they can shatter stone with a gesture or render themselves nearly immovable. The Ironbound are defensive by nature, content to hold their territory but utterly implacable when attacked.

The two tribes have warred intermittently for centuries. Neither can dislodge the other—fire magic struggles against force-hardened defenses, while the Ironbound lack the offensive power to push into Flame Kindred territory. The result is an uneasy stalemate punctuated by raids, skirmishes, and occasional pitched battles.

### Settlements

The mountain settlements are divided between the two tribes, with a few neutral trading posts in the buffer zones.

#### Flame Kindred Settlements (Eastern)

- **Pellosyir** — Northeastern settlement, positioned to trade with coastal communities
- **Dvornuth** — Eastern coastal-facing town
- **Freynthiak** — Central-east settlement, known for its fire-speaker training grounds
- **Tüth** — Eastern settlement near the leyline's surface breach
- **Shaffiak** — Southeastern settlement overlooking the White Wastes
- **Benüd** — Northern settlement, closest to neutral territory
- **Eptriaki** — Central settlement, administrative center of the Flame Kindred

#### Ironbound Settlements (Western)

- **Bryzal** — Northwestern settlement near the Grognil Mountains
- **Pertheniak** — Western settlement, the Ironbound's largest and most fortified
- **Ilmin** — Central-west settlement
- **Choysinn** — Southern settlement near the Firefrost Hills

### Geographic Features

#### Ptequin Lakes

A cluster of mountain lakes in the northern Caffas, fed by snowmelt and underground springs. The lakes mark the boundary between tribal territories and serve as neutral ground for the rare negotiations between Flame Kindred and Ironbound. Fishing rights are carefully allocated; violations have sparked wars.

#### The Leyline Crossing

Somewhere in the central Caffas, the fire and force leylines intersect. The exact location shifts over time and is known only to the most powerful magic users of both tribes. The crossing point is extraordinarily dangerous—combined elemental energies produce unpredictable effects. Both tribes consider it sacred and forbidden.
