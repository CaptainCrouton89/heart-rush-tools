## Grognil Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A rugged mountain range in the southwestern Sandreach Mountains system, positioned between the Caffas Mountains to the east and the lowlands descending toward Wycendeula. The Grognil range is older and more weathered than its neighbors, with rounded peaks and deep valleys carved by ancient glaciers.

### Character

The Grognil Mountains are utterly uninhabited. The force leyline that empowers the Ironbound runs through the eastern Grognil before continuing into Caffas territory, but the mountains themselves lack the thermal activity that makes the Caffas survivable. Winters are brutal, summers are short, and the few water sources freeze solid for most of the year.

The Ironbound occasionally send patrols into the eastern Grognil but never stay long. Something about the range resists settlement—expeditions report unshakeable unease, the sense of being watched from empty ridgelines. Whether this is residual leyline effects, territorial predators, or something older, the result is the same: no one lives here.

### Liar's Lake

A high mountain lake in the northern Grognil, named for the dozens of expeditions that have claimed to find valuable resources nearby—and returned with nothing to show. The lake itself is unremarkable, but the surrounding peaks seem to confuse navigation. Parties split up and can't find each other. Cairns left as markers appear to move. The Ironbound avoid it entirely.

### Larsoia Lake

A larger lake in the central Grognil, partially fed by underground springs that keep sections from freezing completely. The water is drinkable and the shores occasionally show signs of old camps, but no permanent settlement has ever taken hold. Travelers who stay more than a few nights report increasingly vivid dreams of drowning—not in water, but in absolute stillness, unable to move or cry out.

### Etar's Lake

The highest of the Grognil lakes, accessible only through treacherous passes. Named for a hermit who supposedly lived on its shores for a century, though records suggest at least four different "Etars" over the centuries—none of whom aged, and all of whom vanished without explanation. The lake freezes solid for most of the year. Those who've camped here claim the ice sometimes shows shadows moving beneath it, even when nothing swims in the water.
