## Drystone Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A major east-west mountain range within the Sandreach Mountains system, running through the central portion of the range. The Drystone Mountains mark the transition zone between the northern desert and the more temperate southern slopes.

The range takes its name from the pale, weathered stone that dominates its peaks—limestone and sandite formations that have been bleached by millennia of sun exposure. Rain is rare here, and when it comes, it runs off the bare rock in flash floods rather than soaking in. The "dry stone" looks almost white from a distance, giving the mountains an austere, skeletal appearance.

### Fire Leyline

The Yolus fire leyline runs through the Drystone Mountains, passing from Belu Jenari in the north down through Breia and eventually into the southern territories. The leyline's influence keeps the mountains warmer than surrounding ranges and has attracted settlement and magical construction throughout history. The ruins of Shtaneres mark the most dramatic example of what happens when that power is misused.

### Breia

The only organized state within the Drystone Mountains. Breia occupies the central valleys where the leyline's warmth and scattered water sources make permanent settlement possible. Its capital Iara sits atop hot springs heated by the leyline, and its people have adapted to life in a harsh landscape full of dangerous ruins. See the full Breia entry for details on its settlements and notable locations.
