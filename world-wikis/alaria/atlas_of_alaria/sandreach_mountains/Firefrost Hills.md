## Firefrost Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A transitional zone between the southern Caffas Mountains and the White Wastes, where the elevation drops from mountain heights to the flat expanse of the wastes below. The Firefrost Hills take their name from the bizarre weather patterns that occur here—hot air rising from the fire leyline collides with cold air sweeping north from Wycendeula, creating sudden temperature swings, unexpected frosts in summer, and heat waves in winter.

### Climate

The Firefrost Hills are climatically unstable. A warm morning can turn to freezing by noon; snow can fall one day and melt under scorching sun the next. This unpredictability makes agriculture impossible and long-term habitation difficult. The few who live here are nomads who've learned to read the signs of incoming weather shifts.

### The Border Zone

The hills mark the effective boundary between the Sandreach Mountains region and Wycendeula. The Flame Kindred of the Caffas consider the Firefrost Hills the southern edge of their territory, but they don't patrol it—the unstable weather and proximity to the orc and goblin tribes of the White Wastes make it more trouble than it's worth.

Travelers heading south into Wycendeula typically pass through the Firefrost Hills quickly, camping only when necessary and keeping watch for both weather changes and raiding parties from the wastes.
