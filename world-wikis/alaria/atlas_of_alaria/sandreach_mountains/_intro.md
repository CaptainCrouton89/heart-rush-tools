# Sandreach Mountains

## Geography

The Sand Reach Mountains are the vast central mountain range of Upoceax, positioned south of the Sand Reach desert. This is an extensive mountainous region containing several states and serving as the geographic heart of the continent.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach desert
- **East**: Extends toward Sequestria and the eastern coast
- **South**: The Giant Lands and Wycendeula
- **West**: Intersects with the Kelder Mountains (the north-south range)

### Relationship to Other Ranges

The Sand Reach Mountains bisect the Kelder Mountains where they meet on the western side—the Kelder running north-south, the Sand Reach running more or less east-west. This intersection creates a complex mountain junction in the western interior of Upoceax.

### Climate Effect

The mountains act as a rain shadow, contributing to the desertification of the region to their north. They trap moisture on the southern side, leaving the northern Sand Reach desert parched and barren.

### Terrain

The Sand Reach Mountains are an extensive system containing:
- Multiple distinct ranges and peaks
- Several states within the mountain territory
- Passes connecting the desert north to the forested south
