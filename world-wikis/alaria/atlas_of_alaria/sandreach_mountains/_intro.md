# Sandreach Mountains

## Geography

A range of mountains bordering the Sandreach desert to the south. These mountains likely act as a rain shadow, contributing to the desertification of the region to their north. They form the southern barrier of the great desert, trapping moisture on one side and leaving the other parched.
