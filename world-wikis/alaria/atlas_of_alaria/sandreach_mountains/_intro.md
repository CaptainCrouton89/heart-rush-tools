# Sandreach Mountains

## Geography

The Sand Reach Mountains are the vast central mountain range of Upoceax, positioned south of the Sand Reach desert. This is an extensive mountainous region containing several states and serving as the geographic heart of the continent.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach desert
- **East**: Extends toward Sequestria and the eastern coast
- **South**: The Giant Lands and Wycendeula
- **West**: Intersects with the Kelder Mountains (the north-south range)

### Relationship to Other Ranges

The Sand Reach Mountains bisect the Kelder Mountains where they meet on the western side—the Kelder running north-south, the Sand Reach running more or less east-west. This intersection creates a complex mountain junction in the western interior of Upoceax.

### Climate Effect

The mountains act as a rain shadow, contributing to the desertification of the region to their north. They trap moisture on the southern side, leaving the northern Sand Reach desert parched and barren.

### Terrain

The Sand Reach Mountains are an extensive system containing:
- Multiple distinct ranges and peaks
- Several states within the mountain territory
- Passes connecting the desert north to the forested south

### Major Sub-Ranges

- **Drystone Mountains**: Central east-west range containing the state of Breia
- **Lyagnadarr Mountains**: Eastern range bordering Siquestrya, home to Svorinthak the dragon
- **Scarlet Peaks**: Southeastern mountains containing the fortress Viktryapos
- **Caffas Mountains**: Southern range home to rival force-user and fire-user tribes
- **Hills of Gezzeri**: Western hills inhabited by the water-starved Gezzerin who hide from giants in cliff dwellings
- **White Hills**: Home to the Thrygun orcs
- **Dnykuul**: Hilly region south of Breia, home to the Cendelle
