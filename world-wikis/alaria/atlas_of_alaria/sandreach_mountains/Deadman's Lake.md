## Deadman's Lake

Tags: lake, geography

A large lake in the southwestern foothills where the Grognil Mountains descend toward the White Wastes. Deadman's Lake earned its name from the bodies—the water is cold, deep, and for reasons no one fully understands, corpses that enter the lake don't decompose. They sink to the bottom and stay there, preserved indefinitely.

### The Depths

Fishermen who've worked Deadman's Lake describe seeing bodies on the bottom in clear water—some recent, some ancient, all perfectly preserved. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands. Some appear to be victims of violence; others look like they simply lay down and drowned. A few wear armor and clothing styles that haven't been seen in centuries.

No one knows why the lake preserves the dead. Some theorize it's connected to the proximity of the White Wastes and whatever curse affects that region. Others suggest the lake sits on a minor void or time leyline that arrests decay. The locals don't speculate—they fish the lake because the fish are plentiful, and they don't swim in it because they're not stupid.

### Salt Tomb

On the western shore of Deadman's Lake stands the Salt Tomb—a burial structure made entirely of salt blocks, gleaming white against the dark water. The tomb predates any local memory; no one knows who built it or who (or what) is buried inside. The salt has not dissolved despite centuries of exposure to weather, which should be impossible.

The tomb is sealed. The few who've tried to break in have found the salt harder than stone, and the one expedition that tried tunneling underneath reported their tools corroding to rust within hours. Whatever's in the Salt Tomb, it's staying there.
