## Lyagnadarr Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A rugged mountain range on the eastern edge of the Sandreach Mountains system, forming the northern and western boundary of Siquestrya. The peaks here are lower than the Drystone Mountains to the west but no less treacherous—the slopes are riddled with caves, unstable scree fields, and sudden drop-offs concealed by scrub vegetation.

The Lyagnadarr Mountains are home to the Lyndwyrmspren—lesser draconic creatures that hunt in packs across the mountain slopes. These creatures make the range dangerous for casual travelers but are not the primary threat.

### Svorinthak's Domain

The dragon Svorinthak claims the central Lyagnadarr as her territory. Her presence casts a shadow over the entire range—the centaur tribes of Siquestrya give the mountains wide berth, and the Bazaar of Scales at the range's western edge operates only because Svorinthak permits it (or, more likely, finds it beneath her notice).

See the bestiary entry for Svorinthak for full details on this dragon.
