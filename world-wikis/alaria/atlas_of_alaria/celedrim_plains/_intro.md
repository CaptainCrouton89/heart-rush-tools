# Celedrim Plains

## Geography

The Celedrim Plains are a vast frozen steppe occupying the northeastern interior of Clueanda, positioned north of the Kharvorn Mountains and stretching eastward toward the Northern Isles. This is among the most desolate regions of the known world—an endless expanse of wind-scoured snow and ice.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Ocean of Azeros; mountains dot the coastline
- **South**: The Kharvorn Mountains form the southern boundary, their diagonal line running from northwest to southeast
- **West**: Transitions into the Northlands where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains meet
- **East**: Extends to the Ocean of Azeros and transitions into the Frostmarch Peninsula

### Terrain

The plains are distinctly flat and open—frozen steppe rather than glaciated terrain. Endless white expanses stretch to every horizon, broken only by the occasional rocky outcrop or wind-carved snow drift. Nothing stands to break the howling winds that sweep across the expanse.

### Notable Forests

Two significant forests cling to the southwestern margins of the plains, where they transition toward the Kharvorn Mountains:

- **Winterwood Forest**: Located in the southwestern portion of the plains, directly north of Argysis (one of the Kharvorn sub-ranges)
- **Plutochranes Forest**: Positioned north of Myorna (another Kharvorn sub-range), south of the main plains expanse, and west of the Frostmarch Peninsula
