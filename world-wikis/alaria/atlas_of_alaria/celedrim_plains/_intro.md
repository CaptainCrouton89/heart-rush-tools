# Celedrim Plains

## Geography

East of the Northlands stretches the Celedrim Plains—a vast frozen steppe covered in snow but distinctly flat and open. The lack of mountain textures indicates this is a frozen steppe or tundra rather than glaciated terrain. The plains seem to extend endlessly, with nothing to break the wind that sweeps across the expanse.
