## Pelmar Mountains

Tags: mountains

The Pelmar Mountains form the northeastern spur of the greater Kharvorn range, rising where the Celedrim Plains give way to the frozen approaches of the Nysanna Range. They serve as a transitional zone between the windswept grasslands to the south and the true arctic to the north—still bitterly cold, but not yet the killing ground of the higher peaks.

### Character

The Pelmars are lower and more weathered than either the Kharvorn proper or the Nysanna Range, their peaks rounded by millennia of wind and ice. Snow covers them year-round, but the passes remain navigable for most of the year—making them one of the few routes between the Celedrim Plains and the Northlands proper.

The mountains are honeycombed with caves, some natural and some carved by unknown hands in ages past. The Zwaeron use these caves as winter shelters during their migrations, and several of the larger cave systems have become semi-permanent waystation camps where dire wolf riders can rest, trade, and share news from across the frozen north.

### The Wind Gap

The primary pass through the Pelmar Mountains is known simply as the Wind Gap—a brutal corridor where the winds from the Northlands funnel through with enough force to knock a rider from their mount. Crossing the Gap requires timing; the Zwaeron know the wind patterns well enough to predict the brief lulls when passage is possible. Outsiders who attempt the crossing without local guidance often die, their bodies found frozen in the snow days or weeks later.

### Strategic Position

The Pelmars mark the boundary between the civilized reaches of the Celedrim Plains and the lawless frozen north. No nation claims them, though several have tried. The mountains are too harsh to hold, too remote to garrison, and anyone foolish enough to build a fortress there would find themselves fighting the weather more than any enemy.

This makes the Pelmars a natural refuge for those who don't want to be found—exiles, criminals, hermits, and those fleeing wars or debts in the south. Small communities of outcasts eke out a living in the caves, trading with the Zwaeron when they pass through and otherwise keeping to themselves.
