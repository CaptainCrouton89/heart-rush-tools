## The Watchtower

Tags: settlement, penal colony, mystery

A grim settlement clinging to a sheltered valley at the western edge of the Pelmar Mountains, visible from the approaches to Wind Gap. The Watchtower is not a place people choose to live—it is where the unwanted are sent to serve a sentence that never ends.

### Origins

Centuries ago, the lowland kingdoms faced a problem: criminals too dangerous to imprison, too politically inconvenient to execute, and too useful to simply kill. The solution was the Pelmar Sentence—exile to the frozen edge of the world, where escape meant death by exposure and survival meant a lifetime of suffering.

The first prisoners arrived in chains, dumped at the foot of the mountains with minimal supplies and a single instruction: *Watch the caves. Report anything that moves.*

No one told them what they were watching for. The wardens who knew died without passing on their knowledge. But the prisoners watched anyway, because watching was all they had.

### The Condemned

Over generations, the prisoners had children. The children had children. Now the Watchtower holds several thousand souls—the descendants of murderers, traitors, heretics, and political enemies—who have never known anywhere else. They call themselves the **Condemned**, and they have transformed their prison into something between a monastery and a fortress.

The Condemned do not consider themselves criminals. They are **Watchers**. Their ancestors' sins have been washed away by centuries of vigil. They are the guardians of something they do not understand, performing rituals they cannot explain, maintaining seals they cannot read.

### What They Guard

The deep caves beneath the Watchtower are sealed. Opening them is the one absolute law—the only crime still punishable by death (exposure in the wastes, technically, but the result is the same).

The elders speak of fragments:

- **The Breach**: Something opened here, long ago. Not a door exactly—more like a wound in the world. The first wardens sealed it, but seals weaken.
- **The Sleeper**: Something came through before the seal closed. It did not die. It is not alive. It waits.
- **The Anchor**: The Watchtower sits on a point where the barrier between planes grows thin—a secondary stress point related to the weakness at Top of the World. If the Watchtower falls, the membrane tears further.
- **The Sky Going Wrong**: The oldest texts speak of a night when the aurora descended to the ground and *walked*. The Condemned still watch the sky during strong auroras, ready to sound the bells.

Whether any of this is true, whether the vigil serves any purpose, whether the Condemned are heroes or fools—no one knows. The caves remain sealed. The Watchers remain at their posts. And something in the deep has not moved for a very long time.

### Daily Life

Life in the Watchtower is brutal, austere, and rigidly structured. Every adult takes shifts on the watch—four hours staring into the dark of the sealed cave entrances, four hours on the walls scanning the wastes, four hours of labor, four hours of rest. Children are raised communally and assigned to roles based on aptitude: Watchers, Keepers (who maintain the settlement), Seekers (who venture out for supplies), and Speakers (who preserve the fragmentary lore).

The Condemned trade with Zwaeron caravans for necessities they cannot produce—metal tools, certain medicines, news of the outside world. The Zwaeron find them unsettling but reliable. Payment is always exact. Promises are always kept. The Condemned have nothing else.

### The Bells

Seven great bells hang in the central tower, each with a different tone and meaning. Most have not been rung in living memory. The Condemned still know the codes:

- One bell: Caravan approaching
- Two bells: Storm warning
- Three bells: Outsiders at the gate
- Four bells: Breach in the walls
- Five bells: Movement in the caves
- Six bells: The sky is wrong
- Seven bells: *Run*

No one knows what would warrant seven bells. The elders say that if seven bells ring, there is nowhere to run to.

### Relations

The lowland kingdoms have largely forgotten the Watchtower exists. The original crime records were lost centuries ago. Occasionally a scholar or treasure-hunter arrives seeking entrance to the caves; they are turned away, forcibly if necessary.

The Zwaeron treat the Condemned with wary respect. They know the Watchtower guards something, even if they don't know what. Their oral histories include warnings about the place that predate the penal colony.

Hephake officially claims sovereignty over the region but has never attempted to enforce it. The dwarves are content to let the Condemned continue their vigil—better them than us.

### For Adventurers

The Watchtower offers grim hospitality to travelers crossing Wind Gap—shelter, food, and guidance through the pass in exchange for labor or trade goods. The Condemned ask few questions about visitors' pasts. They understand the value of not asking.

But they will not open the caves. For any price. For any reason. And they watch very carefully to ensure visitors don't try.
