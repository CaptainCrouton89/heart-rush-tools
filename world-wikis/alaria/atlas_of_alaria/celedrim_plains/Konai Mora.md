## Konai Mora

### Kona Morai

A massive, white expanse—freezing cold, miserable, and incredibly dangerous.

Home to Mythandrulve, similar to the chulpe, but all white, and similar to wolves. No heirarchy of control like with chulpe—just a pack. All of them are roughly same size—smaller than Terragones, but bigger than chulpe. Huge paws, can run on top of the snow.

Think "vampire wolf gnolls" for vibe.

### Blistering Mountains

A mountain range north of Konai Mora, marking the northern boundary of the icy tundra.

#### Solhalven

A city-state north of the Blistering Mountains, home to the valkyries. This remote settlement serves as the guardians of one of the most extraordinary structures in all of Alaria.

##### Starreach

A tower that extends all the way from the ground to the Astral plane itself. The valkyries of Solhalven have been cursed to guard Starreach from the angels Sarakiel and Xaphkiel, and they are bound to permit only certain chosen individuals to ascend the tower. The curse has transformed what might have been an honor into an eternal duty, and the valkyries stand watch over this bridge between worlds, never knowing rest.

### Yukum's Wall

Although not actually a wall, this mountain range is rife with giants, wyverns, snow spirits, and an eternal blizzard, making passing through so treacherous that it has almost never been done. Located on the east side of Konai Mora (basin plains surrounded by mountains in northeast all the way to southwest). Yukum's Wall is coastal mountains, separating Ceredrim Plains from the Northern Isles. To its north are the Blistering Mountains (contiguous with Yukum's Wall, volcanos).
