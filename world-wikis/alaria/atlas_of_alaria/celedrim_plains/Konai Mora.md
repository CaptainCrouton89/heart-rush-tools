## Konai Mora

### Kona Morai

A massive, white expanse—freezing cold, miserable, and incredibly dangerous.

Home to Mythandrulve, similar to the chulpe, but all white, and similar to wolves. No heirarchy of control like with chulpe—just a pack. All of them are roughly same size—smaller than Terragones, but bigger than chulpe. Huge paws, can run on top of the snow.

Think "vampire wolf gnolls" for vibe.

### Blistering Mountains

A mountain range north of Konai Mora, marking the northern boundary of the icy tundra.

#### Solhalven

A city-state north of the Blistering Mountains, home to the valkyries. This remote settlement serves as the guardians of one of the most extraordinary structures in all of Alaria.

##### Starreach

A tower that extends all the way from the ground to the Astral plane itself. The valkyries of Solhalven have been cursed to guard Starreach from the angels Sarakiel and Xaphkiel, and they are bound to permit only certain chosen individuals to ascend the tower. The curse has transformed what might have been an honor into an eternal duty, and the valkyries stand watch over this bridge between worlds, never knowing rest.

### Yukum's Wall

Although not actually a wall, this mountain range is rife with giants, wyverns, snow spirits, and an eternal blizzard, making passing through so treacherous that it has almost never been done. Located on the east side of Konai Mora (basin plains surrounded by mountains in northeast all the way to southwest). Yukum's Wall is coastal mountains, separating Celedrim Plains from the Northern Isles. To its north are the Blistering Mountains (contiguous with Yukum's Wall, volcanoes).

#### Forbidden Coast

The eastern shore of Konai Mora, where Yukum's Wall meets the Ocean of Azuros, is known as the Forbidden Coast. The name is not metaphorical—the Valkyries of Solhalven have declared this stretch of coastline off-limits to all travelers, and they enforce the prohibition with lethal force.

The reasons for this restriction are not publicly discussed. Some believe the coast hides an entrance to something the Valkyries guard besides Starreach. Others suggest that things emerge from the water here—things connected to whatever dwells in the depths of the frozen ocean. The Mythandrulve avoid the Forbidden Coast as well, which suggests the prohibition predates the Valkyries' arrival.

### Gümloskos

The northwestern peninsula of Konai Mora, jutting into the Ocean of Azuros north of Solhalven. Gümloskos is mountainous and wind-scoured, its peaks lower than the Blistering Mountains to the south but no less treacherous. This is the domain of Zosuun, the albino ice-fire dragon who has claimed the region since before recorded history.

The Valkyries maintain a careful neutrality with Zosuun. The dragon's hunting grounds overlap with their patrol routes, but neither party seems interested in conflict. Travelers seeking passage through Gümloskos are advised to move quickly and avoid camping in the open—Zosuun has been known to steal memories from those who linger in his territory.

### Shargon

The southern reaches of Konai Mora, where the frozen basin begins climbing toward the mountain ranges that ring the region. Shargon is marginally more hospitable than the central expanse—rocky outcrops provide some shelter from the wind, and the Mythandrulve rarely hunt this far from their preferred terrain.

Small bands of Neth make seasonal camps in Shargon, fishing the ice-locked lakes and hunting the hardier game that survives on the fringes. These camps are temporary—the Neth know better than to claim permanent territory in Konai Mora—but they've used the same sites for generations, leaving behind stone circles and cairns that mark safe camping spots.

### Bitterlands

South of Shargon, the terrain rises into a desolate expanse of rocky highlands, ice fields, and howling wind—the Bitterlands. This wasteland stretches between the frozen Konai Mora basin to the north and the Plutachranes forest to the south, with the Gorthe Hills marking its eastern edge.

The name is earned. Nothing grows here; nothing shelters here; nothing survives here for long except things adapted to the absolute worst conditions Alaria can offer. The Mythandrulve rarely venture this far south—their hunting grounds are the frozen basin proper—and the Jotun of the western hills have no reason to cross this barren stretch. The Bitterlands are dangerous not because of what hunts here, but because of the absolute emptiness. Travelers caught in the open have nothing: no shelter, no fuel, no landmarks, just wind and exposure.

Neth traders occasionally cross the Bitterlands when traveling between the western settlements near Sennos and the eastern coast at Soya Grei, but they do so quickly and in groups, following cairn-marked routes their ancestors established generations ago.

### Soya Grei

East of the Bitterlands, where the mountains curve toward the coast, lies Soya Grei—a peninsula of rocky highlands overlooking Soothesong Sound. The name means "grey fortress" in an old Neth dialect, though no fortress stands there now. If one ever did, it has been scoured away by the elements.

Soya Grei is notable for the unusual acoustic properties of its cliffs. The wind through the rock formations produces sounds that the Neth say are the voices of the dead singing to each other across the water. Soothesong Sound earned its name from these cliff-songs, which can be heard for miles on quiet nights.

### Jotunhills

Southwest of Konai Mora, the mountains give way to a range of rolling highlands home to the Jotun—smaller frost giants with cold attunement and remarkable regenerative abilities. The Jotun are cunning, carnivorous, and view frozen humans as both food and status symbols.

The Jotunhills are not a unified territory but rather a collection of clan holdings, each dominated by a patriarch or matriarch who maintains their position through a combination of strength, cunning, and accumulated wealth (measured in frozen corpses). The clans raid each other as readily as they raid outsiders, and the politics of Jotun society—such as it is—revolves around blood feuds, marriage alliances, and the endless competition for prestige.

Human settlements give the Jotunhills a wide berth. The Winterwood's northern edge provides some barrier, and the Zwaeron have learned which routes are safer than others, but Jotun raiding parties still occasionally sweep south to carry off prisoners. Those taken alive are kept frozen in the Jotun larders until needed—a fate the Neth consider worse than death.
