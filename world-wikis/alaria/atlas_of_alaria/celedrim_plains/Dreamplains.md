## Dreamplains

Tags: plains, tundra

The Dreamplains occupy the northwestern reaches of the Celedrim Plains, a vast expanse of frozen steppe notable for its strange atmosphere and the cluster of impact craters that scar its surface. The name comes from the unsettling quality of travel here—distances seem wrong, the horizon plays tricks, and travelers report dreams of vivid intensity during any sleep taken on the plains.

### Character

The Dreamplains are flatter and more featureless than the rest of the Celedrim Plains, which is saying something. The snow here has a peculiar blue-white quality, and sounds carry strangely—sometimes voices from miles away arrive as whispers, while nearby speech vanishes into silence. The Neth who pass through this region say the boundary between the Material Plane and Celestia grows thin here, though not as dramatically as at Top of the World. The spirits of the dead sometimes wander the Dreamplains, visible as faint shapes at the edge of vision, before completing their journey to the other side.

### The Impact Craters

Three massive craters punctuate the Dreamplains, remnants of an ancient cataclysm when objects fell from the sky in the distant past. Whether these were meteors, fragments of the Astral Plane, or something else entirely remains debated by scholars.

#### Predatak

The largest of the three craters, Predatak holds a deep lake of startlingly blue water that never freezes despite the temperatures. The crater walls rise steeply around the lake, creating a natural amphitheater. Something lives in the depths—the Zwaeron refuse to camp within sight of Predatak, and their stories speak of shapes moving beneath the surface on moonless nights.

The lake water has unusual properties. Those who drink it report their dreams becoming prophetic for several nights afterward—though the visions are often symbolic and difficult to interpret. Mages who study divination sometimes make pilgrimages here, though the journey is perilous.

#### Nisk

The smallest crater, Nisk, is dry—its bowl filled with frost-shattered stone rather than water. The crater floor is littered with fragments of a dark metalite that doesn't match any known ore. Some of these fragments are warm to the touch regardless of temperature, and a few have been recovered and traded south where artificers pay handsomely for them.

The Neth say Nisk is where a star fell and died. They leave offerings at the crater's rim—small carvings, braided grass, tokens of remembrance—though they won't explain who or what they're honoring.

#### Emtus

Emtus is the strangest of the three. The crater exists, unmistakably, but something about it resists perception. Travelers who approach find themselves walking past it, around it, their attention sliding away. Mapping expeditions have tried to chart its interior and returned with contradictory results—some claiming it's shallow and empty, others insisting it contains ruins, still others unable to remember reaching it at all.

Whatever fell at Emtus didn't just impact the ground. It may have impacted reality itself.

### Hills of the Lost

South of the craters, where the Dreamplains begin transitioning toward the Winterwood, a range of low hills breaks the flatness. The Hills of the Lost earned their name honestly—travelers who enter them often emerge days later, miles from where they expected, with hazy memories of the intervening time.

The hills are not inherently malevolent, but something about their geography defies normal navigation. Compasses spin, the sun seems to move wrong, and familiar landmarks rearrange themselves. The Zwaeron have mapped safe paths through, but these paths change with the seasons, and even experienced guides sometimes lose their way.

Those who spend too long lost in the hills sometimes return... changed. Quieter. Seeing things others can't. The Neth call them "touched by the between" and treat them with a mixture of reverence and wariness.

### Wolfspine

At the southern edge of the Dreamplains, the Wolfspine rises—a small mountain range that marks the boundary between the open steppe and the forested regions to the south. The peaks are jagged and bare, resembling (as the name suggests) the spine of some enormous creature. The Zwaeron use the Wolfspine as a landmark and waystation, and several semi-permanent camps exist in the sheltered valleys between peaks.

Dire wolves den in the Wolfspine in unusual numbers, which is why the Zwaeron favor it—this is where they find and bond with new companions when their current mounts die. The wolves here are larger and fiercer than those elsewhere, and some Zwaeron believe the strange energies of the Dreamplains have affected them over generations.
