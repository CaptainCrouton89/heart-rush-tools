## Deaddorf Strait

Tags: sea

The name of the strait comes from a misspelling of a description of the strait: dead-dwarves. This strait sees the most dwarven deaths while in transport to Kyagos, and their bodies are thrown overboard. On occasion, the bodies can be thick enough to cause mile long stretches of open sea to smell of rotten flesh.
