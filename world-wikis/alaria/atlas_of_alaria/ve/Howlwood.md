## Howlwood

Tags: forest, geography, edari, ve

A dense forest sprawling across northeastern Edari, where the golden savannah gives way to thick woodland near the coast of Coquray Sound. The forest earned its name from the eerie howling that echoes through the trees at night—a sound that carries for miles across the surrounding grassland.

### Character

Howlwood is darker and cooler than the surrounding savannah, its canopy thick enough to block the harsh Ve sun. The trees are ancient, their trunks wide enough for several people to hide behind, their roots tangled and treacherous. Undergrowth is sparse where the canopy is densest, but clearings and edges are choked with thorny brush.

The forest feels old in a way the savannah doesn't. The Korel hunt its edges but won't go deep.

### The Howling

The sound comes from **wind-singers**—massive, solitary apes that claim territories deep within the forest. Each adult stands eight to ten feet tall, covered in dark fur that blends perfectly with the shadows under the canopy. They're nocturnal, emerging at dusk to hunt and patrol their domains.

The "howling" is territorial communication. Each wind-singer maintains a territory of several square miles and calls nightly to warn neighbors away. The calls carry extraordinary distances—a quirk of the forest's acoustics amplifies them, sending the sound rolling across the savannah like distant thunder. Multiple wind-singers calling creates the eerie, almost musical quality that gives the forest its name.

Wind-singers are apex predators. They hunt by ambush, dropping from branches onto prey below. A single wind-singer can kill a leopard; a Korel hunting party that wanders into one's territory rarely returns intact. The Korel learned this lesson generations ago. They hunt the forest's edges, take what game strays out, and don't push deeper. Pride isn't worth dying for.

The creatures are fiercely territorial toward each other as well. They don't form groups. Encounters between wind-singers typically end in one retreating or dying. This limits their population—Howlwood supports perhaps two dozen adults at any time—but makes each one extraordinarily dangerous within its domain.

### Why It Matters

Howlwood is one of the few places in Edari where the Korel aren't the apex predator. Travelers who think "the Korel avoid it, so it must be safe" have the situation exactly backwards. The forest offers no safe passage—only a choice between leopard-folk who might let you live and giant apes who definitely won't.

The forest also blocks the most direct overland route from Coquray Sound to the interior, funneling any movement around its edges—right through Korel territory.
