## Hardshell Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, ve, krell

A diagonal range running through the northern Krell Lands, the Hardshell Mountains are the insectoid heartland—the most densely populated Krell territory on Ve. Multiple queens have carved their hives into these peaks, their tunnels extending miles beneath the surface.

### Geography

The Hardshells run roughly northeast to southwest for about eighty miles, rising from the jungle floor to peaks exceeding six thousand feet. The range gets its name from the mineral composition of its rock—dense metalite deposits give the mountains a shell-like iridescence when struck by sunlight, and the stone itself resists erosion to an unusual degree.

The terrain is rugged. Cliffs, gorges, and knife-ridge peaks make surface travel difficult even without the Krell presence. Streams cascade down from the heights, feeding Snakemarsh to the south and eventually reaching Meadow Sound.

### The Hives

The Hardshells host the largest concentration of Krell hives on the continent. At least five major queens maintain territory here, their domains separated by natural barriers and the scars of ancient territorial wars.

**The Mother of Shells** — The largest hive occupies the central Hardshells, ruled by a queen whose soldiers are distinguished by unusually thick carapaces. This hive alone is estimated at over two hundred thousand individuals. The Mother has held her territory for at least three human generations.

**The Burrower** — A queen whose hive specializes in tunneling. Her workers have excavated an underground network that extends well beyond the mountains, possibly reaching as far as the Suki Hills. Yuki's burner teams have collapsed dozens of her tunnels over the years.

**The Clutch Sisters** — An unusual arrangement where three smaller queens maintain cooperative territories in the southern Hardshells. Whether this represents a genuine alliance or simply queens too weak to destroy each other remains unclear.

### The Hive Wars

Krell queens compete for territory, resources, and genetic supremacy. When conflict erupts between hives, the battles can devastate entire valleys. Millions of Krell have died in these wars over the centuries—their chitin fields littering the mountain slopes, slowly being reclaimed by jungle growth.

These internal conflicts are the main reason the Krell haven't swept westward. The queens spend more energy fighting each other than expanding. Yuki's strategists actively monitor hive politics, hoping to identify patterns that might predict when a queen will turn her attention outward.

### What Remains

Before the Consumption, the Hardshells were home to mining communities, trading posts, and at least one small kingdom. These settlements were among the first to fall when the Krell arrived. Their ruins dot the mountains—empty towns, collapsed mine entrances, the occasional fortress still visible on defensible peaks.

The Krell ignore these structures. They have no use for buildings designed for creatures with different body plans. The ruins stand as they fell, preserved by the dry mountain air, occasionally explored by treasure hunters willing to risk the hive territories.

**Irongate** — The largest pre-Krell settlement, once a mining center controlling access to the metalite deposits. Its walls still stand on a mountain saddle, its gates still closed. No one has entered in over two centuries.

### The Metalite

The Hardshells contain rich deposits of metalite—a mineral prized for its resonance properties. Metalite alloys hold enchantments longer and more stably than standard metals, making them valuable for magical item construction.

The Krell don't mine metalite. They don't use metal at all. But they've incorporated the substance into their hives regardless—metalite threads through many tunnel walls, and some soldiers have carapaces with a distinctive metallic sheen. Whether they're absorbing the mineral incidentally or deliberately remains debated.

Regardless, Hardshell metalite commands extraordinary prices. A single pound is worth more than most laborers earn in a year. This has driven countless expeditions into the mountains, most of which don't return.

### Approaching the Hardshells

The Shell Road from the Suki Hills provides the most direct approach, following a river valley into the range's western foothills. This route passes close to the Burrower's territory—travelers must watch for tunnel entrances and scout patrols.

An alternate approach from the south passes through Snakemarsh, avoiding the densest hive concentrations but adding days of travel through difficult wetlands. Most expeditions choose the faster, more dangerous route.

The eastern approaches are rarely used. The terrain is worse, the hives more active, and there's no clear path back to friendly territory if things go wrong.
