## Red Desert

Tags: desert, geography, ve, sestros

The arid northern reaches of Sestros, where iron-rich sands glow crimson at sunset and nothing grows for months at a time. The Red Desert is technically part of the kingdom, but no one lives there permanently. It's too hot, too dry, too empty.

### Geography

The Red Desert covers roughly 400 square miles of northern Sestros, bounded by the Shepherds' Stones to the north, the savannah grasslands to the south, and the coast to the west. The terrain is mostly flat, broken by occasional rock outcroppings and dry wadis that flood briefly during the winter rains.

The sand itself is distinctive—high iron content gives it a rust-red color that intensifies as the sun sets, creating spectacular displays that travelers remember long after the heat and thirst fade from memory.

### Climate

Brutal in summer. Temperatures exceed what unprotected humans can survive for extended periods. The Shailin who venture into the desert do so in winter, following the brief rainy season when seasonal grasses attract their flocks. By late spring, everyone has retreated south.

Water exists but is scarce. A few permanent springs emerge from the rock near the Shepherds' Stones, and shallow wells can tap groundwater in certain locations. Knowing where to find water is the difference between crossing the desert and dying in it.

### Inhabitants

None permanent. Seasonal shepherds follow the winter grasses. Occasional traders cut through the desert's edge rather than taking the longer route around. Prospectors sometimes search for mineral deposits, though the heat makes sustained mining operations impractical.

The ruins of Lurza sit at the desert's western edge, but no one goes there. See [Shepherds' Stones](./Shepherds' Stones.md) for why.

### Significance

The Red Desert serves as a buffer zone. It separates the settled portions of Sestros from the Korel territory beyond the Shepherds' Stones, adding another obstacle to any would-be invader from the north. Not that the Korel organize invasions—but if they ever did, they'd have to cross the desert first.

The desert also limits Sestros's northern expansion. The Shailin could theoretically push into the foothills of the Shepherds' Stones, but why bother? Talresses teaches contentment. The grasslands provide everything they need.
