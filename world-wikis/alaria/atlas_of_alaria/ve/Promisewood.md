## Promisewood

Tags: forest, geography, ve, avalon

The largest forest in Avalon, dominating the southern reaches of the kingdom where the land rises toward the Widebarrow Mountains. The name refers to the **Declarations**—the promises made to Temptari children at age eight that determine their life's path. Those declared for forestry, hunting, or druidic work spend their training decades in Promisewood's depths.

### Geography

Promisewood covers over 200 square miles of southern Avalon, a mix of deciduous and evergreen forest that thickens as elevation increases toward the mountains. The northern edges are managed—logging operations, hunting grounds, training camps—while the deep interior remains wild and largely unvisited.

The **Pale Run** river flows through the forest's heart, draining toward the systems that eventually reach Chimea. The river valley creates a natural corridor through the woods, but the corridor is controlled; not everyone may use it.

### The Training Grounds

Deep Promisewood contains the camps where young Temptari spend their formative decades. Children declared for forest-related paths—rangers, druids, hunters, foresters, herbalists—are brought here at age eight and don't emerge until their training is complete.

What happens during those years varies by path. Foresters learn to harvest sustainably, reading the forest's cycles to take only what can be replaced. Hunters learn tracking, ambush, and the ethics of killing. Druids learn something else entirely, and they don't discuss it with outsiders.

The training camps are not marked on any map. Finding them requires a guide, and guides are assigned only to those with business there.

### Restricted Access

Casual visitors are not welcome in deep Promisewood. The forest's edge is open—travelers can pass through on established paths, hunters can take game with appropriate permissions—but venturing off-path or pressing south brings increasing warnings, then confrontation, then (allegedly) disappearance.

The priests say this is for visitors' protection. The forest contains the kingdom's future soldiers, its future rangers, its future spiritual leaders. Disturbing their training disrupts the Ecclesiarch's designs.

Critics suggest other reasons: the training methods might disturb outsiders, or the children might be disturbed by contact with the outside world, or the priests simply enjoy having territory where ordinary rules don't apply.

### Connection to Chimea

Promisewood's southern reaches approach Chimean territory. The forest doesn't stop at the border; it merges into Chimea's jungle-edge woodlands through a contested zone where neither kingdom maintains clear control. Smugglers sometimes use the forest routes to move goods between Avalon and Chimea without passing through official channels.

The Ecclesiarch presumably knows about this. He hasn't ordered it stopped, which the priests interpret as tacit acceptance—the smuggling must serve some purpose in his visions.
