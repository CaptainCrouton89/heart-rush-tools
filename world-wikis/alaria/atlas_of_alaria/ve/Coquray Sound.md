## Coquray Sound

Tags: sound, geography, water

The empty arm.

Coquray Sound is the western inlet of Turquish Bay, a long, narrow body of water that penetrates deep into the coastline west of Droughd Sound. Despite its sheltered waters and defensible position, Coquray Sound hosts no permanent settlements—an oddity that various explanations fail to fully account for.

### Geography

Coquray Sound stretches roughly twenty miles inland, narrower than Droughd Sound but deeper, its waters reaching sixty feet in places. The shoreline is rocky, with steep cliffs along the eastern edge and lower, marshy ground to the west where the sound approaches Sestros territory.

The sound's mouth opens to Turquish Bay between two prominent headlands. In theory, this creates an ideal harbor—defensible, sheltered from storms, with deep water for large vessels. In practice, no one has built there.

### Why It's Empty

Several explanations circulate:

**The Currents**: Coquray Sound has unusual water patterns. Currents flow unpredictably, changing direction without warning. Ships anchoring overnight sometimes find themselves dragged toward the cliffs despite secure moorings. Experienced sailors call the sound "treacherous" and avoid it when possible.

**The Depths**: Fishermen report the sound is deeper than soundings suggest—that instruments sometimes fail to find bottom where charts show forty feet of water. Whether this reflects actual depth variations or equipment malfunction remains unclear. Stories of things in the deep are common but unsubstantiated.

**The Claim**: Sestros technically claims Coquray Sound as part of its territorial waters, though they've never established presence there. Some believe Sestros deliberately keeps the sound empty as a potential naval staging area—somewhere ships could gather unobserved before operations elsewhere. If so, they've never used it for that purpose.

**The Practical**: Most likely, Coquray Sound is simply inconvenient. It leads nowhere valuable—no river connection, no inland resources worth accessing, no reason to build there when Droughd Sound serves perfectly well. Empty land stays empty when there's no profit in filling it.

### Current Use

Coquray Sound sees occasional traffic—ships seeking shelter from storms, smugglers looking for privacy, fishermen working waters their competitors avoid. None stay long. The sound has a reputation, deserved or not, and reputation shapes behavior.

Sestros naval vessels patrol the area irregularly, asserting the claim no one contests because no one cares enough to contest it. These patrols report nothing unusual. The sound remains empty, and no one seems motivated to change that.
