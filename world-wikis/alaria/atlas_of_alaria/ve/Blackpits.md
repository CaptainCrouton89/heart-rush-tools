## Blackpits

Tags: swamp, geography, ve

A sprawling swamp in the north-central Dygon Beastlands, where dark water pools beneath a broken canopy and the dead do not always stay dead. The Blackpits occupy the lowest ground in the region—a basin where runoff from the surrounding jungle collects in stagnant pools of water so dark it reflects nothing.

The swamp stretches roughly sixty miles east to west and forty miles north to south, fed by seasonal flooding from a dozen streams that drain into the basin but never seem to drain out. Where the water goes is unclear; Ix'Meglyakuk legends speak of underground rivers, of water that descends to feed something far below.

### The Waters

The Blackpits take their name from the water itself. The pools are opaque—not merely dark but *lightless*, absorbing rather than reflecting. A torch held over the water illuminates nothing below the surface. Divers report that visibility drops to zero within inches of submersion.

**Composition:** The water is heavily saturated with tannins from decaying vegetation, iron compounds from the soil, and something else—a substance alchemists have failed to identify. It's not poisonous to drink, merely foul-tasting. Prolonged skin contact causes temporary numbness. Wounds exposed to it heal slowly and scar badly.

**Depth:** Most pools are shallow—waist-deep or less—but the "pits" proper are different. Scattered throughout the swamp are sinkholes of unknown depth, their edges indistinguishable from the surrounding shallows until you step into one. The Ix'Meglyakuk mark the known pits with specific warnings, but new ones open periodically, and the old markers sometimes move.

**What Lives There:** The waters host things adapted to lightless hunting. Giant eels that sense vibration. Crustaceans with crushing claws and no eyes. Fish with bioluminescent lures that draw prey close before striking. And the remains of things that drowned—preserved by the water's unusual chemistry, sometimes rising again.

### The Preserved Dead

Bodies that enter the Blackpits do not decay normally. The water's composition arrests decomposition, leaving corpses preserved for years or decades. This would be merely macabre if it stopped there.

It doesn't.

**The Risen:** Periodically—most commonly during the wet season, when water levels peak—preserved corpses animate. They rise from the pools and walk, driven by something that isn't quite undeath and isn't quite life. The Ix'Meglyakuk call them *Thekk-Morru*, which translates roughly to "the ones who forgot they died."

The Risen are not intelligent. They don't hunt or fight with purpose. They simply... move, wandering the swamp until they encounter the living, at which point they attack with whatever reflexes remain. Most are easily avoided or destroyed. But the sheer number of bodies the Blackpits have accumulated over millennia means a wet-season rising can involve hundreds of Thekk-Morru emerging simultaneously.

**Origins Unknown:** What causes the animation is debated. Some scholars propose a unique necromantic phenomenon tied to the water's composition. Others believe the Blackpits sit on a weak point between the Material Plane and Malstaris, allowing shadow-energy to seep through. The Ix'Meglyakuk have a simpler explanation: the swamp is hungry, and the Risen are its way of feeding.

### The Bone Beds

Beneath the water, the Blackpits hold a graveyard spanning epochs.

The swamp has been a natural trap for millions of years. Creatures wandered in and never left. Their bones accumulated, layer upon layer, creating beds of fossil remains preserved by the same chemistry that keeps corpses from rotting. These bone beds are visible in places where seasonal water recession exposes the underlying sediment—masses of skeletal remains, species layered atop species, a record of everything that ever died here.

**Paleontological Value:** Scholars would kill for access to the bone beds. The Blackpits contain specimens found nowhere else—transitional forms, extinct megafauna, creatures that predate the current geological era. A single expedition could rewrite understanding of Ve's ancient history.

**Practical Barriers:** The Ix'Meglyakuk prohibit excavation. The waters are dangerous. The Risen attack intruders. And something about disturbing the bone beds seems to trigger increased Thekk-Morru activity, as if the swamp notices when its dead are molested.

### The Ix'Meglyakuk of the Blackpits

A few tribes make their home in the swamp, occupying the scattered patches of higher ground that remain above water year-round. These *Thekk-uli* (swamp-dwellers) are distinct from their jungle-dwelling kin.

**Adaptation:** Thekk-uli have developed webbed feet and hands, allowing them to swim through the dark waters with uncanny ease. Their scales have darkened to near-black, providing camouflage. They hunt by sound and vibration, their eyes almost vestigial in the lightless pools.

**The Risen-Hunters:** Thekk-uli specialize in controlling the Thekk-Morru. They've developed techniques for putting the Risen down quickly, for predicting when risings will occur, and—controversially—for directing the Risen against enemies. Other Ix'Meglyakuk view this last practice as abomination. The Thekk-uli view it as survival.

**Isolation:** Like the Blyss tribes, the Thekk-uli have minimal contact with the outside world. They attend no gatherings, trade with no outsiders, and respond to intrusion with violence. Their numbers are unknown; estimates suggest perhaps two thousand individuals scattered across the swamp.

### Locations

#### The Central Pit

The largest sinkhole in the Blackpits—a near-perfect circle roughly a quarter-mile across, filled with water that testing ropes have never found the bottom of. The Ix'Meglyakuk consider it sacred and forbidden. They do not approach it, do not fish near it, and kill outsiders who try to investigate.

Local legend holds that the Central Pit connects directly to the underworld—that the water descends through miles of stone to somewhere else entirely. Some stories name this destination as Malstaris. Others speak of a buried city older than life on Ve. The Thekk-uli say only that the Central Pit is *Thekk-Gor*, "the throat," and refuse to elaborate.

**The Sounds:** Those who've camped near the Central Pit—against all advice—report sounds from below. Not the gurgling of water or the calls of swamp creatures, but rhythmic pulses, like breathing or heartbeats, slow and vast. The sounds are clearest just before dawn.

#### The Strangler's Reach

A peninsula of relatively dry ground extending into the swamp's northern section, where a grove of massive trees has developed a unique hunting strategy. The trees—species unknown, found nowhere else—have root systems that extend into the water for hundreds of feet, sensitive to vibration. When prey wades near, the roots rise, wrap, and drag.

The Strangler's Reach provides the only navigable path through the northern Blackpits, assuming travelers stay exactly on the central ridge where the roots cannot reach. Straying left or right by more than a few feet means being dragged under by gripping tendrils.

The Thekk-uli use the Reach as a defensive barrier. Enemies attempting to approach from the north must traverse a quarter-mile of trees that actively hunt them, while the Thekk-uli wait on the far side to deal with survivors.

#### Thekk-Valori

The largest Thekk-uli settlement, built on an island of raised ground in the swamp's center. Perhaps five hundred lizardfolk live here, in structures of woven reeds and preserved wood, raising their young and training the Risen-hunters who keep the surrounding waters clear.

Thekk-Valori is the closest thing the Blackpits have to a capital. The island hosts the tribal councils that make collective decisions, the breeding grounds for the community's utahraptors (adapted to swimming rather than land-running), and the bone-shrines where the Thekk-uli honor their ancestors.

Outsiders are not welcome. The few who've been allowed to visit describe a community living in uncomfortable intimacy with death—Risen corpses stored in underwater cages for later use, children playing games that involve navigating past restrained Thekk-Morru, elders whose own bodies have begun the partial preservation that comes from lifelong immersion in the black waters.

### Threats and Opportunities

**The Bone Bed Expedition:** A wealthy collector in Shyona will pay a fortune for specimens from the Blackpits bone beds. Specifically, they want a complete skeleton of a *Thyrak-ossi*—a creature mentioned in ancient texts but never documented, supposedly preserved somewhere in the central swamp. The collector provides equipment, guides to the swamp's edge, and promises of wealth. What they don't provide is Thekk-uli permission, knowledge of the Risen, or any realistic plan for surviving the attempt.

**The Central Pit:** Something has changed at the Central Pit. The sounds are louder. The water level is dropping. The Thekk-uli are scared—scared enough to have sent a messenger to the outer tribes for the first time in generations. They're asking for help. They won't say with what.

**Risen Overflow:** The last wet season saw the largest Thekk-Morru rising in living memory—thousands of corpses animating simultaneously, spilling out of the swamp into the surrounding jungle. Most were destroyed or wandered off to collapse, but the event has the Ix'Meglyakuk worried. Something is changing in the Blackpits. The risings are getting worse, and no one knows why.

**The Thekk-uli War:** A faction within the Thekk-uli has begun using Risen against rival tribes outside the swamp. The practice is spreading—and other Ix'Meglyakuk are organizing to stop it. The swamp-dwellers are outnumbered, but they control the Blackpits, and anyone trying to assault Thekk-Valori will have to cross miles of territory where the dead rise to defend their masters.
