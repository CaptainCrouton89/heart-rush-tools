## Belanora

Tags: region, hills, geography, ve

A rugged hill country along the western edge of Meadow Sound, separating the coastal waters from the interior jungles. The Belanora hills rise abruptly from the lowlands, their eastern faces forming dramatic cliffs that overlook Belanorn Bay and the sound beyond.

### Geography

The Belanora hills run roughly north-south for perhaps sixty miles, reaching elevations of several hundred feet above the surrounding terrain. The western slopes descend gradually into dense jungle, their ridges forested with hardwoods distinct from the lowland vegetation. The eastern slopes are steeper, in places nearly vertical where the hills meet the water.

The hills create a natural barrier between the Misery River watershed and Meadow Sound. Only a few passes allow easy transit between the interior and the coast, making Belanora strategically important despite its sparse population.

### Character

Unlike the grief-soaked jungle to the west, Belanora feels merely melancholic. The Misery River's influence doesn't penetrate the hills with the same intensity—the elevation and the rocky substrate seem to filter it somewhat. Residents describe the mood as "thoughtful rather than despairing."

The hills themselves are beautiful in a subdued way. Morning mists cling to the valleys. Wildflowers bloom in brief, colorful bursts during the wet season. The views from the eastern ridges—looking out over Belanorn Bay and Meadow Sound—are genuinely stunning, even if observers find themselves contemplating loss and regret while admiring them.

### Inhabitants

Belanora has long served as a refuge for those unwilling to live fully under any established authority. Outlaws, exiles, deserters, and hermits find homes in the hill country's scattered settlements. No formal government exists. Communities police themselves through reputation and the understanding that everyone here has reasons for being hard to find.

The population is small and dispersed. A few hundred people at most occupy the entire region, living in isolated homesteads or tiny villages of a dozen families. They trade with Tearfall and the other coastal settlements, offering hill products—timber, medicinal plants, small game—in exchange for salt, metal goods, and news.

Relations with Locquine are complicated. The pixies occasionally send emissaries into Belanora, seeking things the hill-dwellers can provide—metals they don't work, foods they don't grow. These exchanges happen according to rules the pixies set and the hill-folk have learned to follow, mostly. Belanora has lost people to Locquine's unpredictable violence, but has also profited from the trade when it goes well.

### The Hill Roads

A network of trails winds through Belanora, connecting the scattered settlements and linking the coast to the interior. These paths are unmarked and unmapped—knowing them requires local guidance or years of personal experience. Outsiders who attempt to navigate Belanora without help typically get lost, sometimes fatally.

The most important route is the **Mourner's Path**, which connects Tearfall on Belanorn Bay to the edge of Locquine territory. Traders and explorers use this trail to approach the pixie city-state while minimizing their time on the Misery River itself. It takes three days on foot, winding through the hill passes before descending into the jungle.

### Why It Matters

Belanora is the gateway to Locquine. Anyone seeking to trade with the pixies, explore the Misery River watershed, or investigate the source of the river's grief must pass through these hills. The hill-folk have leveraged this position into a modest economy of guiding, provisioning, and information-selling.

The region also serves as a buffer. Whatever has afflicted the Misery River watershed, the Belanora hills seem to contain it. The melancholy doesn't spread beyond the hills to the same degree. Shyonan authorities have occasionally proposed establishing outposts in Belanora to better monitor the interior, but the hill-folk's resistance and the region's difficult terrain have prevented any serious efforts.
