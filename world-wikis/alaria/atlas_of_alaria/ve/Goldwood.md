## Goldwood

Tags: forest, geography, ve, avalon

A sacred forest in western Avalon, between the settled heartland and Munari Inlet. The trees here have distinctive golden-yellow bark that catches afternoon light, making the forest seem to glow from within. The Temptari consider Goldwood sacred to the aspect of time governing autumn and endings.

### Character

Goldwood covers roughly 80 square miles of western Avalon, spreading from the coastal hills to the edge of the Honor River valley. The dominant trees are a species found nowhere else on Ve—tall hardwoods with smooth, golden bark and leaves that turn brilliant orange in autumn. Even in other seasons, the bark retains its warm color.

The forest floor is carpeted with fallen leaves that decompose slowly, building up into a soft, rustling layer that muffles footsteps. Light filters through the canopy in golden shafts. The overall effect is one of perpetual late afternoon, even at midday.

### Religious Significance

Pilgrims visit Goldwood to contemplate mortality and endings. The forest represents the final season of life, the time when work is done and harvest gathered, when what remains is reflection and rest. Elderly Temptari often make a final pilgrimage here, walking among the golden trees before returning home to await death.

Small shrines dot the forest's edge, maintained by priests who help pilgrims interpret what they experience among the trees. Deeper in, the forest is left wild—the priests say the dying need no guides in their final season.

### Practical Use

Despite its sacred status, Goldwood is not forbidden territory. Logging operations work the northern edges, harvesting the golden-barked trees for furniture and ritual implements. The wood is prized for its color and durability; items made from Goldwood timber are considered auspicious for elderly owners.

The forest also provides game, nuts, and medicinal plants. Temptari declared for forestry spend part of their training here, learning to take from the forest without diminishing it.

### Location

Goldwood lies between the main population centers and Munari Inlet, roughly 30 miles west of Tarolin. The main road to Ismail skirts its northern edge.
