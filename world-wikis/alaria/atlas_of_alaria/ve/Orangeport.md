## Orangeport

Tags: town, settlement, port

The most corrupt town in Ve, and proud of it.

Orangeport squats at the mouth of the Golden River where it empties into Droughd Sound, a chaotic sprawl of docks, warehouses, taverns, and establishments catering to sailors with money to spend. Every dose of Orange Flake that leaves the Dunes of Evioli passes through here. That fact has shaped everything about the town: its wealth, its politics, its complete moral flexibility.

### The Free Port

Orangeport is technically independent—a "free port" governed by its own laws, beholden to no nation. In practice, this means it's beholden to everyone with enough money or muscle to matter.

The town is governed by a **Harbormaster**, elected every three years by a council of ship captains and merchant houses who maintain permanent presence in the port. The current Harbormaster is **Venn Kolosi**, a former Shyonan merchant captain who has held the position for two consecutive terms by being slightly less corrupt than the alternatives.

The Harbormaster's actual power is limited. Real authority in Orangeport belongs to whoever can pay for it that particular day. The position exists mainly to maintain enough order that ships keep coming—and to serve as a convenient point of contact for the various powers trying to influence the town.

### The Interested Parties

Everyone wants Orangeport. No one can take it without the others objecting. The result is a perpetual cold war fought with bribes, blackmail, and occasional violence.

**Gnotobi's Harvest Council**: The Council would dearly love to control Orangeport directly. Every shipment of Orange Flake passes through here; controlling the port would eliminate tariffs, secure their supply line, and cut out the middlemen. But the Council has never united long enough to conquer the town, and doing so would provoke Shyona and Sestros into action. Instead, they maintain extensive bribery networks, "suggest" policies to the Harbormaster, and ensure that Orange Flake shipments receive priority treatment.

**Shyona**: The great state to the east officially disapproves of the drug trade while profiting enormously from taxing it. Shyona maintains a permanent trade delegation in Orangeport that exists primarily to ensure their cut of every transaction. They would object strenuously to Gnotobi or Sestros taking direct control.

**Sestros**: The western state has less direct interest in Orange Flake but resents being cut out of the region's most profitable trade. Sestros sponsors smuggling operations that bypass Orangeport entirely, carrying product overland to alternate markets. They maintain agents in town to monitor the competition and occasionally sabotage rivals.

**Criminal Syndicates**: Where there's money, there's organized crime. Multiple syndicates operate in Orangeport, some local, some with foreign backing. They handle the services the official economy won't acknowledge: smuggling, theft, murder-for-hire, and the town's extensive prostitution trade. The syndicates have an understanding with the Harbormaster—they keep violence off the main streets, and he doesn't look too closely at their operations.

**Independent Operators**: Pirates, smugglers, and opportunists of every stripe pass through Orangeport. The town asks no questions about cargo origins, making it ideal for fencing stolen goods or moving contraband.

### The Droughd Sound Tariff

Ships entering or leaving Droughd Sound pay a "navigation fee" that funds Orangeport's government (and lines various pockets). The rate varies depending on cargo, flag, and how well the captain knows the right people.

Who actually collects this tariff is a source of constant negotiation. Officially, it's the Harbormaster's office. In practice, Gnotobi's agents often waive fees for their own shipments, Shyona's delegation demands their percentage, and everyone else pays according to their leverage.

The system is transparently corrupt. It also works, after a fashion. Ships keep coming because Orangeport is still cheaper than the alternatives, and the chaos creates opportunities for those clever enough to exploit it.

### Layout and Character

Orangeport has no walls, no plan, and no pretensions. Buildings sprawl along the waterfront in whatever configuration their builders could afford, creating a maze of crooked streets and narrow alleys. The docks are the town's heart: long wooden piers extending into Droughd Sound, perpetually crowded with vessels of every size and origin.

**The Wet Quarter**: The dockside district, named for its tendency to flood during storms. Cheap taverns, cheaper lodging, and establishments offering services polite society pretends don't exist. Sailors spend their pay here; locals avoid it after dark.

**Merchant's Row**: The slightly more respectable commercial district, home to trading houses, warehouses, and the offices of the various factions competing for influence. The Harbormaster's Hall anchors the northern end.

**The Narrows**: A dense residential district where workers, small traders, and the town's permanent underclass live packed together. Crime is common; the watch rarely visits.

**The Bluffs**: Higher ground overlooking the harbor, where the wealthy maintain homes away from the smell and chaos of the waterfront. Some Harvest Council families keep residences here to oversee their shipping interests directly.

### What You Can Buy

Anything.

Orangeport's markets deal openly in goods that would be contraband elsewhere. Orange Flake is sold in dedicated shops (taxed, theoretically). Stolen cargo from across Ve finds buyers. Weapons, poisons, forged documents, information about shipping schedules—if it exists and someone will pay for it, Orangeport has a vendor.

The slave trade is officially prohibited. Unofficially, "indentured labor contracts" change hands regularly, and no one examines the consent of the contracted too closely.

### Relations

**Gnotobi**: The source of Orangeport's prosperity and its greatest threat to independence. The Harvest Council's money flows through every level of town government, but their failure to unite prevents direct takeover. For now.

**Keshwindi**: Goldwatch mercenaries are a common sight, escorting shipments from Gnotobi. They spend money, keep to themselves, and cause less trouble than most armed groups passing through.

**Shyona**: The elephant in the room. Shyona could crush Orangeport militarily but tolerates its independence because controlling the town would mean taking responsibility for the drug trade. Easier to condemn from a distance while collecting taxes.

**Sestros**: Competitors and occasional partners. Sestros-backed smugglers use Orangeport as a base while working against Gnotobi's interests. The contradictions don't seem to bother anyone.
