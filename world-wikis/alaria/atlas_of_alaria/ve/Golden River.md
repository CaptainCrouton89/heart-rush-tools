## Golden River

Tags: river, geography, trade

The most profitable waterway in Ve.

The Golden River flows north from Gnotobi's lake through the Dunes of Evioli, emptying into Droughd Sound at Orangeport. This single river carries virtually every dose of Orange Flake that leaves the desert—a stream of narcotic wealth that has made fortunes, broken treaties, and shaped the politics of an entire region.

### Course

The river begins at Gnotobi's lake, the only outlet for waters that have nowhere else to go. Fed by the Cydoris and Marshal Rivers from the southwest, the lake overflows northward through a channel that predates the surrounding dunes.

From Gnotobi, the Golden River winds roughly seventy miles through increasingly sparse desert before reaching the green margins of Turquish Bay. The final stretch passes through cultivated land—small farms and fishing villages that exist because the river makes settlement possible—before emptying into Droughd Sound at Orangeport.

The river is navigable for its entire length by shallow-draft vessels. Deeper ships can travel the lower reaches from Orangeport to the edge of the dunes; beyond that point, sandbars and narrow channels require specialized craft.

### The Name

The Golden River was called something else before Orange Flake made Gnotobi rich. Scholars claim the old name was the Evioli—the same word that gives the surrounding dunes their name—but usage shifted within a generation of the drug trade's emergence. Now everyone calls it the Golden River, and the old name survives only in academic texts.

The new name is apt. The river carries gold in the most literal sense: Gnotobi's Orange Flake shipments, each cargo worth fortunes by the time it reaches foreign markets. The water itself sometimes takes on an orange tinge near Gnotobi, stained by runoff from the algae-rich lake.

### Trade Route

The Golden River is Gnotobi's lifeline. Without it, the city-state would be landlocked in hostile desert, its products unsaleable, its wealth unreachable.

**Downstream (Gnotobi to Orangeport)**: Cargo boats carry Orange Flake, processed and packaged for export. Each shipment travels under Goldwatch escort. The journey takes three to five days depending on river conditions and weather.

**Upstream (Orangeport to Gnotobi)**: Return vessels carry supplies Gnotobi can't produce locally—foodstuffs, manufactured goods, luxury items for the Harvest Council families, and labor (willing or otherwise) for the harvest.

Traffic is constant. On any given day, dozens of boats move along the river, creating a perpetual flow of commerce that makes the Golden River one of Ve's busiest waterways despite serving only two settlements.

### Security

Everyone wants what moves on this river.

The **Goldwatch** maintains the primary security presence—Keshwindi mercenaries under the Goldwatch Compact, hired specifically to protect Orange Flake shipments. Goldwatch boats patrol the river continuously, and armed escorts accompany every cargo vessel.

Despite these precautions, piracy remains a persistent problem. The dunes along the river's middle reaches provide concealment for raiders who strike quickly and disappear into terrain they know better than any pursuer. Small-scale theft is constant; major heists occur every few years, usually involving inside information from someone in Gnotobi or Orangeport.

The Harvest Council has standing bounties on known river pirates. The Goldwatch collects these bounties regularly. Neither measure has eliminated the problem.

### River Communities

Small settlements cluster along the lower Golden River where it approaches Turquish Bay. These communities exist because the river exists—farming the irrigated land along its banks, fishing its waters, and providing services to passing traffic.

None of these villages are large or significant. They pay nominal taxes to no one in particular, maintain careful neutrality between Gnotobi and the powers that covet it, and prosper quietly in the shadow of the drug trade they pretend not to notice.

### The River Road

A track follows the Golden River from Orangeport to Gnotobi, used by travelers who prefer land to water or need to move faster than river traffic allows. The road is maintained—barely—by no one in particular, kept passable mainly by constant use.

Walking the River Road takes roughly a week. Riding cuts that to three or four days. Either option is slower than river travel but provides alternatives for those avoiding the water or unable to afford passage.
