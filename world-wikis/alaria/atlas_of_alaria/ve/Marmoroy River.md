## Marmoroy River

Tags: river, geography, ve

The largest northern tributary of the Misery River, the Marmoroy flows south from the highlands near Shyona's interior before joining the main channel east of Locquine. Its waters carry a milder version of the Misery's grief—still melancholic, but more wistful than crushing.

### Course

The Marmoroy rises in the forested hills that mark the transition between Shyona's settled farmland and the wild jungles of the south. It flows generally southwest, gathering smaller streams as it descends through increasingly dense vegetation. The river joins the Misery roughly twenty miles east of Locquine, their combined waters continuing toward Belanorn Bay.

The Marmoroy is navigable for small craft along much of its length, making it the preferred approach for traders seeking to reach the Misery River watershed from Shyona. The journey upstream is demanding but possible, unlike the Misery's main channel where the psychological effects intensify the closer one gets to the source.

### Character

The Marmoroy's waters produce melancholy rather than despair. Travelers report a sense of nostalgic sadness—memories of happier times, awareness of opportunities lost, gentle regret rather than crushing grief. Some find it almost pleasant, in a bittersweet way. Others compare it to the feeling of visiting a childhood home that has changed beyond recognition.

This milder effect likely results from distance. The Marmoroy doesn't flow from whatever contaminates the Misery's source. It merely joins the afflicted water partway through its course, picking up a diluted version of the grief before carrying it to the confluence.

### The Marmoroy Settlements

Several small communities line the Marmoroy's banks, particularly in its upper reaches where the effect is weakest. These villages serve as staging points for expeditions into Locquine territory and as trading posts for jungle products. The largest, **Sorrow's Rest**, sits at the navigable limit of the river—a cluster of perhaps fifty families who've made their peace with perpetual melancholy.

The villagers of the Marmoroy have developed customs around their environment. They celebrate the past rather than the future. They tell stories of the dead with fondness rather than grief. They've found that accepting the sadness rather than fighting it makes life in the watershed bearable.

### Trade Route

The Marmoroy provides the most practical water route into Locquine territory. Traders travel upstream by poled barge, spending several days on the river before transferring to smaller boats at Sorrow's Rest. From there, they can either continue up minor tributaries or travel overland to the Misery's main channel.

This route avoids the worst of the Misery's psychological effects while still providing water transport for bulky goods. The trade is modest but consistent—luxury items heading into Locquine, pixie artifacts heading out, and provisions moving in both directions.

### Why "Marmoroy"

The name comes from an old Shyonan word meaning "remembrance of stone." Early explorers noted that the river's rocky bed seemed to hold echoes of the past—travelers would find themselves remembering events that happened in this place before they arrived, as if the stones themselves retained memories. Whether this is a real phenomenon or simply the river's psychological effects manifesting as vivid imagination remains unclear.
