## Misery River

Tags: river, geography, ve, fae

The largest river system in the jungles between Shyona and the Krell Lands, the Misery River drains a vast watershed through a network of tributaries before depositing into Belanorn Bay. Its waters carry an ancient grief that has shaped everything along its banks.

### Course

The Misery River's source remains disputed. The main channel emerges from the mountains northwest of Locquine, fed by dozens of streams that wind down from the highlands. From there, it flows generally eastward, gathering tributaries as it goes—the Marmoroy from the north being the largest. The river passes through or near the pixie city-state of Locquine before continuing through increasingly dense jungle, finally widening as it approaches Belanorn Bay.

The tributary system is extensive. Countless smaller streams feed the Misery, creating a web of waterways that makes overland travel in this region difficult. During wet season, the entire watershed floods, turning low-lying areas into temporary lakes.

### The Water's Nature

Something is wrong with the Misery River. Not poisoned—the water supports abundant life, and drinking it causes no physical harm. But those who drink from it experience sudden, inexplicable sorrow. Memories of grief that isn't theirs. Mourning for losses they've never suffered. The sensation passes within hours for small amounts, but lingers for days after heavy exposure.

Prolonged contact is worse. Explorers who've spent weeks traveling the Misery's tributaries report creeping despair, inability to feel joy, and eventually active suicidal ideation. Several expeditions have lost members to self-inflicted death without any apparent external cause.

The effect doesn't seem to be magical in the conventional sense—no detection spells reveal enchantment, and antimagic fields don't suppress it. Scholars theorize the water carries something older than structured magic, perhaps connected to Faesong or to the emotional residue of an ancient catastrophe.

### The Source

Whatever taints the Misery begins somewhere in the northwestern mountains. Expeditions to find the headwaters have uniformly failed—those who venture too far upstream either turn back overwhelmed by despair or don't return at all. The last documented attempt, funded by Shyonan scholars in 3,298 SD, lost six of eight members to self-inflicted deaths. The survivors reported that the grief became *specific* as they climbed: not random sorrow but the unmistakable sensation of a single consciousness mourning something lost so long ago that time itself had forgotten it.

The pixies of Locquine know something. When asked about the source, they say only: "She remembers. We remember with her."

### Who Remembers

Three theories dominate scholarly debate:

**The Melera Theory:** The imprisoned goddess of harmony—trapped by Azus in a "prison of specificity" billions of years ago—is the most compelling candidate. Her song leaks into the world as Faesong, the ambient magic of emotion and connection. The Misery River would then be a place where that leakage *pools*, concentrated grief from an entity who has mourned her imprisonment for longer than life has existed on Alaria. The pixies of Locquine hear "deeper harmonics, sounds that predate Melera's imprisonment"—which would mean the river carries notes of the goddess's song from *before* she was caged. This theory is supported by the grief's emotional specificity: it feels like losing something precious, not like abstract sadness.

**The Catastrophe Theory:** A titanic disaster occurred at the source—perhaps during the Ezz Rift that fractured reality 120 million years ago, or during the God War that ended the Second Eon. The grief would be an echo, reality itself still reverberating from a wound that never healed. This theory explains why the effect isn't magical in the conventional sense: it's older than structured magic.

**The Prison Theory:** Something is *held* at the source. Not Melera herself—her prison exists outside normal space—but perhaps a fragment of her, a piece that broke off during her failed escape attempt. Or something else entirely, a being whose nature is suffering, deliberately contained where it cannot harm anything except explorers stupid enough to go looking.

The pixies won't clarify which theory is correct. They simply smile sadly and repeat: "She remembers."

Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: the source is not a natural phenomenon. The Misery River was made—or is being made—by something capable of grief on a cosmic scale.

### Ecology

Despite its psychological dangers, the Misery River teems with life. Fish species found nowhere else swim its waters. Amphibians and reptiles congregate along its banks. The jungle flora along its course grows particularly lush, as if the water's grief nourishes rather than poisons.

This has led to a disturbing theory: the creatures here have adapted to the sorrow the way life adapts to any environmental factor. The jungle itself may have developed a capacity for grief. Some researchers report that the forest along the Misery feels watchful—not hostile, but mournful. Trees that seem to lean toward travelers. Animal calls that sound almost like weeping.

### Travel and Trade

Few traders use the Misery River, despite it being the most direct water route from the interior to Belanorn Bay. The psychological toll is too high. Those who do usually employ protective measures: earplugs stuffed with specific herbs, masks soaked in alchemical compounds, or hired pixie guides from Locquine who can navigate the river's moods.

The river's mouth at Belanorn Bay is the safest portion—the water's effect dilutes significantly where it meets the sound. Small fishing communities operate here, though even they report melancholic dreams and a higher-than-average incidence of depression.

### Naming

The river earned its name from the first Shyonan explorers to chart this region. Their journals describe the expedition's mood shifting dramatically once they entered the watershed—laughing companions becoming withdrawn, optimistic plans giving way to bitter argument. By the time they reached Locquine, three of their number had walked into the jungle and never returned. The survivors named the river for what it had cost them.
