## Chimea

Tags: state, nation, jungle, empire

A hungry empire sprawling across southwestern Ve—its jungles stretch from the Blood Mountains to the Gulf of Chimea, its mines burrow into conquered Aureum territory, its colonies spread across distant Rimihuica. Chimea is built on expansion, exploitation, and relentless opportunism.

For full political details, see the [state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Chimea.md).

### The Suki Jungle

The dense tropical jungle that covers much of Chimea's territory, divided into three regions:

**West Suki** — Stretches from the Blood Mountains to the coast. The most settled region, with established roads and harvesting operations. Towns like Miltalie and Kargunyah anchor the interior.

**South Suki** — The southern interior, wilder but productive. The Tonyfall River runs through it, with Aldaville and Frowat controlling river traffic. The capital Chimus sits where the jungle opens into cultivated plains.

**North Suki** — Borders the Boneswamps and Dern. The most dangerous region—close to enemy territory and haunted by the undead. Settlements like Bowning, Kinglake, and Chatford watch the swamps nervously.

#### Boneswamps

A cursed swamp on the Chimea-Dern border, filled with the animated dead from the War of Bone (roughly 200 years ago). The bones of fallen Dernish and Chimean soldiers rise from the murky water, driven by residual hatred and the trauma of violent death. The skeletal warriors reenact their final battles, attacking any living creatures that enter their domain.

Neither nation claims the Boneswamps; both patrol their edges. The constant presence of undead makes this one of the most dangerous regions in Ve—and also the only reason Chimea and Dern aren't currently at war. The swamps serve as an impassable barrier.

#### Tonyfall River

The major river system running through South Suki, navigable for much of its length. Aldaville and Frowat control key points along its course. The river serves as the primary transportation route for jungle products heading to market.

### Blood Mountains

The northwestern mountain range, conquered from the Aureum dwarves roughly a century ago. Rich in rubies, iron, and copper—essential to Chimea's economy and a constant drain on its military.

The Aureum population resists assimilation; the Bloodlings (vampiric gnomes) control the deepest mines and emerge at night to prey on workers. Every gemstone that reaches Chimus is stained with blood.

For details on the Bloodlings, see the [gnome racial entry](../../races/Gnome.md#bloodlings-vampire-gnome).

#### Major Blood Mountain Settlements

- **Gilla** — Primary administrative center for the occupation, coordinates the Second Legion
- **Jenolan Caves** — Mining community built into cavern systems
- **Jindivick, Gorokan, Hell Creek, Bumbaldry** — Extraction settlements deep in the range
- **Courangra, Narara, Boggabilla** — Smaller mining villages on the jungle-mountain border

### Settlements

**Chimus** (★ Capital, ~40,000) — Imperial capital in the southern plains, built for display with broad avenues and marble government buildings. Ve's second-largest city.

**Old Tyabb** (■ City, ~15,000) — Gateway to New Chimea. Staging ground for colonial expeditions—soldiers, supplies, convicts, and "redemption colonists" pass through here on their way to Port Vincent and the ships. A city perpetually saying goodbye.

**Port Vincent** (▲ Town) — Primary western port on Traitor Bay, departure point for colonial ships.

**Jungle Towns:**
- Miltalie, Kargunyah, Nugent — Interior anchor settlements
- Aldaville, Frowat — River towns on the Tonyfall

### Adjacent Waters

**Traitor Bay** — Named for a civil war naval battle where captains switched sides. Now Chimea's primary western port, though the name remains uncomfortable.

**Gulf of Chimea** — The southwestern coastal indentation, less developed than Traitor Bay but important for local fishing and trade.
