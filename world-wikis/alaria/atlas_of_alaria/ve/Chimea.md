## Chimea

Tags: state, nation

A state in southwestern Ve, controlling the Suki Jungle and extending through the Blood Mountains into the plains south of Avalon. Chimea has a history of conflict with neighboring Dernis.

### Suki Jungle

The dense tropical jungle that covers much of Chimea's territory, divided into South Suki, West Suki, and North Suki regions.

#### Boneswamps

A cursed swamp deep within the Suki Jungle, filled with the dead bodies of Dernish and Chimean soldiers from ancient wars between the two nations. The bones of the fallen animate and rise from the murky water, driven by residual hatred and the trauma of violent death. The swamp is perpetually haunted by skeletal warriors who reenact their final battles, attacking any living creatures that enter their domain. The constant presence of undead makes the Boneswamps one of the most dangerous regions in the Suki Jungle.
