## Locquine

Tags: citystate, ve, pixie, fae

A city-state deep in the jungles of southern Ve, ruled by pixies whose perception of reality has fundamentally diverged from that of other races. Outsiders call them insane. The Locquine pixies call everyone else blind.

### The Weeping Wood

The jungle surrounding Locquine grows thick and strange. Trees here weep a pale sap that glows faintly at night, and the canopy filters sunlight into shifting patterns that seem to move with intention. The Misery River and its countless tributaries thread through this forest, their waters carrying something that has shaped everything living here for millennia.

The pixies of Locquine drink from the Misery River. They bathe in it. They sing to it. Over generations, this has changed them. They hear frequencies of Faesong that other pixies cannot—deeper notes, older harmonics, sounds that predate the imprisonment of Melera. Whether this is enlightenment or corruption depends on who you ask.

### The Discordant Court

Locquine has no formal government recognizable to outsiders. The pixies organize around what they call "truth-lines"—invisible currents of meaning that they perceive flowing through reality. Those who can read the truth-lines most clearly become guides; those who cannot follow or fall.

To visitors, this appears as chaos. Pixies interrupt conversations to address empty air. They laugh at nothing, weep at sunshine, and occasionally fly in spiraling formations for hours without explanation. Negotiations are impossible in any conventional sense—the pixies respond to questions that weren't asked and ignore questions that were.

Yet Locquine persists. The pixies build elaborate structures from woven vines and river-clay. They maintain gardens of medicinal plants. They wage coordinated defense against jungle predators with uncanny effectiveness, as if they know where threats will emerge before they do.

### The Misery's Gift

The Misery River's waters produce a specific effect on non-pixies: crushing, inexplicable sorrow. Travelers who drink from it report sudden grief—memories of losses they haven't experienced, mourning for people they've never met. The effect fades within hours for small amounts, but prolonged exposure has driven explorers to suicide.

For pixies, the effect is different. The sorrow becomes perception. They see the accumulated grief of the forest—every death, every loss, every moment of suffering that has occurred in this jungle since the Second Eon. The Locquine pixies don't consider this a burden. They consider it truth.

Some scholars theorize the Misery River's source lies somewhere in the mountains to the northwest, where something ancient bleeds its pain into the watershed. The pixies refuse to discuss it. When asked, they simply say: "She remembers. We remember with her."

### Relations with Outsiders

Locquine tolerates visitors who follow the unspoken rules—rules that visitors cannot perceive and therefore inevitably break. The pixies have killed traders for stepping on the wrong patch of moss. They've showered gifts on explorers for breathing at the right rhythm. There is no predicting them.

What makes Locquine valuable despite the danger: the pixies create things. Weavings that show glimpses of possible futures. Elixirs that grant temporary truth-sight (and temporary madness). Maps of places that don't exist yet. Those brave or desperate enough to trade with Locquine sometimes emerge with artifacts worth fortunes—if they emerge at all.

The safest approach, according to the few repeat visitors, is to bring gifts of music. The pixies respond well to songs, especially sad ones. They'll gather to listen, swaying in unison, and afterward are more likely to engage in something resembling rational exchange.

### The Five Who Speak

Among the thousands of pixies in Locquine, five have learned to translate between their perception and that of outsiders. They call themselves the Five Who Speak, and they serve as the closest thing Locquine has to diplomats. Each speaks in riddles, but the riddles contain real information if properly decoded.

The Five rotate. When one dies or "ascends" (a process the pixies celebrate but don't explain), another learns the art of speaking to the blind. Currently:

- **Whispergleam** — Speaks through questions, never statements
- **Thornlace** — Speaks only in metaphors involving water
- **Mothquiet** — Speaks backward; requires patience to understand
- **Sungrief** — Speaks normally but lies constantly; the lies encode truth
- **Rootsong** — Speaks through humming; words emerge from the melody

### What Outsiders Miss

The pixies of Locquine are not broken. They function according to a logic that incorporates information others cannot access. When they stare at empty space, they're watching the truth-lines. When they laugh at nothing, they've perceived something genuinely funny in the pattern of reality. When they attack without provocation, they've seen a threat that hasn't manifested yet.

Whether this makes them prophets or psychotics is an ongoing debate among scholars. The pixies themselves find the question meaningless.
