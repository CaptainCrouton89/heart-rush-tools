## Raptor Hills

Tags: hills, geography, ve, krell, dinosaur

The southeastern corner of the Krell Lands, where the dense jungle thins into savannah-like hills prowled by predatory dinosaurs large enough to threaten even Krell swarms. The Raptor Hills represent a contested zone—territory neither the insects nor the great reptiles have managed to fully claim.

### Geography

The Raptor Hills occupy perhaps sixty square miles where the Krell Lands meet the coast and the Dygon Beastlands border. The terrain transitions here: jungle canopy gives way to scattered trees, then to open grassland broken by rocky outcrops and dry ravines.

The hills themselves are modest—gentle rises rather than dramatic peaks—but the vegetation change is stark. The dense undergrowth that characterizes most of the Krell Lands disappears, replaced by tall grasses and thornbush that offer little concealment. Sightlines extend for miles.

Several seasonal streams cut through the hills, flowing toward the coast. During wet season, these become genuine rivers; during dry season, they're mostly sand with occasional pools.

### The Raptors

The hills' namesakes are pack-hunting dinosaurs that range from wolf-sized to horse-sized, depending on species. They're fast, intelligent (for reptiles), and hunt cooperatively—coordinating ambushes, flanking maneuvers, and relay pursuits that can run down prey over miles.

The largest species—called "terror raptors" by the few humans who've observed them—stand nearly seven feet at the shoulder. A pack of these can bring down creatures many times their individual size. They've been observed killing Krell soldiers, though whether they consider the insects prey or competition remains unclear.

Beyond the raptors, the hills host other dinosaur species: herbivorous browsers, smaller predators, and the occasional massive carnivore that wanders up from the Dygon Beastlands. The ecosystem is violent and dynamic, with territorial boundaries shifting constantly based on which apex predators are currently dominant.

### Krell Presence

The Krell have attempted to colonize the Raptor Hills repeatedly. Small hives establish in the jungle-hill boundary zone, begin expanding, and then collapse—destroyed by raptor packs, starved when prey proves too dangerous to hunt, or simply overwhelmed by the ecological pressure.

No permanent hive has survived more than a few years in the hills. The terrain doesn't suit Krell tactics: the open ground negates their numerical advantage, the lack of dense vegetation limits their communication, and the raptors specifically target Krell scouts as if they've learned the insects represent a threat to be eliminated.

This has created an effective buffer. The Raptor Hills separate the main Krell Lands from the Dygon Beastlands, preventing the insects from expanding southward. Whether this arrangement is stable long-term is unknown—Krell adaptation is slow but persistent.

### Human Presence

Humans don't live in the Raptor Hills. The dinosaurs don't distinguish between insect invaders and mammalian intruders. But the hills offer something valuable: relatively safe passage between the Krell Lands and the coast.

Travelers who stick to the hilltops during daylight, move in groups, and maintain vigilant watch can cross the hills with acceptable risk. The raptors hunt primarily at dawn and dusk; midday travel through open terrain reduces (but doesn't eliminate) the danger.

This makes the Raptor Hills an alternate route to Chitin Cove—one that avoids the deep jungle and its Krell inhabitants. It's longer and more exposed, but some traders prefer dinosaur risk to insect risk.

### The Bone Fields

Where the hills meet the coastal flats, the remains of countless creatures lie scattered across the landscape. Krell exoskeletons, dinosaur skeletons, and occasionally human bones create a macabre plain that locals call the Bone Fields.

The fields mark the high-tide line of Krell expansion—the point where swarms have repeatedly broken against the raptor packs and been destroyed. The accumulation of bones over generations has created an ecosystem of its own: scavengers, bone-eating insects, and creatures that use the remains for shelter.

Treasure hunters sometimes explore the Bone Fields, searching for equipment from lost expeditions or valuable Krell chitin for alchemical use. The work is dangerous—scavengers don't care about the source of their meals—but occasionally profitable.

### Value

The Raptor Hills matter for three reasons:

**Containment** — They prevent Krell expansion into the Dygon Beastlands, maintaining one of the few boundaries the insects haven't crossed

**Access** — They provide an alternative route to the coast, bypassing Krell jungle territory

**Resources** — Raptor kills leave behind valuable materials: dinosaur hide, bones, and organs with alchemical properties

No one controls the Raptor Hills. They're too dangerous for permanent settlement, too contested for territorial claims. They simply exist—a violent, dynamic boundary that serves purposes no one intended.
