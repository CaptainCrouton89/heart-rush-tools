### Sunrise Mountains

Mountain range in the northeast of Shyona.

### Gilded Plains

Great, beautiful plains of golden grass located north of the Sunrise Mountains. When the sun rises, the entire expanse becomes a brilliant gold, making it one of the most beautiful places in the world.

### Marthavia Mountains

A mountain range in Shyona known for its treacherous peaks and dangerous mining operations. The mountains sit at the intersection of void and air leylines, creating supernatural hazards.

#### Choking Mines

Located at the southwest point of the Marthavia Mountains, at the precise intersection of void and air leylines, the Choking Mines are among the most dangerous mining operations in Shyona. The intersection of these leylines causes air to spontaneously appear and cease to exist—miners can be breathing normally one moment and instantly choking the next as the air vanishes from their lungs.

The unpredictable nature of the void-air interaction makes the mines extremely sketchy. Many elves have died here, their bodies found frozen in poses of sudden suffocation. Despite the extreme danger, the mines contain valuable magical minerals and crystals formed by the leyline convergence, drawing prospectors willing to risk their lives for wealth.
