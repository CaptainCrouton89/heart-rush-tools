## Pyaganos

Tags: dragon, creature, ve, green

A green dragon who has ruled the Phriorys hills and northwestern Dygon Beastlands for over eight centuries—the longest continuously held dragon territory in Ve. Pyaganos is theatrical, vain, and utterly confident in his dominance. Where his clutch-sibling Draphilir hides in her jungle, Pyaganos makes himself seen, conducting his hunts and his cruelties in full view of his subjects.

### Appearance

Pyaganos is slightly smaller than his sister—his wingspan reaches perhaps one hundred eighty feet, his body closer to one hundred fifty from snout to tail. But he carries himself as if he were the largest creature in existence, and in the open grasslands of Phriorys, he usually is.

His scales are **bright green**, almost emerald, lacking the darker mottling that helps Draphilir blend into shadows. Pyaganos doesn't want to blend in. His coloring catches light beautifully, especially at dawn and dusk when the Phriorys hills turn golden and the dragon's scales seem to glow against them. He maintains his appearance carefully—grooming, removing damaged scales, ensuring his hide always gleams.

A ridge of **prominent spines** runs from his skull to his tail-tip, each one ivory-white and sharp enough to pierce armor. The spines serve no practical purpose that scholars have identified; they appear to be purely decorative, a display of draconic magnificence that Pyaganos cultivates deliberately.

His eyes are **amber**, bright and intelligent, and they miss nothing. Pyaganos watches everything in his territory with the patient attention of a predator who knows he has all the time in the world.

### Character

Pyaganos is **vain** beyond any rational measure. He considers himself the most magnificent creature in existence—a belief that centuries of unchallenged dominance have only reinforced. He preens. He poses. He arranges his kills and his hoard for maximum aesthetic impact. The Ix'Meglyakuk call him *Thyrak-Mor*, "the Beautiful Terror," and he takes the name as his due.

He is **cruel** in a casual, almost playful way. The seasonal hunts that terrorize Phriorys are not about food—Pyaganos could eat his fill anytime he wished. They're entertainment. He enjoys the chase, the fear, the moment when prey realizes it cannot escape. He prolongs kills for amusement and sometimes releases victims just to hunt them again.

He is **theatrical** in all things. Pyaganos could conduct his business privately, but he chooses not to. Tribute collections happen in the open. Punishments are public spectacles. Even his roosting—visible on hilltops across Phriorys—is a performance, a constant reminder that the dragon is watching.

He **hates** his sister Draphilir with a passion that matches hers for him. But where Draphilir's hatred is cold and patient, Pyaganos's burns hot. He wants to destroy her *now*, to burn Blyss to ash and scatter her bones. Only the memory of their last war—and the scars he still carries—keeps him in check.

### The Breath

Pyaganos's breath weapon is **fire**, but not ordinary dragonfire. His flames burn green-tinged, leaving ash that remains faintly luminescent for weeks. Areas he's burned extensively—like the Burned Valley—retain a permanent glow visible on dark nights, a reminder of his power.

**Precision Control:** Unlike many fire-breathing dragons, Pyaganos has developed extraordinary control over his breath. He can torch a single target while leaving everything around it untouched, or he can blanket square miles in flame. He uses this control for effect—burning intricate patterns into hillsides, incinerating tribute that displeases him one piece at a time.

**The Lasting Mark:** Something in Pyaganos's fire renders soil permanently sterile. The Burned Valley has remained barren for two centuries, and smaller burned areas throughout Phriorys show similar persistence. Whether this is a natural property of his breath or something he's learned to add, the result is the same: places he burns stay burned.

### The Lair

Pyaganos's lair occupies **Thyrak-Vor**, a limestone hill in central Phriorys. Unlike Draphilir's hidden sinkhole, Thyrak-Vor is visible for miles—a bare-stone prominence rising three hundred feet above the grassland, its caves open and accessible to anyone who dares approach.

**The Summit:** Pyaganos spends more time on the hilltop than in the caves below. He rests there openly, surveying his domain, making himself visible to everyone within sight. The summit serves as his throne room, his audience chamber, and his stage.

**The Trophy Caves:** The upper caves display Pyaganos's most treasured kills—skulls and bones arranged with artistic care, each specimen positioned for maximum impact. The collection includes megafauna, rival dragons, unfortunate humanoids, and several creatures that don't match any known species. Pyaganos conducts tours for visitors he wishes to impress or intimidate.

**The Deep Hoard:** Below the trophy galleries, flooded chambers contain eight centuries of accumulated wealth. Pyaganos guards this hoard jealously but knows exactly where every piece is. He can describe specific items' locations, histories, and the circumstances of their acquisition. The hoard is not just wealth—it's a record of his reign.

### Relationships

**Draphilir:** His clutch-sibling and eternal enemy. Pyaganos believes he's stronger, faster, and more deserving of dominance. Every war they've fought has ended in stalemate because Draphilir fights dirty—retreating into her impenetrable jungle, using rot and disease rather than honest combat. He considers her a coward. He's waiting for the right moment to prove himself superior once and for all.

**The Favored Tribes:** Pyaganos has elevated three Ix'Meglyakuk tribes to favored status—the Thyrak-Uli, the Kesh-Morru, and the Vorrikan. He protects them from threats, grants them hunting rights in prime territory, and uses them as instruments of his will. In exchange, they provide whatever he demands without question. The relationship is transactional but stable.

**Chimea:** Pyaganos finds Chimean attention flattering. He allows traders and observers into his territory because their presence confirms his magnificence—here are representatives of a great nation, come to witness the power of Pyaganos. He would never admit it, but their admiration feeds his vanity.

**Other Dragons:** Pyaganos considers himself exceptional among dragonkind. He views other dragons with casual contempt—rivals to be defeated, inferiors to be ignored, or potential threats to be monitored. He's had no contact with dragons outside Ve for centuries and assumes none are his equal.

### History

Pyaganos and Draphilir hatched together roughly eight hundred fifty years ago. From their first moments, they competed—for food, for attention, for dominance. Pyaganos was faster, more aggressive, more willing to fight. He assumed he would always win.

**The Claiming (circa 2,530 SD):** The siblings traveled south together, seeking territories in the abundant Beastlands. Pyaganos claimed Phriorys for its visibility—he wanted a domain where everyone could see him rule. His sister took the jungle, and he dismissed her choice as weakness.

**The Wars:** Six conflicts have erupted between the siblings across eight centuries. Pyaganos won the early engagements—pushing into Blyss, hunting Draphilir through her own territory, burning swaths of jungle. But he could never finish her. She always retreated deeper, struck back from unexpected directions, outlasted his fury.

**The Last War (3,201-3,219 SD):** Pyaganos's deepest penetration into Blyss, reaching within twenty miles of his sister's lair before she counterattacked. The war ended when Draphilir's rot began affecting his troops, and Pyaganos realized continuing would cost him more than victory was worth. He withdrew, burned the valley to deny her pursuit, and agreed to truce.

**The Current Peace (3,336 SD - present):** Forty years of uneasy quiet. Pyaganos has used the time to consolidate his hold on Phriorys, expand his favored tribes' power, and plan his next move. He's convinced the next war will be decisive—that he'll finally destroy his sister and claim all the Beastlands for himself.

### Interactions

Pyaganos enjoys visitors. He grants audiences readily, especially to those who flatter him or bring interesting tribute. Unlike Draphilir, he doesn't hide—approach Thyrak-Vor openly, announce yourself, and the dragon will likely appear.

**Approach:** Come during daylight, visibly and without stealth. Pyaganos considers hidden approaches insulting. Make your presence known, state your business loudly, and wait. If he's interested, he'll come.

**Tribute:** Pyaganos appreciates tribute but cares more about presentation than value. A modest gift offered with eloquent praise pleases him more than a fortune dumped unceremoniously. He rewards good showmanship.

**Conversation:** Pyaganos talks. He enjoys explaining his magnificence, recounting his victories, describing his domain. He's not particularly interested in visitors' perspectives but tolerates them as audience. Flattery works; criticism doesn't.

**Deals:** Pyaganos keeps his word—openly breaking agreements would damage his reputation. But he defines agreements narrowly, and his interpretation of "assistance" or "protection" may differ from what supplicants expect. Get everything in specific terms.

### Hooks

**The Favor Game:** Pyaganos is considering changes to his favored tribes. The competition to win or keep his favor is intensifying, and outside parties are being recruited as allies, saboteurs, or fall guys. Someone needs to navigate tribal politics under a dragon's watchful gaze.

**The Chimean Scheme:** Chimea's generals believe Pyaganos is predictable enough to defeat. They're gathering intelligence, mapping his patterns, and planning an eventual assault on Phriorys. They need scouts willing to spend weeks in dragon territory documenting his movements.

**The Coming War:** Both dragons are preparing for conflict. Pyaganos wants information about Draphilir's current strength, her defenses, her plans. He might hire outsiders for reconnaissance—or he might want them to deliver a message, one designed to provoke his sister into premature action.

**The Gathering Stones:** The mysterious stones in eastern Phriorys have attracted scholarly interest. Pyaganos has never formally acknowledged the stones' neutral status, and researchers will need his explicit permission to study them. What he'll want in exchange is unclear—perhaps simply the pleasure of being asked.
