## Edari

Tags: region, state, savannah, ve

The golden savannah of northwestern Ve, Edari is a vast wilderness claimed by no settled nation. It is the homeland of the Korel—the Wildborn Koren—who roam its grasslands in loose hunting bands, following prey and season across terrain that has never known a permanent wall.

### Geography

Edari occupies a broad peninsula roughly 300 miles across, bounded by water on three sides and mountains to the south. The terrain is predominantly flat savannah—golden grasses stretching to every horizon, broken by scattered acacia-like trees and seasonal watering holes.

**Boundaries:**
- **North**: Open ocean (Norswell Sea)
- **West**: Mesyula Bay
- **East**: Coquray Sound (inlet of Turquish Bay)
- **South**: Shepherds' Stones (mountain range marking the border with Sestros)

The interior is trackless. No roads cross Edari—the Korel don't build them, and outsiders rarely survive long enough to need them.

### Mesyula Bay

The western coastline indents around Mesyula Bay, a shallow body of water rich in fish and seabirds. The Korel occasionally fish these waters from small hide boats, but they build no permanent fishing villages. Foreign ships sometimes anchor in the bay to take on fresh water, though doing so risks attracting Korel attention.

### Coquray Sound

The eastern coast opens into Coquray Sound, which connects to the larger Turquish Bay separating Edari from Shyona. The sound's waters are calmer than the open ocean, and Shyonan fishing vessels sometimes venture into its western reaches—though they rarely go ashore.

### Estri Islands

A small archipelago lies offshore to the northwest, separated from the mainland by a few miles of open water. The islands appear uninhabited by the Korel, who show little interest in seafaring.

#### Hume Une

Ruins of a Kor colony on the largest of the Estri Islands. Centuries ago, the Kor—the "civilized" Koren—attempted to establish a foothold on Ve, building a walled settlement in the traditional Kor style: orderly streets, stone structures, a central hall for social rituals. The colony failed within two generations. Disease, supply problems, and increasingly hostile relations with the mainland Korel made the position untenable. The survivors evacuated by ship; the settlement was left to rot.

The Korel don't fear Hume Une—they find it disgusting. The ruins represent everything they rejected: walls, permanence, suppression of instinct, the Kor obsession with propriety. Entering the ruins is taboo, an act of spiritual contamination. Young Korel sometimes dare each other to approach the islands; actually setting foot on them would mean exile from the pack.

The ruins themselves are overgrown but largely intact. Stone doesn't rot. The central hall still stands, its interior dark and silent. Whatever the Kor left behind when they fled—records, artifacts, supplies—remains untouched. No Korel will retrieve it. No outsider has bothered to look.

### Howlwood

The one major forest in Edari sprawls across the northeastern corner of the region, near where Coquray Sound meets the coast. The forest takes its name from the eerie sounds that drift from its depths at night—whether from wildlife, wind, or something else is debated by the few outsiders who've heard it.

See [Howlwood](./Howlwood.md) for details.

### The Korel

Edari has no cities, towns, or villages because its inhabitants don't build them. The Korel—Wildborn Koren—are nomadic hunters who follow game across the savannah in loose pack structures. They are territorial and view outsiders as either prey or competitors.

The Korel are not a unified people. Each pack operates independently, sometimes cooperating with neighbors, sometimes fighting them. Attempting to cross Edari without Korel permission is extremely dangerous. Attempting to settle is suicide.

See [Koren](../../../races/Koren.md) for details on the Korel.

### Why It Matters

Edari is effectively impassable overland. Anyone traveling between Sestros and the northern coast must either:
- Sail around the peninsula (adding weeks to the journey)
- Negotiate passage with Korel packs (unreliable at best)
- Fight through (rarely successful)

This geographic reality shapes trade routes across northern Ve. The Shepherds' Stones and Korel territory together create a natural barrier that isolates the northwestern coast from the rest of the continent.
