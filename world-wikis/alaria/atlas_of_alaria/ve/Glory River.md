## Glory River

Tags: river, geography, ve, sestros

The sacred waterway of Sestros, flowing from the foothills of the Shepherds' Stones through the kingdom's heartland. The Shailin believe water that touches Talresses's chosen land carries his blessing—and since Talresses has chosen all of Sestros, the Glory River is considered especially holy.

### Course

The Glory River rises from springs in the southeastern Shepherds' Stones, near where the mountains diminish toward the Hills of Dolor. It flows south and then east, winding through the central grasslands that form Sestros's agricultural core. The river eventually feeds into the systems that drain toward Shyona and the eastern coast.

The total length is roughly 150 miles. For most of that distance, the river is slow and shallow—easily forded, ideal for watering livestock, but not navigable by anything larger than a flat-bottomed barge.

### Settlements

The densest population in Sestros clusters along the Glory River. A string of ranching towns follows its banks: Lolani, Phuklean, Wadala Sindhuan, Banda Lamman, Karborai, and dozens of smaller villages. These communities depend on the river for drinking water, irrigation, and the spiritual benefits the Shailin ascribe to proximity to flowing water.

The main road from Mu to the eastern borders roughly parallels the Glory River, connecting the ranching towns to the capital and to each other.

### Religious Significance

The Shailin treat the Glory River as more than water. Pilgrims travel to bathe in its currents, believing the experience purifies the spirit and brings them closer to Talresses. Children are named beside its banks. The dying ask to be carried to the river so their last breath can be drawn near blessed water.

None of this requires Talresses's actual intervention. The daemon encourages the belief because it binds the Shailin to their land and to him—but whether the water carries any genuine blessing is impossible to verify. The Shailin don't question it. They don't question anything.

### Practical Value

Religious significance aside, the Glory River makes central Sestros habitable. The grasslands would be marginal for ranching without reliable water. The river's presence allows sheep and goat herds that produce the wool underlying Sestros's famous textile industry.

The best grazing lands lie within a day's walk of the river. Move farther away and the land dries out, supporting only seasonal pasture. The Glory River's course essentially defines where Sestros can sustain significant population.
