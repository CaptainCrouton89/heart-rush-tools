## Gnotobi

Tags: citystate, settlement

The orange city. Gnotobi sprawls along the shores of its vast lake in the Dunes of Evioli, a haze of refinement smoke hanging over its warehouses and the sweet-chemical smell of processing hanging in the air. This is the only place in the world where Orange Flake is made—and that monopoly has made Gnotobi obscenely wealthy.

The lake itself dominates everything. Miles across, shallow, warm, and carpeted with the distinctive orange algae that grows nowhere else. From the surrounding dunes, the water looks like molten copper at sunset. Up close, it smells of salt and something faintly medicinal.

### The Harvest Council

Gnotobi is governed by the **Harvest Council**, an oligarchy of the families who control algae harvesting rights. Power in Gnotobi is measured in shoreline. Each family's voting weight on the Council corresponds to how much lakefront they own. More shore means more harvesting capacity means more wealth means more influence.

The current Council comprises seven major families and a rotating coalition of minor ones who occasionally accumulate enough combined shoreline to matter. Council sessions are legendarily vicious—alliances shift, marriages are arranged and broken, and the occasional family finds itself mysteriously bankrupt and forced to sell its holdings.

No single family has achieved majority control in living memory. The Council's dysfunction is, in a sense, its stability: everyone is too busy scheming against each other to unite behind a single tyrant.

**The Golden Seat** is the Council's nominal leadership position, held by whichever family currently controls the most shoreline. The Golden Seat sets the agenda and breaks ties but has no special authority otherwise. Families have bankrupted themselves pursuing it for the prestige alone.

### Orange Flake

The drug that built an empire.

Orange Flake is processed from the algae that grows only in Gnotobi's lake. When refined and dried, it produces an orange crystalline powder that dissolves easily in liquid or can be inhaled directly. The high is warm, euphoric, and remarkably safe—overdose is nearly impossible, and the drug causes no physical damage even with heavy use.

The problem is psychological. Orange Flake is extraordinarily addictive. Users describe the high as feeling *loved*—a profound sense of acceptance and peace that makes ordinary life feel hollow by comparison. Most users can maintain functionality while using, which makes the addiction easier to hide and harder to break. Withdrawal isn't physically dangerous, but the emotional crash drives relapse rates above ninety percent.

The drug commands staggering prices in foreign markets. A single dose in Gnotobi costs a day's wages for a laborer. By the time it reaches Shyona's cities, it costs a week's. In distant lands across the sea, it's worth its weight in gold.

### The Harvest

Collecting the algae is miserable work.

Harvesters wade into the lake's shallows—rarely deeper than chest-height—and scrape algae into fine mesh nets. The work continues for hours, bent over in the water, under the desert sun. The lake's minerals stain skin orange within weeks of regular exposure. Long-term harvesters develop joint problems, persistent fatigue, and a distinctive cognitive fog—an ironic echo of the drug's effects.

The orange stain never fully fades. In Gnotobi, orange palms mark you as underclass.

Who does this work?

**Debt laborers**: The cruelest irony. People who became addicted to Orange Flake and couldn't pay their debts work off what they owe in the lake—surrounded by the source of their addiction, paid in the drug they're trying to escape.

**Criminals**: Gnotobi sentences lawbreakers to harvest duty. Theft, assault, unpaid debts—the punishment is the same. A season in the lake.

**The desperate**: Some come voluntarily. The pay is regular, food is provided, and for those with nothing else, that's enough. Many are migrants from the surrounding desert, refugees from Shyona's internal conflicts, or foreigners who arrived chasing opportunity and found only this.

The Harvest Council does not discuss labor conditions publicly.

### The Processing District

Raw algae is worthless. The refinement process—closely guarded by the Council families—transforms harvested algae into Orange Flake through a multi-stage process involving drying, chemical treatment, and crystallization.

The **Processing District** occupies Gnotobi's northeastern quarter, a maze of warehouse-refineries owned by various Council families. The air here smells of chemical solvents and burns the throat. Workers in the refineries develop their own health problems, different from the harvesters but no less debilitating.

Each family guards its refinement techniques jealously. The broad strokes are similar, but small variations produce noticeably different product. Connoisseurs can identify which family processed a batch by its color, texture, and the character of its high. Some families have better reputations than others.

### The Golden River

All roads lead to Orangeport—or rather, all water does.

The **Golden River** flows through Gnotobi's lake and continues north to Droughd Sound on Turquish Bay. This is the only practical route for moving product to market. Overland caravans through the desert are slow, expensive, and vulnerable to raiders. The river is faster, cheaper, and easier to defend.

Gnotobi maintains a fleet of shallow-draft cargo boats that shuttle Orange Flake downstream to Orangeport. The **Goldwatch**—mercenaries from Keshwindi under the Goldwatch Compact—escort every shipment. River pirates are a persistent problem, despite (or because of) the enormous value of the cargo.

The river was called something else once, before Orange Flake made Gnotobi rich. No one remembers the old name.

### Architecture and Layout

Gnotobi is a city of contrasts. The lakefront is beautiful: elegant villas of the Harvest Council families, pleasure gardens, promenades where the wealthy stroll at sunset watching the orange water glow. Behind this facade, the city deteriorates quickly—crowded worker housing, the stinking Processing District, and the tent camps of migrants hoping for harvest work.

The **Council Hall** sits on a promontory overlooking the lake, an ostentatious structure of imported stone that cost more than most cities' entire treasuries. Council families compete to fund expansions and decorations, resulting in an architectural hodgepodge of clashing styles unified only by expense.

### Security

Everyone wants what Gnotobi has.

The Council maintains extensive security operations:

**Lake Patrols**: Armed boats circling the lake, watching for unauthorized harvesting or sabotage of family holdings.

**The Goldwatch**: Keshwindi mercenaries under the Compact, providing muscle for caravan escorts, district patrols, and occasional enforcement of Council decisions.

**Informant Networks**: Spies in Orangeport, Shyona, Sestros, and beyond, watching for theft rings, smuggling operations, or foreign powers planning moves against Gnotobi's monopoly.

**The Refinement Guard**: Each major family maintains private security for its processing facilities. These forces answer to their families first, the Council second, and are as likely to spy on rival families as to protect against external threats.

### Relations

**Keshwindi**: The Goldwatch Compact binds the two cities. Gnotobi pays for Keshwindi's soldiers; Keshwindi provides the muscle Gnotobi's merchant families lack. The relationship is purely transactional. Neither side pretends otherwise.

**Orangeport**: Gnotobi's gateway to the world, and a perpetual headache. The Council would prefer to control Orangeport directly but has never managed to unite long enough to conquer it. Instead, they bribe, threaten, and manipulate Orangeport's factions, trying to ensure favorable treatment without provoking unified resistance.

**Shyona**: The largest market for Orange Flake, and the most complicated relationship. Shyona's noble houses publicly condemn the drug trade while privately consuming enormous quantities. This hypocrisy suits everyone: Shyona maintains moral authority, Gnotobi maintains profits, and no one examines the arrangement too closely.

**Sestros**: Minimal direct trade. Sestros lacks the wealth to afford Orange Flake in quantity, and Gnotobi has little interest in Sestros's goods. Some smuggling passes through Sestros territory to avoid Shyona's nominal tariffs.
