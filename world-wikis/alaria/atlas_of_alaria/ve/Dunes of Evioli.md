## Dunes of Evioli

A sea of sand hiding an empire of orange.

The Dunes of Evioli stretch across north-central Ve, a vast desert of rolling sand dunes that shifts color from pale gold to deep amber depending on the light. At its heart lies Gnotobi's lake—the source of Orange Flake and the reason anyone cares about this otherwise hostile expanse.

### Geography

The Dunes occupy the low basin between the Hills of Dolor to the west and the beginnings of Shyona's settled lands to the east. The terrain is classic erg desert: wave after wave of sand dunes, some reaching heights of two hundred feet, their crests sculpted by winds that blow constantly from the northwest.

The sand is fine and mobile, making permanent structures difficult outside the lake basin. Dunes migrate slowly but relentlessly, occasionally swallowing abandoned camps or burying roads that weren't maintained. Navigation requires either following the Golden River or knowing the patterns well enough to read the landscape.

The climate is brutal: scorching days, cold nights, and almost no rainfall. What precipitation does fall evaporates before reaching the ground or drains quickly into the porous sand. The only reliable water is Gnotobi's lake and the rivers that feed it.

### Gnotobi's Lake

The lake at the heart of the Dunes is an anomaly—a vast, shallow body of water in the middle of a desert. Fed by the Cydoris and Marshal Rivers from the southwest and countless smaller springs along its bed, the lake has no outlet except the Golden River flowing north to Turquish Bay.

The water is warm, brackish, and rich in minerals that support the unique orange algae found nowhere else in the world. From the dunes surrounding it, the lake glows like molten copper at sunset—one of Ve's most striking natural sights, and the source of its most controversial product.

See [Gnotobi](Gnotobi.md) for details on the city-state and the Orange Flake trade.

### The Golden River

The **Golden River** is the lifeblood of the region, flowing from Gnotobi's lake north through the dunes to Orangeport on Droughd Sound. The river is the only practical route for moving goods out of the Dunes of Evioli; overland caravans through the shifting sands are slow, expensive, and dangerous.

The river carved its course before the dunes existed, when this basin was wetter. Now it flows through a relatively stable channel where the water table remains high enough to prevent sand encroachment. The banks support scattered vegetation—date palms, reeds, scrubby trees—creating a green ribbon through the otherwise barren landscape.

See [Golden River](Golden%20River.md) for full details.

### The Mobari Reach

The eastern portion of the Dunes, where sand gives way to rocky hardpan approaching Shyona's borders, is called the **Mobari Reach**. The terrain here is more stable but no less harsh—flat, sun-baked earth broken by occasional rock outcrops and seasonal creek beds that flow only during rare storms.

The Mobari Reach serves as the main overland approach to Gnotobi from Shyona. A poorly maintained road connects the lake to Shyona's western settlements, used primarily by those who can't afford river transport or need to avoid Orangeport's scrutiny.

### Hazards

The Dunes of Evioli are actively dangerous:

**Navigation**: Without landmarks, travelers become disoriented within hours. The dunes look identical in every direction. Getting lost here kills.

**Sandstorms**: The northwest winds occasionally intensify into full sandstorms that can last for days. Visibility drops to nothing; sand infiltrates everything; unprotected travelers suffocate.

**Subsidence**: Some dunes conceal unstable ground—old lake beds, collapsed tunnels, pockets of loose sand. Animals and occasionally people have been swallowed by suddenly shifting terrain.

**Heat**: Daytime temperatures in summer exceed safe limits. Travel happens at night or not at all during the hot months.

**Raiders**: The dunes provide excellent concealment for those preying on Gnotobi's trade. Bandit groups operate in the southern reaches, striking caravans and disappearing into terrain they know better than any pursuer.

### Settlements

**Gnotobi** is the only significant settlement in the Dunes of Evioli, positioned on the lake's shore where water makes permanent habitation possible.

Scattered throughout the dunes are temporary camps—nomadic herders who follow sparse grazing, prospectors searching for valuable minerals, and the occasional hermit or fugitive who prefers the desert's dangers to civilization's laws. None of these constitute permanent population.

### Travel

Those crossing the Dunes typically choose one of two routes:

**The River Road**: Following the Golden River from Orangeport to Gnotobi. Slower but safer—water is available, the path is clear, and Goldwatch patrols provide some security. This is how goods move.

**The Mobari Trail**: The overland route from Shyona through the Mobari Reach. Faster but harder, used by travelers who want to avoid Orangeport entirely or can't afford river passage. High casualty rate among the unprepared.

Crossing the dunes directly—away from rivers or established trails—is possible but inadvisable. Even experienced desert travelers disappear regularly.
