## Sestros

Tags: region, state, ve, savannah, desert

The heartland of western Ve—a kingdom of shepherds and silk-weavers ruled by a monarch who speaks for a god. Sestros stretches from the Red Desert in the north to Tukiwood in the south, from the coast at Nuin Bay to the Hills of Dolor in the east. It is orderly, prosperous, and unsettlingly content.

### Geography

Sestros occupies the most habitable portion of western Ve. The terrain transitions from dry savannah in the north, through rolling grasslands ideal for grazing in the center, to forested hill country in the south. The Glory River winds through the heart of the kingdom, providing water for the ranching communities that form the backbone of Sestran life.

**Boundaries:**
- **North**: Shepherds' Stones (mountain border with Edari)
- **East**: Hills of Dolor and the Dunes of Evioli (borders with the independent city-states)
- **South**: Tukiwood and the northern slopes of the Widebarrow Mountains
- **West**: Nuin Bay and the open coast

The kingdom is well-connected by road. A main route runs east from the capital at Mu, following the Glory River through the central grasslands before splitting—one branch heading northeast toward Shyona, the other southeast toward the Widebarrows.

### Mu (Capital)

The capital sits on Nuin Bay in the southwest, where the coastal trade meets the inland ranching economy. Mu is a modest city by continental standards—perhaps 15,000 people—but it's the largest settlement in Sestros by far. The royal palace dominates the skyline, a sprawling complex of whitewashed stone and silk banners that serves as both seat of government and primary temple to Talresses.

The harbor handles most of Sestros's textile exports, loading bolts of the finest silk in Ve onto ships bound for distant markets. The textile workshops cluster near the docks, their dye-vats producing the brilliant colors that make Sestran silk distinctive.

### Red Desert

The northern reaches of Sestros give way to true desert—the Red Desert, named for its iron-rich sands that glow crimson at sunset. Few live here permanently. Shepherds bring flocks to the desert's edges during the brief winter rains, when seasonal grasses sprout, but retreat south when the heat returns.

The ruins of Lurza stand at the desert's western edge, where it meets the Shepherds' Stones. See [Shepherds' Stones](./Shepherds' Stones.md) for details on that cursed place.

### Glory River

The primary waterway of central Sestros, the Glory River rises in the foothills of the Shepherds' Stones and flows east-southeast through the kingdom's heartland. Its banks support the densest settlement in Sestros—a string of ranching towns that depend on the river for water, irrigation, and transport.

The river's name comes from Shailin religious practice. They believe water that flows through Talresses's chosen land carries his blessing. Drinking from the Glory River is considered auspicious; bathing in it purifies the spirit. Whether Talresses actually blesses the water is debatable. The Shailin don't debate it.

### Tukiwood

The southern forest marks the transition between Sestros and the wilder lands beyond. Tukiwood is temperate woodland—oaks, maples, and scattered evergreens—that provides timber, game, and a buffer against whatever comes out of the Widebarrow foothills.

Logging operations work the forest's northern edges, but the Shailin don't push deep. Talresses teaches contentment with what one has. The deep woods remain largely unexplored.

### Nuin Bay

The southwestern coast curves around Nuin Bay, a sheltered natural harbor that makes Mu possible. The bay's calm waters allow year-round shipping, connecting Sestros to the broader world despite its relative isolation on Ve.

Fishing villages dot the bay's shores, providing seafood to supplement the meat-heavy Sestran diet. The fishermen worship Talresses alongside everyone else, though their prayers focus on calm seas rather than fat flocks.

### Why It Matters

Sestros controls the overland route across northern Ve. Anyone traveling between the western coast and Shyona, the Dunes of Evioli, or the eastern lands must pass through Sestran territory unless they want to risk Edari or sail around the continent. The Shailin don't exploit this—hospitality is a virtue Talresses demands—but their strategic position gives them quiet leverage they rarely need to use.

The kingdom also produces the finest textiles on Ve, possibly in the world. Sestran silk is a luxury good everywhere it reaches, and the merchants who trade in it make fortunes.
