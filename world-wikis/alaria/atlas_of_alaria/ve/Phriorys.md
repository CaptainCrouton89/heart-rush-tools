## Phriorys

Tags: region, hills, geography, ve, dragon-territory

The northwestern edge of the Dygon Beastlands, where the jungle breaks against a landscape of rolling hills, scattered groves, and open grassland. Phriorys marks the transition between the primordial wilderness to the south and the Suki Jungle of Chimea to the north—and serves as the domain of the green dragon Pyaganos.

The region covers roughly eight thousand square miles, a crescent of elevated terrain that curves from the Gulf of Chimea in the west to the central Beastlands in the east. The hills rise several hundred feet above the jungle floor, high enough that the canopy breaks, allowing sunlight to reach the ground. This makes Phriorys the most accessible part of the Beastlands—and therefore the most contested.

### Character of the Land

Phriorys doesn't look like the rest of the Beastlands. The endless jungle gives way to something more varied: hills crowned with wind-bent trees, valleys filled with tall grass, groves of ancient hardwoods separated by open savannah. The change feels sudden, like crossing a threshold.

**The Hills:** Dozens of named hills dot the region, their slopes covered in grass that turns gold in the dry season. The Ix'Meglyakuk call them *Thyrak-Kesh*—"the bones of the land"—and believe they're the exposed spine of the primordial lizard-god that sleeps beneath the Beastlands. Geologists would note the hills are limestone formations, remnants of an ancient seabed uplifted by tectonic forces. Both explanations can be true.

**The Groves:** Scattered across Phriorys are stands of massive trees—some single specimens, others clusters covering several acres. These groves are old, their root systems extending deep into the limestone, their canopies providing the only shade in the open grassland. Wildlife concentrates around them, making them prime hunting grounds—and prime ambush sites.

**The Edge Zone:** Where Phriorys meets the jungle proper, the transition creates a unique ecosystem. Jungle creatures that hunt in open ground compete with savannah species that shelter in the forest edge. This zone sees some of the most intense predator activity in the Beastlands, as different hunting strategies collide.

### Pyaganos's Domain

The dragon Pyaganos has claimed Phriorys for over eight centuries, making it the longest continuously held dragon territory in Ve. His approach to rulership differs markedly from his sibling Draphilir's.

**Visibility:** Where Draphilir hides in her jungle, Pyaganos is often seen. He hunts in the open, sometimes circling for hours before striking, letting everyone in the region know he's present. He roosts on hilltops in plain view. He conducts tribute collections personally rather than through intermediaries. The Ix'Meglyakuk of Phriorys live under constant awareness that the dragon is watching.

**Selectivity:** Pyaganos doesn't demand tribute from every tribe. Instead, he's chosen three "favored" groups—tribes that provide him with whatever he requests in exchange for protection from all threats, including other Ix'Meglyakuk. These favored tribes have grown powerful, expanding their territories under draconic patronage, while unfavored groups struggle to survive.

**The Hunts:** Once each season, Pyaganos conducts a ceremonial hunt across Phriorys. He doesn't hunt to eat—he hunts to demonstrate. For three days, he ranges across the hills, killing whatever catches his attention: megafauna, Ix'Meglyakuk who've displeased him, occasionally Chimean travelers who've strayed too far south. The hunts are terrifying, unpredictable, and apparently recreational. The dragon enjoys the fear.

**The Lair:** Pyaganos's primary lair occupies a hill called *Thyrak-Vor* in the central region—a limestone formation riddled with caves, its summit cleared of vegetation by centuries of dragon landing. The caves extend deep into the earth, connecting to underground rivers and eventually to an air pocket where the dragon stores his hoard. Unlike Draphilir, Pyaganos doesn't hide his lair's location. Everyone knows where he lives. The knowledge doesn't help; the caves are trapped, patrolled, and visited frequently by the dragon himself.

### The Ix'Meglyakuk of Phriorys

The tribes of Phriorys have adapted to life under a visible, capricious dragon. They're different from their jungle cousins in several ways:

**Open-Ground Hunting:** Where jungle Ix'Meglyakuk use stealth and ambush, Phriorys tribes have developed pursuit predation—running down prey across the grasslands on their raptors, exhausting animals over miles rather than striking from concealment. This makes them the most mobile Ix'Meglyakuk, capable of covering vast distances quickly.

**The Favored and Unfavored:** Social hierarchy in Phriorys revolves around relationship to Pyaganos. The three favored tribes—the *Thyrak-Uli*, the *Kesh-Morru*, and the *Vorrikan*—dominate the region, controlling the best hunting grounds and water sources. Unfavored tribes survive in the margins, constantly pressed by both their more powerful neighbors and the dragon who might decide to hunt them at any moment.

**Chimean Contact:** Phriorys sees more interaction with the outside world than any other part of the Beastlands. Chimean traders, explorers, and occasionally soldiers enter the region from the north, and Pyaganos tolerates this—even seems to encourage it. The dragon appears to enjoy having an audience beyond the Ix'Meglyakuk, observers who can carry word of his power back to "civilized" lands.

### Locations

#### Thyrak-Vor (The Dragon's Hill)

The limestone hill that serves as Pyaganos's primary lair, rising three hundred feet above the surrounding grassland. The hill's slopes are steep and largely bare—the dragon has burned away the vegetation enough times that nothing grows there anymore. The caves that riddle the interior are visible from a distance, dark openings in pale stone.

**The Approach:** Anyone attempting to reach the caves must cross open ground under Pyaganos's gaze. The dragon can see approaching visitors from miles away. Sometimes he lets them come. Sometimes he doesn't.

**The Caves:** The upper caves are trophy galleries—skulls and bones of the dragon's most notable kills, arranged with care. Deeper chambers hold treasure accumulated over eight centuries: gold, gems, artifacts, and items of sentimental value the dragon refuses to explain. The deepest chambers flood periodically, filled by underground rivers that connect to the water table.

**The Summit:** Pyaganos rests on the hilltop more often than in the caves—a display of confidence that says he fears nothing. Visitors granted audience are sometimes required to climb the hill to meet him at the summit, an exhausting ascent under the dragon's constant observation.

#### The Burned Valley

A long depression between two hill ridges, roughly ten miles long and one mile wide, where nothing grows. Two centuries ago, during one of the sibling wars between Pyaganos and Draphilir, the battle reached Phriorys. Pyaganos burned the valley to deny his sister cover, and something in his fire—or perhaps his fury—rendered the soil permanently sterile.

The Burned Valley serves as a boundary marker. Ix'Meglyakuk do not cross it. Chimean expeditions that enter it report feeling watched, unsettled, wrong. The ground is ash-gray and powdery, and footprints in it remain visible for months. Some say the valley records everything that crosses it—that Pyaganos can read the traces and know who's been where.

#### The Chimean Approach

The northern edge of Phriorys, where the hills meet the Suki Jungle of Chimea. This strip of borderland sees regular traffic: Chimean traders seeking jungle products, Ix'Meglyakuk willing to sell them, and occasional military patrols testing how far they can push into dragon territory.

Pyaganos allows this commerce—even seems to enjoy it. He's been known to appear during negotiations, circling overhead while deals are struck below, never attacking but always reminding everyone present whose land they're on. The psychological effect keeps Chimea from ever getting too comfortable with the idea that Phriorys might be conquerable.

**Outpost Viyen:** A Chimean trading station at the very edge of the approach, staffed by merchants too ambitious or too desperate to fear the dragon. The outpost has survived for thirty years—a record for Chimean establishments in the Beastlands—by paying tribute to both Pyaganos and the nearest favored tribe. The arrangement is expensive, unstable, and immensely profitable for those involved.

#### The Gathering Stones

A formation of standing stones on a prominent hilltop in eastern Phriorys, their origin unknown. The stones predate Ix'Meglyakuk presence in the region—possibly predate intelligent life on Ve entirely. They're arranged in a pattern that doesn't match any known astronomical alignment, their surfaces carved with symbols no one can read.

The Ix'Meglyakuk use the Gathering Stones for inter-tribal councils, treating the site as neutral ground. Even Pyaganos respects the location; he's never hunted there, never interrupted a gathering. Some believe the stones hold power that constrains even dragons. Others believe the dragon simply finds the meetings useful—a way to observe tribal politics without direct involvement.

### Threats and Opportunities

**Pyaganos's Favor:** The dragon has grown bored with his current favored tribes. Rumors suggest he's considering replacing one of them—or adding a fourth to create new dynamics. Outside parties might be drawn into the resulting competition, hired by tribes seeking to win or keep favor, or by unfavored groups hoping to seize opportunity from the chaos.

**The Chimean Problem:** Chimea's generals have been studying Phriorys for decades, looking for weakness. They believe Pyaganos is predictable—that his territorial patterns could be mapped, his hunting schedule anticipated, his lair eventually assaulted. They're almost certainly wrong, but they might hire outsiders to gather intelligence before discovering how wrong they are.

**The Gathering Stones:** The symbols on the stones have attracted scholarly interest. A team from Shyona wants to document and translate them, believing they predate all known writing systems. The Ix'Meglyakuk are willing to allow research—but only if the scholars can convince Pyaganos, who's never formally acknowledged the stones' neutral status.

**Sibling Tensions:** Pyaganos and Draphilir haven't fought in forty years, but tensions are rising. Both dragons have been ranging closer to their territorial boundaries. Both have been demanding more tribute. War between them would devastate Phriorys and Blyss alike—but it might also create opportunities for those willing to exploit divided draconic attention.
