## Honor Creek

Tags: river, creek, geography, ve, avalon

A tributary of the Honor River, branching northeast through Shorolyn Forest before joining the main watercourse. The creek drains the northeastern highlands and passes through terrain where the Temptari believe glimpses of the future can be found—for those foolish enough to seek them.

### Course

Honor Creek splits from the Honor River roughly 20 miles east of Tarolin, flowing northeast through the edge of Shorolyn Forest before curving back to rejoin the main watershed. The total length is perhaps 40 miles—a modest waterway by Ve standards, but significant for the settlements along its banks.

The creek is shallow and fast-moving, tumbling over rocky beds in the higher stretches before slowing as it approaches the main river. Not navigable, but reliable for water supply and small-scale irrigation.

### The Vision Pools

Certain pools along Honor Creek are said to grant visions of the future to those who drink from them. The priests neither confirm nor deny this—they simply warn that unguided visions bring madness more often than wisdom.

The pools are not marked. Finding them requires local knowledge or dumb luck. Some seekers spend years walking the creek's length without success. Others stumble onto a vision pool their first day and never recover from what they see.

The visions, when they come, are fragmentary and contextless. A face you'll meet in ten years. A building that will burn. Your own death, or someone else's. Without the Ecclesiarch's interpretive framework, these glimpses illuminate nothing—they just add knowledge without understanding, which the priests consider worse than ignorance.

### Settlements

Several towns cluster along Honor Creek:
- **Civicvler**: Near the creek's headwaters, in the Shorolyn Forest
- **Sarihalliler**: Downstream, where the terrain begins to level
- **Kochisar**: Near where the creek approaches the main Honor River system

These towns are small, dependent on forestry and the creek's water supply. Their priests maintain shrines warning visitors about the vision pools—and, some say, maintaining records of who goes looking for them.

### Location

Honor Creek flows through northeastern Avalon, roughly 30 miles from the Dern border at its closest point.
