# Ve

## Geography

Ve is a large, isolated continent to the far east of Alaria, separated from the main landmasses by vast ocean expanses. It stands apart—a world unto itself. The continent divides broadly into a drier northern half of savannah, plains, and desert, and a heavily jungled southern half dominated by wild beasts and ancient mysteries.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Alrock Ocean**: The vast ocean to the west, separating Ve from the rest of Alaria
- **Norswell Sea**: The northern waters
- **Sea of Fools**: The eastern ocean, what Meadow Sound opens to, lying due east of the Krell Lands. Despite its lovely appearance—filled with beautiful coral reefs and inviting waters—the Sea of Fools is treacherous. Every creature here, from the eels to the snails to the smallest reef dwellers, carries slow-acting poison. Not necessarily lethal, but awful nonetheless. The sea's beauty is a deadly lure, earning it the name "Sea of Fools" for those who trust what they see
- **Shadowreap**: Far to the east of Ve, north of the Sea of Fools, lies Shadowreap—a region where force and dark leylines intersect beneath the ocean. Massive clouds of pure darkness drift across the water, and sailing into them invites disaster. The combined power of force and darkness can tear ships apart, ripping hulls to splinters and scattering wreckage across the waves. Few vessels that enter Shadowreap return intact

### Continental Layout (Clockwise from Northwest)

**Northwest - Edari**: Savannah plains occupy the northwestern corner of Ve, a land of golden grasses and scattered trees.

**Shepherd's Stones**: Steep golden plains that form a natural barrier between Edari and Sestros, marking the transition between the two regions.

**North - Turquish Bay**: This bay separates Edari from Shyona, cutting into the northern coastline.

**Northeast - Shyona**: The largest state on Ve, occupying much of the northeastern region. Shyona is a Japan-inspired land of large plains (including the Gilded Plains), with dramatic **Yokani Cliffs** running along most of the eastern edge. The state extends south to **Meadow Sound**, a large inlet that penetrates deep into the continent where jungle meets the sea.

**East Coast - Wild Jungle**: South of Meadow Sound, the coast becomes untamed jungle.

**Southeast - Krell Lands**: The first major wild jungle region, occupying the eastern coastal jungle.

**South - Dygon Beast Lands**: A vast jungle stretching across the entire southern end of the continent from west to east. This is primordial wilderness, home to creatures found nowhere else.

**Southeast - Phyr Island**: A jungle island separated from the mainland by **Disaster Passage**, a treacherous strait.

**Southwest - Phriorys**: A region of hills between the Dygon Beast Lands and the Suki Jungle, home to the dragon **Pyaganos**.

**Southwest - Gulf of Chimea & Chimea**: The Gulf of Chimea indents the southwestern coast. The state of **Chimea** controls the **Suki Jungle** and extends through the Blood Mountains into the plains just south of Avalon. The Suki is divided into regions: South Suki and West Suki along the coasts, North Suki inland.

### The Widebarrow Mountains

A moderate-sized mountain range runs diagonally from the southwest to the northeast, roughly bisecting the continent. From south to north, it comprises:

- **Blood Mountains** (south): Home to an underground realm of vampiric gnomes
- **Mez**: Mountain state
- **Dern**: Mountain state
- **Thorum** (north): Northernmost mountain state

### Western Regions (North of the Mountains)

**Avalon**: Immediately north and west of the Widebarrow Mountains. A land of grasslands and forests, more temperate than the surrounding regions.

**Sestros**: North of Avalon. Transitions from plains in the south through savannah to desert in the north, including the **Red Desert**.

### North-Central Desert Region

Between Sestros and Shyona lie independent territories in a yellowy, arid landscape:

- **Hills of Dolor**: Hilly desert terrain with city-states
- **Dunes of Evioli**: Sandy desert with city-states
