## Yuki

Tags: citystate, ve, frontier, goblin

A fortified city-state in the Suki Hills, standing as the first line of defense against Krell expansion into Chimean territory. Yuki is a city of watchers, trappers, and survivors—people who've built their lives around the knowledge that the swarm could come any day.

### The Twin Cities

Yuki and its sister city Garlow exist in unusual symbiosis. Founded by refugees from the fallen Jaipon Confederacy roughly two centuries ago, the two cities were originally rival settlements competing for the same hilltop. When the first major Krell probe reached the hills in 3180 SD, the cities realized they would survive together or die separately.

Today, Yuki handles defense and diplomacy; Garlow handles production and supply. The cities are connected by a fortified road and share a common council, though each maintains its own internal governance. In practice, they function as a single entity with two geographic centers.

### The Etherweaver Population

Yuki's most distinctive feature is its goblin population. Roughly a third of the city's twelve thousand residents are etherweavers—the aether-producing goblin variant whose secretions fuel magical devices throughout Alaria. These goblins fled the Krell Lands during the Consumption, and their descendants have become integral to Yuki's survival.

The etherweavers maintain the city's defenses. Their aether powers the alarm systems, the communication network, and the devastating trap arrays that ring the hills. A Krell scout cannot approach within two miles of Yuki without triggering enchanted sensors that alert the entire garrison.

In exchange, Yuki provides the etherweavers with something rare: respect. Most of Ve views goblins as vermin or resources to be exploited. In Yuki, they sit on the council, own property, and are addressed as citizens. This has made the city a magnet for goblin refugees from across the region.

### Defenses

Yuki's survival depends on making Krell incursions too costly to sustain. The city has developed defensive doctrine over two centuries of skirmishes:

**The Kill Zones** — The approaches to Yuki are laced with traps: pitfalls, spike arrays, poison gas vents, and alchemical fire triggers. The trappers know exactly which paths are safe; everyone else gambles. These defenses are constantly maintained and regularly repositioned to prevent Krell scouts from mapping them.

**The Watchtowers** — A network of elevated positions throughout the Suki Hills, connected by aether-powered signaling devices. Watchers rotate through these posts, observing Krell movement patterns and providing early warning of any buildup near the border.

**The Burners** — Specialist teams equipped with alchemical incendiaries. When a Krell tunnel is discovered, the burners descend and flood it with fire. The work is dangerous, claustrophobic, and essential—a single overlooked tunnel can allow thousands of Krell to bypass surface defenses.

### Economy

Yuki survives on three industries:

**Aether Production** — The etherweavers produce a steady supply of goblin aether, which Yuki exports to Chimea, Shyona, and the western city-states. The quality is high, the supply is reliable, and the prices are steep. Yuki can afford to be expensive because the alternative sources involve enslaving goblins, which many buyers find distasteful.

**Intelligence** — Yuki knows more about the Krell Lands than any other settlement. Maps, patrol patterns, hive locations, seasonal behaviors—all of this information has value. Scholars, military planners, and treasure hunters pay well for Yuki's accumulated knowledge.

**Expedition Support** — Those mad enough to enter the Krell Lands usually stage from Yuki. The city provides guides (expensive), supplies (expensive), and extraction guarantees (extremely expensive, limited coverage). Most expeditions fail. Yuki profits regardless.

### Governance

The Twin Cities Council consists of twelve members: six from Yuki, six from Garlow, with the goblin population guaranteed at least two seats. The council handles inter-city matters; internal affairs remain with each city's own assemblies.

The current First Speaker is **Matron Vesara Koh**, a human woman whose family has held leadership positions since the founding. She's pragmatic, ruthless about defense spending, and surprisingly diplomatic with Chimea—whose military assistance Yuki may eventually need.

### The Unspoken Fear

Everyone in Yuki knows the math. The city has twelve thousand people. The nearest Krell hive has over two hundred thousand. If a queen ever decides to swarm west, Yuki's defenses will buy time—perhaps days, perhaps weeks—but they will not hold indefinitely.

The city plans for this possibility without discussing it openly. Evacuation routes are maintained. Supplies are cached along the road to Chimea. Children are taught the escape protocols as soon as they can walk.

Yuki exists because the Krell haven't seriously tried to take it yet. Everyone hopes that continues.
