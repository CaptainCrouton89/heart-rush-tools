## Draphilir

Tags: dragon, creature, ve, green

A green dragon who has claimed the eastern Dygon Beastlands—the region called Blyss—as her domain for over five centuries. Draphilir is patient, calculating, and profoundly territorial. Where her clutch-sibling Pyaganos rules through visibility and fear, Draphilir rules through rot, disease, and the certainty that she is always watching from somewhere you cannot see.

### Appearance

Draphilir is large even by dragon standards—her wingspan exceeds two hundred feet, and her body stretches nearly as long from snout to tail-tip. Her scales are the deep green of jungle canopy, darker along the spine and fading to yellowish-green on the underbelly. Centuries in the lightless depths of Blyss have given them a mottled pattern that breaks her outline against the foliage.

Her most distinctive feature is the **spore-growth** that covers portions of her hide. Patches of fungal matter—the same bioluminescent species that colonize her territory—grow directly on her scales, pulsing with faint light in the darkness. The growth is symbiotic; the fungi feed on dead tissue from her molts, and in return they provide camouflage, antibacterial protection, and—some believe—an extension of her sensory awareness.

Her eyes are pale yellow, almost luminescent, and they track movement in near-total darkness. Those who've survived encounters describe the experience of seeing those eyes appear in the shadows, realizing they'd been watched the entire time.

### Character

Draphilir is **patient** in ways that unsettle even other dragons. She doesn't react to provocation immediately—she waits, sometimes for years, until the perfect moment to respond. Insults to her dignity have been answered a decade later, when the offender had long forgotten the slight but Draphilir had not.

She is **possessive** to an extreme degree. Everything in Blyss belongs to her: the land, the creatures, the Ix'Meglyakuk tribes who pay her tribute. She doesn't share. She doesn't negotiate. Trespassers are either killed, driven out, or—if they prove interesting—added to her collection.

She is **curious** about things she doesn't understand, which is increasingly rare after eight centuries of life. Novel creatures, unusual magic, unprecedented situations—these things attract her attention in ways that can be either fortunate or catastrophic for the subject.

She **hates** her brother Pyaganos. The hatred is old, layered, and fundamental. They were clutch-siblings, hatched together, and they competed from their first breath. Centuries of territorial conflicts, betrayals, and grudges have calcified into something that transcends mere enmity. Given opportunity, she would destroy him utterly—but she's patient enough to wait for the right moment.

### The Green Rot

Draphilir's breath weapon is not fire but a **cloud of corrosive, spore-laden vapor**—the Green Rot that pervades her territory. The effects are devastating:

**Immediate:** Living tissue exposed to the breath begins to necrotize within seconds. Armor corrodes. Wood rots. Stone develops fissures as organic matter in the rock breaks down.

**Lingering:** Areas where Draphilir has used her breath retain traces of the rot for decades. The spores settle into soil and vegetation, creating "rot pockets" that can kill unwary travelers years after the original attack.

**Deliberate Seeding:** Draphilir has learned to control the concentration and dispersion of her breath. She can kill instantly or inflict slow, agonizing decay. She uses this control strategically, creating rot pockets at territorial boundaries, marking paths she wants to discourage, and—occasionally—as a form of torture for prisoners.

### The Lair

Draphilir's primary lair occupies a **massive sinkhole** in central Blyss, where an underground river surfaces briefly before diving back beneath the jungle floor. The sinkhole is nearly a mile across and several hundred feet deep, its walls thick with vegetation and fungal growth.

**The Approach:** No path leads to the lair. Draphilir clears approach routes periodically, ensuring the jungle remains impassable. The only way in is to cut through miles of dense growth—or to be invited.

**The Caverns:** Below the sinkhole, flooded caves extend deep into the earth. Draphilir can swim through sections completely submerged, reaching air pockets where she rests and stores her hoard. The water is dark with the same tannic compounds that fill the Blackpits to the west.

**The Hoard:** Five centuries of tribute, treasure from kills, and items collected for reasons only the dragon understands. The hoard includes expected valuables—gold, gems, artifacts—but also odder items: preserved specimens of extinct species, tablets inscribed in unknown languages, a collection of Ix'Meglyakuk skulls arranged by some organizing principle Draphilir won't explain.

### Relationships

**Pyaganos:** Her clutch-sibling and eternal rival. They've fought six wars over territorial boundaries since claiming their respective domains. The current truce—forty years old—is the longest period of peace in their shared history, but Draphilir is preparing for its end. She believes Pyaganos will strike first; she intends to be ready.

**The Thykkalu:** The Ix'Meglyakuk tribe that serves as her intermediaries. Draphilir treats them as useful tools—valued, maintained, but ultimately expendable. She protects them from other tribes because their service benefits her, not from any attachment.

**Outsiders:** Draphilir is more interested in the outside world than Pyaganos, though she expresses this interest differently. Where he invites observers into his territory, she sends the Thykkalu to gather information, building a picture of events beyond Blyss without revealing her own interest. She knows more about continental politics than most Ix'Meglyakuk realize.

### History

Draphilir and Pyaganos hatched from the same clutch roughly eight hundred and fifty years ago, somewhere in the mountains north of the Beastlands. They competed from the beginning—for food, for territory, for their mother's attention. When they matured enough to seek their own domains, they traveled south together, drawn by the Beastlands' abundance of prey.

**The First Division (circa 2,550 SD):** The siblings claimed adjacent territories—Pyaganos in the hills, Draphilir in the deep jungle. For a century, they maintained an uneasy peace, hunting their own grounds and avoiding conflict.

**The First War (2,661-2,679 SD):** A territorial dispute over hunting rights in the buffer zone erupted into open conflict. The war lasted eighteen years and killed thousands of Ix'Meglyakuk caught between the dragons. It ended inconclusively, with both siblings withdrawing to their cores.

**Subsequent Wars:** Five more conflicts followed, each lasting years or decades, each ending in bloody stalemate. The most recent (3,201-3,219 SD) saw Pyaganos push deep into Blyss before Draphilir counterattacked, creating the Burned Valley in Phriorys as she drove him back.

**The Current Truce (3,336 SD - present):** Established after the last war exhausted both dragons' patience for immediate conflict. Draphilir has spent the forty years since preparing—expanding her rot pockets, strengthening her grip on the Thykkalu, gathering intelligence. She believes the truce will end within a decade.

### Interactions

Draphilir rarely meets with outsiders directly. Those seeking audience must first negotiate with the Thykkalu, who will evaluate the request and—if they deem it worthy—arrange passage to the lair's edge. The dragon decides whether to appear.

**Approach:** Never enter Blyss uninvited. Draphilir considers all trespassers hostile unless they've received explicit permission. The Thykkalu can grant passage, but only the dragon can grant audience.

**Tribute:** Draphilir expects offerings from anyone seeking her attention. The nature of the tribute matters less than its quality—she's seen enough gold to be unimpressed by quantity. Unusual items, rare specimens, or valuable information are more likely to interest her.

**Conversation:** If Draphilir deigns to speak, expect questions. She interrogates visitors about the outside world, probing for information about politics, magic, and—always—Pyaganos. She offers little in return, and promises less. Making deals with Draphilir is possible but dangerous; she honors the letter of agreements while finding creative interpretations that serve her interests.

### Hooks

**The Rot's Spread:** The Green Rot is expanding beyond its historical boundaries. Rot pockets are appearing in territories that were safe a decade ago, and the Thykkalu claim Draphilir is responsible—but they won't say why. Someone with the skills to negotiate with a dragon might learn what's changed.

**The War's End:** The current truce is failing. Draphilir is positioning for the next conflict, but she lacks information about Pyaganos's current strength. She might hire outsiders to scout his territory—or she might need mediators to delay the inevitable war until she's ready.

**Something in the Caves:** The flooded caverns beneath Draphilir's lair connect to something else. The dragon has been spending more time below than usual, and the sounds rising from the water suggest activity. What she's found—or what's found her—remains unknown.
