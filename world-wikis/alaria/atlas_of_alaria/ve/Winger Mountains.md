## Winger Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, ve, krell

A smaller range in the central-southern Krell Lands, the Winger Mountains are less densely populated by the insects than their northern counterpart. Something about these peaks makes the Krell uncomfortable—they patrol the perimeter but rarely establish permanent hives within.

### Geography

The Wingers rise abruptly from the jungle floor, a compact range roughly thirty miles across at its widest point. The peaks are lower than the Hardshells—four thousand feet at most—but steeper, with dramatic cliff faces and deep ravines cutting through the rock.

The mountains are volcanic in origin, though no active eruptions have occurred in recorded history. Geothermal activity persists in the form of hot springs, steam vents, and the occasional sulfurous pool. The rock itself has a reddish tinge from iron oxidation.

### The Stone That Burns

Local legend speaks of "the stone that burns"—a substance found in the Wingers that causes Krell to avoid the area. Whether this is literal (some mineral that harms them on contact), chemical (fumes they can't tolerate), or mystical (an ancient ward) remains unclear.

What's confirmed: Krell scouts patrol the Winger perimeter but don't enter the peaks. Expeditions that reach the interior report finding no hive structures, no tunnel entrances, no sign of permanent Krell presence. This is unique within the Krell Lands.

Several theories circulate:

- **Geothermal gases** — The volcanic activity may produce fumes toxic to Krell respiratory systems
- **Mineral content** — The reddish rock may contain something the Krell can't process
- **Ancient magic** — Pre-Consumption civilizations may have warded the mountains
- **Territorial instinct** — Something else claimed this territory first, and the Krell recognize the claim

No theory has been proven. The Krell don't explain themselves.

### The Tomb of Theoron

The most significant ruin in the Wingers is the burial complex of King Theoron III, last ruler of the Kingdom of Theoron. According to histories preserved by refugees, the tomb contains the accumulated wealth of a three-century dynasty: gold, gems, magical artifacts, and the mummified remains of the king himself.

What makes the tomb unusual: the Krell show interest in it. Workers patrol the perimeter of the complex, circling endlessly without entering. They've done this for as long as anyone has observed. No one knows why.

Some speculate the tomb contains the source of whatever repels the Krell—and they're trying to find a way in to neutralize it. Others believe the Krell are guarding the tomb, though from what and for whom remains unexplained.

### Expedition Potential

The Wingers represent the safest region within the Krell Lands—"safest" being relative. Expeditions that reach the interior can operate without constant Krell harassment. This has made the range a target for treasure hunters, scholars, and anyone else willing to risk the journey through hostile territory.

The main obstacles are:

1. **Getting there** — The approach passes through active Krell territory
2. **The terrain** — The Wingers themselves are difficult to navigate
3. **The unknowns** — Whatever keeps the Krell out may not be friendly to humans either
4. **Getting back** — The return journey is just as dangerous

Several expeditions have reached the Wingers successfully. Fewer have returned. Of those that returned, most report finding nothing of value—empty ruins, barren peaks, volcanic hazards. Whether they're telling the truth or protecting profitable secrets is debated in Yuki's taverns.

### What Lives Here

If the Krell avoid the Wingers, something else must occupy the ecological niche. Reports are fragmentary and contradictory:

- Large predatory birds nesting on the cliffs (possibly the source of the range's name)
- Creatures in the hot springs that don't match any known species
- Lights moving on the peaks at night
- Sounds from underground that don't match any natural phenomenon

The pre-Consumption Kingdom of Theoron used these mountains for religious purposes. Temples and shrines dot the slopes, dedicated to deities that refugees no longer worship. What rituals occurred here—and what might have been summoned or bound—remains lost to history.
