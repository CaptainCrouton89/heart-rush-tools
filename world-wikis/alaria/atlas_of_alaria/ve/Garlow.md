## Garlow

Tags: citystate, ve, frontier, industry

The industrial heart of the Twin Cities, Garlow produces the weapons, traps, and supplies that keep Yuki's defenses functional. Where Yuki watches the border, Garlow forges the tools that make watching worthwhile.

### Character

Garlow is louder, dirtier, and more practical than its sister city. Forges run day and night. Alchemical workshops fill the air with acrid smoke. Workshops produce everything from crossbow bolts to tunnel-flooding pumps. The city smells of metal, chemicals, and sweat.

The residents are craftspeople first, soldiers second. Every adult in Garlow knows a trade—blacksmithing, alchemy, engineering, carpentry—and contributes to the Twin Cities' survival through production rather than patrol. Children apprentice as soon as they're old enough to hold tools.

This industrial focus creates a different culture than Yuki's watchful vigilance. Garlow people are builders, makers, problem-solvers. They take pride in the quality of their work and measure status by skill rather than martial prowess.

### The Workshops

Garlow's economy centers on several major production facilities:

**The Foundry** — The largest smithing operation in the Suki Hills, producing weapons, armor, and the metal components for Yuki's trap systems. Run by the Ironwright Guild, which maintains quality standards and apprenticeship programs.

**The Alchemist's Row** — A street of competing workshops producing poisons, incendiaries, acids, and other chemicals essential to Krell defense. The competition keeps prices reasonable and drives innovation, though occasional explosions remind everyone why the Row is located on Garlow's downwind edge.

**The Trapwright's Hall** — Where the deadliest defensive devices are designed and assembled. The guild that operates this facility guards its techniques jealously—trap designs are Garlow's most valuable intellectual property.

**The Aether Refineries** — Joint operations with Yuki's etherweavers, processing raw goblin aether into usable forms. The refineries produce everything from lamp fuel to enchantment catalysts.

### Governance

Garlow maintains its own city assembly for internal matters while participating in the Twin Cities Council for shared concerns. The assembly is dominated by guild representatives—master craftspeople whose economic power translates directly into political influence.

The current Assembly Speaker is **Forgemaster Daven Korr**, an aging human smith whose family has run the Foundry for four generations. He's conservative, production-focused, and skeptical of any expenditure that doesn't directly contribute to defense.

### Relations with Yuki

The Twin Cities' division of labor creates natural tensions. Yuki's watchers sometimes view Garlow as soft—civilians who don't understand the reality of the border. Garlow's craftspeople sometimes view Yuki as parasitic—warriors who consume resources without producing anything.

These tensions never escalate beyond grumbling. Both cities know they need each other. Yuki without Garlow would run out of weapons within a year. Garlow without Yuki would be overrun within a month. The arrangement works precisely because neither side can afford to let it fail.

### The Refugee Quarter

Garlow absorbs most of the Twin Cities' refugee population—survivors from the Krell Lands who trickle in over the years, displaced farmers from the borderlands, goblins seeking citizenship. The Refugee Quarter occupies the city's southern edge, a crowded district where newcomers learn trades and integrate into Garlow's workshop economy.

The Quarter has developed its own character over generations. Cuisines from the lost kingdoms survive here. Languages that haven't been spoken outside these streets for a century persist in family homes. Cultural practices from Theoron, Valifax, and the Jaipon Confederacy blend into something new—a community defined by what was lost and what was built in its place.

### What Garlow Makes

Beyond weapons and traps, Garlow produces:

- **Communication devices** — Aether-powered signaling equipment for the watchtower network
- **Protective gear** — Sealed suits for the burner teams, masks against Krell pheromones
- **Extraction equipment** — Ropes, harnesses, climbing gear for expedition teams
- **Trade goods** — Quality metalwork and alchemical products for export to Chimea and beyond

The city's reputation for quality draws buyers from across Ve. Garlow steel commands premium prices, and Garlow alchemicals are considered among the most reliable in the region.
