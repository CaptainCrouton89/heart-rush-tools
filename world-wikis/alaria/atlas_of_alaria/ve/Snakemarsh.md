## Snakemarsh

Tags: swamp, geography, ve, krell

A vast wetland in the western Krell Lands, fed by streams descending from the Hardshell Mountains. The Krell avoid deep water, making Snakemarsh one of the few refuges within their territory—though the serpentine inhabitants that give the marsh its name are not necessarily friendlier than the insects.

### Geography

Snakemarsh sprawls across perhaps forty square miles of low-lying terrain between the Hardshell Mountains and the jungle lowlands. The water is murky, warm, and slow-moving—a maze of channels, pools, and partially-flooded forest where dry ground is rare and temporary.

The marsh is fed primarily by mountain runoff, with water levels fluctuating dramatically between seasons. During the wet season, Snakemarsh expands to nearly double its dry-season extent. During the dry season, some areas become navigable by foot, though "navigable" is relative—the footing is treacherous and the snakes are always present.

### The Serpents

Snakemarsh hosts the highest concentration of serpent species in Ve. Dozens of varieties inhabit the waters, from finger-length swimmers to constrictors capable of taking down jungle cats. The marsh's namesakes dominate every ecological niche, competing with each other rather than with the Krell.

The largest species—locals call them "marsh lords"—reach lengths of thirty feet or more. These ambush predators lie motionless in the murk for days, then strike with explosive speed when prey ventures within range. They're a significant threat to humans, but their presence helps explain why the Krell don't enter the marsh in force.

Several serpent species are venomous. Some are edible. A few are both. The marsh-dwellers have learned which are which through generations of painful trial and error.

### Why the Krell Avoid It

Krell physiology doesn't handle deep water well. Their exoskeletons aren't watertight, their respiratory systems can't function when submerged, and their pheromone-based communication fails in wet environments. A single Krell can cross a stream; a swarm attempting to traverse Snakemarsh would lose cohesion and drown.

The marsh also disrupts Krell tunneling. The water table is too high, the substrate too soft. Any tunnel dug here floods immediately. This has made Snakemarsh a natural barrier to Krell expansion in certain directions.

Scouts patrol the marsh's edges, and occasionally small parties attempt crossings during the dry season. But these incursions are rare, limited, and easily avoided by anyone who knows how to read the Krell patrol patterns.

### The Marsh-Dwellers

A scattered population survives in Snakemarsh—refugees from the Consumption who fled here when their homes fell, and their descendants who've never known anywhere else. These marsh-dwellers live on elevated platforms built into the largest trees, fishing the channels and hunting the snakes that would otherwise hunt them.

The population is small, perhaps a few hundred across the entire marsh, organized into extended family groups that rarely interact. They speak a creole of the old languages, worship gods their ancestors abandoned elsewhere, and trust outsiders only slightly more than they trust the Krell.

What the marsh-dwellers know about the Krell Lands is valuable. They've watched the insects for generations, noted patterns that Yuki's watchers haven't observed, mapped approaches that don't appear on any chart. Traders who earn their trust can access information worth fortunes in the right markets.

### Navigating Snakemarsh

Travel through the marsh requires boats—flat-bottomed craft that can be poled through shallow channels. The marsh-dwellers build these from local materials and occasionally sell them to outsiders, though they rarely include guidance on which channels lead where.

The main hazards beyond serpents:

- **Getting lost** — The maze of channels all look similar; without local knowledge, travelers circle for days
- **Rising water** — Rain in the mountains can raise marsh levels within hours, stranding travelers on shrinking dry ground
- **Disease** — The water carries parasites and infections that target the unwary
- **The marsh-dwellers themselves** — Some view outsiders as threats, others as opportunities; neither response is reliably safe

### Strategic Value

Snakemarsh offers a route between the Suki Hills and the central Krell Lands that avoids the densest hive territories. The Southern Descent from the hills leads here, and from here, travelers can reach the Winger Mountains or the southern jungle without passing through Hardshell territory.

This makes the marsh valuable to expeditions seeking the Tomb of Theoron or other sites in the southern Krell Lands. It also makes it valuable to anyone who wants to move through Krell territory without being observed—smugglers, spies, and those with reasons to avoid Yuki's documentation requirements.
