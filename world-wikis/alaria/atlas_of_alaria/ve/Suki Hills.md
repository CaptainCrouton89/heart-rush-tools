## Suki Hills

Tags: hills, geography, ve, frontier

A range of forested highlands marking the western boundary of the Krell Lands, the Suki Hills serve as the last defensible terrain between the insectoid swarms and Chimea's eastern territories. The twin city-states of Yuki and Garlow anchor the human presence here.

### Geography

The Suki Hills rise gradually from the North Suki jungle to the west, reaching elevations of several hundred feet before descending steeply into the Krell-controlled lowlands to the east. The terrain is broken and irregular—ridges, valleys, and isolated peaks create natural defensive positions and limit the effectiveness of mass Krell assaults.

The hills are heavily forested with hardwoods distinct from the lowland jungle. The canopy is less dense here, the undergrowth more manageable. Streams run down from the heights, feeding the wetlands below.

The range extends roughly fifty miles north-to-south, with the Twin Cities occupying the central portion where the hills are highest and the defensive advantages greatest.

### Strategic Importance

The Suki Hills exist as a frontier for one reason: the terrain favors defenders. Krell swarms lose their numerical advantage in the broken ground. Their tunneling is hindered by rocky substrate. Their coordination falters when line-of-sight pheromone communication is blocked by ridges and forest.

This hasn't stopped Krell incursions—scouts probe constantly, and small hives have occasionally established in the eastern foothills—but it has prevented the overwhelming swarmings that consumed the lowland kingdoms. The hills buy time. Time to spot buildups, time to respond, time to evacuate if necessary.

### The Watchtower Network

A system of elevated observation posts spans the Suki Hills, positioned on ridges and peaks with clear sightlines into Krell territory. Each tower is staffed by rotating teams of watchers who monitor insect movement patterns and report via aether-powered signals.

The network has functioned continuously for nearly two centuries. Its data has allowed Yuki's strategists to predict Krell behavior, identify hive locations, and respond to incursions before they become crises. The towers themselves are built to be abandoned quickly—when a swarm approaches, the watchers flee rather than defend.

### The Approaches

Three main routes connect the Suki Hills to the Krell Lands proper:

**The Shell Road** — The most direct path, following a river valley toward the Hardshell Mountains. Heavily trapped and constantly monitored. Expedition teams typically use this route because it's the best-mapped, despite the danger.

**The Southern Descent** — A series of switchbacks leading toward Snakemarsh. Less monitored, more treacherous terrain. Smugglers and independent operators sometimes prefer this route to avoid Yuki's fees.

**The Ridge Path** — A high route along the hill crests, eventually descending toward the Winger Mountains. Exposed but offers long sightlines. Rarely used except by scouts.

### Life in the Hills

Outside Yuki and Garlow, the Suki Hills support a scattered population of hunters, trappers, and hermits. These hill-folk maintain a precarious existence, trading with the cities while avoiding both Krell incursions and the tax collectors who occasionally venture out from Chimea.

Some of these residents are refugees who never made it to the cities. Others are outcasts who found the Twin Cities' rules too constraining. A few are watchers who retired from the towers and couldn't bear to leave the frontier entirely.

The hill-folk know the terrain intimately. Their knowledge supplements the formal watchtower network—they notice things the watchers miss, track Krell scout patterns, and occasionally provide warnings that save lives. In exchange, Yuki and Garlow leave them alone.

### What Lies Beneath

The Suki Hills contain extensive cave systems, some natural, some excavated by unknown predecessors. These caves have been mapped and trapped by Yuki's defenders—they serve as shelters, supply caches, and fallback positions if the surface defenses fail.

The deeper caves remain unexplored. Stories circulate about pre-Krell ruins in the depths, about creatures that predate the insectoid invasion, about tunnels that connect to the old kingdoms' underground networks. No one has verified these claims, and few are willing to venture far enough underground to try.
