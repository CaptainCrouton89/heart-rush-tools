## Honor River

Tags: river, geography, ve, avalon

The central waterway of Avalon, flowing from the eastern highlands westward through the kingdom's heart before emptying into Munari Inlet. The Honor River valley contains Avalon's best farmland, its capital city, and most of its population.

### Course

The Honor River rises in the foothills where Avalon meets Dern, fed by snowmelt from the Widebarrow Mountains. It flows roughly 120 miles westward, passing through Tarolin before reaching Munari Inlet. The river is navigable for most of its length—shallow-draft boats carry goods between the coast and the interior.

Major tributaries include **Honor Creek** to the northeast and **Pale Run** to the south. The river also spreads into **Honor Moss**, a marshy region near Tarolin where the current slows and wetlands form.

### Settlements

The densest population in Avalon clusters along the Honor River. Tarolin, the capital, sits at the river's central bend. Smaller towns dot the banks upstream and down: Zindi, Incebolu, Kenzek, Burga, and dozens of villages dependent on the river for water, irrigation, and transport.

The main road through Avalon roughly parallels the river, connecting the coastal port of Ismail to the eastern settlements and eventually to Dern.

### Religious Significance

The Temptari don't worship the river itself, but they view it as evidence of the Ecclesiarch's providence. The river flows exactly where Avalon needs it, providing water to the fertile heartland, defense for the capital, and a transport route to the sea. This perfection is attributed to the Ecclesiarch's foresight—or perhaps to divine ordering of the land to match his visions.

Certain pools along the river are said to grant visions to those who drink from them. The priests warn against seeking such visions without guidance; uninterpreted glimpses of the future bring confusion more often than clarity.

### Practical Value

The Honor River makes central Avalon habitable and prosperous. Its waters irrigate the fields that feed the population. Its current carries trade goods. Its valley provides the flat, fertile land where most Temptari live and work.

Without the river, Avalon would be a minor forest kingdom. With it, the theocracy commands the most productive agricultural land on western Ve.
