## Avalon

Tags: region, state, ve, theocracy, time-magic

The heartland of Ve's time-magic theocracy, where the Grand Imperial Ecclesiarch has sat unblinking upon the throne for generations, seeing futures that guide every aspect of Temptari life. Avalon is a land of rolling grasslands and ancient forests, temperate and fertile, ruled by priests who declare children's destinies before they can walk.

### Geography

Avalon occupies central-western Ve, bounded by natural features that make its borders feel ordained:

**Boundaries:**
- **North**: Tukiwood and the plains of Sestros
- **East**: The Widebarrow Mountains and Dern
- **South**: Promisewood descending toward Chimea
- **West**: Munari Inlet and the open sea

The terrain is gentler than surrounding regions—rolling hills, broad river valleys, and mixed forests that provide timber without overwhelming the grasslands. The Honor River winds through the center, its banks supporting the densest population.

### Tarolin (Capital)

The seat of the Grand Imperial Ecclesiarch sits where the Honor River bends through the heart of Avalon. Tarolin is both capital and pilgrimage site, its central temple-palace housing the throne where the Ecclesiarch has sat, unblinking, for longer than anyone can remember.

The city is organized in concentric rings around the temple. The innermost ring houses the Solum Impervium—the Ecclesiarch's administrative hand—and the highest priests. Each successive ring holds lesser religious officials, then merchants and craftsmen, then the common faithful. Movement between rings requires permission from the appropriate authorities, who consult the Ecclesiarch's pronouncements to determine who may pass.

Tarolin's population approaches 40,000, making it Ve's largest city outside Shyona. Pilgrims swell this number during holy seasons, when the faithful come to hear the Ecclesiarch's pronouncements about the coming year.

### The Forests

Four major forests define Avalon's landscape:

**Goldwood** lies in the west, between the settled heartland and Munari Inlet. The trees here have distinctive golden-yellow bark that seems to glow in afternoon light. The forest is considered sacred to the aspect of time governing autumn and endings. Pilgrims visit to contemplate mortality.

**Pathanul** spreads across the northern reaches, a transitional forest between Avalon's heartland and the Sestran border. The trees are older here, and the priests say this is where time moves slowest in Avalon—minutes pass while hours elapse elsewhere. Whether this is literally true or theological metaphor, travelers report feeling disoriented in Pathanul's depths.

**Promisewood** dominates the south, a vast forest stretching toward the Widebarrow Mountains. The name refers to the promises made to children during their Declarations—the forest is where those declared for forestry, hunting, or druidic paths spend their training decades. Deep Promisewood is off-limits to casual visitors.

**Shorolyn Forest** covers the eastern highlands where Avalon meets Dern. Logging operations work its edges; the interior remains wild.

### The Honor River System

The **Honor River** rises in the eastern highlands and flows westward through Avalon's heart, eventually emptying into Munari Inlet. Its valley contains the kingdom's best farmland and most of its population.

**Honor Creek** branches northeast from the main river, draining the Pathanul region. The creek's waters are said to reveal glimpses of the future to those who drink from certain pools—though the priests warn that unguided visions bring madness more often than wisdom.

**Honor Moss** is the marshy region where the river slows near Tarolin, spreading into wetlands thick with reeds and waterfowl. The Moss produces medicinal herbs used in time-magic rituals.

**Pale Run** flows through the southern forests, eventually joining the river systems that drain toward Chimea.

### Ismail (Port City)

Where the Honor River empties into Munari Inlet stands Ismail, Avalon's window to the world. The city of perhaps 12,000 serves as the kingdom's primary port—nearly everything that enters or leaves Avalon by sea passes through Ismail's harbor.

The city sits at a natural chokepoint. The Honor River narrows as it approaches the coast, and Ismail controls both banks. Warehouses line the waterfront, storing goods moving between river barges and oceangoing vessels. The textile trade dominates—bolts of Goldwood-dyed cloth, time-touched ritual implements, and agricultural products flow outward, while metal goods, exotic materials, and foreign luxuries flow in.

Ismail's character differs from inland Avalon. The constant flow of foreigners—sailors, merchants, travelers—dilutes the theocracy's grip. The priests maintain temples and enforce the major observances, but Ismail's residents are more worldly than their rural cousins. Declarations still govern local children's lives, but visitors operate under looser rules, and the commerce-minded locals have learned to accommodate difference.

The harbor master, always a priest of high standing, balances religious duty against commercial necessity. Ships carrying forbidden goods (certain magical items, materials the Ecclesiarch has proscribed) are turned away. Ships carrying merely unusual cargo are taxed and monitored. The Ecclesiarch presumably foresees what passes through his port; the harbor master acts accordingly.

### Munari Inlet

The western coast curves around Munari Inlet, a protected natural harbor that makes Ismail possible. The inlet is named for a saint of the Ecclesiarch's faith—a priest who allegedly foresaw a great storm and evacuated the coast before it struck. The waters are calm, the sailing relatively safe, and the Temptari consider the inlet blessed.

Fishing villages dot the inlet's shores beyond Ismail, their catches supplementing the grain-and-meat diet of inland Avalon. The fishermen worship as faithfully as anyone, though their prayers focus on weather and tides rather than the abstractions that occupy Tarolin's theologians.

### Karahoroz

Avalon's eastern city, Karahoroz sits where the Honor River approaches Dern. It serves as administrative center for the eastern fiefdoms and as a trading hub with the mountain states. The city's priests maintain close ties with Dern—the mountain kingdom has its own traditions, but respects Avalon's theocracy enough to cooperate on border matters.

### Society

Life in Avalon follows patterns laid down generations ago by the Ecclesiarch's visions. At age eight, every child is brought before the local priest for their **Declaration**—a pronouncement of what their life will hold. Farmers' children are declared farmers. Soldiers' children might be declared soldiers, or might be declared for entirely different paths if the priest sees different futures.

The Declaration is final. Fighting one's Declaration is possible but brings social ostracism and religious condemnation. Most Temptari accept their fates—the Ecclesiarch sees truly, the priests interpret correctly, and individual desires are less important than cosmic order.

Partners are similarly assigned. The priests determine which unions will produce the children Avalon needs, and marriages are arranged accordingly. The system usually works. When it doesn't—when couples are miserable, when children are born outside assigned partnerships—the failures are attributed to corruption among minor priests rather than flaws in the system itself.

### Why It Matters

Avalon's time-magic tradition produces the most skilled temporal practitioners on Ve. Their military is tiny but devastating—soldiers trained from childhood in time manipulation, capable of knowing where attacks will land before they're launched. No neighbor has successfully invaded Avalon in recorded history.

The theocracy also provides stability. The Ecclesiarch's visions prevent famines (fields are planted where harvests will succeed), disasters (buildings are constructed where earthquakes won't strike), and most conflicts (problems are addressed before they grow). Life in Avalon is predictable, safe, and thoroughly controlled.

Whether this is paradise or prison depends on whether you trust the Ecclesiarch's sight—and whether your Declaration matched what you wanted from life.
