## Phyr Island

Tags: island, geography, cursed

A jungle island in southeastern Ve, separated from the mainland by the treacherous Disaster Passage. Phyr Island bears the scars of an ancient magical catastrophe—the land itself transformed by a curse that turned an army to stone and warped the jungle into something hostile to all life.

The island is roughly eighty miles east-to-west and sixty miles north-to-south. Dense jungle covers nearly every surface, broken only by the ridge of the Statue Hills running through the eastern interior. A single village, Attla, clings to the eastern shore.

Ships avoid Phyr Island. Those that must approach come through Further Sound to the east, anchoring in Safety Bay on the northern coast—the only approach that doesn't require navigating cursed waters or landing in cursed jungle.

### History

#### The Reign of Queen Haegstra

Phyr Island was not always cursed. Three centuries ago, it was home to a modest population of fisherfolk and jungle foragers who lived in scattered villages across the island. Then came Haegstra.

The histories disagree on what Haegstra was before she came to power. Some accounts call her a Chimean exile, a noblewoman cast out for practicing forbidden magic. Others claim she was native to Phyr, a village witch who grew too powerful. A few darker texts suggest she was never human at all—that she crawled up from something buried deep beneath the island.

What the histories agree on: Haegstra could turn living things to stone with a touch, a word, or—at the height of her power—simply by willing it. She consolidated control over the island's villages through terror. Those who resisted became statues in her garden.

She ruled for forty-three years. The islanders learned to obey.

#### The Invasion and the Curse

In 3,041 SD, the expanding power of Chimea sent a military expedition to claim Phyr Island. Three thousand soldiers landed on the western shore and marched inland toward Haegstra's tower.

They never reached it.

Haegstra met the army in the island's central highlands. The details of what followed are unclear—there were no survivors among the invaders, and the islanders who witnessed it from a distance speak only of a sound like breaking glass and a light that turned the sky gray.

When the light faded, three thousand soldiers stood frozen in stone. Horses, pack animals, war dogs—all petrified mid-stride. An entire army transformed into a forest of statues stretching across the hills.

But Haegstra had overreached. The magical energy released in that single act was catastrophic. The curse did not stop with the soldiers.

The jungle began to change. Trees hardened, their bark crystallizing into glass-like spines. Animals developed strange afflictions—partial petrification, stone growths, the ability to petrify prey. The waters around the western shore became deadly, filled with petrified reefs and creatures warped by the curse's residue.

And Haegstra herself was consumed. Her tower still stands in the northwestern jungle, but what remains of the queen is unknown. Some say she turned to stone like her victims. Others say she became something worse—neither alive nor dead, neither flesh nor stone, still waiting in the ruins for someone to wake her.

The surviving islanders fled east, beyond the Statue Hills, to the shores of Further Sound. Their descendants founded Attla and learned to live in the shadow of the curse.

### Geography

#### Disaster Passage

The strait separating Phyr Island from the Dygon Beastlands mainland, running roughly north-south along the island's western edge. The passage earns its name.

The waters are treacherous for multiple reasons:
- **Petrified reefs** lurk just below the surface—razor-sharp stone formations that can hull a ship before the lookout spots them
- **Unpredictable currents** twist through the strait, the result of the curse warping the water's flow in ways that defy navigation
- **Curse-touched creatures** hunt the passage—things that were once normal sea life, now partially petrified and predatory in ways their ancestors never were

Ships that must pass between Phyr and the mainland typically sail far to the south, around the island entirely, adding days to their journey rather than risk the passage.

#### Further Sound

The open water east of Phyr Island, connecting to the Sea of Fools to the south. Further Sound is relatively safe—the curse's effects diminish rapidly east of the Statue Hills. Ships approaching Attla come this way, and the sound sees occasional traffic from traders willing to deal with the islanders.

The name reflects the sound's position: further from Ve's mainland than any other named water, at the edge of the known world before the poisoned beauty of the Sea of Fools begins.

#### Safety Bay

A small inlet on Phyr Island's northern coast, sheltered by a curved arm of jungle-covered land. Safety Bay is the island's only reliable anchorage—the one approach that doesn't require navigating Disaster Passage or landing in curse-heavy jungle.

The bay earned its name honestly. Ships that anchor here and deal fairly with the people of Attla depart unharmed. The curse does not reach the bay's waters, and the jungle surrounding it is merely dangerous rather than actively malevolent.

A narrow trail leads from Safety Bay southeast to Attla, skirting the northern edge of the Statue Hills. The journey takes two days on foot. Attla's traders make it regularly; outsiders are advised to hire a guide.

### Regions

#### Jungle of Spines

The transformed jungle covering most of Phyr Island's western and central territory. What was once ordinary tropical forest is now something far more dangerous.

The trees themselves have changed. Their bark has crystallized into glass-like spines—sharp, brittle, and everywhere. Walking through the Jungle of Spines means constant small cuts unless you move with extreme care. These wounds would be merely painful in any normal jungle. Here, they can be fatal.

**Spine Sickness**: Wounds from the crystalline spines carry traces of the petrification curse. Left untreated, the flesh around the wound begins to harden over the following days. The process is slow—a week or more before it becomes dangerous—but inexorable. The hardening spreads from the wound site, eventually reaching vital organs. Death comes when the heart turns to stone.

The people of Attla know remedies: poultices made from certain eastern plants, rituals involving salt water and moonlight, careful excision of affected tissue. These treatments work if applied early. Visitors to Phyr Island are advised to either avoid the Jungle of Spines entirely or travel with someone who knows the cures.

The jungle's wildlife has adapted in various ways. Some creatures have developed immunity to the spine sickness. Others have become carriers—their bites or scratches transmit the curse more efficiently than the spines themselves. A few have evolved partial petrification as a defense mechanism, their hides studded with stone growths that turn aside predators' teeth.

#### Statue Hills

A ridge of hills running roughly north-south through Phyr Island's eastern interior, separating the Jungle of Spines from the relatively safer eastern shore. The hills take their name from what stands upon them.

Three thousand soldiers. Frozen in stone. Still there after three centuries.

The army that invaded Phyr Island in 3,041 SD remains exactly where Queen Haegstra stopped them. Stone legionnaires stand in marching formation, their faces frozen in expressions ranging from confusion to terror to simple blankness—those who were petrified before they understood what was happening. Stone horses rear or stand placidly. Stone supply wagons sit with stone goods still loaded. Stone war dogs crouch mid-lunge or lie curled as if sleeping.

Time and weather have damaged some of the statues. Arms have broken off. Faces have eroded. A few have toppled entirely, lying in fragments among the undergrowth. But most remain standing, an army that will never complete its march.

**The Treasures of the Hills**: The petrified soldiers still carry their equipment. Weapons, armor, coins, personal effects—three thousand soldiers' worth of military gear, untouched for three centuries. The temptation to loot the Statue Hills draws occasional treasure hunters to Phyr Island.

Most of them regret it. The curse lingers strongest here, at the site of its origin. Spending too long among the statues—sleeping in their shadow, touching them, disturbing their belongings—accelerates the spine sickness dramatically. Treasure hunters who fill their packs with ancient coins often find their fingers hardening before they reach the coast.

The people of Attla occasionally harvest from the hills, but carefully. They know which areas are safer, how long they can stay, which items carry more of the curse than others. They do not share this knowledge freely.

**The Soldiers' Faces**: Most statues show confusion or terror. But roughly two hundred show something else: recognition, calm acceptance, faint smiles.

These were Haegstra's agents—cultists and spies planted within the Chimean army. They fed her information about the invasion's timing and route. They believed she would spare them, or reward them, or grant them a place in her new order.

She petrified them with everyone else.

The Attla elders know this history. They can identify the smiling statues by unit position—the spies were concentrated in the command staff and supply trains, where they could do the most damage. Some treasure hunters specifically seek these statues, believing the agents carried hidden valuables or coded information. A few have found small caches. Most have found only stone and spine sickness.

The smiling faces are not a mystery. They're a reminder that Haegstra used people, then discarded them.

### Locations

#### Queen Haegstra's Tower

A ruined fortress in the northwestern interior of Phyr Island, deep within the Jungle of Spines. The tower was Haegstra's seat of power during her forty-three-year reign, and the site from which she worked the curse that transformed the island.

The tower still stands, though barely. The upper floors have collapsed. The walls are cracked and overgrown with crystalline vines. The main gate hangs open, has hung open for three centuries, as if inviting visitors.

No one goes there.

The Jungle of Spines is at its worst near the tower—the spines longer, sharper, the curse stronger. Creatures that would flee humans elsewhere on the island grow aggressive near the tower, as if defending it. The few expeditions that have attempted to reach the ruins report feeling watched, hearing sounds that couldn't be natural, seeing movement in the peripheral vision that vanished when looked at directly.

Some expeditions have reached the tower. Fewer have returned. Those who did describe:
- Chambers filled with statues that weren't soldiers—islanders, Haegstra's subjects, arranged in poses of supplication or service
- A throne room with a throne of fused stone, multiple petrified bodies melted together into a seat
- Sounds from below, from chambers beneath the tower, a rhythmic pulse like breathing or grinding stone
- The certainty, irrational but absolute, that something down there was aware of them

**The Petros Shard**: Beneath the tower, in chambers carved long before Haegstra arrived, lies the source of her power: a fragment of elemental earth roughly the size of a human torso, pulsing with petrification magic. The shard is not truly alive, but it responds to proximity and intent. It grants petrification abilities to those who bond with it—touch it, accept its presence in their mind, let it partially transform their flesh.

Haegstra found the shard when she first came to Phyr. She was its third known wielder. The ruins beneath the tower predate human settlement on Ve; whatever species carved them left no other trace.

The shard is why the curse persists. It's the engine that powers everything—the spine sickness, the warped creatures, the petrified army. Destroying it might end the curse. Or it might release three centuries of accumulated magical energy in a single catastrophic burst.

**What Haegstra Became**: When Haegstra petrified the army, the magical backlash didn't kill her. It *dispersed* her.

Her consciousness fused with the curse itself. She didn't die—she became the crystalline spines, the petrified reefs, the stone soldiers, the warped creatures. The curse IS Haegstra. Every spine that breaks skin carries a fragment of her awareness. Every statue contains a sliver of her attention. The island is her body now.

For three centuries, she's been fragmented—present everywhere but coherent nowhere, her mind shattered across thousands of cursed objects. But she's slowly reassembling. The shared dreams that occasionally sweep through Attla are Haegstra becoming focused enough to reach out intentionally. The lights in the tower are her attention gathering at the shard, the center of her distributed self.

The Attla elders understand this. They've tracked the dreams for generations, noting their increasing frequency and clarity. Thirty years ago, the dreams came once a decade. Now they come several times a year. Haegstra is waking up.

She won't have a body. But within another generation, she'll likely be coherent enough to direct the curse precisely—extend spines toward specific targets, control the creatures as extensions of her will, perhaps animate the stone soldiers as puppets. The island will stop being passively dangerous and become actively hostile.

The elders don't share this knowledge with outsiders. They don't want treasure hunters getting ideas about "killing the curse" by destroying the shard. An uncontrolled release could petrify everything within miles—including Attla.

#### Attla

A fishing village on Phyr Island's eastern coast, home to approximately three hundred permanent residents. Attla is the only surviving settlement on the island—the descendants of those who fled east when the curse transformed their home.

The village occupies a sheltered cove facing Further Sound, with the Statue Hills rising to the west. The location was chosen deliberately: the hills block the worst of the curse's effects, and the eastern waters remain safe for fishing. Three centuries of isolation have made Attla self-sufficient by necessity.

**The People of Attla**: The villagers are ethnically similar to the peoples of Chimea and the Dygon Beastlands—their ancestors came from the same stock. But three centuries of isolation have given them distinct traditions.

They know the curse intimately. Every child learns to recognize spine sickness, to prepare the poultices that slow it, to perform the rituals that can halt it entirely if caught early. They know which paths through the hills are safer, which seasons see the curse wax stronger, which signs indicate that something has stirred in the western jungle.

They are not hostile to outsiders, but neither are they welcoming. Visitors bring disruption—and on Phyr Island, disruption can be fatal. Traders who deal fairly and follow local guidance are tolerated. Those who ignore warnings or express interest in the tower are encouraged to leave.

**Trade**: Attla trades with the occasional ship from Further Sound. They offer:
- **Preserved fish** and other seafood from the uncursed eastern waters
- **Curse remedies**—the poultices and preparations that treat spine sickness, valuable to anyone planning to explore the island's interior
- **Carefully harvested artifacts** from the Statue Hills, selected for low curse contamination and sold only to buyers who understand the risks
- **Information** about the island, its dangers, and its history—for a price

They seek:
- Metal tools and weapons (the island has no smithing tradition)
- Cloth and textiles
- Salt (essential for their preservation methods and their curse treatments)
- News from the mainland

**The Village Council**: Attla is governed by a council of elders who make decisions by consensus. The council's primary concern is the village's survival, which means maintaining the careful balance between isolation and trade, between safety and opportunity.

The council controls access to the Statue Hills. No one harvests from the hills without council permission, and the council decides which artifacts can be sold and which must remain buried. They are not sentimental about the soldiers—the invasion was three centuries ago, and the petrified army tried to conquer their ancestors—but they are practical about the curse.

### Threats and Opportunities

#### For Players

Phyr Island offers several hooks for adventuring parties:

**The Treasure of the Statue Hills**: Three thousand soldiers' worth of military equipment, untouched for three centuries. Ancient weapons, armor, coins, and personal effects—enough to make a party wealthy. But the curse makes looting dangerous. A party would need to work with Attla's council, learn the safe methods, and still accept significant risk.

**The Tower Expedition**: The Petros Shard sits beneath the tower, still granting power to anyone willing to bond with it. A wealthy patron in Chimea wants it recovered—or destroyed. A scholar in Shyona wants to study it. A cult that worships earth elementals considers it a holy relic. Someone will pay for access. The party would need to traverse the Jungle of Spines at its worst and deal with Haegstra's concentrated attention at the curse's source.

**The Cure**: The shard grants petrification abilities. It might also hold the key to reversing them. Someone afflicted with late-stage spine sickness—or someone who loves them—might pay anything for the chance to touch the shard and bargain with whatever intelligence guides it. The elders of Attla know this is possible. They also know it's never worked; the shard takes more than it gives.

**Racing the Clock**: Haegstra is reassembling. The Attla elders have tracked the pattern for generations—thirty years ago, the shared dreams came once a decade; now they come several times a year. Within another generation, she'll be coherent enough to direct the curse intentionally. Someone needs to stop this before the island becomes actively hostile. The options: destroy the shard (risking catastrophic magical release), find a way to further fragment Haegstra's consciousness, or evacuate Attla before it's too late.

**Chimea's Unfinished Business**: The army that Haegstra petrified was Chimean. Three centuries later, some in Chimea consider the soldiers' recovery a matter of national honor—and the treasure they carried a matter of national interest. A Chimean expedition with military backing might arrive, expecting to succeed where their ancestors failed. They won't listen to warnings from a fishing village. They'll make everything worse.
