## Keshwindi

Tags: citystate, settlement

The city-state of the nameless. Keshwindi rises from the Hills of Dolor like a rebuke to the desert that was meant to kill its founders—a sprawl of mud-brick buildings, shaded markets, and terraced gardens fed by deep wells. Its people are halflings: small in stature, fierce in pride, and bound together by the shared disgrace that brought them here.

### The Nameless Ones

Keshwindi's population descends from exiles. In Shyona, to betray one's family is the ultimate dishonor. The punishment is exile and the stripping of one's name—offenders become *nobody*, erased from family records, forbidden to speak their former identity. These nameless ones were sent into the desert to die.

They didn't.

The first exiles who survived the Hills of Dolor were Shontobi nobles and the servants who followed them into disgrace. Over generations, these two groups merged. Former masters and former servants rebuilt themselves as something new: a people defined not by the families that rejected them, but by their refusal to disappear. They call themselves halflings—reclaiming the Shontobi slur for the nameless ("half-people," those without identity) as a badge of defiance.

Physically, Keshwindi halflings are shorter than their Shontobi ancestors, a trait that emerged over centuries of intermarriage and harsh desert conditions. Whether this is natural adaptation or something stranger—some whisper of old curses woven into Shontobi bloodlines—remains debated by scholars who will never receive a straight answer from Keshwindi itself.

### Princess Keleila Watazari

Keshwindi is ruled absolutely by Princess Keleila Watazari, called the "Desert Beauty" across Ve. She holds no council, recognizes no nobles, answers to no law but her own judgment. Her word reshapes Keshwindi's policies overnight. Her displeasure ends careers—or lives.

She chooses mercy.

Exiles arrive in Keshwindi broken: nameless, ashamed, often starving from the journey through the Hills of Dolor. Keleila welcomes them. She provides housing, work, a place in her city. She asks nothing of their past crimes. In Keshwindi, everyone begins again.

This generosity is genuine—and calculated. Keleila understands that every exile she saves becomes loyal to her personally, not to whatever faction or family they once served. Her kindness builds an unshakeable power base of people who owe her everything.

The other edge of her rule is less visible but no less real. Those who threaten Keshwindi, who scheme against her, who attempt to exploit her mercy—they discover why no coup has ever succeeded. Keleila was a legendary blade-dancer before her own exile, trained in Shyona's deadliest schools. She remains dangerous. More dangerous still is her network of utterly loyal agents, many of them exiles who repay her welcome with absolute devotion.

She is not soft. She has chosen kindness from a position of absolute strength.

### The Goldwatch Compact

Keshwindi is poor. The Hills of Dolor produce little—some copper mining, goat herding, subsistence gardens around the wells. What Keshwindi has is *people*: generations of exiles who were once Shontobi warriors, trained from childhood in the blade.

Gnotobi, the neighboring city-state, is rich beyond measure—but its ruling merchant families are schemers, not fighters. They need protection for their drug caravans, their river shipments, their council members' lives.

The **Goldwatch Compact** binds the two city-states. Keshwindi provides soldiers; Gnotobi provides gold.

The **Goldwatch** mercenary company is Keshwindi's largest employer. Mostly halfling warriors, they guard Orange Flake shipments along the Golden River, patrol Gnotobi's streets, and provide muscle for the Harvest Council's internal disputes. The work pays well. The irony is bitter: exiled for dishonor, now selling their swords to protect a drug empire.

Princess Keleila negotiated the Compact and takes a percentage of every Goldwatch contract. This is how she funds Keshwindi's generosity—her open arms are paid for in Orange Flake money. She doesn't discuss this publicly.

### Society and Culture

Keshwindi operates on deliberate amnesia. No one asks about your past. No one uses family names. Children are raised communally in neighborhood groups rather than households, preventing the reformation of dynastic structures. The only titles that matter are those earned in Keshwindi itself.

This creates a society of radical equality and radical instability. Without family networks, status depends entirely on current reputation. A merchant can rise to prominence in a decade; a falling-out with the wrong people can destroy everything just as fast. Keshwindi politics are vicious precisely because no one has inherited protection.

The exception is Princess Keleila herself, whose position has solidified over her long reign into something approaching sacred. To most Keshwindi, she *is* the city.

### Architecture and Layout

Keshwindi clusters around its wells. The city has no walls—the desert itself is defense enough—but its buildings press close together, creating shaded alleyways and covered markets that stay cool even in the worst heat. Mud-brick construction dominates, with buildings rarely exceeding two stories. Wealthier residents paint their homes in desert colors: ochre, sand, rust-red.

The **Princess's House** is modest by the standards of rulers—a sprawling compound rather than a palace, distinguished mainly by its gardens. Keleila receives petitioners in an open courtyard, sitting on cushions like everyone else.

### Relations

**Gnotobi**: Economic partnership through the Goldwatch Compact. Gnotobi needs Keshwindi's soldiers; Keshwindi needs Gnotobi's gold. Neither city fully trusts the other.

**Shyona**: Officially, Shyona considers Keshwindi a den of criminals and traitors. Unofficially, Shyona's noble houses rely on Keshwindi's existence—it gives them somewhere to send exiles rather than executing them. Some houses maintain quiet contacts, occasionally "losing" family members to the desert rather than acknowledging their disgrace publicly.

**Sestros**: Minimal contact. Sestros lies to the west, separated by more desert. Some trade passes through, but neither state has much the other wants.
