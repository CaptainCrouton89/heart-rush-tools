## Blisterswamp

Tags: swamp, geography, ve, krell

A caustic wetland near the western edge of the Krell Lands, where geothermal activity creates bubbling pools of acidic water that nothing—not even the Krell—can tolerate. The swamp marks the border between Krell territory and Chimea's eastern claims.

### Geography

Blisterswamp occupies a shallow depression roughly fifteen miles across, where underground heat sources interact with surface water to create an environment hostile to most life. The "blisters" that give the swamp its name are bubbling pools of superheated, acidic water that can strip flesh from bone in minutes.

Steam drifts constantly across the swamp, limiting visibility and creating an eerie, shifting landscape. The water ranges from merely scalding near the edges to immediately lethal near the thermal vents. Solid ground is rare, and what exists is often caked with mineral deposits that crumble underfoot.

The swamp's western edge bleeds into the North Suki jungle, creating a natural boundary that neither Chimea nor the Krell have interest in crossing.

### Why Nothing Lives Here

The combination of heat, acid, and mineral toxicity makes Blisterswamp essentially lifeless. No fish swim in its waters. No plants grow along its shores. Even insects avoid the steam plumes. The few creatures adapted to such environments—extremophile microorganisms, certain heat-resistant arthropods—aren't prey anything else would want.

This makes Blisterswamp unique in the Krell Lands: a genuinely empty zone. The insects don't enter because there's nothing to eat and the environment would kill them. Humans don't enter because the environment would kill them faster.

### The Jaipon Ruins

The most significant feature near Blisterswamp is the ruined fortress-city of Jaipon, visible on the swamp's eastern edge where the caustic waters give way to regular jungle. The city's founders apparently chose this location deliberately—the swamp served as a natural moat against threats from the east.

The strategy worked until the Krell came from the north instead.

Today, Jaipon's towers rise above the jungle canopy, visible from miles away. Its walls still stand. Its gates remain closed. No one has entered and returned in over a century, and the combination of Krell patrols and caustic swamp makes the approach extremely dangerous.

### Border Zone

Blisterswamp effectively marks the Chimea-Krell border in this region. Neither side patrols it—there's nothing to patrol. Occasionally, Chimean scouts skirt the western edge to observe Krell movements; occasionally, Krell workers investigate the eastern edge for reasons unclear to observers.

The swamp's impassability creates a natural peace. Chimea doesn't worry about Krell incursions from this direction, and the Krell apparently don't consider the acidic wasteland worth expanding into.

### Crossing Blisterswamp

It's possible, barely, to cross the swamp rather than going around it. The route requires:

- Detailed knowledge of which areas are merely dangerous versus immediately fatal
- Heat-resistant equipment (boots, gloves, face protection)
- Alchemical treatments to neutralize acid exposure
- Perfect timing—crossing during thermal surges is suicide
- Speed—the longer you're in the swamp, the worse the cumulative damage

A few expeditions have used this route to reach Jaipon from Chimean territory, avoiding the Krell-patrolled approaches from the north. Most failed. The successful ones report that the crossing took hours, cost them equipment, and left survivors with chemical burns that took months to heal.

Why bother? Because whatever Jaipon contains is supposedly worth it. The fortress-city was the seat of a confederacy that once rivaled Theoron in wealth. If its vaults remain intact, the treasures inside could make a small army rich.

### The Steam Prophets

Local legend speaks of figures who walk through Blisterswamp unharmed—robed shapes that appear in the steam, deliver cryptic messages to those nearby, then vanish. Chimean border guards have reported these sightings; so have Krell-watchers from Yuki.

Most dismiss the stories as heat-induced hallucination. A few scholars theorize the geothermal activity has created some kind of planar weakness—the steam serving as a medium for communication from elsewhere. No one has investigated seriously, because investigating would require entering the swamp.
