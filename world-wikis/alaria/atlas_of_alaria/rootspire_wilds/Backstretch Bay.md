## Backstretch Bay

### Geography

Backstretch Bay is a vast sheltered arm of the Slumbering Abyss that curves into the eastern edge of the Rootspire Wilds, protected from the ocean's main currents by a series of submerged ridges and a narrow entrance channel barely a quarter-mile wide. The bay spans nearly thirty miles across at its widest point, with a shoreline of dense, impenetrable mangrove forests and rocky outcrops that rise in places to sheer cliffs two hundred feet high.

Every significant river and tributary in the Rootspire Wilds eventually drains into Backstretch Bay. The water is a murky green-brown—not from pollution, but from the sheer volume of organic matter flowing in from the jungle. The bay's depth varies wildly: shallow brackish estuaries near the river mouths give way to trenches over a thousand feet deep near the entrance channel, where the water turns dark and cold.

The isolation is nearly absolute. The overland approach requires cutting through miles of hostile jungle. The narrow entrance makes maritime approach treacherous during storms, and the bay's currents are unpredictable, with sudden reversals that have claimed ships. No port has ever been established here. No settlement larger than a temporary camp has ever taken root.

### Ecosystem

Backstretch Bay is not a normal ecosystem. It is a fossil of one.

Millions of years ago, during the waning years of the Second Eon, the bay became progressively cut off from broader oceanic circulation. A combination of geological drift, sedimentation, and shifting currents gradually transformed it from a thriving coastal region into an enclosed system. As the world outside changed—as species adapted, migrated, or vanished—Backstretch Bay remained sealed off, a pocket of deep time.

Species that went extinct everywhere else persisted here. Predators with no natural competition developed in isolation. Prey animals evolved nowhere else to hide. The result is an explosion of biodiversity so dense that the ecosystem has become nightmarishly productive. There is almost no empty niche. Almost every creature here is either hunting or being hunted, with little room for anything passive or timid.

The waters are thick with life at every depth. Bioluminescent mollusks drift near the surface at night, their shells glowing in complex patterns that serve purposes no living scholar has deciphered. Armored fish that can breathe air gulp at the surface, their scaled hides thick enough to resist most predator bites. Amphibious creatures with too many limbs—six, eight, sometimes more—hunt in the shallows, built for movement both in water and on land in ways that defy easy explanation. Some appear transitional, as if evolution itself is still making up its mind about them.

The deeper water is worse. Expeditions that have ventured into the bay's central depths report shapes moving at the limits of visibility—massive silhouettes that match descriptions from ancient bestiaries, creatures sketched in margins of old natural histories with the notation "possibly extinct" or "unconfirmed sighting." No one has managed to capture or definitively study these deep-water inhabitants. Whatever they are, they stay in the dark water and have little interest in the shallows where humans operate.

### Inhabitants

Backstretch Bay has no permanent human inhabitants. Every attempt to establish a settlement has failed catastrophically. The wildlife is simply too numerous, too aggressive, and too well-adapted to predation. A group of settlers can survive days, perhaps weeks, but eventually they draw attention from something larger. Disappearances are common. Recovery of bodies is rare.

The locals of the Rootspire Wilds—the scattered communities that border the jungle—treat Backstretch Bay with a mixture of fear and pragmatism. They know it is dangerous. They also know what it provides.

### Notable Species

The bay is home to hundreds of species large enough to be individually noteworthy, most of them poorly understood. A few have been documented by expeditions:

**Luminant Mollusks** - Shells up to eighteen inches across, capable of producing light patterns in multiple colors. The flesh inside has no apparent eyes and does not react to light stimuli, suggesting the bioluminescence serves some form of communication entirely foreign to surface-dwelling experience.

**Ironscales** - Fish ranging from three to six feet long, covered in metallic-gray interlocking plates strong enough to turn aside a crossbow bolt at moderate range. Their teeth are grinding plates rather than sharp points, suggesting a diet of hard-shelled prey. They school in shallow water and are known to breach onto mudflats to pursue smaller prey.

**Tentacle-Swimmers** - A loose category encompassing various squid-like creatures, some enormous. Expedition scouts report specimens with arm-spans exceeding twenty feet, with suction cups the size of a human palm. Most appear to hunt in deeper water, but smaller varieties sometimes venture into the estuaries. They are fast, intelligent, and have been known to attack boats they perceive as threats.

**The Walkers** - Six-legged amphibious predators, typically eight to twelve feet long, built low to the ground with powerful rear limbs built for launching. They hunt along the mangrove fringe and in shallow water, working in coordinated groups. Their bite is deeply poisonous. Expeditions report that a single Walker's venom can incapacitate a large animal, and they typically attack prey in packs of three to seven. Their intelligence appears genuine—they have been observed coordinating hunts and setting ambushes.

**Deep Shapes** - Unconfirmed but extensively reported. Massive shadows in the central bay moving with purpose and grace. One expedition reported observing a shape moving at depth that was "at least the length of a trading vessel," with movement suggesting predatory grace rather than passive drifting. No specimen has ever been secured.

### Expeditions & Harvesting

Despite the danger, Backstretch Bay attracts regular expeditions. The incentive is simple: alchemical specimens.

The creatures of Backstretch Bay produce materials of extraordinary rarity and potency. Venoms from deep-water predators carry properties unlike anything found elsewhere—some paralytic, some hemorrhagic, some producing effects that conventional toxicology cannot explain. Glandular secretions from Walker-class predators have been documented to possess remarkable properties for various alchemical applications. The scales of armored fish can be worked into protective compounds. The eyes of deep-water creatures, preserved in certain oils, serve purposes in optical and scrying applications. Even the shell fragments of bioluminescent mollusks have trade value as components for luminous inks and compounds.

A successful expedition—one that returns with a substantial harvest—can fund a major laboratory's operations for decades. A single dried Walker venom sac has been known to sell for prices that would purchase a good house in any major city. The rarest specimens, if verified as authentic, can change a collector's fortune.

Expeditions typically work in teams of five to fifteen people, heavily armed and working quickly. Routes are established overland through the jungle, following rivers to their mouths to reach natural collection points. Most teams work the estuaries and mangrove fringe, where specimens are abundant but slightly less immediately lethal. Very few expeditions venture into open water. Almost none return from the deep.

The successful groups are methodical. They understand the danger is not mystical but biological—they hunt creatures that are genuinely dangerous, and they accept the possibility of casualties. Expedition scouts are well-paid, well-armed, and equipped with detailed maps of approach routes, safe zones, and recovery points. A failed harvest means lost time and money. A failed expedition can mean lost lives.

Yet they keep coming. The specimens of Backstretch Bay are simply too valuable, too rare, too impossible to acquire anywhere else.
