# Umbral Hills

The Umbral Hills lie on the eastern edge of the Rootspire Wilds, where they rise toward the Real Forest that dominates Nykotheryx Amberylika. Low, rolling formations rather than true mountains, they mark a threshold—a place where the rules governing the natural world begin to fray at their edges.

These hills exist in perpetual twilight. Some say the dense canopy of the Real Forest blocks the sun, but those who have climbed them report that clouds gather unnaturally close, as if the sky itself drains of light in layers. The sensation of moving through shadow is inescapable, even at midday. Flora here is strange and subdued—pale green, strangely luminescent in the gloom, things that seem to grow sideways and in spirals.

The Umbral Hills serve as a buffer zone between two different kinds of wild. The Rootspire Wilds are dangerous in comprehensible ways: territorial creatures, difficult terrain, hostile weather. The Real Forest is something else entirely—a place where time moves differently, where thought shapes reality, where even experienced druids proceed with caution. The Umbral Hills are where travelers can feel the difference most acutely.
