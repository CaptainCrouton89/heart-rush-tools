# Magera's Palace

Magera's Palace is not a palace, and Magera is not a ruler.

The structure sits where the White River slows and pools before continuing its journey toward Dalizi—a seemingly impossible construction of living wood, shaped stone, and organic growth rising from the water's edge. Towers spiral upward in patterns that hurt to trace. Halls extend into darkness that shouldn't fit within the walls. The architecture breathes.

Below it, something sleeps.

## The Sleeper

Magera predates the titans.

When Azus shaped the first life 235 million years ago, Magera was already old. The entity—if entity is the right word for something that exists partially outside conventional categories—settled along what would become the White River during an age when the land itself was still cooling. It curled there, and it slept.

It has not moved since.

Over the eons, the world grew around it. Sediment accumulated. Vegetation took root in its stillness. When the druids came to the Rootspire Wilds after the Ezz Rift, they found Magera already wrapped in millennia of growth, a hill that breathed once every few centuries, a foundation that dreamed.

The druids recognized what they'd found. They built upon it.

## The Structure

What stands today is the work of 120 million years of druid cultivation—a living throne grown from Magera's sleeping form, fed by the White River, maintained by those who understand that the foundation is not stone.

The visible architecture includes:

**The Breathing Halls** — The main chambers, where the walls expand and contract in a rhythm too slow for most visitors to perceive. Over hours, you notice the corridors have narrowed or widened. The druids navigate by this rhythm; outsiders find it disorienting.

**The Root Towers** — Spires that appear to be wood but are actually calcified portions of Magera's exterior, grown through with living vines the druids maintain. The highest offers views across the Wilds. The lowest descends into chambers that are no longer entirely within normal space.

**The River Halls** — Sections where the White River flows through the structure itself, channeled through living aqueducts. The water here carries trace impressions of Magera's dreams—nothing coherent, just the occasional sense that someone vast is watching from very far away.

**The Deep Roots** — Below the water line, the structure continues downward. The druids descend there for rituals they don't explain. The chambers grow warmer as you descend, and the walls are less wood than something else—something that might be tissue, might be stone, might be neither.

## The Conclave

The druids of Magera's Palace are the closest thing the Rootspire Wilds has to governance—though governance implies authority they don't claim.

Perhaps a dozen remain in permanent residence. Others come and go from throughout the Wilds and beyond, gathering when matters require collective attention. The conclave has no formal leader. Decisions emerge from consensus among beings who have known each other for millions of years and rarely agree on anything quickly.

What they agree on:

- **The Wilds must remain wild.** Civilization will not be permitted to establish here. Expeditions seeking titan materials are tolerated if they stay at the edges; those who go too deep are dealt with.

- **The Sleeper must not wake.** Not yet. The druids have spent eons preparing for an awakening they believe is inevitable, but they intend to control the timing. What happens when Magera rises is the subject of extensive preparation and considerable disagreement.

- **The old ways persist.** The druids remember what the world was before mortals reshaped it. They intend to preserve at least this fragment of that older reality.

The conclave does not welcome visitors. Those who find Magera's Palace—and the finding is not easy; the forest misdirects travelers who haven't been invited—are assessed before they're permitted to approach. Most are turned away, their memories of the location dulled until they can't find it again. Some are killed. A very few are allowed to enter.

## Magera's Dreams

The Sleeper is not unconscious. It dreams.

The dreams are slow—a single image might persist for decades, a narrative might unfold across centuries. But they leak into the surrounding area, coloring the forest with impressions that don't belong to any living mind.

Near the Palace, visitors report:

- A sense of vast age, of having existed forever and being tired of it
- Fragmentary visions of landscapes that don't match Alaria—places where the sky was different colors, where the land moved like water
- The occasional certainty that something immense is aware of you, not hostile, just... present
- Dreams while sleeping near the Palace that feel like memories belonging to something else

The druids have learned to interpret these dreams. They believe Magera was once a traveler between worlds—or between states of existence—and that its long sleep is not rest but waiting. Waiting for what, they won't say. Perhaps they don't know.

## The Awakening

The druids expect Magera to wake. Not soon by mortal standards—their preparations span generations—but inevitably.

They've spent 120 million years building toward this moment. The living architecture of the Palace is designed to channel and direct whatever happens when Magera rises. The Root Towers are anchors. The River Halls are conduits. The Deep Roots are... something else, something the druids shaped to interface with an entity that doesn't think in ways they can fully model.

What happens when Magera wakes depends on factors the druids have been trying to control:

- **The state of the Wilds** — Magera's dreams respond to the land around it. A corrupted or diminished forest might produce a different awakening than an intact one. The druids' insistence on preserving the Wilds isn't just nostalgia.

- **The condition of the leylines** — The void and force leylines that cross the Wilds may interact with Magera in unpredictable ways. The druids monitor them constantly.

- **Who is present** — The druids intend to be the ones standing in the Palace when Magera opens its eyes. They've arranged the architecture to give themselves the best chance of establishing communication. Whether that will work is untested.

The most optimistic outcome: Magera acknowledges the druids as caretakers, accepts the Palace as an offering, and remains in the Wilds as a guardian presence—something so ancient and powerful that even the leylines bend around it.

The pessimistic outcomes vary. The druids don't discuss them with outsiders.

## Reaching the Palace

The White River provides the most direct approach, but the river doesn't cooperate with uninvited travelers. Boats ground themselves on sandbars that weren't there. Currents reverse without explanation. The forest along the banks grows thick enough to block overland portage.

Those who've reached the Palace without invitation describe days of circular travel, supplies running low, the growing certainty that they were being watched and found wanting. Some gave up. Some were found dead of apparently natural causes. A very few persisted long enough to earn an audience—whether through stubbornness, desperation, or qualities the druids valued.

The druids do occasionally invite outsiders. The invitations come as dreams, or as paths that suddenly open where no path existed, or as a rusalka from Cynker's Den appearing with a message. The reasons for these invitations are never explained in advance.

What the druids might want from mortals:

- Specific knowledge they don't possess (rare, given their age)
- Services they can't perform themselves (also rare)
- Objects of power or significance
- Test subjects for preparations related to the awakening
- Reasons they don't share

Bargaining with the conclave is possible. The druids don't value gold, but they value other things: memories, skills, services, artifacts connected to the old world, news of events beyond the Wilds. They've been known to offer guidance through dangerous territory, healing that conventional magic can't provide, and—rarely—fragments of knowledge about the titans, the leylines, or Magera itself.

They don't offer these things lightly. And they always seem to know when they're being lied to.
