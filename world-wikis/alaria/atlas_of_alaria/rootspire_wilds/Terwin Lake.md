# Terwin Lake

Terwin Lake sits near the convergence of the Rootspire Wilds' major leylines, a body of water that appears unremarkable to the casual observer—deep, cold, fed by mountain springs, its surface ringed by ancient pines. Fish live in its waters. Fishermen have been known to camp along its shores without incident.

But beneath the surface, the void leyline passes through the lake's depths, and that fact colors everything about it. The water is colder than it should be in summer, warmer in winter, as if the normal seasonal progression has no purchase on this place. Plants that should grow in the surrounding soil instead flourish in impossible locations around its banks. The deepest parts of the lake have never been soundly mapped—measurements contradict each other, and divers return unsettled by their inability to determine exactly how deep the water extends.

Cynker's Den, the void archdragon's lair, has its entrance somewhere beneath the lake. Whether the cavern lies directly below or accessed through some twisted passage is unknown even to those who have attempted the journey. Few have sought to reach the den deliberately, and fewer still have returned with useful information.

The lake itself remains mostly peaceful. It is the world beneath its surface that demands respect.
