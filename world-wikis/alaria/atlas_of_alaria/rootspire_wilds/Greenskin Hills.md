# Greenskin Hills

The Greenskin Hills form the northern boundary of the Rootspire Wilds, a towering rampart of stone and ancient forest that marks the transition between wild and wilder. The name comes not from inhabitants but from the pervasive lichen that clings to the lower slopes—vibrant greens and yellows that spread across exposed rock like a slowly advancing tide. From a distance, the mountains appear to glow in certain light.

The lower slopes are heavily forested, dense with the same twisted growth that characterizes much of the Wilds. As elevation increases, the trees thin and dwarf, giving way to bare, weathered peaks that pierce the cloud layer. The ascent is treacherous—loose stone, sudden drop-offs, and paths that seem to shift with the seasons make crossing difficult even for experienced climbers.

The Greenskin Hills serve as a genuine barrier. Few who attempt to cross do so more than once. Those who do report an unsettling quality to the passage—a sense of being watched, tracked, though by what they cannot say. The lichen itself seems to pulse in certain places, and some claim it glows faintly at night.
