## Bloodwood

The Bloodwood marks the western threshold of the Rootspire Wilds, named for its trees' distinctive crimson bark—a rare trait among old-growth woodland that locals swear darkens further after rainfall, as if absorbing blood from the earth. The forest has long served as a natural boundary between the settled territories of Misanda Mulu and the untamed wilderness beyond, with the Dedeba River cutting along its eastern edge as if deliberately separating civilization from chaos.

Here, the last vestiges of Dalizi influence fade into shadow. Logging operations and hunting camps dot the western periphery, and a handful of rough settlements cluster along the forest's border, serving as staging grounds for expeditions and trade into the deeper Wilds. But the forest itself remains empty of permanent habitation—the Bloodwood's interior belongs to something older than human settlement.

The transition is sharp and deliberate. Step beyond the western fringe, and civilization falls away entirely. The crimson trees grow darker, more twisted, and the air itself seems to thicken with age and possibility. Bloodwood is not as actively hostile as regions deeper in the Wilds, but it demands respect and vigilance. It is the last comfortable place before you discover why the Rootspire Wilds are spoken of only in whispers.
