## Memory Lake

South of Terwin Lake lies a body of water both beautiful and unsettling—one that reflects not what stands before it, but what has already passed.

The locals call it Memory Lake for reasons travelers discover quickly. The surface shows images unbidden: sometimes your own past, sharp as lived moments. Other times, visions far older surface—glimpses of the land itself, as if the titans who shaped this world left echoes in the water. A hunter might see the moment they made a choice they regret. A scholar might witness the forest as it stood centuries ago.

The lake grants no control over these visions. They come when they will, to whom they will. Some come seeking answers; most find only questions they didn't know to ask. The water is cold, and those who wade in too far sometimes forget which memories are their own.
