## White River

The White River drains from the cool heights of Nykotheryx Amberylika, flowing southeast past Magera's Palace and down toward Dalizi. Of all the waterways through the southern Rootspire Wilds, it is the most traveled—the most civilized route through otherwise hostile territory.

But the river's cooperation comes with conditions. Those with Magera's blessing find safe passage, clear channels, and swift currents. Uninvited travelers discover something different: sandbars that appear without warning, currents that reverse mid-crossing, depths that shallow unexpectedly. A boat that sailed the White River safely yesterday might find itself grounded on a bar that wasn't there the day before.

Local boat captains know enough to navigate by respect and ritual. Pay homage at the Palace's water gates. Give offerings to the river itself. And never, under any circumstance, speak ill of the sorceress whose hand shapes these waters. Some say the White River isn't a natural waterway at all—merely water that consents to flow in one direction, so long as Magera wills it.
