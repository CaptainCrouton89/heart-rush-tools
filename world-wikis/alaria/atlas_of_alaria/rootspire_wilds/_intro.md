# Rootspire Wilds

The Rootspire Wilds is one of the last places in Alaria where the Second Eon never truly ended.

Occupying the eastern interior of Aboyinzu—north of Dragon's Spine, east of the Dalizi Confederation, and west of the Slumbering Abyss—this vast forested wilderness has resisted civilization for 120 million years. Not through active malice. It simply never stopped being what it was before mortals arrived.

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria with Melera's music, titans across the world went mad. Many fled to the cosmos. Many died where they stood. In this region, they fell in *numbers*. The leyline intersection that cuts through the heart of the Wilds may have drawn them, or perhaps chance simply clustered them here. The druids came afterward to bury the dead and plant the Anchor Trees that mark titan graves elsewhere. But here, the scale was too vast. They did what they could, then withdrew to the forest's edges.

What grew back was not normal forest.

The old things never left. Creatures that went extinct elsewhere persist here, evolved in isolation. Druids who remember the burial still walk these woods—ancient, strange, and hostile to the civilization that drove their kind to near-extinction. The titans' death-dreams echo through their petrified remains. And the leylines carry that contamination outward, warping reality in ways that make permanent settlement impossible.

No state claims the Rootspire Wilds. No army has cleared it. The Dalizi Confederation marks it on maps as "unincorporated territory" and discourages travel. The few who enter seeking titan treasure, rare specimens, or ancient knowledge mostly don't return.

This is what Alaria looked like before mortals imposed order. The Rootspire Wilds remembers.

## Geography

The region spans roughly four hundred miles east to west and three hundred north to south—larger than many nations, entirely unsettled.

### Boundaries

- **West**: The Bloodwood marks the transition from Misanda Mulu's territory into true wilderness. Beyond it, Dalizi influence ends.
- **North**: The Greenskin Hills rise as a mountain barrier, their lower slopes forested, their peaks bare rock. The Tongueroot Forest fills the valleys below.
- **East**: Backstretch Bay, a sheltered arm of the Slumbering Abyss, forms the coastal boundary. Rivers drain the interior here.
- **South**: The Hills of Sorrow and the mountain ranges beyond separate the Wilds from Nykotheryx Amberylika's southern reaches and eventually the Dragon's Spine.

### Major Subregions

**Tongueroot Forest** — The northern reaches, where the Greenskin Hills slope down into dense woodland. Druid territory. Travelers report paths that loop back on themselves, days that repeat without memory, and the persistent sense of being watched by something older than the trees.

**The Central Wilds** — The heart of the region, where the Rootspires cluster thickest. The void and force leylines cross here. Kroikylo's Tomb sits at their intersection. This is the most dangerous territory—reality itself becomes unreliable near the larger titan formations.

**Nykotheryx Amberylika** — The southern subregion, where the Real Forest's dream-warping influence dominates. Dreamlake draws oneiromancers willing to risk the journey. Magera's Palace anchors the western edge, where the White River exits toward Dalizi.

**Backstretch Bay Shores** — The eastern coastal strip, where the forest thins and the bay's unique ecosystem begins. No settlements, but the richest hunting grounds for alchemical specimens.

## The Rootspires

The formations that give the region its name are not geological. They're the calcified remnants of titans who died during the Ezz Rift 120 million years ago.

Titan physiology doesn't decay normally. What remains after such vast time is a hybrid of skeleton, crystallized tissue, and something that *grew* from the death process itself—structures that resemble root systems turned to stone and thrust toward the sky. The largest reach three hundred feet. They cluster densest near the force/void leyline intersection, suggesting the titans were drawn there in their madness, fighting or fleeing or simply trying to reach something before the emotional onslaught killed them.

### The Prize

Titan blood and titan bone are the only known materials capable of holding Deoric charge—the reality-warping magic that shapes the most powerful artifacts in Alaria. The Deo Esari priesthood in the Farlands controls 95% of the world's supply from the Kelder Mountains, maintaining a sacred monopoly that makes titan materials among the most valuable substances in existence.

The Rootspire Wilds contains an unknown quantity. Untouched. Unguarded by theocratic monopoly. The formations here have never been systematically surveyed.

### The Problem

Two hundred years ago, a contamination disaster struck the Farlands' harvesting sites. Workers hit a "bad vein" of titan remains—material that spread wasting sickness through contact, caused birth defects, and killed. The southern sites were sealed. Forty percent of harvesting capacity was lost. Prices skyrocketed.

No reliable method exists to detect contaminated titan material before exposure. The Rootspire Wilds has never been tested. Any expedition harvesting here gambles that they haven't found poisoned remains.

Most expeditions don't return. Whether they died to contamination, to the creatures, to the druids, or to the reality-warping effects of the leylines—no one knows. The few survivors describe the deep forest as wrong in ways that don't have words. Gravity shifts near the larger formations. Time moves strangely. And sometimes, in the oldest Rootspires, you can hear something that might be dreaming.

## The Druids

The druids remember.

They came here after the Ezz Rift to bury the titans and plant Anchor Trees. Elsewhere in Alaria, that worked—the trees mark graves, their slow collective consciousness keeping watch over the dead. Here, the scale was too vast. The druids planted what they could, then retreated to the edges.

Some never left.

The druids of the Rootspire Wilds are among the oldest of their dying kind—immortal greater elves who predate the races they created. They've watched civilizations rise and fall from the forest's edge. They've seen expeditions come seeking titan treasure and added those expeditions to the forest floor. They don't teach. They don't guide. They don't negotiate with the civilized peoples who have forgotten why this place was sealed.

They simply *persist*, tending to a wound that never healed, ensuring that what sleeps in the Rootspires stays sleeping.

How many remain is unknown. Druids don't announce themselves. But their influence is felt throughout the region—in the forest's hostility to intruders, in the paths that lead travelers in circles, in the way the wildlife seems to coordinate against expeditions. The druids didn't abandon the Wilds. They became part of it.

Their seat of power—if they have one—is believed to be Magera's Palace on the White River. But that location brings its own complications.

## Elemental Leylines

Two major leylines cross through the Rootspire Wilds:

**The Void Leyline (Nilus)** — Runs east-west across the entire region, a crack where the plane of Nilus bleeds closer to the material world. Void magic is amplified along its path. Reality becomes thinner. The line passes directly through Cynker's Den, which may explain the dimensional nature of that location.

**The Force Leyline** — Runs southwest to northeast, intersecting the void line at Kroikylo's Tomb. Force magic involves spatial manipulation, momentum, and kinetic energy. The intersection creates compound effects: spatial rifts, gravity distortions, pockets where physics operates by different rules.

The leyline intersection at Kroikylo's Tomb is considered one of the most dangerous locations in Alaria. The dungeon built there exploits both leylines—lethal traps using force fields, spatial rifts, and void zones. Those who've survived describe the interior as "architecture that hates you."

## Points of Interest

### Major Sites

**Kroikylo's Tomb** — A fortress-dungeon at the force/void leyline intersection, built into one of the largest Rootspire formations. Contains void stones, titan materials, and treasures accumulated over millennia. Also contains traps that have killed more expeditions than the rest of the Wilds combined. The tomb's original purpose—whether it was always a trap-filled vault or something else—is unknown.

**Cynker's Den** — A dimensional lair on the void leyline near Terwin Lake. Cynker is an entity of uncertain nature whose "daughters"—clawed rusalkas with force magic and teleportation capabilities—guard the approaches. Cynker occasionally bargains with visitors, though the terms are never straightforward.

**Magera's Palace** — The seat of the druid conclave, built on and around a slumbering entity that predates the titans. The "palace" is grown architecture shaped over millions of years, fed by the White River, maintained by the druids who use its power. The entity beneath—Magera itself—has not moved in recorded history. The druids believe it will wake eventually. They've been preparing.

**Dreamlake** — A body of water in Nykotheryx Amberylika where the boundaries between sleeping minds dissolve. Those who sleep near its shores share dreams. Oneiromancers seek it for training and communion. The dreams are not always benign—the lake has absorbed impressions from the Real Forest's reality-warping influence, and some sleepers don't wake as themselves.

**The Real Forest** — A zone within Nykotheryx Amberylika where the distinction between dream and reality breaks down. The forest looks normal until you realize the trees weren't there a moment ago, or the path you're walking doesn't match what your companions see. A spirit called the Pine Jester is said to rule here, though "rule" may not be the right word for something that treats reality as a suggestion.

### Lakes and Waters

The Wilds contain numerous lakes, most concentrated in the western and central regions:

- **Lonely Lakes** — Scattered bodies in the northwest, isolated and rarely visited
- **Venchi Lake, Nozilus Lake, Tswili Lake** — A cluster in the southwest where rivers gather
- **Terwin Lake** — Near the leyline intersection, location of Cynker's Den
- **Memory Lake** — South of Terwin Lake, said to show reflections of the past
- **Dreamlake** — In Nykotheryx Amberylika, the oneiromancer's destination
- **Apoches Lake, Lake Encietis** — Interior lakes draining toward Backstretch Bay
- **Reflection Lakes** — Small scattered lakes in the Tongueroot Forest, possibly druid-maintained
- **Pool to Infinity** — A feature on the western edge of Tongueroot Forest; nature unclear

### Rivers

- **Dedeba River** — Flows from the Bloodwood northeast through the western Wilds
- **White River** — Drains from Nykotheryx Amberylika past Magera's Palace toward Dalizi
- **Sivava Noul** — Cuts through the southern Wilds
- **Chavogra River** — Joins the Sivava Noul from the southeast
- **Merrin Thamia** — An east-west waterway (or possibly a path) through the central region
- **Theria River** — Drains Lake Encietis toward Backstretch Bay
- **Shrik River** — Flows from the southern hills to the bay

### Hills and Highlands

- **Greenskin Hills** — The northern mountain barrier, named for the lichen that covers their slopes
- **Umbral Hills** — Low hills on the edge of the Real Forest, perpetually shadowed
- **Hills of Sorrow** — The southern boundary range, named by the few survivors of expeditions that tried to cross them

## Inhabitants

### Sapient Presence

**Druids** — The oldest continuous presence, maintaining the region as a memorial and a ward. Numbers unknown. They avoid contact but enforce boundaries—expeditions that go too deep simply disappear.

**Cynker and Daughters** — The dimensional entity at Cynker's Den and its rusalka servants. They occasionally interact with travelers, though their motives are unclear.

**No permanent settlements exist.** The Wilds actively resist habitation. Structures rot faster than they can be maintained. Crops fail. Livestock panic and flee. The few who've tried to establish outposts abandoned them within seasons.

### Creatures

The Rootspire Wilds harbors species found nowhere else in Alaria—creatures that match descriptions in bestiaries from the Second Eon, evolved in isolation while their relatives elsewhere went extinct.

The interior is poorly documented because expeditions rarely return with detailed notes. Known threats include:

- Predators adapted to hunt in the reality-distorted zones near Rootspires
- Territorial creatures that defend the titan formations (possibly drawn to residual energy)
- Pack hunters in the forest understory
- Aquatic and amphibious species in the river systems and Backstretch Bay
- Whatever lives in the deeper parts of the Real Forest (reports are contradictory and possibly hallucinatory)

Backstretch Bay contains the densest concentration of unique fauna—its isolation from the Slumbering Abyss's currents allowed a Second Eon ecosystem to persist. Alchemists prize specimens from the bay, though collecting them requires surviving both the overland journey and the bay's aggressive wildlife.

## History

The Rootspire Wilds has no recorded history in the conventional sense. No civilizations rose here. No wars were fought. No treaties drawn. The region exists outside the timeline of mortal events.

What's known:

**120 million years ago** — The Ezz Rift. Titans die in vast numbers across Alaria. An unusual concentration falls in what becomes the Rootspire Wilds, possibly drawn by the leyline intersection. Druids bury the dead and plant Anchor Trees where possible.

**Deep past** — Something older than the titans sleeps along the White River. The druids find it. They build around it. Magera's Palace takes shape over eons.

**Unknown period** — Kroikylo's Tomb is constructed at the leyline intersection. By whom and why is undocumented. The tomb may predate current civilizations.

**Approximately 3,000 years ago** — King Kilren of Illron sends 10,000 soldiers into the Iyaklomori Grera seeking conquest. They vanish. Kilren returns alone, catatonic. The Rootspire Wilds is not Iyaklomori Grera, but this event demonstrates what ancient forests defended by druids and fae can do to armies.

**200 years ago** — The contamination disaster in the Farlands raises prices for titan materials. Interest in the Rootspire Wilds increases among desperate or ambitious harvesters. Expedition frequency rises. Survival rates don't.

**Present day** — The Wilds remain unclaimed, unsettled, and largely unexplored. Dalizi maps mark it as off-limits. The druids maintain their vigil. And somewhere beneath Magera's Palace, something continues to sleep.

## Travel and Survival

### Getting There

The most common approach is from Dalizi territory—crossing the Bloodwood from Misanda Mulu or following river routes from the south. The northern approach through the Greenskin Hills is possible but requires mountain travel. The eastern approach from Backstretch Bay requires ocean passage to an uninhabited coast.

### Surviving

Short version: most don't.

Longer version:

- **Navigation**: Compass directions become unreliable near leylines. The forest actively misdirects travelers in druid-controlled areas. Landmarks shift in the Real Forest.
- **Supplies**: Nothing edible grows safely here. Water from rivers is usually safe; water from lakes near Rootspires may not be. Hunt at your own risk—some prey species are toxic.
- **Shelter**: Structures attract attention. Sleeping in the open attracts different attention. There are no good options.
- **The Druids**: They're watching. If they want you gone, you'll find yourself walking in circles until you give up or die. If they want you dead, you won't see it coming.
- **The Leylines**: Avoid the intersection unless you're specifically seeking Kroikylo's Tomb. Even then, reconsider.

Successful expeditions (the few that exist) move fast, stay at the edges, take what they came for, and leave. Extended stays in the interior are not survivable for conventional parties.

### Why Go At All

- **Titan materials**: Untapped wealth for those willing to gamble on contamination
- **Kroikylo's Tomb**: Legendary dungeon, legendary treasures, legendary death rate
- **Dreamlake**: Destination for oneiromancers seeking to expand their abilities
- **Backstretch Bay specimens**: Alchemical ingredients found nowhere else
- **Magera's Palace**: Some seek the druids for knowledge they won't share, or to bargain with an entity that doesn't bargain
- **Cynker's Daughters**: The rusalkas can teleport anywhere they've been—useful if you can survive negotiating with Cynker

Most seekers become part of the forest floor. The Wilds don't distinguish between the ambitious and the foolish.
