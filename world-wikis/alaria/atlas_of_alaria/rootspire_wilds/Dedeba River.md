## Dedeba River

The Dedeba flows northeast from the depths of the Bloodwood, carving one of the primary water routes through the western Rootspire Wilds. For traders and travelers without sky routes or coin for passage, the river is lifeline and highway both.

The current runs strong in early spring, fed by snowmelt from the heights. By summer, it settles into a navigable but meandering pace, winding deeper into forest so ancient the trees block out the sky. Small boats can push upriver with effort; downstream passage is swift but demands attention—sandbars shift, and the channel narrows without warning.

Fishing camps dot its banks, though the Wilds' dangers keep permanent settlements small. Those who know the Dedeba say it has moods: generous with passage one season, treacherous the next. Some claim the river itself decides who passes and who must portage around obstacles that appear overnight.
