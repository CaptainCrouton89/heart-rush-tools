## Tongueroot Forest

The Tongueroot Forest sprawls across the northern valleys beneath the Greenskin Hills, a dense woodland where ancient trees twist into forms that resemble gnarled tongues coiled at the forest's floor. Massive root systems surface like skeletal fingers, sometimes as thick as buildings, creating a tangled maze that makes navigation treacherous even for experienced woodsmen. The canopy grows so thick that perpetual twilight reigns, and moss clings to every surface in shades of sickly green.

The Dedeba River cuts through the heart of the forest, flanked by the Reflection Lakes and the Pool to Infinity—waters so still and mirror-perfect that travelers swear they've glimpsed impossible landscapes in their depths. These water features serve as both landmarks and warnings; many who've lingered by them report missing hours with no memory of passing time.

### Geography

The forest marks the primary northern gateway to the central Rootspire Wilds for those foolish or desperate enough to enter. Its valleys funnel cold air from the Greenskin Hills downward, creating fog that rolls through the understory like something alive. The undergrowth is nearly impenetrable, and paths loop back on themselves with unnatural frequency—what should be a day's walk becomes two, or three, or longer if the forest wills it.

### Character

Druid patrols are far more active here than in other regions, not merely observing but actively misdirecting and harassing intruders. Travelers report encountering the same woodland features repeatedly, as if the forest itself has become conscious and deliberately confusing. There's a constant sensation of being observed by something vast and ancient—a presence that predates even the oldest trees. The Tongueroot Forest doesn't welcome visitors. It makes this known through persistence, repetition, and an overwhelming sense of wrongness that accumulates with each wrong turn.
