## Reflection Lakes

Within the depths of Tongueroot Forest, scattered like scattered stars, lie the Reflection Lakes—small pools of water so still and clear they seem to hold images from nowhere and everywhere at once.

Druid circles maintain these lakes with ancient care, using them as conduits for seeing beyond the veil. Whether the druids' magic creates the reflections, or whether they merely tend to something older, is unclear. What is certain: a still observer at the water's edge might see places they've never been, people they've never met, or futures that haven't come to pass. Some reflections answer questions. Others raise ones that haunt for years.

The druids permit visitors rarely, and only those who approach with respect. The lakes themselves seem to judge whether an image is meant for you—the water sometimes shows nothing but your own face, no matter how desperately you seek an answer.
