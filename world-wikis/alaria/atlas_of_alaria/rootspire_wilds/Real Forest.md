# Real Forest

In the northern reaches of Nykotheryx Amberylika lies a stretch of woodland that appears, at first glance, exactly as a forest should be: trees, ferns, undergrowth, the normal architecture of nature. Travelers often pass through sections of the Real Forest for hours believing themselves in ordinary woodland—until they realize the trees blocking their path were not there a moment before. Or were they always? The question becomes difficult to answer with certainty.

The Real Forest is where the Rootspire Wilds' reality-warping properties manifest most directly. Dreams and waking reality do not merely coexist here—they intermingle at the level of perception itself. Different travelers walking the same path see different routes. Some encounter clearings that others never find. Trails double back on themselves in ways that should be geometrically impossible. Whether these variations are genuinely present or experienced only by those perceiving them remains unanswerable.

A thick pollen hangs in the air throughout the Real Forest, and while it grows most oppressive during the autumn months, it never fully dissipates. Those who breathe it deeply find their consciousness shifting between states—not sleep exactly, but something adjacent to it. The boundary between sleeping and waking becomes genuinely uncertain. Travelers report conversations they held that might have been dreams, or dreams so vivid they seem more real than waking memory. Time becomes negotiable; minutes stretch into hours or collapse into seconds.

At the heart of this chaos dwells the Pine Jester—a wild, mischievous spirit bound to the forest's essence. Some call it malevolent, but this misunderstands its nature. The Pine Jester is not cruel; it simply treats reality as a game, and the rules of games are meant to be bent. It torments travelers not from hatred but from something like play—shifting paths, causing them to circle the same clearing repeatedly, creating phantom sounds and false trails. It is unkillable while the forest lives, and the forest lives as long as Alaria exists. The Pine Jester is, in some sense, immortal by definition.

Those who spend time in the Real Forest are often changed by the experience. Some return able to perceive things others miss—fleeting glimpses of things that might be spirit-touched or reality-torn. Others lose the ability to dream in the normal sense, their sleep instead filled with confused waking-dreams that provide no rest. The forest leaves its mark on those who spend too long within it, a subtle rewriting of what they are capable of perceiving.

Whether the Real Forest is sentient is a question the druids debate without conclusion. What is clear is that it is responsive. It may be connected to some greater dreaming consciousness—a waking dream held by the world itself—or it may be something stranger still: a place where consciousness of any kind has become geographic, where thought takes on the weight of terrain.
