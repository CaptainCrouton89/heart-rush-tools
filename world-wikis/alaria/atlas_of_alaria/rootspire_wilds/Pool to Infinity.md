# Pool to Infinity

On the western edge of the Tongueroot Forest lies a pool of impossible dimensions. Locals call it the Pool to Infinity, and the name proves apt in ways both literal and metaphorical. At first glance, it appears to be a natural formation—dark water, clear depths, unremarkable. But those who linger find the pool increasingly difficult to comprehend.

The surface reflects not the sky above but something else entirely—geometric patterns, colors that don't exist in normal light, shapes that seem to recognize those who gaze into them. Some claim the pool has no bottom, that the darkness extends indefinitely downward. Others insist the water is not water but something thinner, colder, utterly alien to the world above.

The druids of the Rootspire Wilds maintain a careful watch over this place. They do not prevent others from visiting, but they have established clear boundaries—markers that indicate how close one should venture. Those who have crossed those lines do not speak of what they experienced. A few who barely escaped the pool's influence describe brief moments of displaced time, of seeing impossible architecture reflected in its surface, of understanding on the edge of sanity.

Whether the pool is a natural wonder, a wound in reality, or something the druids themselves cultivate, none outside their order can say with certainty.
