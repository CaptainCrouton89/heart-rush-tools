## Lonely Lakes

Scattered across the northwestern Rootspire Wilds are a dozen small lakes that bear no other name than the collective one: the Lonely Lakes. Each sits isolated, separated from the others by dense forest and broken terrain.

Few creatures linger near them. The water is clear and deep, the shores muddy and still. No birds call over these waters, and the fish that dwell below rise rarely. Travelers who find them sometimes camp nearby, drawn by the freshwater and relative shelter—but few stay long. There's a weight to these places, a profound quiet that feels less like peace and more like abandonment.

Whether the lakes themselves repel life, or whether something in them simply doesn't welcome visitors, no one has determined. Those who drink from them report no taste of strangeness. Yet stillness follows them home regardless.
