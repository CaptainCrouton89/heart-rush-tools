# Dreamlake

Just south of the Real Forest, in the northern reaches of Nykotheryx Amberylika, lies Dreamlake—a body of water unlike any other in Alaria. Its surface is mirror-still, often shrouded in mist that rises from the water without apparent cause. What makes it remarkable is not its appearance but its properties: the lake reflects things that are not present in the waking world. Travelers report seeing their own faces aged or young, landscapes that exist nowhere else, and sometimes the faces of people they have never met but somehow recognize.

Drinking from Dreamlake water allows one to navigate the dream realm with remarkable clarity and intent. Those who have drunk from its waters report being able to enter vivid dreams—their own or, with focus, those of others who sleep in proximity. The water creates shared dreamscapes, spaces where multiple minds can interact with near-waking awareness. More unsettling, those skilled in the practice can allegedly invade the private dreams of others without invitation, though the ethics and wisdom of this practice are debated even among those who possess the ability.

The lake's power is not accidental. Over millennia, the Real Forest's dream-touched nature has bled into these waters. The lake has absorbed the dream-impressions of countless travelers, and some scholars suggest—though such claims are difficult to verify—that it contains the dreams of the ancient titans whose bones lie scattered throughout the Rootspire Wilds. Whatever its origin, the effect is undeniable: the water has become a repository of dreaming itself.

Sleeping near the lake's shores without drinking from its waters still produces vivid, shared dreams. Entire expeditions have found themselves in shared dreamscapes upon waking—conversations held, visions experienced, all apparently real in the moment, yet leaving no physical trace. The power extends even to those who approach it with skepticism or caution.

Oneiromancers and dream-practitioners make pilgrimage to Dreamlake seeking to perfect their craft, but the lake welcomes all who approach with respect. The druids who maintain a presence here do not prevent access, though they do caution visitors about the risks. To drink deeply of Dreamlake's waters without understanding what one seeks is to risk losing the distinction between waking and sleeping altogether. Some who have drunk too deeply cannot function in the waking world—they wander in perpetual confusion, their minds caught between states, unable to rest in either.

A practical warning for those who might harvest the lake's power: the water's properties do not survive removal. Bottles filled from Dreamlake become ordinary water within hours of departing the region. The lake's gift is location-bound, available only to those willing to journey to its shores and drink directly. This limitation has preserved the lake from exploitation by distant powers and kept it a place of pilgrimage rather than commodity.
