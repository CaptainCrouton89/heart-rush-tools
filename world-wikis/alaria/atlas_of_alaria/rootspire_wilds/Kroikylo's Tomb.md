# Kroikylo's Tomb

The tomb sits at the intersection of the void and force leylines, built into the largest Rootspire formation in the Wilds—a calcified titan remnant that rises nearly four hundred feet from the forest floor. The structure exploits both leylines with lethal precision. Those who've survived describe the interior as "architecture that hates you."

It is considered one of the most dangerous dungeons in Alaria. The death rate approaches absolute.

## Origins

No one knows who built Kroikylo's Tomb or why.

The name suggests a burial site, but no remains of anyone called Kroikylo have ever been recovered—assuming anyone has penetrated deep enough to find them. The construction predates current civilizations. The architectural style doesn't match any known culture. The traps use leyline magic in ways that suggest intimate understanding of both void and force energies, knowledge that may not exist anymore outside these walls.

Theories include:

**A titan's tomb** — Built to contain the remains of a titan who died at the leyline intersection, possibly by beings who wanted to harvest from it safely. The Rootspire it's built into supports this theory. But the traps seem designed to keep people *out*, not to preserve something for later retrieval.

**A vault** — Constructed to store something valuable in the most secure location possible. The leyline intersection provides both power and natural defenses; the tomb adds artificial ones. What's stored inside remains unknown.

**A prison** — Built to contain something that couldn't be killed. The void and force energies might serve as bindings rather than just trap mechanisms. Some survivors report a sense of *presence* in the deeper levels—something aware and waiting.

**A test** — Created by an unknown intelligence to evaluate those who enter. The few who've reached the inner chambers and returned describe treasures laid out as if expecting collection, rewards for those skilled enough to survive. This theory is popular among adventurers planning expeditions. It's also popular among adventurers who don't come back.

The druids know more than they share. When asked about the tomb, they say only that it was there when they arrived after the Ezz Rift, and that some things are better left buried.

## The Exterior

The Rootspire housing the tomb dominates the surrounding forest—a white-gray mass of calcified titan remains twisted into shapes that suggest agony frozen in stone. The main entrance is visible from half a mile away: a dark opening carved into the base of the formation, framed by architecture that seems to grow from the titan remnants rather than being built against them.

The entrance is not hidden. The tomb wants to be found.

Approaching presents the first challenges:

- **The leyline intersection** warps space for several hundred yards around the tomb. Distances become inconsistent. Walking toward the entrance might take ten minutes or ten hours. Some expeditions have spent days circling without making progress.

- **The forest resists** — Trees grow thicker near the tomb, branches interlock to block paths, roots rise to trip travelers. Whether this is druid influence or something else is unclear.

- **Creatures gather** — Things live in the shadow of the Rootspire that don't live elsewhere. They're not necessarily hostile, but they're watching. Always watching.

Those who reach the entrance find it open. No locked door, no guardian, no obvious barrier. The darkness inside simply waits.

## The Interior

The tomb's layout defies consistent mapping. Survivors' accounts contradict each other on basic details: number of levels, arrangement of chambers, whether certain rooms exist at all. The most likely explanation is that the interior changes—either randomly or in response to who's inside.

Consistent elements across accounts:

### The Entry Halls

The first chambers appear almost normal: stone corridors, occasional rooms, mundane-seeming architecture. The traps here are mechanical—pressure plates, dart launchers, collapsing floors. Dangerous but conventional. Expeditions that turn back at this point usually survive.

This section is a filter. It weeds out the obviously unprepared while lulling survivors into a false sense of competence.

### The Force Galleries

Deeper in, the force leyline's influence becomes apparent. Gravity shifts without warning—floors become walls, ceilings become floors. Spatial relationships twist: a corridor might loop back on itself, a room might be larger on the inside than the outside, two doors on opposite walls might both lead to the same place.

Traps in this section use kinetic energy: force fields that trigger from movement and compress whatever's inside them, zones where momentum reverses unexpectedly, corridors where the air itself becomes a crushing pressure.

Survivors describe this section as disorienting but navigable with caution. The architecture follows rules, even if those rules don't match normal physics. Patient explorers can learn the patterns.

### The Void Chambers

Where the void leyline's influence dominates, reality becomes negotiable.

Rooms exist in states of probability rather than certainty. A door might open onto a treasure chamber, a death trap, or nothing at all depending on factors no one has identified. Shadows move independently of light sources. Darkness isn't just absence of light—it's *presence* of something else.

Traps here are existential: zones where matter ceases to exist, rifts that lead to nowhere (or to Nilus itself), pockets of void that erase whatever enters them from existence. Some survivors report seeing members of their expedition simply *stop being* without warning or apparent cause.

The void chambers are where most expeditions end.

### The Intersection

At the heart of the tomb, where both leylines meet, the architecture becomes something else entirely.

Few have reached this point. Those who returned describe:

- A chamber that exists in multiple states simultaneously, overlapping versions of itself
- Treasures scattered throughout, as if waiting to be claimed: void stones, titan materials, artifacts of unknown purpose
- A presence—something aware, something watching, something that might be the reason the tomb was built
- The sense that they were being evaluated and found... adequate

What's at the very center is unknown. No confirmed survivor has reached it and been willing to discuss what they found.

## The Treasures

The tomb contains wealth sufficient to reshape nations. Survivors have recovered:

**Void stones** — Crystallized void energy, valuable for magical applications and worth fortunes to the right buyers.

**Titan materials** — The Rootspire itself contains titan bone and possibly blood. Whether it's contaminated is unknown. Samples recovered from outer chambers have tested clean, but no one has harvested from the deeper formations.

**Artifacts** — Objects of unclear purpose and undeniable power. Most recovered artifacts require study to understand. Some resist study. A few have proven dangerous to possess.

**Knowledge** — Inscriptions on the walls in languages that predate known writing systems. Maps of places that might not exist. Diagrams of magical principles that don't match established schools. The tomb contains information about the deep past that exists nowhere else.

The problem is extraction. Taking anything from the tomb seems to increase its hostility. Expeditions that grab treasures and run rarely make it out. Those who explore without taking anything survive at higher rates. Whether this is coincidence, design, or something else is debated.

## Expeditions

Kroikylo's Tomb has been the target of treasure hunters, scholars, and thrill-seekers for as long as anyone has known it existed.

**Success rate**: Less than one in ten expeditions return with any members alive. Fewer than one in fifty return with significant treasures. The rate of total loss—no survivors, no bodies recovered—exceeds seventy percent.

**Preparation**: Successful expeditions typically include force and void magic specialists, extensive supplies, multiple exit strategies, and the willingness to abandon objectives if conditions deteriorate. Even then, success is not guaranteed.

**Timing**: Some believe the tomb is more navigable at certain times—during specific lunar phases, when the leylines pulse in particular patterns, during Faesummer or Shadowrift. Evidence for this is circumstantial at best.

**The druids**: The conclave at Magera's Palace does not prevent expeditions to the tomb, but they don't help either. Asking them for guidance typically results in warnings to turn back. Those who persist are told, simply: "The tomb was there before we came. It will be there after you're gone. What's inside wants to stay inside."

### Notable Expeditions

**The Karosi Delve (approximately 400 years ago)** — A well-funded expedition from Dalizi, forty members including powerful mages. Twelve returned after three months. They brought back void stones worth a kingdom's treasury and descriptions of the force galleries. All twelve died within five years of returning—accidents, illness, violence. Whether the tomb was responsible is unprovable.

**The Scholar's Attempt (approximately 150 years ago)** — An academic expedition seeking knowledge rather than treasure. They took nothing, documented extensively, and returned with the most detailed accounts of the interior available. Seven of nine members survived. Their notes are held in Dalizi archives and are the primary source for understanding the tomb's layout.

**The Last Harvest (approximately 30 years ago)** — An expedition specifically seeking titan materials, funded by parties who wanted to circumvent Deo Esari's monopoly. Twenty-three members entered. One returned, mind shattered, carrying a single titan bone fragment. The fragment tested contaminated. The survivor spoke of "something in the center that knows you're coming" before dying of wasting sickness two years later.

## The Presence

Multiple survivors describe an awareness within the tomb—something that watches, evaluates, and decides.

The presence becomes noticeable in the void chambers and overwhelming at the intersection. It doesn't communicate in words. Survivors report impressions: curiosity, patience, hunger that isn't quite hunger, and occasionally something that might be approval.

Theories about the presence:

- It's Kroikylo—whatever Kroikylo was—still aware after death or imprisonment
- It's the tomb itself, a structure so saturated with leyline energy that it developed consciousness
- It's something summoned or bound, using the leyline intersection as an anchor
- It's the titan whose remains form the Rootspire, not fully dead, dreaming in its calcified grave

The druids, when pressed, say only: "Something died there before we came. Something remains. They may not be the same thing."
