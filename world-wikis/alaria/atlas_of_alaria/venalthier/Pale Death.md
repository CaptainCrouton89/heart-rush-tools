## Pale Death

Tags: plains, ice, geography, transition

The central-eastern expanse of Venalthier's frozen interior—a vast plain of ice and compacted snow stretching from The Face in the north to the Selengreyb Plateau in the south, and from Morelous in the west to where the ice meets the impossible boundary of Eyendra's living forest. Pale Death is named for what it is: featureless white emptiness where those who enter often don't return.

### Geography

Pale Death covers roughly 200 miles north to south and 150 miles east to west—30,000 square miles of frozen nothing. The terrain is predominantly flat, with only the gentlest undulations breaking the monotony. Elevation rises gradually from roughly 3,000 feet at the northern edge near The Face to 4,500 feet where the ground rises toward Selengreyb Plateau.

The surface is hard-packed snow over ancient ice, compacted by millennia of pressure and wind. In most places, the snow layer is 10-20 feet thick, concealing the glacial ice beneath. The ground supports weight easily—travelers don't sink—but the uniform whiteness makes distance and direction impossible to judge.

No features exist to navigate by. No hills, no rocks, no variations in color. On overcast days, the sky and ground blend into a single white void where horizon ceases to exist. This is when Pale Death claims most of its victims: travelers who walk in circles until exhaustion takes them, their bodies found (if ever) miles from any intended destination.

### The Eastern Boundary

Pale Death's most remarkable feature is what lies at its eastern edge: the Eyendra forest.

The transition is instant and impossible. There is no gradual thaw, no treeline creeping forward, no zone of scrub vegetation. One step is frozen wasteland; the next step is living boreal forest, the air ten degrees warmer, the ground bare of snow, the trees ancient and dense.

The boundary runs roughly north-south for perhaps 60 miles, marking where the Riin's merged consciousness refuses to let winter enter their domain. The Eyendra forest's edge is not natural—the trees grow right to the line and no further, their roots stopping precisely where the ice begins. Snow falling on the forest side sublimates before it can accumulate. Cold air hitting the tree canopy seems to deflect upward, as though striking an invisible wall.

No one understands how this boundary maintains itself. The Riin's merger with the land occurred two thousand years ago, yet the forest continues to defy the climate that should freeze it solid. Some scholars theorize the boundary is weakening gradually—that in another thousand years, Pale Death will finally claim Eyendra. Others note the boundary hasn't shifted an inch in recorded history and suggest it will outlast any observer.

### Kama Sa'malina Proximity

The eastern portion of Pale Death borders not just Eyendra's edge but the Kama Sa'malina lake district—the "dreaming waters" where hundreds of lakes hold fragments of Riin consciousness. The boundary effect intensifies here: travelers on the ice sometimes hear voices from the forest, catch glimpses of faces in their peripheral vision, or dream of places they've never visited.

The dreams are the worst part. Travelers who camp near the Eyendra boundary wake with memories that aren't their own—fragments of lives lived centuries ago, emotions belonging to the dead, knowledge they couldn't possibly possess. Some handle this well. Others are found weeks later, still alive but speaking only in the Riin tongue, their original personalities seemingly replaced.

The dragon Ezra Olkanis claims the Eyendra forest as her domain. Her pact with Zor does not extend to Pale Death, but her influence sometimes does. Travelers on the ice have reported seeing her silhouette against the sunset, perched on trees at the forest's edge, watching the frozen plain with ancient patience. She doesn't intervene in what happens on the ice—but she watches.

### Climate

Pale Death experiences the full force of Venalthier's polar climate:

**Temperature**: -30°C to -50°C year-round. Brief "warm" periods during high summer might reach -15°C, but such conditions are rare and unpredictable.

**Wind**: Constant. The katabatic flow from the Selengreyb Plateau creates persistent winds of 30-40 mph, with gusts exceeding 80 mph during storms. The wind is the primary killer—wind chill pushes effective temperatures to -70°C or colder.

**Visibility**: Variable and unreliable. Clear days offer visibility measured in miles; overcast conditions create total whiteout where you cannot see your own feet. Storms can reduce visibility to zero for days at a time.

**Precipitation**: Minimal. What little falls is immediately redistributed by wind. New snow doesn't accumulate—it simply rearranges what's already there.

### Why "Pale Death"

The name is literal. The plain is pale—white ice, white snow, white sky. And it kills—sometimes through exposure, sometimes through something worse.

### The Glassworms

Beneath Pale Death's ice live the glassworms—massive serpentine creatures, 40-80 feet long, composed of transparent crystalline flesh that makes them nearly invisible against the ice. They sense vibrations through the frozen surface and hunt by ambush, bursting through the snow layer to seize prey before retreating below.

The glassworms are ancient—fossils suggest they've existed since before the region froze, adapting as their temperate homeland became polar wasteland. Their crystalline bodies don't generate heat; they're as cold as the ice itself, which is how they survive temperatures that would kill warm-blooded creatures. They eat anything organic: travelers, bears, seals that wander too far inland, even frozen corpses.

The Nabuhe know exactly what the glassworms are. They hunt them occasionally—glassworm flesh, when properly prepared, provides months of nutrition, and the crystalline organs have alchemical value. But hunting glassworms is extremely dangerous, and the Nabuhe only attempt it when other food sources fail.

The bodies found in terror were people who saw a glassworm before it struck—the creatures are nearly invisible, but not quite, and the moment of recognition brings a very specific expression. The bodies found smiling were lured to the surface by the worms' secondary hunting method: glassworms can project illusions of warmth, shelter, and safety, drawing exhausted travelers toward their position. Victims who die this way look peaceful because they genuinely believed they were walking toward rescue.

The bodies never found were taken below the ice. Glassworms cache food, storing corpses in subsurface chambers for later consumption. The tunnels shift as the glacier flows, which is why searches fail—the bodies are there, but not where they were taken.

Glassworm territory covers most of Pale Death's interior. They're less common near the edges—the Eyendra boundary seems to repel them, and the Morelous teeth provide too little prey to attract large populations. But crossing the open plain means crossing glassworm hunting grounds, and the creatures can sense footsteps from hundreds of feet away.

### Movement and Survival

Crossing Pale Death is technically possible. The Nabuhe do it occasionally when necessary, using techniques developed over centuries:

**Navigation**: Travel only on clear days when celestial navigation is possible. During overcast conditions, remain stationary. Use stakes driven into the ice to mark your trail—without them, you won't know if you're walking forward or in circles.

**Shelter**: Carry materials to construct emergency snow shelters. Build them tight against the wind; a poorly oriented shelter will be scoured away in hours.

**Speed**: Move as fast as conditions allow. Extended exposure is fatal. A crossing that should take three days must not take five.

**The Eastern Edge**: If you must approach the Eyendra boundary, maintain at least a mile of distance. Closer approach invites the dreams, and the dreams invite worse.

**Trust Nothing**: Mirages occur on Pale Death despite the cold. You will see things that aren't there—settlements, mountains, the edge of the ice. You will hear things—voices calling, music playing, sounds from home. Ignore them. Trust only your compass and your stakes.

### For Travelers

Don't cross Pale Death.

If you must:

- **Hire Nabuhe guides** if any will agree. Their knowledge is the only reliable advantage available.
- **Accept that you may die**. Not as pessimism, but as fact. The prepared survive more often than the unprepared, but survival is never guaranteed.
- **Stay away from the eastern edge**. The dreams are worse than the cold.
- **If you become lost, stop immediately**. Dig in and wait for weather that allows navigation. Walking blind is walking dead.
- **If you see something strange, don't investigate**. Whatever is out there isn't looking for company. Let it pass.

The Nabuhe say Pale Death isn't evil—it simply has no concept of human survival. It doesn't want you dead; it doesn't want anything. You're meaningless to it. That indifference is worse than malice would be.
