# Venalthier

## Geography

Venalthier is the frozen polar region occupying the extreme southwest of Upoceax. This is a land of white cliffs, glacial ice, and bitter cold—a world apart from the forests and plains of the main continent. Roughly 1,100 miles east to west and 650 miles north to south, Venalthier is larger than many nations yet supports fewer than a thousand permanent residents.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eceraen Mountains (running east-west) separate Venalthier from Wycendeula; Tundra Oblivio lies between the mountains and the Whitewalls
- **East**: The Sea of Daggers and its extension, the Frozen Sea; the impossible boundary with Eyendra forest
- **South**: Open polar ocean; the Akratian Plateau extends toward the unexplored pole
- **West**: Dismar Deep, the southwestern ocean; the Crystal Coast and Scepter Mountains

### Major Regions

#### Northern Transition

**Tundra Oblivio**: The windswept wasteland between the Eceraen Mountains and the Whitewall barrier. Contains the Blerian Hills and the settlement of Morya (~200 souls surviving on Nabuhe-supplied Frostfire).

**The Whitewalls**: The great ice cliffs marking Venalthier's northern edge:
- **West Whitewall**: Pure glacier, constantly calving into the Dismar Deep
- **The Face**: Mysterious cliff formation with a face-like profile, containing the warm Eye pool
- **East Whitewall**: Ice over rock, home to the Nabuhe dwarves and their Frostfire mines

#### Interior Ice Plains

**Morelous**: The western interior plain, punctuated by rocky "teeth" that provide navigation and shelter. Primary overland route between East Whitewall and the Scepter Mountains.

**Pale Death**: The central-eastern plain of featureless white, notorious for claiming travelers. Its eastern edge meets the impossible boundary of Eyendra forest, where polar conditions end and living boreal forest begins instantly.

**Ekri Towers**: Twin black spires of unknown origin rising from the ice between Morelous and Selengreyb—the only structures in Venalthier's interior.

#### Southern Plateaus

**Selengreyb Plateau**: The elevated heart of Venalthier at 5,000-6,000 feet, source of the katabatic winds that scour the interior. Contains a mysterious central depression with anomalous properties.

**West Selengreyb**: The brutal transition slope where plateau winds accelerate to maximum velocity—the most dangerous leg of east-west travel.

**Akratian Plateau**: The southernmost landmass, extending toward the polar ice cap. Gateway to the unreached southern pole, known for the phenomenon of singing ice.

#### Coastal Features

**Crystal Coast**: Northwestern shoreline where intricate ice formations refract polar light into spectacular displays. Richest marine ecosystem in Venalthier.

**Scepter Mountains**: Western coastal range with the only viable landing points. Contains the fjords (Deepest Reach, Shatter Bay, Ghostwater) and mountain passes (Coldgate, Scepter Gap) that connect Venalthier to the outside world.

### Climate

Venalthier experiences polar conditions year-round:
- **Temperatures**: -20°C to -60°C depending on region and season
- **Wind**: Persistent katabatic flows from Selengreyb, 30-60 mph constant, gusting to 100+
- **Polar Night**: 3 months of complete darkness in the south; proportionally less further north
- **Polar Day**: Corresponding months of continuous dim light

## Political Climate

Venalthier has no nations, no governments, no territorial claims. The only organized presence is the Nabuhe dwarf clan in East Whitewall, who control the Frostfire mines and thereby control access to the only reliable heat source in the region.

The Nabuhe don't rule Venalthier—they simply survive it better than anyone else. Their monopoly on Frostfire gives them power without requiring them to exercise it; anyone who wants to live in Venalthier needs Frostfire, and the Nabuhe set the terms.

Beyond the Nabuhe territory, Venalthier is lawless in the truest sense. No authorities, no enforcement, no structure. Survival is the only law, and the ice enforces it impartially.

## What Makes It Interesting

**Ancient Powers**: Venalthier contains layers of history most of Alaria has forgotten:
- **The Face (Velkoreth)**: A dead titan whose body provides the Frostfire that makes life possible here. Its Eye grants access to memories spanning epochs.
- **Ekri Towers**: Riin ruins containing Ekri herself—a woman who refused to merge with her people's collective consciousness, still conscious after 2,000 years.
- **The Lunar Fragment**: Debris from the lost third moon buried under Selengreyb, containing concentrated planar resonance.
- **Keth-Vorun**: A pre-primordial entity imprisoned at the pole, whose containment creates Venalthier's climate.

**Resources**: Frostfire (crystallized titan life-force), glassworm organs (alchemical value), Crystal Coast ice (optical properties), lunar fragment material (planar resonance), and Velkoreth's memories (accessed through the Eye) all offer power to those who can survive harvesting them.

**The Eyendra Boundary**: Where Riin magic holds polar conditions at bay, creating an instant transition from ice to living forest. The Riin collective maintains this boundary; understanding how could revolutionize climate magic.

## What Will Go Wrong

**Frostfire Depletion**: The Frostfire supply is finite—it's Velkoreth's remaining life force. When it runs out, the titan truly dies, the Nabuhe lose their monopoly, and the economic structure of Venalthier collapses.

**Lunar Fragment Excavation**: Eventually, someone with enough resources will attempt to reach the buried moon fragment. The Riin tried two thousand years ago and the survivors founded Eyendra's merger. Whatever they learned there drove an entire civilization to dissolve itself.

**Keth-Vorun Communication**: The entity at the pole has been trying to communicate for millions of years. If someone successfully translates its language, they might share that comprehension—and Keth-Vorun can sense minds that understand it.

**Ekri's Release**: Two thousand years of isolation may have changed Ekri. If someone finds a way to unseal her tower, what emerges may not be what went in.

**Glassworm Expansion**: The glassworms are confined to Pale Death because prey is scarce elsewhere. If populations in Morelous or the Tundra grow, the worms will follow. They're apex predators with no natural enemies.
