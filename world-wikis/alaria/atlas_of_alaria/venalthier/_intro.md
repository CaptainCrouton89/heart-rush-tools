# Venalthier

## Geography

Venalthier is the frozen polar region occupying the extreme southwest of Upoceax. This is a land of white cliffs, glacial ice, and bitter cold—a world apart from the forests and deserts of the main continent.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eceraen Mountains (running east-west) separate Venalthier from the Wycendeula forests
- **East**: The Sea of Daggers and its extension, the Frozen Sea
- **South**: Open polar ocean
- **West**: Dismar Deep, the southwestern ocean

### Terrain

Venalthier is characterized by:
- White, ice-covered cliffs along much of its coastline
- Glaciated interior
- Polar conditions year-round

### Isolation

Venalthier's position at the southern pole and its mountain barrier to the north make it one of the most isolated regions in Alaria. The Eceraen Mountains form a formidable wall between the frozen south and the relatively more hospitable Wycendeula forests.

### Surrounding Seas

- **Dismar Deep**: The ocean to the southwest
- **Sea of Daggers / Frozen Sea**: The waters to the east, stretching along the entire southern coast of Upoceax
