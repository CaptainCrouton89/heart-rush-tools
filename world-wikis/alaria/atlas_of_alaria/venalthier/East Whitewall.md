## East Whitewall

Tags: cliffs, geography

The first major face of cliffs in Venalthier, home to the Nabuhe dwarves who have carved extensive mining operations into the frozen stone.

### Nabuhe Dwarves

A clan of dwarves adapted to the extreme cold of Venalthier, the Nabuhe have survived in this harsh environment by mining the unique resource that makes life possible in the frozen wastes.

### Frostfire Mines

Deep within East Whitewall, the Nabuhe mine Frostfire—a miraculous material that burns from within, emitting warmth without consuming fuel. This is the only reliable source of heat for the dwarves in the southern frozen regions, making it more valuable than gold or gems.

However, Frostfire possesses a darker property: it has immense power to control people's fear. Those who wield Frostfire can manipulate the primal terror in others' hearts, granting them formidable abilities of psychological manipulation. This dual nature—life-giving warmth and mind-controlling power—makes Frostfire both essential and dangerous. The Nabuhe guard their monopoly on this resource jealously, knowing that losing control of the Frostfire trade would mean losing their survival advantage in Venalthier's brutal climate.
