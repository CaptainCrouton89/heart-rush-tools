## Morelous

Tags: plains, ice, geography

The western expanse of Venalthier's frozen interior, stretching from the Crystal Coast in the northwest to the West Selengreyb lowlands in the south. Morelous is marginally more hospitable than Pale Death to the east—not because conditions are better, but because occasional rocky outcrops provide minimal shelter and navigation points.

### Geography

Morelous covers roughly 180 miles north to south and 120 miles east to west. The terrain is predominantly flat ice plain, similar to Pale Death, but punctuated by scattered rock formations where ancient mountains resist the glacial pressure. These outcrops—called "teeth" by the Nabuhe—rise 50-200 feet above the ice surface and occur roughly every 15-20 miles.

The region sits at lower elevation than the eastern interior, averaging 2,000-3,000 feet. This brings it closer to the moderating influence of the Dismar Deep, resulting in slightly less extreme conditions. "Slightly less extreme" in Venalthier still means temperatures averaging -25°C and persistent winds, but the difference between -25°C and -40°C is the difference between difficult survival and nearly impossible survival.

The ice here shows more variation than Pale Death's uniform white. Blue-tinged areas indicate compressed glacial ice reaching the surface; darker patches suggest volcanic rock just below the snow layer; occasional greenish zones mark where ancient algae somehow survive in the ice. The variation provides navigation references that Pale Death lacks entirely.

### The Teeth

The rocky outcrops that define Morelous serve multiple purposes:

**Navigation**: Each tooth is distinctive—different height, different color, different profile. The Nabuhe have named all significant outcrops and use them as waypoints for travel. A journey across Morelous follows a chain of teeth rather than compass bearings alone.

**Shelter**: The leeward side of any tooth provides respite from the wind. Snow accumulates in these wind shadows, allowing construction of stable shelters. Expeditions plan their daily distances around reaching the next tooth before nightfall.

**Resources**: Some teeth contain caves or overhangs that offer more substantial shelter. A few have been developed into semi-permanent way stations, with cached supplies and improved shelter structures. The Nabuhe maintain these stations, though their locations aren't shared freely.

**Danger**: Predators know about the teeth too. Anything hunting on Morelous uses the outcrops as ambush points. Approaching a tooth carelessly is nearly as dangerous as not reaching one at all.

### The Route to Scepter Mountains

Morelous provides the primary overland route between the Nabuhe settlements in East Whitewall and the coastal passes through the Scepter Mountains. This route sees the most traffic of any in Venalthier—which means perhaps a dozen parties per year in good conditions.

The journey covers approximately 150 miles across Morelous proper, following a chain of seven major teeth between the Whitewalls and the mountain foothills. Under optimal conditions, the crossing takes 5-7 days. Under normal conditions, 10-14 days is more realistic. Under poor conditions, the crossing doesn't happen.

Trade goods move along this route: Frostfire from the Nabuhe mines heading toward the coast for export; imported grain, metal tools, and luxuries heading back. The route's danger limits trade volume—only the most essential or valuable goods justify the risk.

### Fauna

Morelous supports more life than other parts of Venalthier's interior:

**Ice Bears**: Polar bears wander the region, attracted by the slightly warmer conditions near the coast. They're the apex predators of Morelous, capable of bringing down anything they catch. The Nabuhe don't hunt them unless attacked; the risk isn't worth the reward.

**Snow Foxes**: Small, cunning, and numerous. They scavenge from bear kills and ambush smaller prey near the teeth. Their pelts are valuable, but trapping takes time travelers don't have.

**Tooth Spiders**: Large arachnids that survive the cold through unknown adaptations, living in caves and crevices within the teeth. They're venomous and aggressive when disturbed. Entering a tooth's caves without checking for spider occupation is a common way to die.

**Something Else**: Occasionally, travelers report tracks in the snow that match no known animal—too large for bears, too few limbs for any normal creature. The Nabuhe don't discuss these sightings. They simply advise avoiding the areas where such tracks appear.

### Weather Patterns

Morelous sits in the path of storms rolling off the Dismar Deep. These storms are different from the interior's dry cold:

**Ocean Storms**: Relatively warm, wet air from the sea hits the frozen interior and dumps precipitation as heavy snow. These storms can last days, burying landmarks and making travel impossible. They're also warmer than the ambient cold, creating a paradoxical situation where storm conditions are more survivable than the clear weather that follows.

**Clear Periods**: After storms pass, temperatures drop dramatically as the cloud cover disappears. The temperature swing—from -10°C during a storm to -40°C after it passes—kills those who aren't prepared for the change.

**Wind Direction**: Storms bring easterly winds from the coast; clear weather brings the katabatic westerlies from the interior. A shift in wind direction predicts weather changes roughly 6-12 hours in advance.

### For Travelers

Morelous is the least deadly part of Venalthier's interior—but "least deadly" is a relative term.

- **Plan for the teeth**. Know where they are before you start. Running out of daylight between teeth means exposure camping, which is often fatal.
- **Check caves carefully**. The shelter isn't worth the spider bite.
- **Respect the bears**. They own Morelous more than anyone else does. Give them wide berth.
- **Watch the wind**. Easterly wind means storm coming; westerly after a storm means plunging temperatures.
- **Carry extra supplies**. You will be delayed. The question is whether you prepared for it.

The Nabuhe travel Morelous routinely, but they've spent centuries developing the knowledge that makes routine travel possible. What's routine for them remains deadly for anyone else.
