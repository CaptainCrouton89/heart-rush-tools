## Scepter Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, coast

A rugged coastal mountain range running along the western edge of Venalthier, from the Eceraen junction in the north to where the peaks disappear beneath the Whitewall glaciers in the south. The Scepter Mountains form a natural barrier between the frozen interior and the Dismar Deep, their summits catching the last warmth from ocean currents before the polar cold consumes everything.

### Geography

The Scepter Mountains extend roughly 300 miles north to south, with an average width of 40-50 miles. The range rises steeply from the coast, reaching elevations of 8,000-10,000 feet at the highest peaks before descending more gradually toward the Tundra Oblivio interior.

The mountains take their name from their profile when viewed from the sea: a series of sharp peaks that resemble the finials of an ornate scepter, each summit distinct and angular against the sky. The effect is most pronounced at sunset, when the peaks catch light while the lower slopes fall into shadow.

The western slopes face the Dismar Deep and receive significant precipitation—mostly snow, but occasional sleet and freezing rain during warmer periods. This creates substantial glaciation on the seaward faces. The eastern slopes are drier, sitting in the rain shadow, but equally frozen due to cold air drainage from the interior.

### Terrain

The Scepter Mountains are geologically young and extremely rugged:

**Sharp Ridges**: The peaks haven't eroded into rounded forms; knife-edge ridges and near-vertical faces are common. Climbing is technical and dangerous.

**Glacial Valleys**: Deep U-shaped valleys cut between the major peaks, carved by glaciers that have since retreated. These valleys provide the only practical routes through the range.

**Unstable Rock**: The volcanic and sedimentary layers are prone to rockfall and avalanche. The freeze-thaw cycle cracks the stone constantly.

**Coastal Cliffs**: Where the mountains meet the sea, they do so abruptly. Sheer cliffs 500-2,000 feet tall plunge directly into the Dismar Deep, with no beaches and few landing points.

### Climate

The Scepter Mountains experience a hybrid climate—coastal influence from the west, polar conditions from the east:

**Western Slopes**: Warmer than the interior, with temperatures occasionally reaching just above freezing even in winter. Heavy snowfall creates deep accumulation. Fog is common when warm ocean air meets cold mountain surfaces.

**Eastern Slopes**: Full polar conditions. The rain shadow means less precipitation, but what falls stays frozen. Temperatures match Tundra Oblivio levels. Wind exposure is extreme.

**Summits**: Permanently frozen, permanently wind-scoured. Nothing survives at elevation.

### Strategic Value

The Scepter Mountains matter for two reasons:

**Coastal Access**: The range contains the only viable landing points on Venalthier's western coast. Several fjords penetrate the mountain wall, providing protected harbors where ships can anchor. These landing points are the primary connection between Venalthier and the outside world—everything that enters or leaves the frozen south by sea passes through the Scepter coast.

**Route Through**: The glacial valleys provide the only passable routes between the coast and the interior. Anyone traveling from the Dismar Deep to Tundra Oblivio or the Whitewall settlements must pass through the Scepter Mountains. There are perhaps three or four viable passes, and all of them are dangerous.

### The Fjords

Several deep inlets cut into the Scepter coast, remnants of glacial carving:

**Deepest Reach**: The largest fjord, extending nearly 15 miles inland. The innermost waters remain ice-free year-round, warmed by currents from the Dismar Deep. This is the primary entry point for ships serving Venalthier.

**Shatter Bay**: A wide, shallow inlet where ice calving from the surrounding glaciers fills the water with dangerous bergs. Navigation is treacherous, but the bay provides access to the northern passes.

**Ghostwater**: A narrow, mist-shrouded fjord where the water appears to glow faintly in darkness—some property of bioluminescent organisms that survive in the unusual conditions. Local legend claims the glow is the spirits of drowned sailors. The practical effect is that Ghostwater is navigable even in darkness, making it valuable for winter arrivals when daylight is scarce.

### Wildlife

The Scepter Mountains support more life than the interior tundra, though not by much:

**Seabirds**: Large colonies nest on the coastal cliffs, surviving on fish from the Dismar Deep. Their guano creates distinctive white streaks down the dark rock faces.

**Seals and Sea Lions**: Haul out on rocky ledges along the coast. Hunted by anyone who can reach them.

**Mountain Goats**: A hardy subspecies adapted to the extreme conditions. Their wool and meat are valuable; reaching them on the steep terrain is difficult.

**Predators**: Snow leopards, white wolves, and the occasional polar bear wander the mountains. All are dangerous; all are rare.

### Passage Through

The Scepter passes are the only overland routes into Venalthier's interior. All are difficult:

**Coldgate**: The northernmost pass, connecting to the Eceraen foothills. Highest in elevation but shortest in distance. Impassable in winter due to snow accumulation.

**Scepter Gap**: The primary year-round route, lower and longer than Coldgate. Maintained by the Nabuhe as their supply line from the coast. Travelers pay tolls or don't pass.

**Southern Route**: No formal name—a difficult climb over the southern peaks where they begin to merge with the Whitewall glaciers. Only used by those desperate to avoid Nabuhe tolls.

### For Travelers

The Scepter Mountains are dangerous but navigable with preparation:

- **Use the fjords** for coastal access. Don't attempt to land on open cliffs—the rocks will shred your hull.
- **Pay the tolls** at Scepter Gap unless you have compelling reasons to avoid Nabuhe contact. The alternative routes are significantly more dangerous.
- **Carry supplies for delays**. Weather can close passes for days. Running out of food while waiting for a storm to clear is a common way to die.
- **Respect the glaciers**. Crevasses are invisible under fresh snow. Roped travel is mandatory on any ice field.

The mountains are harsh but honest. They don't hide their dangers—anyone can see the cliffs, the glaciers, the exposed ridges. What kills people is underestimating how quickly conditions change, and how far they are from help when things go wrong.
