## Tundra Oblivio

Tags: tundra, geography, wasteland

The vast frozen interior of northern Venalthier, stretching from the southern slopes of the Eceraen Mountains to the edge of the Whitewall glacier fields. Tundra Oblivio is perhaps the most inhospitable habitable region in Alaria—a windswept wasteland where nothing grows, nothing shelters, and survival is measured in hours rather than days.

### Geography

Tundra Oblivio occupies roughly 400 miles north to south and 500 miles east to west—a staggering expanse of frozen emptiness. The terrain is predominantly flat, with only the Blerian Hills and Scepter Mountains breaking the monotony. The ground is permafrost year-round, frozen solid to depths of hundreds of feet.

The tundra sits at moderate elevation, sloping gradually downward from the Eceraen Mountains in the north to the Whitewall cliffs in the south. This creates a persistent drainage pattern: meltwater from the mountains flows south across the frozen plain, cutting shallow channels that freeze solid in winter and become rushing torrents during the brief summer thaw.

Visibility across the tundra is theoretically unlimited—the flat terrain and lack of vegetation mean you can see for miles in clear conditions. In practice, visibility is often measured in feet. Wind-driven snow creates ground blizzards even on sunny days; fog rolls in from the coast; and whiteout conditions make navigation impossible.

### Climate

Tundra Oblivio experiences polar conditions year-round:

**Winter** (roughly 8 months): Temperatures drop to -40°C or colder. Darkness lasts 20+ hours per day at the solstice. Wind chill makes exposed skin deadly within minutes. The ground is covered in hard-packed snow and ice.

**Summer** (roughly 4 months): Temperatures climb to just above freezing on the warmest days. The sun barely dips below the horizon, creating perpetual twilight rather than true darkness. The surface layer of permafrost partially thaws, turning the ground into a treacherous mix of mud, ice, and standing water.

**Wind**: The defining feature of the tundra. Cold air flowing off the Whitewall glaciers creates persistent katabatic winds that blast northward across the plain. Wind speeds of 50-70 mph are common; 100+ mph gusts occur regularly. The wind never stops completely. Ever.

### The Blerian Hills

Rising from the central tundra, the Blerian Hills provide the only significant elevation change between the Eceraen range and the Whitewall. These are not mountains—the highest peaks reach perhaps 1,500 feet above the surrounding plain—but in a landscape of absolute flatness, they loom large.

The hills are composed of ancient volcanic rock, harder than the surrounding sedimentary plain and resistant to glacial erosion. Their presence creates minor wind shadows on their southern slopes, making them one of the few places on the tundra where snow doesn't immediately scour away. This relative shelter has attracted what little life exists in the region.

Lichens grow on the Blerian Hills—the only vegetation in Tundra Oblivio. Small rodents burrow in the rocky soil during summer. Arctic foxes and snow owls hunt the rodents. It's not much of an ecosystem, but it's more than exists anywhere else in the region.

The hills are also rumored to contain ruins—structures buried under ice and rock that predate any known civilization. Expeditions have occasionally reported finding carved stone beneath the permafrost, but the conditions make excavation nearly impossible. Whatever lies buried in the Blerian Hills has remained buried for millennia.

### Morya

On the northern edge of the Blerian Hills, where the slopes descend toward the Eceraen foothills, sits Morya—the only permanent settlement in Tundra Oblivio.

"Settlement" overstates the case. Morya is a collection of ice-block shelters and underground burrows occupied by perhaps 200 souls at peak population. Its residents are outcasts, fugitives, and madmen—people who have chosen to live in conditions that would kill most others rather than face whatever awaited them in civilization.

Morya survives because of three factors:

**Location**: The northern Blerian Hills receive slightly less wind than the open tundra, and proximity to the Eceraen range means occasional game wanders down from the relatively richer hunting grounds to the north.

**Frostfire**: A trickle of Frostfire trade reaches Morya from the Nabuhe dwarves in East Whitewall. Without this magical heat source, the settlement would be impossible. The Nabuhe charge extortionate prices, knowing Morya has no alternatives.

**Desperation**: The people who live here have nowhere else to go. They endure conditions that would break others because the alternative is death—either from the cold or from whatever they fled.

Morya has no formal government, no economy beyond barter, and no future. It exists because people continue to arrive, and some of them survive long enough to help the next arrivals. That's all.

### Wildlife

Tundra Oblivio supports almost no life:

**Migrating Birds**: Some species cross the tundra during seasonal migrations, but none stop. There's nothing to eat.

**Arctic Foxes and Wolves**: Small populations exist in the Blerian Hills, surviving on the limited prey available there. They don't venture onto the open tundra.

**Polar Bears**: Occasionally wander inland from the coastal ice. Extremely dangerous—a starving polar bear will eat anything it catches, and on the open tundra, it can catch anything it sees.

**Ice Worms**: Disputed. Some travelers report seeing massive worms—20, 30, 50 feet long—burrowing through the permafrost. Others dismiss these as hallucinations born of cold and exhaustion. The descriptions are consistent enough to suggest something lives under the ice, but no specimen has ever been recovered.

### Navigation

Crossing Tundra Oblivio is theoretically possible but practically suicidal.

**No Landmarks**: The terrain is featureless. Once you lose sight of the mountains (which happens quickly in poor visibility), there's nothing to navigate by. Compasses work, but magnetic interference near the pole makes them unreliable.

**No Shelter**: There's nothing to hide behind, nothing to build with, nothing to burn. Survival requires carrying everything you need—and carrying enough supplies for a multi-day crossing means carrying more weight than most can manage.

**No Rescue**: If something goes wrong on the open tundra, no one is coming to help. Morya can't mount rescue expeditions; the Nabuhe won't; and no one else is close enough to matter.

The only viable crossing routes hug the edges of the tundra—following the Eceraen foothills along the north, or the Scepter Mountains along the west coast. The open interior is death.

### For Travelers

Don't cross Tundra Oblivio unless you have no other choice.

If you must:

- **Travel along edges only**. The Eceraen foothills and Scepter Mountains provide marginal shelter and navigation references. The open tundra provides nothing.
- **Carry Frostfire** if you can obtain it. Magical heat is the only reliable warmth source; conventional fires are impossible in the wind.
- **Move fast**. Extended exposure is fatal. Plan to cover ground quickly rather than camping extensively.
- **Watch for weather**. Storms can materialize within minutes. When visibility drops, stop immediately and shelter in place. Moving in a whiteout means dying in a whiteout.
- **Avoid Morya** unless desperate. The settlement survives on the edge of viability; visitors strain resources that are already inadequate. You're not welcome unless you bring supplies worth more than you'll consume.

The Nabuhe have a saying: "The tundra doesn't want you dead. It simply doesn't care whether you live." They're being generous. The tundra doesn't notice you at all.
