## Thorne

Tags: poi, druid_territory

A region in the interior of L'Coth D'hari where an ancient druid of the same name has dwelt since before the Gamori arrived. The grove is a place where the forest has become alien—plants move with purpose, animals watch with intelligence, and visitors lose memory of their passage.
