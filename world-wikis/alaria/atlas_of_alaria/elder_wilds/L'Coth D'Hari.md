## L'Coth D'Hari

Tags: state, nation, gamori

The northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds—a multi-lobed landmass of dense jungle surrounded by the South Sea. Territory of the **Gamori**, an elven people obsessed with death, transformation, and the sacred hunt.

L'Coth D'hari functions as a loose republic with multiple communities and elected leadership. The Gamori consider the Elder Wilds their hunting grounds and rarely welcome outsiders.

### Sub-locations

- **Eriyen** — The primary gathering place of the republic
- **Thorne** — Domain of an ancient druid who predates the Gamori
- **Breathless Bay** — Western inlet, fog-shrouded and still
- **Paradise Inlet** — Central waterway dividing the main lobes
- **Farthing Inlet** — Southern boundary with the Apelands
