# Elder Wilds

## Geography

The Elder Wilds occupy the entire eastern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a vast region of ancient rainforest, winding rivers, and primordial wilderness. This is one of the oldest and least tamed regions of the known world, where the jungle has grown undisturbed for millennia.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The South Sea and the waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands
- **East**: Eastern coastline facing the Slumbering Abyss
- **South**: The Dalizi Highlands rise to the south
- **West**: The Wanderlands peninsula and the South Sea

### Terrain

The Elder Wilds are dominated by massive rainforest—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, and countless rivers cutting through the green expanse. The terrain is ancient and wild, with towering trees that predate human civilization. Notable features include:
- Extensive river systems threading through the jungle
- Ancient ruins hidden beneath the canopy
- Varied terrain from coastal lowlands to interior highlands

### Relationship to Surrounding Regions

The Elder Wilds form a natural barrier between the Wanderlands to the west and the Dalizi Highlands/Dalizi confederation to the south. The South Sea provides water access to both the Wanderlands and the distant Shacklands across the strait.

## Notable Locations

### Everlong

Blue ruins, huge crumbling walls, labyrinthine. Blue/black lotus flowers grow throughout, inhabited by shadow hounds. Onyx crystal somewhere in the ruins.

### Forest of Statues

Time witches/hags live in this forest. Turn to stone, slow movements, move faster than you can see. Also Ciri the Time Witch, possesses one of the time stones. Can train you, in exchange for a piece of your soul.

### Seyiy

A centrally located hilly region within the Elder Wilds, notable for its dramatic terrain and treacherous waterways.

#### Archfalls

Moss-covered stone arches span throughout this waterfall-laden region, creating a maze of cascading water and ancient stonework. The slightest misstep sends travelers tumbling toward the abyss below. The water harbors brain-eating amoebae, and water hags lurk in the pools and mists.

The area teems with unusual wildlife—quad-winged dove-like creatures drift through the spray, while pterodactyls nest on the higher arches and hunt in the updrafts. The combination of dangerous fauna, deadly parasites, and treacherous footing makes Archfalls one of the most hazardous locations in the Elder Wilds.
