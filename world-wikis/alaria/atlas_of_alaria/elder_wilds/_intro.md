# Elder Wilds

## Geography

The Elder Wilds occupy the entire eastern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a vast region of ancient rainforest, winding rivers, and primordial wilderness. This is one of the oldest and least tamed regions of the known world, where the jungle has grown undisturbed for millennia.

The region earns its name from the **Anchor Trees**—colossal individuals scattered throughout the wilderness, rising hundreds of feet above the canopy. These ancient giants mark the tombs of titans buried by druids in the aftermath of the Ezz Rift, 120 million years ago.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The South Sea and the waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands
- **East**: Eastern coastline facing the Slumbering Abyss
- **South**: The Dalizi Highlands rise to the south
- **West**: The Wanderlands peninsula and the South Sea

### Terrain

The Elder Wilds are dominated by massive rainforest—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, and countless rivers cutting through the green expanse. The terrain varies dramatically:

- **Northern Peninsula (L'Coth D'hari)**: Dense jungle covering a multi-lobed landmass, controlled by the Gamori elves
- **Central Highlands (Seyiy)**: Rolling hills and dramatic waterfall systems, the highest ground in the region
- **Western Lowlands (Aphenlein)**: Flat, flooded jungle with slow-moving rivers forming moat-like channels between trees
- **Eastern Forests (Bygos Shemazari, Runeglades)**: Rainforest giving way to seasonal floodplains along the coast

### Why It's Empty

Three points of interest across 340,000 square miles. The Elder Wilds are not frontier waiting for settlement—they are wilderness that refuses habitation.

The beasts here are simply not worth the cost. Forty-foot apes roam the Apelands, territorial and violent. Pterodactyls hunt from the Archfalls. Water hags lurk in the river systems. Brain-eating amoebae infest the pools. Shadow hounds stalk the blue ruins of Everlong. The flooded Aphenlein forests can't support permanent structures—the moats shift seasonally, and anything built sinks.

What settlements exist are either ancient (L'Coth D'hari's hidden Gamori communities), inaccessible (Urzula beneath its waterfalls), or the territory of beings who prefer solitude over company.

### Relationship to Surrounding Regions

The Elder Wilds form a natural barrier between the Wanderlands to the west and the Dalizi Highlands to the south. The South Sea provides water access to both the Wanderlands and the distant Shacklands across the strait. An astral current crosses the region diagonally, but with no settlements along its route, it sees virtually no traffic.

## The Anchor Trees

Scattered throughout the Elder Wilds—from the Apelands in the north to the edges of the Dalizi Highlands in the south—stand the Anchor Trees. These colossal individuals dwarf even the ancient rainforest canopy, rising three hundred feet or more, their trunks so massive that small communities could live within hollowed sections.

### Origin

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria with Melera's music 120 million years ago, the titans experienced emotion for the first time. For beings of pure Deoric order, this contact with raw feeling was unbearable agony. Many killed themselves. Others fled to distant planar stacks.

Those who died in the Elder Wilds were buried by the druids—the only beings who could safely handle titan remains while channeling Faesong to bind the cosmic energies. Where druids sang titan corpses into the earth, the Anchor Trees grew. Their roots wrap around titan bones that never decay. Their sap carries traces of Deoric resonance.

### The Collective

The Anchor Trees are aware. Not individually intelligent—each tree is no more sentient than any ancient oak—but together they form a slow, distributed consciousness. They communicate across decades through root networks and spore dispersal. They remember fragments of the titans they anchor: impressions of an age before emotion, echoes of Deoric speech, the traumatic flood of feeling that ended everything.

Druids can sometimes perceive this collective awareness. Faesong practitioners hear it as a bass note beneath their music—impossibly deep, impossibly slow. Psy-sensitives approaching an Anchor Tree feel the weight of geological time pressing against their minds.

The trees are not hostile. They are patient beyond mortal comprehension. They are waiting—for what, no one knows.

## The Shemazari Ruins

Dotted throughout the Elder Wilds are the remnants of an ancient civilization—step pyramids swallowed by jungle, stone faces worn smooth by millennia of rain, processional ways now choked with strangler figs. These are the ruins of the **Shemazari**, a kingdom that flourished during the early Third Eon before vanishing without historical record.

### What Remains

The Shemazari built in pale stone that the jungle has since stained green and black. Their structures share distinctive features:
- **Stepped pyramids** with flat tops, often partially collapsed, found near river confluences
- **Carved faces** worked into cliff sides and boulder surfaces, expressions serene or anguished
- **Canal systems** now flooded and integrated into the natural waterways
- **Underground chambers** beneath the pyramids, most long since looted or collapsed

The largest concentration of ruins lies in **Bygos Shemazari** ("Old Shemazari" in corrupted local dialect)—the eastern rainforest where the civilization likely centered. But smaller sites appear throughout the region, suggesting the Shemazari controlled far more territory than the jungle has revealed.

### What Happened

No one knows. The Shemazari left no decipherable writing, no clear descendants, no legend of their fall. Scholars have proposed plague, internal war, ecological collapse, or magical catastrophe. The Gamori of L'Coth D'hari claim the Shemazari "went into the trees"—whether this is metaphor, myth, or literal truth is unclear.

Some adventurers note that the oldest Anchor Trees often stand near Shemazari sites. Whether the Shemazari worshipped the trees, tended them, or were destroyed by them remains a matter of speculation.

## L'Coth D'hari

The northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds—a multi-lobed landmass of dense jungle surrounded by the South Sea. L'Coth D'hari is the territory of the **Gamori**, an elven people obsessed with death, transformation, and the sacred hunt.

### Geography

L'Coth D'hari comprises several forested peninsulas separated by:
- **Breathless Bay**: The western inlet, fog-shrouded and still
- **Paradise Inlet**: The central waterway dividing the main lobes
- **Farthing Inlet**: The southern boundary separating L'Coth D'hari from the Apelands

The entire territory is densely forested with minimal clearings. Outsiders find navigation nearly impossible without guides.

### The Gamori Republic

L'Coth D'hari functions as a loose republic. Multiple Gamori communities exist throughout the peninsula, each with elected leadership. These leaders gather at **Eriyen** to make decisions affecting the whole territory.

The Gamori are elves who have developed a culture centered on:
- **Death and rebirth cycles** — They view death not as an ending but as transformation
- **Body modification** — Scarification, bone-shaping, implants of natural materials
- **Sacred hunting** — Rituals involving the pursuit and consumption of specific prey

Outsiders are rarely welcome. The Gamori consider the Elder Wilds their hunting grounds and have been known to dismantle settlement attempts south of their borders.

### Eriyen

The closest thing L'Coth D'hari has to a capital—though "gathering place" is more accurate than "city." Eriyen sits in the western lobe near Breathless Bay. Here the elected leaders convene during significant moments: disputes between communities, external threats, or decisions about outsiders seeking passage.

Eriyen itself is less a permanent settlement than a ceremonial ground with temporary structures that appear and disappear with the political calendar.

### Thorne

In the interior of L'Coth D'hari, away from the coasts and the Gamori communities, lies **Thorne**—the domain of a druid who has dwelt in the Elder Wilds since before the Gamori arrived.

Thorne (both the place and the being who inhabits it) is not exactly evil, but operates by principles that most mortals find disturbing. The druid Thorne is ancient, immortal in the way of greater elves, and has pursued a path that diverged from traditional Faesong practice long ago. Some whisper of bargains with entities in the Anchor Tree collective. Others speak of experiments with the boundary between life and death—fitting for a neighbor of the death-obsessed Gamori.

The grove called Thorne is not a fortress. It is a place where the forest itself has become alien—where the plants move with too much purpose, where the animals watch with too much intelligence, where visitors find themselves forgetting why they came.

The Gamori give it wide berth. They have an understanding with the druid, the terms of which they do not discuss.

## The Apelands

South of L'Coth D'hari, across Farthing Inlet, lies a stretch of rainforest dominated by its most dangerous inhabitants: the great apes.

These are not ordinary primates. The apes of the Apelands stand forty feet tall, covered in dark fur, possessed of terrifying strength and violent territorial instincts. They roam the forest in loose bands, battling each other for dominance, and killing anything they perceive as a threat.

No one has successfully studied them. Expeditions that enter the Apelands either return within days or don't return at all. What little is known comes from observation at the boundaries:
- They are omnivorous but prefer meat
- They communicate through deep vocalizations that carry for miles
- They appear to have some form of social hierarchy, though the specifics are unclear
- They occasionally venture south into Seyiy and Bloodwood, causing devastation

Why apes of this size evolved here—whether natural adaptation or magical intervention—remains unknown. Some scholars note that the Anchor Trees are particularly numerous in and around the Apelands.

---

## Bloodwood

The forest west of the Apelands and north of Seyiy takes its name from its dominant tree species—the bloodwood, a hardwood with deep red heartwood that bleeds crimson sap when cut.

Bloodwood timber is extraordinarily valuable:
- Rot-resistant even in the wettest conditions
- Fire-resistant to temperatures that would char ordinary wood
- Beautiful when finished, with rich red grain patterns

The problem is harvesting it. Bloodwood forest sits between the Apelands to the north and the dangerous Seyiy highlands to the south. Logging expeditions must contend with ape incursions, the beasts of Seyiy, and the forest's own dangers. Most bloodwood that reaches markets comes from the Jungles of Titania in the Shacklands—a longer route but one with fewer forty-foot apes.

---

## Seyiy

The central highlands of the Elder Wilds—a dramatic region of hills, waterfalls, and treacherous terrain. Seyiy rises from the surrounding lowland jungle like a rumpled blanket, its rivers carving deep valleys and plunging over cliff faces.

### Terrain

Seyiy is defined by its elevation changes. Rolling hills give way to sudden drops. Rivers that flow placidly through the lowlands become rushing torrents here, tumbling over falls and through rocky gorges. The constant mist from so many waterfalls creates a unique microclimate—cooler, wetter, and thick with plant growth that clings to every surface.

### River Systems

From Seyiy's heights, water drains in three directions:
- **North** — Three major rivers flow north through Bloodwood to empty into Farthing Inlet
- **West** — Numerous rivers descend through North Aphenlein and Aphenlein to Thrumbling Bay
- **East** — The Saploeth River and its tributaries flow through Bygos Shemazari to the eastern coast

These rivers are the only practical highways through the Elder Wilds. Overland travel through the jungle is nearly impossible; the rivers offer routes—difficult and dangerous, but navigable.

### Archfalls

In the southern reaches of Seyiy lies the Archfalls—a maze of waterfalls, ancient stonework, and death.

Moss-covered stone arches span the cascades, creating a labyrinth of spray and crumbling masonry. The origin of these arches is unknown; they predate the Shemazari and may be titan-era construction. Whatever purpose they once served has been forgotten. Now they serve as perches for pterodactyls, hunting grounds for water hags, and graves for the unwary.

The water here harbors brain-eating amoebae. Quad-winged dove-like creatures drift through the spray—beautiful and apparently harmless, though no one has studied them closely enough to be certain. The combination of dangerous fauna, deadly parasites, slick stone, and sheer drops makes Archfalls one of the most hazardous locations in the Elder Wilds.

### Urzula

North of the Archfalls, built beneath massive waterfalls, sits the city of Urzula—the only significant settlement in the Elder Wilds outside L'Coth D'hari.

Urzula clings to cliff faces and occupies caves behind the falling water. Climbers hang from ropes, harvesting the plants that grow in the perpetual mist—rare herbs, medicinal mosses, bioluminescent fungi. The city is accessible only by dangerous climbing routes or by navigating the treacherous rivers.

Beneath modern Urzula lie the ruins of an ancient titan city. The current inhabitants know the ruins are there—they occasionally find artifacts, strange inscriptions, chambers of unknown purpose—but they've never fully explored what lies below. The depths are dangerous, and Urzula's people are more interested in surviving the present than excavating the past.

## The Aphenlein Forests

West of Seyiy, descending toward Thrumbling Bay, the terrain flattens dramatically. Here the Elder Wilds transform into something different: the Aphenlein forests, where the jungle becomes as much water as land.

### North Aphenlein

The transitional zone between Seyiy's hills and the true Aphenlein. Rivers from the highlands spread and slow here, beginning the process of flooding that defines the region. The forest is dense but navigable; the water channels are not yet the impassable moats of the southern reaches.

### Aphenlein

True Aphenlein is flat, flooded jungle. Slow-moving rivers weave between ancient trees, their waters forming moat-like channels that separate islands of raised ground. During the dry season, the moats are chest-deep. During the wet season, they rise overhead.

Travel here is exclusively by canoe or raft. Walking means wading—or swimming. The trees have adapted to permanent flooding: aerial root systems arch above the water, floating seed pods drift on the current, bioluminescent fungi cling to submerged trunks and glow faintly at night.

The danger in Aphenlein is not monsters—it's navigation. The channels shift seasonally. Landmarks submerge. Maps made in dry season become useless when the waters rise. People who enter without guides don't find their way out. They become lost in the endless green maze, paddling in circles until exhaustion or predators claim them.

Freshwater dolphins move through the deeper channels—the same species that swims up into the Runeglades during flood season. Giant salamanders lurk in the murky water. Fish that climb trees watch from branches overhead. It is beautiful and lethal in equal measure.

---

## Bygos Shemazari

The eastern rainforest of the Elder Wilds—"Old Shemazari" in corrupted local usage, and the region where the ancient Shemazari civilization likely centered.

The jungle here is dense but punctuated by ruins. Step pyramids rise from the canopy, visible from the eastern coast. Stone faces peer from cliff sides along the Saploeth River. Underground chambers—most collapsed or flooded—honeycomb the ground beneath the forest floor.

Modern interest in Bygos Shemazari is limited by its inaccessibility. The eastern coast offers few natural harbors. The interior is trackless jungle. And the Runeglades to the south flood annually, cutting off overland approaches for months at a time.

Those who have explored the region report that the ruins feel watched. Not by inhabitants—the Shemazari are long gone—but by the forest itself, or perhaps by the stone faces that stare with worn, serene expressions.

---

## Runeglades

The coastal lowlands southeast of Seyiy, where the Elder Wilds meet the Slumbering Abyss.

The Runeglades flood every year. When the seasonal rains come and the rivers swell, the entire region becomes a shallow inland sea. The jungle here has adapted—trees with stilt roots, floating vegetation mats, wildlife that migrates vertically rather than horizontally.

And the dolphins come.

Swimming up from the ocean, pods of freshwater dolphins navigate the flooded forest, hunting fish driven from the deeper channels. They're more intelligent than they should be—following boats, responding to calls, apparently communicating among themselves with clicks and whistles that carry complex information.

The local name "Runeglades" comes from markings found on certain trees and stones—patterns that might be Shemazari writing, might be natural formations, might be something else entirely. During flood season, some of these marked surfaces glow faintly beneath the water. No one has explained why.

---

## Kidwood

The southern forest, between the Aphenlein system and the Dalizi Highlands. Kidwood is less dramatic than the northern regions—standard rainforest without the flooding of Aphenlein or the hills of Seyiy—but it serves as a transition zone where the Elder Wilds begin to give way to the different character of the Dalizi.

The Frosnos River flows through Kidwood, one of the primary waterways connecting the interior to the southern coast. Small Shemazari ruins dot the forest, but none of the major pyramid sites.

---

## Lemru Nymor

The southeastern hills, between Kidwood and the coast. Lemru Nymor represents the last of the Elder Wilds before the terrain rises toward the Dalizi Highlands. The forest here is thinner, the hills more pronounced, the climate drier.

Anchor Trees are rare in Lemru Nymor—only a handful stand in the hills, suggesting that fewer titans died or were buried in this region.

---

## Minori Ezag

In the northeast of the Elder Wilds, where three Anchor Trees stand in unusual proximity, dwells **Minori Ezag**—an ancient druid of extreme power and questionable sanity.

Minori Ezag climbs between trees like a primate, moving through the canopy with unsettling speed and grace. Their age is unclear but certainly measured in centuries; their gender is ambiguous or perhaps irrelevant. They have lived among the Anchor Trees for so long that some speculate they've become attuned to the collective consciousness—that they hear what the trees remember, perceive what the trees perceive.

What Minori Ezag does in their territory is unknown. They accept no students. They offer no wisdom. Occasionally they're spotted from a distance, moving through the treetops at dusk. Occasionally travelers who pass too close find themselves... redirected. Not attacked—simply turned around, their path subtly altered until they're heading away without remembering when they changed direction.

The three Anchor Trees near Minori Ezag's territory are the only ones in the Elder Wilds that stand so close together. Whether this is why the druid settled here, or whether their presence has caused the trees to grow in unusual proximity, is yet another mystery of the Elder Wilds.

---

## Thrumbling Bay

The bay on the western coast where the rivers of Aphenlein empty into the South Sea. Thrumbling Bay earned its name from the sound—the constant low rumble of water flowing from dozens of river mouths, creating a background noise that visitors describe as both soothing and unsettling.

The bay itself is shallow, the water brown with silt, the coastline a maze of river deltas and mangrove-like vegetation. This is not a natural harbor—ships cannot easily approach, and there's nothing to approach for. Thrumbling Bay marks the edge of the navigable world. Beyond lies only the endless green of the Aphenlein, and beyond that, the hostile heights of Seyiy.

---

## Notable Locations

### Everlong

Blue ruins, huge crumbling walls, labyrinthine. The stone itself carries a faint azure tint—some mineral in the original construction, or perhaps staining from the blue and black lotus flowers that grow throughout the ruins.

Everlong predates the Shemazari. Its builders are unknown. Its original purpose is lost. What remains are walls that seem to extend forever, turning and twisting in patterns that may once have had meaning. An onyx crystal of significant size and unknown purpose lies somewhere within—multiple expeditions have sought it, few have returned.

The ruins are inhabited by shadow hounds—creatures of Malstaric origin that have somehow established a permanent presence in the material plane. They hunt at night, invisible in darkness, and their bites drain not blood but shadow—leaving victims diminished, faded, less substantial with each wound.

### Forest of Statues

An ancient, eerily silent expanse of the Elder Wilds where reality bends and time becomes a tangible force. The Forest of Statues is the site of **The Stillness**—a permanent Izzus (time) breach that has existed since the Lost Ages, creating one of the most dangerous and mysterious locations in Alaria.

#### The Stillness: A Temporal Breach

Within the forest, time flows in deeply inconsistent patterns. The breach itself is not localized to a single point but pervades the entire forest region, creating zones of accelerated, decelerated, and frozen time. Those who venture into the forest without understanding its nature face a horrifying fate: they slow down progressively, their movements becoming increasingly sluggish until they effectively become stone-like—frozen in moments that stretch for centuries from the outside world, yet feel like mere seconds from their own distorted perspective.

The statues that give the forest its name are victims of The Stillness—travelers, explorers, and adventurers who became trapped by the temporal anomaly, their bodies hardened and petrified by the strange forces at work. Some are centuries old; others are recent additions to the forest's grim collection.

#### The Time Witches

Over centuries, a society of witches and hags has learned to navigate The Stillness and exploit its power. These **time witches** possess an innate understanding of temporal flow—a gift or curse that allows them to move within the breach as others move through normal space. To outsiders, they appear to move impossibly fast, blurring between moments. They inhabit the forest and guard its secrets jealously.

The time witches have become custodians of a unique form of power: **time stones**—artifacts of concentrated Izzus energy that channel the breach's temporal manipulations. These stones are rare, precious, and tightly controlled by the witch communities. Those who possess them can influence time on localized scales, though the cost of such power is invariably steep.

#### Ciri the Time Witch

Among the time witches, **Ciri** stands out as a legendary figure—ancient, powerful, and possessor of one of the most potent time stones. She is said to have lived through multiple centuries of subjective experience while only decades passed in the outside world. Ciri has been known to accept capable and determined travelers as students, teaching them to navigate The Stillness and understand temporal magic. However, her price is steep: she demands a piece of her student's soul—a literal fragment of their essence—in exchange for knowledge that most could never acquire elsewhere.

Those who have trained under Ciri emerge transformed, bearing subtle marks of temporal affinity and understanding, but forever diminished in some ineffable way.
