# Elder Wilds

## Geography

The Elder Wilds occupy the entire eastern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a vast region of ancient rainforest, winding rivers, and primordial wilderness. This is one of the oldest and least tamed regions of the known world, where the jungle has grown undisturbed for millennia.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The South Sea and the waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands
- **East**: Eastern coastline facing the Slumbering Abyss
- **South**: The Dalizi Highlands rise to the south
- **West**: The Wanderlands peninsula and the South Sea

### Terrain

The Elder Wilds are dominated by massive rainforest—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, and countless rivers cutting through the green expanse. The terrain is ancient and wild, with towering trees that predate human civilization. Notable features include:
- Extensive river systems threading through the jungle
- Ancient ruins hidden beneath the canopy
- Varied terrain from coastal lowlands to interior highlands

### Relationship to Surrounding Regions

The Elder Wilds form a natural barrier between the Wanderlands to the west and the Dalizi Highlands/Dalizi confederation to the south. The South Sea provides water access to both the Wanderlands and the distant Shacklands across the strait.
