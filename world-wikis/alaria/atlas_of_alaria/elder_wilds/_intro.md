# Elder Wilds

## Geography

The Elder Wilds occupy the entire eastern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a vast region of ancient rainforest, winding rivers, and primordial wilderness. This is one of the oldest and least tamed regions of the known world, where the jungle has grown undisturbed for millennia.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The South Sea and the waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands
- **East**: Eastern coastline facing the Slumbering Abyss
- **South**: The Dalizi Highlands rise to the south
- **West**: The Wanderlands peninsula and the South Sea

### Terrain

The Elder Wilds are dominated by massive rainforest—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, and countless rivers cutting through the green expanse. The terrain is ancient and wild, with towering trees that predate human civilization. Notable features include:
- Extensive river systems threading through the jungle
- Ancient ruins hidden beneath the canopy
- Varied terrain from coastal lowlands to interior highlands

### Relationship to Surrounding Regions

The Elder Wilds form a natural barrier between the Wanderlands to the west and the Dalizi Highlands/Dalizi confederation to the south. The South Sea provides water access to both the Wanderlands and the distant Shacklands across the strait.

## Notable Locations

### Everlong

Blue ruins, huge crumbling walls, labyrinthine. Blue/black lotus flowers grow throughout, inhabited by shadow hounds. Onyx crystal somewhere in the ruins.

### Forest of Statues

An ancient, eerily silent expanse of the Elder Wilds where reality bends and time becomes a tangible force. The Forest of Statues is the site of **The Stillness**—a permanent Izzus (time) breach that has existed since the Lost Ages, creating one of the most dangerous and mysterious locations in Alaria.

#### The Stillness: A Temporal Breach

Within the forest, time flows in deeply inconsistent patterns. The breach itself is not localized to a single point but pervades the entire forest region, creating zones of accelerated, decelerated, and frozen time. Those who venture into the forest without understanding its nature face a horrifying fate: they slow down progressively, their movements becoming increasingly sluggish until they effectively become stone-like—frozen in moments that stretch for centuries from the outside world, yet feel like mere seconds from their own distorted perspective.

The statues that give the forest its name are victims of The Stillness—travelers, explorers, and adventurers who became trapped by the temporal anomaly, their bodies hardened and petrified by the strange forces at work. Some are centuries old; others are recent additions to the forest's grim collection.

#### The Time Witches

Over centuries, a society of witches and hags has learned to navigate The Stillness and exploit its power. These **time witches** possess an innate understanding of temporal flow—a gift or curse that allows them to move within the breach as others move through normal space. To outsiders, they appear to move impossibly fast, blurring between moments. They inhabit the forest and guard its secrets jealously.

The time witches have become custodians of a unique form of power: **time stones**—artifacts of concentrated Izzus energy that channel the breach's temporal manipulations. These stones are rare, precious, and tightly controlled by the witch communities. Those who possess them can influence time on localized scales, though the cost of such power is invariably steep.

#### Ciri the Time Witch

Among the time witches, **Ciri** stands out as a legendary figure—ancient, powerful, and possessor of one of the most potent time stones. She is said to have lived through multiple centuries of subjective experience while only decades passed in the outside world. Ciri has been known to accept capable and determined travelers as students, teaching them to navigate The Stillness and understand temporal magic. However, her price is steep: she demands a piece of her student's soul—a literal fragment of their essence—in exchange for knowledge that most could never acquire elsewhere.

Those who have trained under Ciri emerge transformed, bearing subtle marks of temporal affinity and understanding, but forever diminished in some ineffable way.

### Seyiy

A centrally located hilly region within the Elder Wilds, notable for its dramatic terrain and treacherous waterways.

#### Archfalls

Moss-covered stone arches span throughout this waterfall-laden region, creating a maze of cascading water and ancient stonework. The slightest misstep sends travelers tumbling toward the abyss below. The water harbors brain-eating amoebae, and water hags lurk in the pools and mists.

The area teems with unusual wildlife—quad-winged dove-like creatures drift through the spray, while pterodactyls nest on the higher arches and hunt in the updrafts. The combination of dangerous fauna, deadly parasites, and treacherous footing makes Archfalls one of the most hazardous locations in the Elder Wilds.

### Urzula

A city built beneath massive waterfalls in the Seyiy region, north of the Archfalls. Climbers hang from the cliffside rocks, harvesting the plants that grow in the perpetual mist. The city is surrounded by dense rainforest, and the ruins of an ancient titan city lie beneath the modern settlement.

The Archfalls lie further south from Urzula, marking the perilous waterfall confluence.
