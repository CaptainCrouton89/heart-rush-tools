# Giant Lands

## Geography

The Giant Lands occupy the central region of Upoceax—a hilly territory surrounded by mountains on multiple sides. As the name suggests, this is a land primarily inhabited by giants, who have made the rolling hills and valleys their home.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach Mountains
- **East**: The Sand Reach Mountains continue along the eastern edge
- **South**: Wycendeula and its forests
- **West**: The Sand Reach Mountains and Kelder Mountains

### Terrain

The Giant Lands are characterized by hilly terrain—not as dramatic as the surrounding mountain ranges, but elevated and varied. The landscape provides ample territory for the giant populations to hunt, settle, and maintain their way of life.

### Inhabitants

The region is home to various giant populations, including the Güli mountain giants who inhabit the Gül Mountains. Most giants here are relatively peaceful, subsisting on hunting megafauna and large oxen.
