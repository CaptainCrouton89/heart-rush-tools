## Xeltri Plateau

Tags: plateau, giants, ogres, geography

A broad, elevated tableland in the northern Giant Lands, positioned between the Hills of Gezzeri to the north and Malo Kon Greikh to the south. The plateau was once home to a sophisticated ogre civilization—fortress cities built from the plateau's abundant stone, connected by paved roads and defended by disciplined ogre legions.

That civilization is gone. A few years ago, a massive warband of hill giants from Triuci swept across the plateau, demolishing everything in their path. The ogre city-states fell one by one, their inhabitants killed or scattered. The giants didn't stay to occupy—they simply destroyed and moved on, leaving the plateau a graveyard of shattered fortifications.

### The Ruins

The ruined ogre cities are now picked over by scavengers, treasure hunters, and the occasional desperate refugee. The giants stripped obvious valuables, but ogre engineering hid many things in ways giants couldn't be bothered to find. The ruins are dangerous—unstable structures, lingering ogre traps, and creatures that have moved into the abandoned spaces.

#### Sypha Kestil

The northernmost of the ruined cities, positioned to watch the approaches from Triuci. Sypha Kestil's walls were the first to fall when the giants came. The ruins are relatively picked-over, having been accessible longest, but the city's underground granaries may still hold preserved supplies—and whatever was locked in the vaults beneath the citadel.

#### Drigard Gakh

A ruined city-state in the northern plateau, once a military stronghold. Its armories were legendary among the ogres.

#### Grug Rirmor

A ruined city-state in the central plateau. Grug Rirmor was the ogres' administrative center—if records of their civilization survive anywhere, they're buried here.

#### Urkrakr

A ruined city-state on the eastern plateau edge.

#### Cherruzil

A ruined city-state in the central-southern plateau, known for its temple complex dedicated to ogre ancestor spirits.

#### Zremmad Khag

The southernmost of the major ruins, positioned on the plateau's edge overlooking Malo Kon Greikh. The giants of Malo Kon Greikh have been known to send parties to loot Zremmad Khag, considering it within their sphere of influence.

### Mina's House

A strange structure near Cherruzil that predates the ogre civilization—or at least, the ogres claimed it did. Mina's House is a squat stone building with no windows and a single door that opens onto a staircase descending into darkness. The ogres avoided it. Treasure hunters who've explored report that the stairs go down much farther than should be possible, and that something lives at the bottom.

The identity of "Mina" is unknown. The name comes from ogre records.

### Ulle Alari

A settlement on the western edge of the plateau where it meets the Mathavia Mountains. Ulle Alari survived the giant invasion—barely—by virtue of its position in terrain too rough for the giants to bother with. The settlement is now home to ogre refugees, human scavengers, and others who make their living picking over the plateau's ruins. It's a rough, lawless place where questions about the past aren't welcome.
