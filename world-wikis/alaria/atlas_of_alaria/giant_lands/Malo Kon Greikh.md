## Malo Kon Greikh

Tags: state, nation, giants

The dominant giant nation in the southern Giant Lands, comprising a loose confederation of city-states along the Xcraya River Valley and surrounding highlands. Unlike the savage hill giants of Triuci, the giants of Malo Kon Greikh have built a civilization—crude by human standards, but sophisticated enough to maintain cities, conduct trade, and engage in politics beyond simple violence.

### Geography

Malo Kon Greikh sprawls across the fertile Xcraya River Valley and the hills on either side. The Xcraya River provides water, transportation, and the agricultural base that supports the giant population. The northern border is loosely defined by the Xeltri Plateau; the eastern edge runs along the Gezzeri River where it marks the boundary with the Drystone Mountains.

### Political Structure

Each city-state in Malo Kon Greikh is ruled by a chief or council, and each considers itself sovereign. The "nation" of Malo Kon Greikh is really a network of alliances, feuds, and trade relationships that shifts constantly. Wars between city-states are common but rarely genocidal—the giants understand that destroying rivals completely just creates opportunities for outsiders.

When external threats arise, the city-states can coordinate, but slowly and grudgingly. A true unified response requires a threat significant enough to make the chiefs set aside their rivalries—which hasn't happened in living memory.

### The City-States

#### Morgrad

The largest and most politically significant of the giant city-states, positioned at the confluence of the Xcraya River and its major tributaries. Morgrad's chief claims precedence over the other cities—a claim most ignore, but which gives Morgrad outsized influence in regional politics.

#### Zord Oshbag

A northern city-state near the Xeltri Plateau border. Zord Oshbag's giants have taken to looting the ruined ogre cities, and the settlement has become a hub for trading recovered ogre artifacts.

#### Vrommol

An eastern city-state along the Gezzeri River, positioned to trade with (and raid) the settlements of Breia.

#### Kregkard

A prosperous city-state in the eastern valley, known for its metalworkers who produce giant-scale weapons and tools.

#### Kebuz Bakh

A southern city-state with access to lowland trade routes.

#### Zeror Gokh

A central city-state that serves as a neutral meeting ground for inter-city negotiations—when such negotiations occur.

#### Bragkur

A city-state in the central valley, frequently allied with Morgrad.

#### Vog Dridril

A southern city-state near the valley's end, trading with regions further south.

#### Xhodon

A western city-state in the upper valley, known for herding the massive cattle that form the base of giant diet.

#### Egzahd

A southwestern city-state in the hill country.

#### Khurgril

A western city-state near the Mathavia Mountains.

#### Ulbrizil

The westernmost city-state, positioned where the Xcraya River Valley meets the mountains.

### Geographic Features

#### Xcraya River Valley

The fertile heart of Malo Kon Greikh, where the Xcraya River and its tributaries provide water for agriculture and transportation between city-states. The valley floor is cultivated with giant-scale crops—massive grain varieties, orchards of trees that would be forests elsewhere, and pastures for the enormous cattle the giants raise.

#### Gezzeri River

The eastern boundary of Malo Kon Greikh, flowing south from the Hills of Gezzeri through the borderlands between giant territory and the Drystone Mountains. The river marks a rough frontier—giants on the west, Breia and other human settlements on the east. Both sides raid across the river regularly.

#### Prisoner Hills

A region of rough hill country in the eastern part of Malo Kon Greikh, named for the tradition of keeping captives there. Giants who take prisoners in raids—whether for ransom, labor, or eventual consumption—hold them in camps scattered through these hills. Escape is theoretically possible but practically difficult; the terrain is disorienting, and escapees must cross giant territory to reach safety.

#### Xcraya Pallir

The broad floodplain where the Xcraya River spreads out before reaching the southern lowlands. This marshy, seasonally flooded region marks the southern extent of Malo Kon Greikh's effective control.
