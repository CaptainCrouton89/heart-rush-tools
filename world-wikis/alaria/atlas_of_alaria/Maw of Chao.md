## Maw of Chao

Tags: poi, island

The Maw of Chao is a volcanic island surrounded by a hundred mile fog of memory loss. This fog protects the island, which is the hatching ground for thousands of dragons.

The island is guarded over, by Damasaki Edara, the daughter of Nagatayora, a massive female dragon who raises the eggs before setting them free. The dragon riders of Adrus (now Adron) would travel to the Maw of Chao to be blessed by Damasaki Edara, and thereby be approved to raise and ride with dragons.
