# Aboyinzu

Aboyinzu stretches like a hooked tail along the southwestern edge of the known world. Temperate states in the northwest give way to vast savannas, humid jungles, and the cold, mist-shrouded Dragon's Spine mountains in the far south. Multiple mountain chains—the Crystal Mountains, the Morygun range, and the Dalizi Highlands—carve the continent into distinct biomes, while the Deadloop inner sea cuts deep into its heart. To the east, the South Sea separates Aboyinzu from the Shacklands, and to the west the Wanderlands peninsula reaches toward distant horizons.
