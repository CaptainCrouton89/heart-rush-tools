## Kokotintin

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The jewel of the Free Isles and the wealthiest city in southern Alaria. Kokotintin is a sprawling metropolis of canals, marble palaces, and blood-soaked arenas where fortunes change hands faster than the tides. It is the seat of the Valdrossi family—the most powerful of the Five Families—and the undisputed commercial capital of the archipelago.

### The City

Kokotintin occupies the largest island in the central Free Isles cluster, its natural harbor expanded over centuries into a labyrinth of artificial channels that allow ships to dock directly at merchant warehouses. The city rises in tiers from the waterline—dockside markets at the bottom, merchant quarters in the middle, and the palatial estates of the wealthy crowning the central hill. The Valdrossi palazzo dominates the summit, its gilded dome visible from any point in the harbor.

The architecture is ostentatious by design. Marble façades, bronze fixtures, murals depicting trade victories and arena champions. Every building competes to display wealth, because in Kokotintin, appearance *is* wealth. A merchant whose palazzo looks shabby won't get contracts. A family whose gondolas look cheap won't get respect.

Canals serve as streets. Gondolas and cargo barges crowd the waterways, poled by indentured oarsmen who know every shortcut and every family's territory. The poor live in floating houseboats or cramped rooms above the waterline, packed into buildings that lean dangerously over the canals. When it rains, the lower levels flood. No one with money notices.

### The Grand Coliseum

The *Arena Valdrossi*—commonly called the Grand Coliseum—is the largest gladiatorial arena in the Free Isles and possibly in all of Upoceax. It seats forty thousand and is rarely less than half full. The games run almost daily: morning bouts for amateurs and criminals, afternoon matches for professional gladiators, evening spectacles featuring exotic beasts, mass battles, or high-profile duels.

The arena floor can be flooded for naval recreations, fitted with obstacles for hunt scenarios, or stripped bare for formal combat. Beneath the floor, a warren of cells, training rooms, and beast pens houses the fighters and creatures waiting their turn. The tunnels connect to the canal system—bodies go out, fresh fighters come in.

**Red, the Screaming Blade** fights here most often, though she appears at other arenas for special events. Her matches always sell out. Betting on her fights moves more gold than some merchant fleets.

### The Valdrossi Family

The Valdrossi have ruled Kokotintin for four generations, and they intend to rule it for four more. Their power comes from three sources: control of the harbor master's office (every ship pays them tariffs), ownership of the Grand Coliseum (every bet pays them percentages), and a network of informants that makes secrets expensive.

**Don Emilio Valdrossi**, the current patrón, is a heavyset man in his sixties who presents himself as a jovial grandfather while running the most ruthless organization in the Free Isles. He rarely raises his voice. He doesn't need to. When Don Emilio is disappointed, people disappear into the canals. When he's pleased, fortunes are made.

The Valdrossi maintain relationships with every major trading power in the region—Gorath, Bonnetaz, Tarkhon, even cautious exchanges with Kyagos through intermediaries. They're pragmatic about profit and utterly ruthless about threats. The other families resent their dominance but fear a direct challenge.

### Economy

Everything passes through Kokotintin. Silks from Ve, metals from the Shacklands, spices from the Greenwater Isles, manufactured goods from Tarkhon, mercenaries from anywhere with hungry swords. The city takes a cut of every transaction through tariffs, docking fees, warehouse rentals, and protection payments.

The legitimate economy is vast, but the gray economy is larger. Smuggling, black-market goods, stolen cargo, and "redirected" shipments all flow through channels the Valdrossi pretend not to control. Fencing operations move goods that fell off ships. Money lenders offer rates that look reasonable until you miss a payment. Brothels, gambling houses, and drug dens operate openly, paying their licenses to the family.

Kokotintin's guilds—the Merchant Consortium, the Longshoremen's Brotherhood, the Gondoliers' Union—are all family fronts. Union dues go to the Valdrossi. Guild contracts favor Valdrossi partners. Cross the guild, cross the family.

### Districts

**The Spires**: The wealthy hilltop district where the great families maintain their palazzos. Quiet streets, private docks, and guards who ask questions with crossbows.

**Merchant's Rest**: The commercial heart of the city—warehouses, trading houses, counting houses, and the Consortium Hall where deals are struck and broken.

**The Canals**: Everything below the waterline. Markets, taverns, fighting pits, pleasure houses, and the cramped homes of the working poor. This is where refugees end up, where debts are worked off, and where people vanish.

**The Coliseum Quarter**: Built around the Grand Coliseum—gladiator schools, betting houses, weapon smiths, and the celebratory rowdiness that surrounds the games.

**The Floats**: A floating district of houseboats, barges, and improvised platforms connected by rope bridges. Home to the poorest, the newest arrivals, and those hiding from someone.

### What Travelers Should Know

- Every gondolier is a potential informant. Watch what you say on the water.
- The games run daily. Missing the evening bout is considered odd.
- Debts are enforceable. Don't borrow what you can't repay.
- Refugees are "welcome" but expected to work. Ask about terms *before* accepting help.
- Don Emilio is always listening. Even when he's not.
