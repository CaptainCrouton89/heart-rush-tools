## Mpehi

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The city of gold and chains, where a dragon sleeps beneath the streets and the ruling family's touch turns flesh to metal. Mpehi is the second wealthiest of the Free Isles city-states, and the most feared. The Gattorini family has held power here for longer than anyone can count, bound to their patron Bathemiel by a bargain whose terms have been forgotten—but whose price is still being paid.

### The City

Mpehi sprawls across a cluster of connected islets linked by bridges of gold-veined stone. The architecture is heavy, fortress-like, built from dark volcanic rock quarried from the island's interior—but every surface gleams with gilded ornamentation. Gold leaf covers domes, lines doorframes, traces patterns on street cobblestones. The effect is gaudy, overwhelming, deliberately intimidating. This is a city that wants you to know it could buy you.

The streets are narrow and winding, designed centuries ago to confuse invaders. Old fortifications have been converted into pleasure houses and gambling dens, arrow slits now windows for watching the crowds below. The harbor is smaller than Kokotintin's but fiercely defended—chain booms can seal it in minutes, and the watchtowers are always manned.

Beneath the city, in caverns that predate human settlement, Bathemiel sleeps. The dragon's presence can be felt in subtle ways: warmth rising through the stones, a faint vibration during deep night, the occasional tremor that sends gold-plated fixtures rattling. The Gattorini palazzo sits directly above the primary cavern. They call it the Golden Seat.

### Bathemiel

The dragon came to these islands in the Second Eon, when the world was younger and the Free Isles were uninhabited rock. No one knows why Bathemiel chose to stay, or what wounded it so badly that it needed to sleep. When humans arrived, they found the dragon already chained—great bonds of dull gray metal that resist all attempts at identification, anchored to the cavern walls by mechanisms no one has been able to understand.

The first Gattorini patrón made a deal. The exact terms are lost, recorded only in a sealed vault that subsequent patróns have been unable (or unwilling) to open. What remains is the gift: the ruling patrón of Mpehi can transform any non-living matter they touch into pure gold. The effect is permanent and irreversible.

The gift has made the Gattorini unimaginably wealthy—but it has costs. Every patrón eventually goes mad, convinced that gold is spreading through their own flesh. Several have died clawing at their skin, certain they were transforming. Others have become paranoid about touch, refusing to remove their gloves even in private. The current patrón, **Donna Serephina Gattorini**, wears golden gauntlets at all times and has not touched another living being in fifteen years.

Bathemiel occasionally speaks through dreams. The messages are cryptic, unsettling, and never helpful. The dragon seems to be waiting for something. The Gattorini have learned not to ask what.

### The Gattorini Family

The Gattorini are the oldest of the Five Families, and the strangest. Their obsession with gold extends beyond wealth—they believe it purifies, protects, sanctifies. Family members are ritually gilded at important life moments: gold leaf pressed to the forehead at birth, golden jewelry bonded to the flesh at coming-of-age, golden death masks sealed over faces before burial. The family crypt is said to contain centuries of golden corpses.

**Donna Serephina** rules with cold efficiency, maintaining Mpehi's position through calculated marriages, strategic violence, and the ever-present threat of her touch. Cross her, and your most prized possession becomes worthless gold—your ship's wheel, your heirloom blade, your wife's portrait. She rarely needs to demonstrate twice.

The family maintains a corps of golden-masked enforcers called the *Mani d'Oro*—the Golden Hands. They're recognizable by their gilded masks, golden gauntlets, and absolute silence. They don't make threats. They make examples.

### The Arena

Mpehi's coliseum—the *Fossa d'Oro*, the Golden Pit—is smaller than Kokotintin's but more brutal. The fights here tend toward lethality; survival rates are lower, and the crowds prefer decisive endings. The arena floor is sprinkled with gold dust before each match, turning the sand glittering and slick.

Gladiators who please the Donna receive gilded weapons and armor—worthless for combat but invaluable as status symbols. Champions are sometimes offered a choice: a fortune in gold, or one touch from the Donna's bare hand on an object of their choosing. Most take the fortune. The smart ones take the touch.

### Economy

Mpehi's economy runs on gold and fear. The Gattorini don't need to trade—they can create wealth from nothing—but they choose to, maintaining the pretense of legitimate commerce. Their real power comes from lending: Gattorini gold funds half the merchant ventures in the Free Isles, and the interest rates are murderous. Default, and the Mani d'Oro come calling.

The city also specializes in luxury goods: goldsmiths, jewelers, artisans who work with precious metals. Rich merchants from across Alaria commission work here, paying premium prices for the prestige of Mpehi craftsmanship. Much of this gold is transformed by the Donna personally, guaranteeing authenticity.

### The Dragon's Price

Bathemiel's bargain is coming due. Donna Serephina has begun dreaming of golden hands—her own hands—reaching up from the earth and pulling her down into the caverns. The dreams are getting more frequent. The dragon's messages, once cryptic, have become demands: *bring me the blood of a willing sacrifice. Bring me a soul that chooses the chain.*

The Donna hasn't told her family. She's been quietly researching alternatives—ancient texts, planar scholars, anyone who might know how to break a dragon's bargain. So far, nothing. The Gattorini have been paying Bathemiel's price for centuries. Soon, someone will have to pay the principal.
