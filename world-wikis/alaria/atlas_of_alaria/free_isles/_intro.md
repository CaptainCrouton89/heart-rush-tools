# Free Isles

## Geography

The Free Isles region encompasses both the famous trading city-states and the mysterious island of Xabraedia. Positioned between Upoceax to the southwest and Aboyinzu to the east (via Devil's Spine), this region serves as a critical crossroads for maritime trade across Alaria.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bay of Merchants
- **East**: Devil's Spine passage leads to Chaal Nazzerox (Aboyinzu)
- **South**: Strait of Curses, Unsettling Bay
- **West**: Scaley Sea, Belter Bay; Upoceax beyond

### The Free Isles Proper

The western cluster of city-states is what most people mean when they speak of "the Free Isles." These islands are populated by diverse peoples—Chargon, Nyolci, Eloweir, Swuigrach, Craven, Ayblek, Shapers, and Qord'ik. The cities are massive trading ports that have attracted merchants from all over the world.

The cities are extremely colorful, beautiful places, but deadly if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Huge coliseums have been built for gladiatorial fights. Best of all the gladiators is Red, the Screaming Blade.

### Xabraedia

The large island east of the city-states, separated by The Spout (a common but not primary shipping lane). Xabraedia is not typically what people think of as "the Free Isles," but it falls within this region geographically.

Notable features:
- **Veluminatic Forest**: The purple-tinged forest covering much of the island
- **Starfall**: A giant pool of energy from a different plane—a major point of supernatural interest
- **Morgwood**: Forest region in the northern part of the island

### Surrounding Waters

- **Bay of Merchants**: Northern waters, major trade route
- **The Spout**: Channel between the Free Isles and Xabraedia
- **Scaley Sea**: Southwestern waters
- **Belter Bay**: Southwest
- **Unsettling Bay**: Southern waters
- **Strait of Curses**: South of Xabraedia
- **Devil's Spine**: Eastern passage to Aboyinzu

## Political Climate

The Free Isles operate without kings, councils, or any pretense of democracy. Each city-state is ruled by whichever family currently holds enough muscle, money, and blood-debt to keep the others in line. They call their leaders *patróns*—a title earned, not inherited, though dynasties form when a family stays vicious enough across generations.

### The Five Families

The major cities aren't governed—they're *owned*. Five great families have consolidated power across the archipelago, each controlling one city-state as their seat of power while maintaining operations throughout the region:

- **The Valdrossi** of Kokotintin: The wealthiest and most powerful, their fingers in every port and every pocket
- **The Gattorini** of Mpehi: Golden and cursed, blessed by their chained dragon
- **The Torvachi** of Yibiye: Old magic, old grudges, guardians of the gates
- **The Marrovini** of Awobiso: Shipwrights and smugglers, masters of the western approach
- **The Velathi** of Hik: Teflin outcasts who found power in the purple light of Starfall

The families maintain a fragile peace through the *Patto di Sangue*—the Blood Pact—an agreement that disputes between families are settled in the arena, not the streets. This hasn't prevented assassinations, poisonings, and "accidents," but it keeps the ports open and the trade flowing.

### The Arenas

Blood sport isn't entertainment in the Free Isles—it's law. Every city maintains at least one coliseum where grievances are settled, debts are paid, and the crowds are kept fed on spectacle. Gladiators are celebrities, slaves, criminals, and volunteers. The greatest of them become legends.

The current champion of the Free Isles is **Red, the Screaming Blade**—a massive Chargon woman who fights with twin curved swords and has never lost a bout. She's sponsored by the Valdrossi family but answers to no one. Killing her in the arena would be legal. Killing her outside it would start a war.

### Freedom's Price

"Free" is a complicated word here. The Isles are officially abolitionist—escaped slaves from Kyagos and the Shacklands find refuge, and slave ships are seized in Free Isles waters. But freedom isn't free. Refugees often find themselves indentured to the families, working off "protection fees" and "passage debts" that mysteriously never shrink. Some end up in the arenas.

The families see no contradiction. You're free from chains. What you do with that freedom—including selling it back for security—is your business.

## What Makes It Interesting

**The wealth is obscene.** These are the richest cities in Upoceax, possibly in all of southern Alaria. Kokotintin's harbor sees more gold pass through in a month than some nations see in a decade. The architecture drips with opulence—gilded spires, marble colonnades, pleasure barges floating between canal-side palazzos. Merchants from every corner of Alaria jostle for position, and fortunes are made and lost before breakfast.

**The violence is normalized.** Gladiatorial combat isn't a curiosity—it's woven into daily life. Debts are settled in blood. Trials are conducted by combat. Entertainment is watching people die artfully. Children grow up betting on their favorite fighters. The families use the arenas to dispose of enemies legally, and the crowds love them for it.

**Everyone's playing an angle.** The mob families, the merchants, the gladiators, the escaped slaves, the foreign traders—everyone has something they want and something they're hiding. Trust is currency, and most people are broke. A street vendor might be a family informant. A gladiator might be an assassin waiting for orders. A refugee might be a spy from Kyagos.

**The dragon.** Bathemiel is chained beneath Mpehi, granting the Gattorini patrón the midas touch. This single advantage has kept the Gattorini in power for generations—but the dragon wants something, and whatever deal was struck is older than anyone alive remembers.

**The purple island.** Xabraedia looms to the east, touched by Starfall's alien energy. The Velathi of Hik have adapted to live near it, but the other families eye the island with a mixture of greed and fear. Whatever power Starfall offers, it's power they don't control.

## What Will Go Wrong

**Family war.** The Blood Pact is fraying. The Valdrossi have grown too powerful, and the other families are beginning to whisper about alliances. A single assassination could shatter the peace and turn the Isles into a bloodbath.

**Slave revolt.** The "freed" slaves who work off their debts are getting organized. Someone's been arming them, training them, and promising them real freedom. When they rise, the families will face an enemy that knows every back alley, every weakness, every dirty secret.

**The dragon's price.** Bathemiel's bargain is coming due. The Gattorini patrón has been having dreams—golden hands reaching from the earth, pulling him down. The dragon is patient, but it remembers everything.

**Starfall spreads.** The purple tinge of the Veluminante Forest has been creeping outward for decades. The Velathi say it's nothing. The other families have noticed that Velathi traders bleed a color that isn't quite red.

**Outside interest.** The wealth of the Free Isles has attracted attention from powers that don't play by local rules. Tarkhon traders have been making generous offers. Gorath sky-captains have been surveying the harbors. And someone's been asking questions about the Spire of Ascension—the one POI that leads outside the planar stack entirely.

## City-States

The Five Families control one city-state each:

- **Kokotintin** - Seat of the Valdrossi, wealthiest city in the Free Isles
- **Mpehi** - Seat of the Gattorini, the golden city built above a chained dragon
- **Yibiye** - Seat of the Torvachi, guarded by the awakening Gates
- **Awobiso** - Seat of the Marrovini, gatekeepers of the western approach
- **Hik** - Seat of the Velathi, teflin city on Xabraedia

## Notable Locations

- **Massacre Hills** - Haunted promontory near Yibiye, site of an ancient slaughter
- **Hills of the Damned** - Cursed territory near Awobiso, result of a failed spirit binding
