# Free Isles

## Geography

The Free Isles region encompasses both the famous trading city-states and the mysterious island of Xabraedia. Positioned between Upoceax to the southwest and Aboyinzu to the east (via Devil's Spine), this region serves as a critical crossroads for maritime trade across Alaria.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bay of Merchants
- **East**: Devil's Spine passage leads to Chaal Nazzerox (Aboyinzu)
- **South**: Strait of Curses, Unsettling Bay
- **West**: Scaley Sea, Belter Bay; Upoceax beyond

### The Free Isles Proper

The western cluster of city-states is what most people mean when they speak of "the Free Isles." These islands are populated by diverse peoples—Chargon, Nyolci, Eloweir, Swuigrach, Craven, Ayblek, Shapers, and Qord'ik. The cities are massive trading ports that have attracted merchants from all over the world.

The cities are extremely colorful, beautiful places, but deadly if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Huge coliseums have been built for gladiatorial fights. Best of all the gladiators is Red, the Screaming Blade.

### Xabraedia

The large island east of the city-states, separated by The Spout (a common but not primary shipping lane). Xabraedia is not typically what people think of as "the Free Isles," but it falls within this region geographically.

Notable features:
- **Veluminatic Forest**: The purple-tinged forest covering much of the island
- **Starfall**: A giant pool of energy from a different plane—a major point of supernatural interest
- **Morgwood**: Forest region in the northern part of the island

### Surrounding Waters

- **Bay of Merchants**: Northern waters, major trade route
- **The Spout**: Channel between the Free Isles and Xabraedia
- **Scaley Sea**: Southwestern waters
- **Belter Bay**: Southwest
- **Unsettling Bay**: Southern waters
- **Strait of Curses**: South of Xabraedia
- **Devil's Spine**: Eastern passage to Aboyinzu
