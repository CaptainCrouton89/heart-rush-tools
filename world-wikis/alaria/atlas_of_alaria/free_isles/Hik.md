## Hik

Tags: citystate, free-isles, teflin

The city at the edge of the impossible, where exiles built a kingdom in the shadow of alien light. Hik sits on the western shore of Xabraedia, separated from the main Free Isles by The Spout and from normal reality by proximity to Starfall. The Velathi family—teflin outcasts who found refuge here generations ago—have adapted to the purple influence in ways that unsettle the other families. Their blood runs colors that aren't quite right, and their eyes see things they shouldn't.

### The City

Hik occupies a crescent harbor on Xabraedia's western coast, positioned to trade with the main Free Isles while keeping Starfall at their backs. The city is smaller than the other Free Isles capitals but denser, buildings pressed close together in a maze of narrow streets and covered passages. The architecture shows teflin influences—geometric patterns, angular rooflines, windows placed for light at odd hours.

The most striking feature is the illumination. At night, Hik glows faintly purple, the residual light of Starfall filtering through the Veluminante Forest and reflecting off polished surfaces throughout the city. Locals have adapted; visitors find it unsettling. The light is stronger closer to the forest edge, and the oldest parts of the city—nearest the interior—are visibly affected. Plants grow in wrong shapes. Shadows move without sources. Some walls seem to breathe.

The harbor is well-defended but welcoming to trade. Ships from across the Free Isles dock here regularly, though sailors rarely venture beyond the harbor district. The Velathi encourage this boundary—the inner city, they say, takes time to understand.

### The Velathi Family

The Velathi are teflin—the horned peoples whose daemon ancestry makes them outcasts in most of Alaria. Centuries ago, a teflin community fleeing persecution found Xabraedia and its strange purple pool. Rather than avoid Starfall, they embraced proximity to it. The energy changed them, slowly, over generations. Now the Velathi are something more than teflin, or something less—depending on who you ask.

**Donna Seraveth Velathi**, the current patrón, has skin that shimmers with undertones of purple and eyes that occasionally reflect things that aren't there. She speaks rarely, communicates through trusted intermediaries, and has been known to answer questions before they're asked. The other families find her deeply unnerving. This is intentional.

The Velathi operate differently from the other families. Hierarchy is less rigid, decisions more collective, enforcement more... subtle. People who cross the Velathi don't die publicly. They change their minds, forget their plans, wake up somewhere they didn't mean to be. The family's connection to Starfall has given them access to abilities the other families can't counter or understand.

### Starfall's Influence

The Velathi's power comes from their relationship with Starfall—the pool of extraplanar energy left by the disintegrated sky worm from Glyssen. They don't worship it, exactly, but they've learned to live with it in ways no one else has managed.

Those born in Hik, especially those with Velathi blood, develop minor adaptations: enhanced night vision, sensitivity to psychic impressions, the occasional precognitive flash. The deeper you go into the city, the stronger these effects become. The Velathi leadership, who spend time in the Veluminante Forest itself, develop abilities that approach the supernatural. Some can taste lies. Some can see through walls. Some can make people forget they were ever there.

The cost is visible. Velathi blood isn't quite red—it has a purple-brown tint that disturbs doctors from other cities. Their shadows sometimes move independently. Their oldest members sometimes speak in languages no one recognizes. The other families have noticed. They're not sure what to do about it.

### The Arena

Hik doesn't have a traditional coliseum. Instead, it has the *Labirinto delle Ombre*, the Labyrinth of Shadows—a sprawling maze-arena built into the edge of the Veluminante Forest, where the purple light is strongest and reality is most flexible.

Fights in the Labyrinth are strange. The maze reconfigures between bouts. Shadows interfere unpredictably. Some combatants report fighting opponents who weren't there, or seeing things in the corners that watched without participating. Deaths are rare—the Labyrinth doesn't seem to want them—but the experience changes people. Champions from other cities who compete in Hik often refuse to return.

The crowds watch from elevated platforms around the maze's perimeter, betting not just on who will win but on what will happen. "Three shadow interventions in the first round" pays twelve to one. "Victor emerges speaking backwards" pays forty to one. It happened once.

### Economy

Hik's economy runs on exotic goods, strange services, and carefully managed fear. The city trades in substances and materials found nowhere else—luminescent fungi from the Veluminante, minerals affected by Starfall's energy, preserved specimens of creatures that shouldn't exist. Alchemists, occultists, and desperate scholars pay premium prices.

The Velathi also offer services the other families can't: information extraction through psychic means, memory modification, the removal of inconvenient recollections. These services are expensive, discreet, and absolutely never discussed publicly. Clients arrive by appointment, leave by arrangement, and rarely remember the details clearly.

Trade with the main Free Isles is steady but wary. Ships dock, load cargo, and leave quickly. The Velathi don't take offense. They prefer visitors who know their limits.

### Morglwood

North of Hik, the Morglwood provides a buffer between the city and the northern coast. Unlike the purple-tinged Veluminante to the south, Morglwood is a relatively normal forest—dense, dark, but unmutated. The Velathi harvest timber here, hunt game, and maintain it as proof that not everything about Xabraedia is strange.

Local legend claims Morglwood was planted deliberately to contain Starfall's spread, roots woven with protective bindings to keep the purple light from reaching the northern shore. The Velathi neither confirm nor deny this. The forest does seem to end very abruptly at its southern edge.

### The Veluminante

South of Hik, stretching toward Starfall, the Veluminante Forest glows with alien light. Trees twist in impossible spirals, bioluminescent fungi carpet the forest floor, and the wildlife has adapted in unsettling ways. The Velathi enter the forest regularly; outsiders are strongly discouraged.

Those who enter without Velathi guidance often don't return. Those who do return aren't always unchanged. The forest seems to respond to intention—hostile visitors encounter hostile phenomena, while those the Velathi vouch for find the path clearer. Some theorize the forest is semi-sentient, a colony organism affected by Starfall's energy. The Velathi say it's just the forest. They smile when they say it.

### What Travelers Should Know

- Stay in the harbor district unless you have Velathi permission to go further.
- The purple light is not harmful in small doses. Probably.
- Don't stare at Velathi shadows. They notice.
- Trading for Starfall-affected goods is legal but complicated. Bring documentation.
- The Labyrinth of Shadows is not for tourists. Spectating is fine. Participating is ill-advised.
- If a Velathi gives you advice, follow it. They rarely warn people twice.
