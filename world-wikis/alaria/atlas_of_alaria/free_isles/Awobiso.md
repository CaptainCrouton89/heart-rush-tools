## Awobiso

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The gatekeepers of the Free Isles, where paranoia is policy and strangers are screened before they're welcomed. Awobiso sits at the western edge of the archipelago, the first port of call for ships arriving from Upoceax and the Scaley Sea. The Marrovini family has controlled this city for generations, building their power on shipyards, smuggling networks, and the simple fact that everyone passes through their waters first.

### The City

Awobiso clings to a rocky island at the western approach, its harbor carved from the cliffs rather than naturally formed. The city rises in steep terraces from the waterline, every level defensible, every street designed with chokepoints in mind. From the sea, Awobiso looks like a fortress pretending to be a city. From inside, it feels like a city preparing for siege.

The architecture is functional, almost military—heavy stone, reinforced doors, narrow alleys that favor defenders. There's wealth here, but it's hidden behind practical façades. A merchant's palazzo might have gilded furniture inside, but the exterior looks like a barracks. The Marrovini don't believe in advertising what they have.

The harbor is smaller than the other cities', but its shipyards are the finest in the Free Isles. Awobiso builds the fastest smuggling craft, the most maneuverable patrol boats, and the most heavily armed merchant vessels in the region. If you want a ship that can outrun trouble, you commission it here.

### The Approach

Ships entering the Free Isles from the west pass through Awobiso's waters first—and the Marrovini make sure they know it. A chain of guard towers stretches along the western approaches, manned day and night, signaling to the city with mirror flashes and flag codes. Unknown vessels are hailed, inspected, and either cleared or turned away. Resistance is met with fire ships.

This chokepoint gives the Marrovini leverage over the other families. Tariffs collected at the western approach are technically shared, but the Marrovini take their cut first. More importantly, they see everything that comes in—and sometimes, things that were supposed to arrive simply don't. The other families resent this control but haven't found a way to break it without starting a war.

### The Marrovini Family

The Marrovini are shipwrights, smugglers, and paranoid geniuses. They trust no one outside the bloodline and barely trust each other. Family decisions are made in closed councils where every member is checked for weapons, poisons, and enchantments before entering. Secrets shared with a Marrovini stay with that Marrovini—they don't even tell each other everything.

**Don Jacopo Marrovini**, the current patrón, is a weathered man who spent thirty years at sea before taking the family seat. He still thinks like a captain—quick decisions, harsh discipline, no tolerance for failure. His paranoia is legendary; he changes sleeping chambers nightly, employs three food tasters, and hasn't left the city in twelve years.

The Marrovini maintain the Free Isles' most extensive smuggling network. Goods that can't pass through legitimate channels—weapons for rebels, substances for addicts, people who need to disappear—move through Marrovini hands. The other families know about it. They use it too often to object.

### The Hills of the Damned

Southwest of Awobiso, visible from the highest terraces, the Hills of the Damned rise from the sea—a barren promontory where nothing grows and the soil itself seems wrong. The hills earned their name centuries ago, when a Marrovini patrón attempted to bind a powerful spirit to serve as a guardian, similar to Yibiye's Gates. The binding failed catastrophically.

Now the hills are haunted—genuinely, undeniably haunted. Spirits move through the rocks, wailing sounds carry across the water on still nights, and anyone who stays too long begins to hear voices offering terrible bargains. The Marrovini maintain a cordon of guard posts around the hills, not to protect them, but to keep what's inside from getting out.

The Tower of Yprazi stands at the center of the hills, a crooked spire of blackened stone that predates the failed binding and may have been its cause. No one knows what Yprazi was—a mage, a daemon, a title, a curse. The tower remains sealed, its single door unopened in living memory. The Marrovini don't discuss it.

### The Arena

Awobiso's coliseum—the *Pozzo della Vendetta*, the Pit of Vengeance—is the smallest and grimmest of the Free Isles arenas. Fights here are personal: debts settled, grudges concluded, sentences carried out. There's no spectacle, no theater, just two people entering and one person leaving.

The Marrovini don't care about entertainment. They care about finality. The Pit serves as the family's court of last resort—disputes that can't be resolved by mediation, money, or threats end here. The fights are to the death by default. Mercy is considered weakness.

### Economy

Awobiso's economy runs on shipbuilding, smuggling, and tariffs. The shipyards employ a significant portion of the population—skilled craftsmen who can build a hull that outpaces pursuit or reinforce a merchant vessel against pirates. Commissions come from across the Free Isles and beyond.

The smuggling operations are never discussed publicly but employ even more people. Awobiso has the expertise, the vessels, and the strategic position to move anything anywhere. The Marrovini take a percentage of everything that passes through their networks—and their networks are extensive.

Legitimate tariffs from the western approach provide steady income, but the real profit comes from what the Marrovini choose not to report to the other families. A ship carrying valuable cargo might be "inspected" and found to be carrying somewhat less than its manifest claimed. The difference ends up in Marrovini warehouses.

### What Travelers Should Know

- Every ship entering the Free Isles stops here first. Cooperation makes the process faster.
- The Marrovini see everything. Attempting to hide cargo is possible but expensive.
- Do not ask about the Hills of the Damned. Do not approach the Hills of the Damned. Do not acknowledge the Hills of the Damned exist if you can help it.
- Commissioning a ship takes time. The craftsmen don't rush, and the Marrovini don't pressure them.
- The Pit of Vengeance is not entertainment. Tourists who treat it as such sometimes end up participating.
