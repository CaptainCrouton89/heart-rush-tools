## Veluminante Forest

Tags: forest, geography, free-isles, xabraedia

The purple-tinged forest that covers much of Xabraedia's interior, spreading outward from Starfall like a slow infection. The Veluminante glows faintly at night, its bioluminescent life forms creating an eerie luminescence that can be seen from ships passing through The Spout. The Velathi of Hik enter the forest regularly; outsiders are strongly advised not to.

### Nature

The Veluminante is not a normal forest. The trees grow in spiraling patterns, their bark shot through with veins of faintly luminescent material. Fungi carpet the forest floor in colors that don't exist elsewhere—purples that shade toward ultraviolet, blues that seem to recede rather than reflect. The air tastes different inside the treeline: metallic, slightly sweet, with an aftertaste that lingers for hours.

Wildlife has adapted in unsettling ways. Deer-analogues move silently, their eyes reflecting the purple light. Birds sing in frequencies that affect the listener's equilibrium. Insects pulse with internal light, creating constellations among the undergrowth. Nothing here is dangerous in the conventional sense—predators exist, but they're no more aggressive than elsewhere. The danger is subtler.

Extended exposure to the Veluminante changes visitors. Small changes at first: vivid dreams, sensitivity to light, a tendency to lose track of time. Longer exposure produces stranger effects—perceiving things that haven't happened yet, hearing thoughts that aren't your own, bleeding in colors that aren't quite right. The Velathi have lived with these changes for generations. Outsiders rarely adapt as gracefully.

### The Starfall Connection

The forest's strange properties flow from Starfall—the pool of extraplanar energy at Xabraedia's center. The remnant of a sky worm from the distant planar stack of Glyssen, Starfall radiates energy that the Veluminante has absorbed and distributed throughout its ecosystem. The forest is, in a sense, a processing system for Starfall's influence—channeling the alien energy into forms that are merely strange rather than immediately lethal.

The closer one travels to Starfall, the more intense the effects become. Trees near the pool's edge have crystallized into glass-like structures. The ground pulses with visible veins of purple light. The air itself becomes thick with psychic static, making thought difficult for unprepared minds. The Velathi have mapped safe routes through the forest, but these routes change, and the forest doesn't share its logic with outsiders.

### Spread

The Veluminante has been growing for centuries, slowly expanding its borders as Starfall's influence seeps outward. The purple tinge that marks affected vegetation creeps a few hundred feet further each decade. The Morglewood to the north appears to serve as a barrier—whether natural or constructed—but the western shore has no such protection. Old maps show the treeline significantly closer to Starfall than current observations indicate.

The other Free Isles families have noticed. They've begun quiet discussions about what happens when the Veluminante reaches Hik's walls, or spreads to the harbor, or begins affecting the waters of The Spout. The Velathi insist the spread is slowing, that equilibrium is approaching. The Velathi also have purple-tinged blood and shadows that move independently. Their reassurances are not entirely comforting.

### What Lives Here

The Velathi harvest materials from the Veluminante that exist nowhere else: luminescent fungi for alchemical purposes, crystallized sap with unusual magical properties, specimens of adapted wildlife for study. They trade these goods through Hik's harbor, commanding premium prices from desperate scholars and adventurous merchants.

Something else lives in the deeper forest, near Starfall itself. The Velathi don't discuss it. They simply don't travel to certain areas, and they become very quiet when outsiders ask why. The few expeditions that have ignored these boundaries and returned at all brought back fragmented accounts of structures that weren't built by human hands, patterns in the light that suggested intelligence, and a profound sense of being watched by something that existed partially outside normal perception.
