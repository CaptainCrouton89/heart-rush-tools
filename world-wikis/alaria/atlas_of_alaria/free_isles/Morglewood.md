## Morglewood

Tags: forest, geography, free-isles, xabraedia

The northern forest of Xabraedia, standing as a buffer between the city of Hik and the island's northern coast. Unlike the purple-tinged Veluminante to the south, Morglewood is a relatively normal forest—dense, dark, and unmutated. Its existence is a mystery and possibly a miracle.

### Nature

Morglewood is a temperate forest of ordinary composition: oak-analogues, evergreens, ferns, and underbrush that would seem unremarkable anywhere else in Alaria. The trees grow tall and close, creating a permanent twilight beneath the canopy. Wildlife behaves normally. Plants follow expected patterns. The soil is ordinary soil.

This normalcy is deeply strange given Morglewood's proximity to Starfall and the Veluminante. The purple forest ends at a sharp boundary running east-west across Xabraedia's interior, and Morglewood begins immediately north of that line. There's no gradual transition, no partially affected zone—just the Veluminante's spiraling, glowing trees, then a clear demarcation, then ordinary forest.

The Velathi maintain that Morglwood is proof not everything about Xabraedia is changed. Outsiders suspect the forest's normality is deliberate—that something was done, long ago, to keep Starfall's influence from spreading north.

### The Barrier Theory

According to local legend, Morglewood was planted deliberately by the first Velathi settlers—or by someone even older—to contain Starfall's spread. The roots were woven with protective bindings, the soil treated with neutralizing agents, the trees selected specifically for their resistance to extraplanar contamination. The forest itself serves as a living wall against the purple tide.

Evidence for this theory includes:
- The unnaturally sharp boundary between Morglewood and the Veluminante
- Unusual patterns in the oldest trees' growth rings, suggesting synchronized planting
- Buried structures at the forest's southern edge that might be foundation stones for old wards
- The forest's stubborn resistance to the Veluminante's expansion despite centuries of proximity

The Velathi neither confirm nor deny the barrier theory. They simply ensure Morglewood is maintained—harvesting selectively, replanting where trees fall, and quietly removing anything that shows signs of purple influence.

### Resources

Hik depends on Morglewood for ordinary timber, game, and foraged goods—the practical materials that the Veluminante cannot provide. The forest supports hunting lodges, lumber camps, and harvesting operations run by Velathi family members or trusted associates. Outsiders can obtain permits to enter Morglewood, unlike the Veluminante, though they're expected to report any unusual observations.

The contrast between the two forests makes Morglewood valuable in ways beyond resources. Visitors to Hik sometimes arrange forest walks specifically to remind themselves that normal exists. Scholars studying Starfall's influence use Morglewood as a control sample. And the Velathi themselves retreat to the northern forest when the purple light becomes too intense, using it as a place to remember what unaffected reality feels like.

### The Northern Coast

Beyond Morglewood, Xabraedia's northern coast faces the Bay of Merchants—ordinary water, ordinary shores, theoretically accessible to anyone. In practice, the Velathi control access through Hik's harbor and discourage independent landings. They claim it's for visitors' protection; the forest can be confusing, and the route to Hik requires guidance. The real reason is less clear.

The northern coast shows no signs of Starfall's influence. This might mean the barrier worked. It might also mean the influence is spreading in a different direction. The Velathi watch the coast carefully and don't explain why.
