### Gates of Yibiye

The Yibeyen Gates consist of two colossal, moss-covered statues standing at the entrance to Yibiye's port. These ancient guardians are said to protect the city, and the stories are true—when Yibiye faces a credible threat, the statues come alive, defending the port with devastating power. Their mere presence serves as a warning to would-be attackers: Yibiye is not defenseless.
