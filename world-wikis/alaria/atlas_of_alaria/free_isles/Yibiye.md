## Yibiye

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The warded city, where ancient magic guards the harbor and old grudges run deeper than the sea. Yibiye is the northernmost of the Free Isles city-states, positioned near the Massacre Hills—a name that tells its own story. The Torvachi family has held this city for centuries, and they remember every slight, every betrayal, every drop of blood that bought their walls.

### The City

Yibiye occupies a defensible island at the northern edge of the Free Isles cluster, its harbor mouth narrow enough to chain and its hills steep enough to fortify. The city is older than the others, built on foundations that predate the current inhabitants—cyclopean stone blocks, channels of uncertain purpose, carvings in no known language. The Torvachi built on top of what they found and try not to dig too deep.

The architecture is practical rather than ostentatious. Stone walls, iron fittings, narrow windows that double as arrow slits. Where Kokotintin gleams and Mpehi glitters, Yibiye broods. The wealthiest districts are still fortress-like, their palazzos designed for siege. Gardens grow on rooftops, fed by ancient aqueducts. Underground cisterns store enough water for years.

The city's position near the Massacre Hills and the Bay of Merchants makes it strategically vital—and historically bloody. Yibiye has been attacked more often than any other Free Isles city. It has never fallen. The Gates are one reason. The Torvachi's long memory is another.

### The Gates of Yibiye

Two colossal statues stand at the entrance to Yibiye's harbor, moss-covered stone figures rising eighty feet above the waterline. They appear ancient, weather-worn, vaguely humanoid but proportioned wrong—too long in the arms, too broad in the shoulders, faces worn smooth by centuries of salt spray. Local legend claims they were here before humans arrived, already standing sentinel over the harbor mouth.

The legends are true. When Yibiye faces a credible threat, the Gates awaken. The stone cracks, the moss falls away, and the statues move with terrible purpose, defending the harbor with fists that can shatter hulls and voices that can shatter minds. The awakening has happened eleven times in recorded history. No attacking fleet has survived.

The Torvachi maintain the Gates through rituals passed down through generations. The exact nature of the binding is a family secret, but it requires sacrifice—willing blood, given freely, once per generation. Young Torvachi compete for the honor. Not all survive the selection.

### The Torvachi Family

The Torvachi are the oldest bloodline in the Free Isles, and they never let anyone forget it. Their family records go back further than any other, meticulously documenting alliances, betrayals, debts, and offenses. Cross a Torvachi, and your grandchildren will still be paying for it.

**Don Aurelio Torvachi**, the current patrón, is a thin, precise man who speaks softly and forgets nothing. He maintains files on every significant person in the Free Isles—their secrets, their weaknesses, their families. He rarely uses this information directly. He prefers to wait, letting debts accumulate interest until the moment of maximum leverage.

The Torvachi are the family others come to for mediation. Their reputation for fairness is real—they don't take sides, they take notes. When the Blood Pact needs enforcement, the Torvachi provide witnesses. When deals need guaranteeing, Torvachi seals are accepted throughout the Isles. This neutrality makes them invaluable, but it also makes them targets. The other families resent their access to everyone's secrets.

### The Arena

Yibiye's coliseum—the *Teatro del Sangue*, the Theater of Blood—is smaller than Kokotintin's and less fatal than Mpehi's, but it has its own character: theatrical, dramatic, focused on spectacle over slaughter. Fights here are choreographed as much as contested, with elaborate costumes, musical accompaniment, and crowd-participation elements. Deaths are rare but meaningful.

The Torvachi see the arena as a tool for social management. Grudges that might otherwise fester find outlet in sponsored bouts. Disputes that might turn violent are channeled into formal duels. The family takes a cut of every bet, every concession, every sponsorship—but the real value is in the control. People focused on the games aren't focused on rebellion.

### The Massacre Hills

Northeast of Yibiye, the Massacre Hills rise from the sea—a rocky promontory that has earned its name repeatedly. Three centuries ago, an invasion fleet from Kyagos landed there, intending to take Yibiye and establish a foothold in the Free Isles. The Torvachi met them with the Gates awakened and a month's preparation. Fifteen thousand soldiers died in the hills. Their bones are still there, visible when the rain washes the soil.

The Massacre Hills are considered cursed by some, sacred by others. The Torvachi maintain a modest monument at the landing site—not triumphant, but quiet, acknowledging the dead without celebrating them. Some claim the hills are haunted, that the screams of dying soldiers can still be heard on stormy nights. The Torvachi don't confirm or deny.

### Economy

Yibiye's economy is built on information, mediation, and the long game. The city hosts the Free Isles' only formal banking consortium—the *Banca delle Memorie*, the Bank of Memories—which holds debts, guarantees contracts, and maintains records that no individual family could be trusted with. The Torvachi own the bank. The other families pretend they don't.

The city also profits from its strategic position near the Bay of Merchants. Ships passing through often stop at Yibiye for provisions, repairs, and the kind of neutral ground where deals can be struck without family interference. The harbor fees are reasonable. The information gathered from visitors is priceless.

### What Travelers Should Know

- The Gates are always watching. Approach the harbor with proper signals or don't approach at all.
- Never insult a Torvachi. They'll be polite about it. They'll also remember.
- The Massacre Hills are not a tourist destination. Locals become very quiet when outsiders ask about them.
- The Theater of Blood offers safer entertainment than other arenas. "Safer" is relative.
- Banking at the Banca delle Memorie means the Torvachi will know your business. They know it anyway. At least this way you get interest.
