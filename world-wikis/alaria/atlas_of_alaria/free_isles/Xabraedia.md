### Starfall

At the center of Xabraedia lies Starfall—a pool of intense, otherworldly energy unlike anything else on Alaria. The pool contains starblood, a substance that glows with a deep, alien purple-red color and twinkles with inner lights. This energy comes from a distant planar stack, having naturally coalesced here in a phenomenon that defies normal magical understanding.

The starblood is the remnant of a massive sky worm that escaped its home plane of Glyssen and came to Alaria, where it was promptly disintegrated by a coalition of titans. The creature's blood pooled here, barely contained on this plane. When removed from the pool, the substance begins teleporting back toward Glyssen—it cannot exist far from the pool's location.

Sometimes, people who enter the pool never come back, drawn into the alien energy or pulled toward the distant plane from which the starblood originates. The pool remains a site of mystery, danger, and otherworldly power.
