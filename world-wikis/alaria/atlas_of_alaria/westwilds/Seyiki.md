## Seyiki

Tags: state, nation, gnome

The Seyiki are dragonfly-riding gnomes who have made their home among the Chakatann pillars—the vast stone monuments left behind by the fallen Postronamas Empire. Theirs is an aerial culture, a distributed nation of pillar-top communities connected by dragonfly-back travel and a shared heritage of adaptation to one of Alaria's strangest landscapes.

### Origins

After the Postronamas collapse, survivors scattered across the desert. Most died in the chaos—the infrastructure that had supported their civilization was gone, and the Piktiniti is merciless. But some found refuge on the pillars, climbing the stone monuments to escape ground-level dangers.

These early refugees weren't gnomes—they were human and mixed-heritage Postronamas remnants. The gnomes came later, perhaps a century after the collapse, drawn by the strange resonance of the functioning pillars. Over generations, the two populations merged, and the gnome heritage came to dominate through simple demographics: gnomes breed faster and live longer.

The modern Seyiki remember their Postronamas heritage only in fragments—myths about the "time before the spires," respect for the crystal cores, and an intuitive understanding of the pillars' moods that seems to come from somewhere deeper than learning.

### The Dragonflies

Giant dragonflies grow enormous in the Piktiniti's oxygen-rich air, their wingspan reaching fifteen feet or more. The Seyiki have domesticated several species, breeding them for different purposes:

**Skimmers:** Light, fast mounts for scouts, messengers, and racing. A skimmer can cross the ten miles between pillars in under an hour.

**Haulers:** Larger, slower dragonflies bred to carry cargo slung beneath them. The backbone of Seyiki trade.

**War-dancers:** Aggressive breeds trained for combat, capable of precision maneuvers that let their riders strike from unexpected angles.

Dragonfly husbandry is the foundation of Seyiki culture. Children learn to ride before they can run properly. The bond between gnome and mount is intimate—a Seyiki who loses their dragonfly often takes months to bond with another.

Dragonfly-racing is the primary sport, cultural event, and status marker. The great races draw spectators from across the pillar-network, and champion riders are celebrities.

### Society

**Pillar Communities:** Each major pillar hosts a community of 200 to 2,000 gnomes. They've carved homes into the stone—little holes and chambers in the pillar sides, connected by internal passages and external platforms. Below many pillars lie saltwater lakes, remnants of ancient seas now trapped in desert basins. The dragonflies have adapted to tolerate saltwater, and the lakes serve as breeding grounds, water sources, and sacred sites.

**Vertical Status:** The higher your dwelling, the more prestigious. Pillar-tops are for nobles, priests, and successful merchants. Mid-pillar residence is respectable working-class. The base-dwellers—those who must live at ground level—are the lowest caste, constantly at risk from desert predators.

**The Resonance-Touched:** Generations of living near active crystals have made the Seyiki slightly attuned to the old magic. They're not mages in any traditional sense, but they have an instinctive sense for the pillars' states. They can feel storms coming through changes in the crystal-hum, predict locust swarms days in advance, and sometimes receive fragmentary visions when sleeping atop a "blessed" pillar.

**The Robes:** All Seyiki wear flowing robes—practical garments that serve a dual purpose. In the pillar-homes, the robes provide warmth against the desert's cold nights and protection against the hot days. But the robes are specially constructed with panels that catch air; a falling Seyiki can spread their arms and convert the garment into a wingsuit, gliding safely to the ground or a lower platform. Children learn to fall before they learn to climb.

**Warriors:** Despite their small size, Seyiki are fantastic fighters. Their combat style emphasizes three-dimensional movement—dropping from above, striking from unexpected angles, retreating upward. A Seyiki warrior on their home pillar is nearly impossible to pin down. Combined with their dragonfly mounts, they can harry enemies indefinitely, never committing to a fight they can't win.

**Insularity:** The Seyiki are not hostile, but they're deeply suspicious of outsiders. The desert is deadly; strangers usually want something—typically crystal cores or pillar access. And they remember, in a mythological way, that their ancestors' hubris destroyed an empire. They're wary of anyone who seems too interested in the old magic.

### The Reaping

Every seven years, the locusts hatch.

The swarms are devastating at ground level—billions of insects consuming everything organic, stripping the desert bare. Most Piktiniti cultures hide and pray. The Seyiki hunt.

Dragonflies are natural locust predators. When the swarms rise, Seyiki riders launch en masse, diving into the locust clouds on war-dancers and haulers alike. They harvest locusts by the ton—the insects are dried, ground, and stored as protein-rich flour that will feed the pillar-communities for years.

The Reaping is the most important cultural event in Seyiki life. It's dangerous—riders are lost every cycle, overwhelmed by swarms or brought down by collisions—but successful hunters return as heroes. A gnome's worth is often measured by how many Reapings they've survived.

### Enimogos

The Seyiki call it "the Broken Song," and they do not go there.

Enimogos is the ruined heart of the Postronamas Empire, visible on clear days from the eastern pillars—a cluster of shattered crystal spires that still resonate with maddening intensity. The Seyiki's oral traditions are explicit: Enimogos is death. The crystals there sing a song that breaks minds. Even flying over it is said to leave riders disoriented for days.

Whether this prohibition is wisdom or superstition, no Seyiki violates it. The pillars near Enimogos are abandoned, ceded to whatever haunts the ruins.

### Trade

The Seyiki trade with the outside world through Jüt, the port city on Kettle Bay. They export:

**Crystal fragments:** Small pieces of twyl from depleted or damaged pillars. Valuable for enchanting and alchemy.

**Dragonfly chitin:** The shed carapaces of giant dragonflies, useful for lightweight armor and magical components.

**Locust products:** Dried locusts, locust flour, and refined locust oil. Not glamorous, but there's always demand.

In exchange, they import metal (scarce in the desert), textiles, and luxury goods. Seyiki merchants are known as hard bargainers—they know the value of what they have and don't negotiate from weakness.
