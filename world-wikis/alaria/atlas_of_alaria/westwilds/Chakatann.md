## Chakatann

Tags: region, geography, desert

A region of the western Piktiniti Desert defined by the Postronamas pillars—massive stone columns hundreds of feet tall, spaced roughly ten miles apart in a grid that once covered most of the western desert. The pillars are impossible to miss; they dominate the skyline for miles in every direction, ancient monuments to an empire that rose and fell millennia ago.

### The Pillars

Each pillar is a monolithic column of fused stone and crystal, between two hundred and four hundred feet tall, smooth-sided and weathered by centuries of desert wind. They are clearly artificial—too regular, too uniform, made of a composite material that doesn't match local geology. The Postronamas Empire built them, though how remains unclear. Modern engineers cannot replicate the construction.

The pillars were designed as a resonance network. Each contains (or contained) a core of twyl crystal—the same magical mineral that produces oxygen in the Piktiniti's soil. When the network was active, the crystals sang to each other across the desert: a subsonic hum felt in the bones rather than heard with ears. The network amplified magical power to continental scales, enabling feats of weather control, long-distance communication, and perhaps stranger things.

Now the network is broken. Many pillars have fallen or shattered; their crystals cracked, depleted, or stolen. But some still function—faintly, sporadically, enough to make the region strange.

### The Resonance

Standing exactly between two pillars creates unusual acoustic effects. Whispers carry impossibly far. Sounds echo from directions that don't make sense. Some travelers report hearing voices—fragments of ancient Postronamas speech, conversations from thousands of years ago somehow preserved in the resonance.

The pillars that still hum are called "blessed" by the Seyiki gnomes who live among them. Those that hum *wrong*—discordant, arrhythmic, unsettling—are avoided. Whatever damage broke the network didn't destroy it uniformly; different pillars remember different pieces of what they were.

At night, some pillars glow faintly from within. The crystal cores aren't entirely dead.

### The Spacing

The ten-mile spacing isn't random—it's the precise distance for resonance between twyl crystals of a specific frequency. The Postronamas engineers understood harmonics at a level modern mages don't. The grid pattern means that anywhere in Chakatann, you can see multiple pillars on the horizon, their tops often lost in heat-haze or dust.

Navigating by pillar is the only reliable way to cross Chakatann. The pillars don't move. Everything else might.

### The Seyiki

The pillars are home to the Seyiki—dragonfly-riding gnomes who have adapted to life among the impossible monuments. They live on pillar-tops, in carved chambers within the pillars themselves, and in settlements around the pillar bases. See separate entry for their culture and way of life.

### Dangers

Beyond the Seyiki, Chakatann shares the Piktiniti Desert's hazards: giant insects (thriving in the oxygen-rich air), sand dragons, scorpions the size of horses, and the seven-year locust swarms that devastate everything at ground level.

The pillars themselves can be dangerous. Climbing them without permission risks Seyiki response—they're territorial about their homes. Some pillars are unstable, their bases eroded or their structures compromised. And the resonance effects near certain pillars can cause disorientation, headaches, or worse.

Treasure hunters come to Chakatann seeking intact crystal cores, which are worth fortunes to the right buyers. The Seyiki don't appreciate claim-jumpers. Neither do the pillars—something about removing a core seems to wake defenses that shouldn't still function.
