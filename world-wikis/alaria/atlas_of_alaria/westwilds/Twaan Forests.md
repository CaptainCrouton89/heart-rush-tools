## Twaan Forests

Tags: forest, twaan, ley lines, fire, geography

The Twaan Forests are a sprawling woodland complex in the northeastern Westwilds, bounded by the Kharvorn Mountains to the east and the arid scrublands to the west and south. Three distinct forests make up this region—Turxis Golathi in the north, Sorix Melar in the west, and Zlyverth Korn in the center—though locals and the Twaan themselves treat them as one continuous territory.

This is Twaan land. The large, bitter skaag-relatives have claimed these forests as their own, and they do not welcome outsiders. Their sprawling burrow-settlements honeycomb the ground beneath the trees, housing extended families in warrens that can stretch for miles. Above ground, the forest appears wild and trackless. Below, it's a civilization.

### Why They Came Here

The Twaan speak of a betrayal. The details vary by clan, but the shape of the story remains: they once lived elsewhere, among other peoples, and were driven out. Some say humans broke treaties. Others blame elves, or orcs, or simply "the world." Whatever the truth, the Twaan retreated to these forests generations ago because no one else wanted them.

The Westwilds are harsh—arid scrubland with little water and less mercy. But the Earth ley line that runs through this region creates an anomaly: soil rich enough to support dense forest where none should grow. The Twaan found sanctuary in this improbable woodland, and they've defended it ever since.

Their bitterness runs deep. They trade reluctantly, speak to outsiders rarely, and trust no one who isn't Twaan. Visitors who stumble into their territory are watched, guided out if they're lucky, and simply vanish if they're not. The Twaan remember what happened last time they trusted outsiders.

### Turxis Golathi

The northern section of the Twaan Forests, Turxis Golathi is the oldest and densest part of the woodland. Ancient trees tower here, their canopy so thick that the forest floor lies in permanent twilight. This is where the most established Twaan clans make their homes, their burrow-networks extending deep into the earth.

Turxis Golathi is relatively peaceful by Twaan standards—the clans here have sorted out their territorial disputes generations ago, and a rough hierarchy keeps the endless bickering from erupting into open conflict. Outsiders are rare this deep in the forest, and the Twaan prefer it that way.

The Earth ley line runs through the southern edge of Turxis Golathi before curving southeast toward the Magma Pits. The soil here is unnaturally fertile, and the trees grow to enormous size. Some Twaan claim the oldest trees are aware in some fashion, though they won't elaborate to outsiders.

### Sorix Melar

The western forest, Sorix Melar marks the boundary between Twaan territory and the open Westwilds. The trees here are younger, the canopy thinner, and the Twaan clans more aggressive. This is the front line—where raiders, traders, and the merely curious first encounter Twaan hospitality.

Which is to say, they encounter arrows and warnings.

The Twaan of Sorix Melar have developed a reputation for shooting first. They maintain watch-posts in the larger trees, and they've learned to identify the difference between a lost traveler (escort out), a merchant (tolerate briefly), and a scout (kill immediately). Their paranoia is earned; they've repelled orc war-parties, human settlers, and at least one organized attempt to harvest timber from "unclaimed" forest.

The clans here are poorer than their cousins in Turxis Golathi, more fractious, and more desperate. They control the western trade routes into Twaan territory, which means they also bear the brunt of outside contact. It's made them hard.

### Zlyverth Korn

The central forest is where the fire ley line enters Twaan territory, running north-south along the eastern edge of the woodland before converging with the Earth ley line at the Magma Pits. This convergence has created something extraordinary: the Burning Corridor.

#### The Burning Corridor

Along the fire ley line, the trees have become something else entirely.

Generations of exposure to raw elemental fire have transformed the forest. The trees here don't burn—they ARE fire made into wood. Their bark glows with internal heat, radiating warmth that can be felt from yards away. Their sap runs like liquid flame, bright orange and searingly hot. Their leaves flicker and dance like candle flames frozen in place. At night, the Burning Corridor is visible for miles—a wall of soft red-orange light cutting through the darkness.

The trees are alive. They grow, they reproduce (their seeds are small embers that drift on hot updrafts), and they die (collapsing into piles of ash that quickly sprout new growth). But they don't burn in the conventional sense. You cannot set them more on fire than they already are.

This makes the wood extraordinarily valuable. Fire-immune timber has a thousand uses: ships that can't burn, structures proof against arson, wands and staves that channel flame without consuming themselves, alchemical components for fire resistance, charcoal that burns eternally. A single fire-tree log is worth more than most Twaan clans see in a year.

The Twaan know this. So does everyone else.

#### The Twaan and the Fire

The Burning Corridor is both the Twaan's greatest asset and their greatest vulnerability. They've learned to harvest the fire-trees carefully—never taking too much, never allowing the corridor to thin. They trade small quantities of the wood at enormous markup, maintaining a near-monopoly on the supply.

But the corridor also draws attention. Merchants, thieves, armies—everyone wants fire-wood. The Twaan have repelled dozens of attempts to take the corridor by force, and they've grown expert at making the forest itself into a weapon. The Burning Corridor is impassable to anyone who doesn't know the safe paths, and the Twaan aren't sharing.

Their underground warrens extend beneath the corridor, insulated by stone and earth from the heat above. Some clans have learned to tend the fire-trees from below, feeding their roots with alchemically-treated water that somehow doesn't extinguish them. The relationship between the Twaan and the Burning Corridor has become almost symbiotic—they protect the trees, and the trees protect them.

### Relations with Neighbors

**Gymlstik Goblins**: The goblin-controlled mountains to the east are a constant low-grade threat. Goblin raiders probe Twaan territory regularly, and Cirthikin hunting parties sometimes venture into the forest edges. The Twaan and goblins have fought skirmishes for generations, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Burning Corridor helps—goblins don't handle fire well.

**Orc States**: The orcish nations to the south and west view the Twaan Forests with a mixture of frustration and grudging respect. Several orc states have tried to claim the fire-wood trade; all have failed. An uneasy understanding exists: the Twaan don't expand, the orcs don't invade, and both sides pretend the other doesn't exist.

**Everyone Else**: The Twaan don't distinguish much between humans, elves, dwarves, or anyone else. They're all outsiders. They all betrayed the Twaan (or would, given the chance). Trade happens at the forest's edge, briefly, with weapons visible. That's as friendly as it gets.

### What Travelers Should Know

- Don't enter the forest without permission. The Twaan will know you're there.
- Don't cut any trees. Not even dead ones. Not even branches.
- Don't approach burrow entrances. You won't see them until you're standing on one, and then you'll have a dozen angry Twaan explaining your mistake.
- If you're escorted out, go. The alternative is not being escorted out.
- Fire-wood can be purchased at the western edge of Sorix Melar, if you have enough gold and enough patience. The Twaan will make you wait. It's a test.
