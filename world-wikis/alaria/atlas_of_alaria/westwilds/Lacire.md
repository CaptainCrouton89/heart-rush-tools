## Lacire

Tags: city, state, geography

A city of perhaps fifteen thousand people built on and around the Springs of Vyowehr, deep within Ierya at the heart of the Walking Forest. Lacire is the only significant permanent settlement in the entire Walking Forest—and it exists because its people have learned to live in silence.

### The City of Silence

Lacireans do not speak.

This is not metaphor or exaggeration. Within city limits, verbal communication is forbidden. Lacireans communicate through an elaborate sign language called Stillspeech, through written notes, through gesture and expression and the subtle vocabulary of a culture that has abandoned voice entirely.

The prohibition isn't religious or arbitrary—it's survival. The Grayls who dwell in Ierya find humanoid speech physically painful. The pitch, the speed, the sheer volume of mortal voices causes them genuine distress. When Lacire's founders first settled at the springs, the Grayls' response to their voices drove them to the edge of extinction.

The survivors learned. Over generations, Lacire evolved into something unique: an entire city-state built around the absence of speech.

### Life in Lacire

**Communication:** Stillspeech is taught from infancy. Children learn to sign before they learn to walk. The language is sophisticated—capable of poetry, philosophy, insults, and dirty jokes—and Lacireans are proud of its expressiveness. Written communication supplements Stillspeech for complex or permanent matters.

**Sound Discipline:** Lacireans don't just avoid speech—they minimize all sound. They walk softly, handle objects carefully, build with sound-dampening materials. Music exists but is percussion-only—drums, which the Grayls tolerate, perhaps because the sounds are low and rhythmic rather than sharp and chaotic.

**Visitors:** Outsiders are allowed in Lacire, but they must observe the silence. Those who cannot or will not are confined to a visitors' quarter at the city's edge, where low voices are permitted but carefully monitored. Repeat offenders are expelled. Those who shout—whether in anger, fear, or ignorance—find themselves facing not the city guard but the forest itself.

**Architecture:** Buildings in Lacire are organic, flowing things. They curve around massive roots, integrate fallen branches, use stone from the springs' pools. No sharp angles, no hard edges. The aesthetic isn't just cultural—it minimizes echo and sound reflection.

### The Compact

Lacire exists because of an ancient bargain with the Grayls—what the Lacireans call "the Compact."

The details have been lost to time, known only in fragments and children's stories. What's remembered: the founders were refugees (from where is disputed—some say the Postronamas collapse, others say wars further east). They stumbled into Ierya, dying of thirst, and drank from the springs. The dreams they received showed them how to live: what to do, what never to do, how to exist alongside beings who experience time and sound so differently.

The Compact's requirements, as understood today:
- No fire larger than a candle within Ierya (cooking uses geothermal vents near the springs)
- No cutting of living wood (construction uses only deadfall and stone)
- The springs must remain open to all who come in peace
- Once per generation, a delegation travels deep into Ierya to commune with the eldest Grayls, reaffirming the agreement

In exchange, Ierya doesn't shift around Lacire. The city exists in a pocket of stability, a fixed point in a moving forest.

### Economy

Lacire survives on trade in three precious commodities:

**Spring Water:** The Waters of Vyowehr have genuine healing properties and are valuable across the Westwilds and beyond. Lacire carefully controls export, never taking more than the springs can renew.

**Grayl-Amber:** Hardened sap from the Walking Forest's trees, sometimes found on the forest floor, occasionally purchased directly from Grayls who are willing to sell. The amber has magical properties useful for enchanting and alchemy.

**Guidance:** Anyone who needs to cross the Walking Forest needs a Lacirean guide. They know which paths are passable this season, which groves to avoid, how to navigate a forest that doesn't stay still. This service is expensive and essential.

### Defense

Lacire has walls but barely staffs them. The city's defense is the forest itself.

Hostile forces entering the Walking Forest find paths closing behind them, landmarks shifting, the trees themselves seeming to lean in watchfully. Those who come with violence in their hearts rarely find Lacire at all—they wander until they starve, or until they attract the attention of something in the deep forest that deals with threats in its own way.

The few armies that have reached Lacire's walls found the Grayls waiting. The wooden beings don't fight like mortals—they're slow, patient, implacable. A Grayl can stand motionless for hours, then move with terrifying sudden force. Generals who thought they could overwhelm the city discovered that the forest contained more defenders than any scout had reported.

### The Grayl Market

Outside Lacire's walls, at the forest's edge, stands the Grayl Market—a silent trading post where Grayls occasionally come to exchange goods with mortals.

The Grayls trade their own body-material: wood shavings, bark, sap, and occasionally larger pieces harvested from themselves (a painful process they undertake for reasons mortals don't fully understand). In exchange, they accept... strange things. Seeds from distant lands. Memories written down. Songs performed in absolute silence (signed descriptions of music, which they seem to find meaningful). Stories about places that don't move.

Transactions take days. The Grayls don't negotiate in any timeframe mortals find comfortable. But the results are worth fortunes to those with patience.
