## Hills to Nowhere

Tags: hills, wurmspine, geography, wasteland

The Hills to Nowhere occupy the southern reaches of the Wurmspine range, a desolate highland region stretching from Kobuk in the north to the arid wastes beyond. The name is accurate: the hills lead nowhere anyone wants to go. No valuable passes, no important settlements, no strategic advantage. Just empty terrain that serves primarily to be crossed—or avoided entirely.

### Geography

The Hills to Nowhere span roughly forty miles north to south, gradually descending from the rugged peaks of the central Wurmspine to the dry plains below. The terrain is characterized by rolling highlands, shallow valleys, and sparse vegetation—mostly scrub grass, thornbush, and the occasional stunted tree clinging to a sheltered slope.

Water is scarce. A few seasonal streams cut through the hills during spring snowmelt, but they dry to bare rock by summer. The few reliable springs are jealously guarded by whatever happens to control the immediate area, which changes regularly.

The climate is harsh—hot in summer, bitterly cold in winter, windy year-round. The hills catch weather systems moving off the Wurmspine and funnel them into unpredictable patterns. Snow can fall in autumn; heat waves can strike in spring. Travelers who don't prepare for everything often don't arrive.

### Why "Nowhere"

The name reflects both geography and reputation.

**No Passes**: Unlike other sections of the Wurmspine, the Hills to Nowhere contain no meaningful routes through the mountains. Anyone wanting to cross the range goes around them—through Kobuk and the Hellion Hills to the north, or through Tarkhon-controlled territory to the east. The hills themselves lead only to more hills, and eventually to empty wasteland.

**No Resources**: The hills are mineral-poor, agriculturally useless, and strategically irrelevant. No nation claims them because no nation wants them. Occasional prospectors search for ore deposits; they don't find much.

**No Population**: Almost no one lives here permanently. The few inhabitants are outcasts, hermits, and fugitives—people who specifically want to be in a place no one cares about. They don't form communities. They avoid each other.

### Who Goes There

**Fugitives**: The hills' emptiness and irrelevance make them attractive to people fleeing justice, debts, or enemies. The lack of any organized authority means no one is looking for you. The tradeoff is surviving alone in harsh terrain with limited resources.

**Exile Communities**: Occasionally, groups too large to simply disappear but too troublesome to keep find themselves "encouraged" to relocate to the Hills to Nowhere. These communities rarely last. The lucky ones eventually migrate elsewhere; the unlucky ones don't.

**Smugglers**: The hills provide alternative routes around Tarkhon-controlled passes, if you're willing to accept longer travel times and worse conditions. Some smuggling operations maintain way-stations in the hills, though these change location frequently to avoid being found.

**The Lost**: Some travelers end up in the Hills to Nowhere by accident—taking wrong turns, fleeing danger, or being abandoned. Many of these wander until they find their way out or die. A few stay.

### The Cairn Fields

Scattered throughout the central hills are fields of stone cairns—thousands of stacked rock piles, some ancient, some recent. No one knows who started building them or why. The oldest are weathered nearly flat; the newest look freshly made.

Different theories circulate:

- **Grave markers**: Some believe each cairn marks a burial, making the fields an enormous cemetery for the unknown dead. Excavations have occasionally found bones beneath the older cairns.

- **Navigation aids**: Others think the cairns were meant to help travelers navigate, though if so, whatever system they used has been lost. The cairns don't correspond to modern trails.

- **Ritual purpose**: A few scholars suggest the cairns served some religious or magical function, perhaps related to the nearby ley lines. No evidence supports this beyond the fields' inexplicable existence.

Travelers who pass through sometimes add their own cairns, continuing a tradition whose origin no one remembers. It's considered bad luck to knock down a standing cairn.

### The Bleached Garden

At the southern edge of the hills, where the terrain transitions to desert, lies an area called the Bleached Garden. Here, thousands of bones litter the ground—animal bones, mostly, though human remains appear occasionally. The bones are old, sun-bleached white, and cover perhaps a square mile of open ground.

The origin is unknown. No battle is recorded here. No mass die-off is documented. The bones simply accumulated over time, from sources no one has identified. Local speculation ranges from the mundane (a natural trap where animals become disoriented and die) to the supernatural (something that lures creatures here to feed).

The Cogheads of Kobuk warn travelers away from the Bleached Garden. They don't explain why, and they won't discuss what they know about it.

### Travel

Crossing the Hills to Nowhere is possible but unpleasant. No maintained roads exist. No services are available. Water must be carried or found through careful navigation to the few reliable springs.

The safest approach is to skirt the hills entirely—the eastern edge, where they meet Tarkhon-aligned territory, offers slightly better conditions. The western edge, bordering Westwilds territory, is drier and more exposed.

Those who must cross directly should carry sufficient supplies for the entire journey, travel in groups, and accept that no help is coming if something goes wrong.
