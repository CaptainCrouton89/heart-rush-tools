# Westwilds

## Geography

Situated below the Northlands, the Westwilds have a yellowish-green hue suggesting a dry steppe, savanna, or scrubland environment. The region appears less fertile than the central regions but not as arid as a true desert—a rugged transitional zone between the frozen north and the more hospitable south.
