# Westwilds

## Geography

The Westwilds occupy the southwestern corner of Clueanda, forming a transitional zone between the frozen Northlands and the maritime regions to the south. This is the southern coast of Clueanda, stretching from Tarkhon in the east to the waters overlooking the Western Isles in the west.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Transitions into the Northlands; the frozen tundra gradually gives way to arid scrubland
- **East**: Meets Tarkhon territory; some desert coastline marks this transition
- **South**: Faces the open ocean, with the Western Isles visible offshore
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking the Western Isles

### Terrain

The Westwilds have a yellowish-green hue suggesting dry steppe or scrubland. The region is less fertile than the Middle Sea lands but more hospitable than the frozen north—a rugged zone of hardy grasses, wind-worn rock, and arid soil. While not a true desert, the land is parched and demanding.

### Climate Transition

The Westwilds represent one of Clueanda's major climate transitions. The frozen winds from the Northlands lose much of their bite here, but the region receives little rainfall. The result is an austere landscape—neither frozen nor verdant, but something in between.
