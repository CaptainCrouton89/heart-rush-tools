# Westwilds

## Geography

The Westwilds occupy the southwestern corner of Clueanda, forming a transitional zone between the frozen Northlands and the maritime regions to the south. This is the southern coast of Clueanda, stretching from Tarkhon in the east to the waters overlooking the Western Isles in the west.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Transitions into the Northlands; the frozen tundra gradually gives way to arid scrubland
- **East**: Meets Tarkhon territory; some desert coastline marks this transition
- **South**: Faces the open ocean, with the Western Isles visible offshore
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking the Western Isles

### Terrain

The Westwilds have a yellowish-green hue suggesting dry steppe or scrubland. The region is less fertile than the Middle Sea lands but more hospitable than the frozen north—a rugged zone of hardy grasses, wind-worn rock, and arid soil. While not a true desert, the land is parched and demanding.

### Climate Transition

The Westwilds represent one of Clueanda's major climate transitions. The frozen winds from the Northlands lose much of their bite here, but the region receives little rainfall. The result is an austere landscape—neither frozen nor verdant, but something in between.

## Notable Locations

### Shazuihn

An orc state in the interior Westwilds, notable for its extensive forests and proximity to dangerous geothermal features.

#### Shazuihn Forest

Dense woodlands covering much of the orc state's territory, providing shelter and resources for the orc clans.

#### The Plains Beyond

North of the Shazuihn Forest lie open plains marked by violent magical phenomena.

##### Dragon Spout

Located in the plains north of Shazuihn and southwest of the Scorches (a region of hotsprings and geysers), Dragon Spout is a site where the void and fire leylines intersect. Huge gouts of flame erupt unpredictably from the ground, shooting hundreds of feet into the air. The combination of void magic and fire creates flames that burn with unnatural heat and persistence—they cannot be extinguished by conventional means and sometimes burn in colors that shouldn't exist.

The area around Dragon Spout is a scorched wasteland, littered with the remains of those who underestimated the danger. The eruptions are impossible to predict, and the void-tainted fire can burn through magical protections. Despite the extreme hazard, some fire mages make pilgrimages here to study the raw elemental power.

##### The Scorches

Northeast of Dragon Spout lies the Scorches, a region of hotsprings and geysers where geothermal activity creates a landscape of bubbling mud pots, scalding pools, and steam vents. The heat here is natural rather than magical, but no less deadly.

At the heart of the Scorches is a massive boiling whirlpool where superheated water churns with such violence that it becomes super-aerated, causing anything that enters to lose buoyancy and sink immediately. Gouts of fire erupt from the whirlpool at irregular intervals, and the area is inhabited by steam elementals—creatures born from the intersection of water and fire. The Scorches are extremely dangerous, and few who venture too close to the central whirlpool survive.

###### Ruby Rock

West of the Deadwalk desert, within the Scorches, stands Ruby Rock—a massive stone outcropping that erupted from the ground in ancient times. The rock contains a vast cavern system filled with rubies and gemstones, created when mineral-rich water from the hotsprings deposited sediments over millennia before being uplifted by geological forces.

The gems are breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly valuable, but they carry a curse. Those who take rubies from the cavern find themselves plagued by misfortune—relationships crumble, fortunes are lost, and death stalks them. Some say the curse is tied to the volcanic forces that created the gems; others believe the rubies remember being torn from their home and seek revenge on those who stole them.

### The Orc States

The southern and western portions of the Westwilds are divided among six major orcish states, each controlling territory in the vast forested region:

- **Glivornax**
- **Hedroscobb** (northeast of the Plains of Oblivion)
- **Grieb** (home to the Grieb Lakes and the Griebi people)
- **Shazuihn** (detailed above)
- **Tarn** (detailed below)
- **Uhionai**

These states maintain a loose confederation, cooperating for defense against external threats while fiercely competing for resources and territory within the Westwilds.

#### Tarn

One of the central orcish states in the Westwilds, positioned along the Grand Tolkarsus river system.

##### Plenjorn Swamp

A marshy region within Tarn, fed by the Grand Tolkarsus—a massive river that stretches from the Nirvanis Mountains (part of the Kharvorn range) in the northeast, flowing southwest through orcish territory, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and the Deadwalk desert, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake. This colossal lake connects to Symonair Lake, which empties into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

Within Plenjorn Swamp, the river's waters are said to possess miraculous healing properties. Bathing in the Grand Tolkarsus can cure even the most brutal wounds and life-threatening injuries. Few outside Tarn know of this power, and the Tarni orcs fiercely protect the swamp from outsiders, ensuring the healing waters remain a secret advantage for their people.

### Plains of Oblivion

Northwest of the mountains of Murth (a state in Tarkhon), stretching from the Western Isles coast in the west to the orc state of Hedroscobb in the northeast, lie the Plains of Oblivion. These cursed grasslands cause all who enter to gradually forget everything except their oldest long-term memories and events from the past year. Recent memories, learned skills, and personal identity slip away like water through fingers.

The plains are home to Satyrn Gray—the palace of Queen Eranes, an extremely powerful half-titan who lost her love when the plains were cursed and split by ancient magic. In her grief, she sought to forget, enchanting her entire palace with powerful spells that hide memories. Though she has succeeded in forgetting her love, she still feels a deep, inexplicable sorrow. She knows she is connected to these plains and cannot bring herself to leave, but she no longer remembers why.

Queen Eranes will handsomely reward anyone who can explain to her what has happened—who she was, what she lost, and why she feels such endless mourning. But the palace's enchantments work against this goal: visitors forget their purpose, the queen forgets the conversations she has, and the truth remains perpetually out of reach. The memory-draining effect of the plains ceases once travelers leave, but the lost memories never return, and the queen remains trapped in her palace of forgotten sorrows.

### Mountains Semaphois

West of the Grand Tolkarsus and south of the northern plains rise the Mountains Semaphois. To the mountains' west lies Ichneum, a large forest. North of the range are the mountains of Miphori, the Zhorheim Mountains (marking the northern edge of the forest), and the Hills of the White Terror, which stretch northeast into the Northlands.

#### Temple of the Wind

High in the Mountains Semaphois stands the wind-racked, abandoned Temple of the Wind. This remote structure was once home to monks and primeshapers who mastered both earth and air magic, using the mountain winds to fuel their practice. The temple was destroyed when a mechwurm attacked, killing the monks and leaving the temple empty.

Now the temple stands as a haunting reminder, its halls filled with the howling winds that once served the monks' magic. The structure itself remains intact, though battered by decades of relentless wind, and the knowledge the monks possessed has been lost with their deaths.

### Zhorheim Mountains

Home to Zorheim, the dragon guardian of the Einwissel dwarves who traveled back from Celestia. The dragon can travel to Celestia easily as well. The dwarves know its true name, and vice versa—a foundation of enormous trust. Located in a mountain range forming part of the southwest side of the northlands, northeast of Ichneum, marking the northern edge of the forest region.
