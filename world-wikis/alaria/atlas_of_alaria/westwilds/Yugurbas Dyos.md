## Yugurbas Dyos

Tags: geography, swamp, contested

The bloody ground between Hedroscobb and Glivornax—a transitional marsh where the southern Wildwood gives way to the Tolkarsus watershed. The Hedroscobbi call it the Algae Fields. The Glivornaxi call it Sacred Waters. Both call it theirs, and both have been dying over it for a century.

### Geography

Yugurbas Dyos occupies roughly fifty miles of borderland between the two orc states. It's not quite swamp, not quite forest—a soggy transitional zone where streams from the higher ground spread into marshes, meadows flood seasonally, and thick beds of the distinctive blue-green algae that the Hedroscobbi prize grow in the still waters.

**The Algae Beds:** The real prize. These shallow pools and slow streams host the specific algae species that, when properly treated and combined with iron, creates the Hedroscobbi's signature corrosive armor. The algae grows elsewhere in the Tolkarsus watershed, but nowhere as abundantly as here.

**The Wet Meadows:** Seasonal flooding creates grasslands that are sometimes passable, sometimes waist-deep in water. Armies have bogged down here; raiders have vanished without trace. Knowing when and where to move is everything.

**The Drowned Forest:** Ancient trees killed by rising water levels stand skeletal and gray throughout the region. They provide cover, landmarks, and firewood—but they also create a haunting, maze-like terrain where it's easy to get lost.

### Why It Matters

The War of the Marshes has been fought over Yugurbas Dyos for over a century. The stakes:

**For Hedroscobb:** The algae is essential. Without it, they can't produce their armor. Without their armor, they're just another orc state—large, but not unstoppable. The forges need a constant supply, and Yugurbas Dyos has the richest beds outside Glivornax proper.

**For Glivornax:** The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of the entire Tolkarsus watershed. Yugurbas Dyos is part of that system—its waters feed into the greater network, and what happens here affects everything downstream. Beyond that, allowing Hedroscobb to strip-mine the algae would be a betrayal of everything they stand for.

**For Everyone Else:** The war keeps both states focused on each other instead of expanding. Tarn appreciates this. Vogenfeld appreciates this more. If either side won decisively, the balance of power in the Wildwood would shift dramatically.

### The Seasonal Conflict

Fighting in Yugurbas Dyos follows the algae bloom cycle:

**Dry Season (Summer):** The marshes recede, the algae beds are exposed, and this is when the Hedroscobbi send their Gatherer expeditions. Armed parties move in to harvest as much algae as they can before the Glivornaxi respond.

**Patrol Season (Spring/Fall):** Both sides maintain patrols. Skirmishes are common. Small parties clash, retreat, and clash again. Neither side commits fully because the terrain is too dangerous for major operations.

**Flood Season (Winter):** The marshes become impassable. Fighting stops. Both sides regroup and prepare for the next year's harvest.

**The Harvest War:** Every summer, the same pattern repeats. Hedroscobbi Gatherers enter the marshes. Glivornaxi patrols intercept them. People die. The Hedroscobbi take what algae they can; the Glivornaxi prevent what harvesting they can. Neither side ever wins completely.

### The Terrain

Moving through Yugurbas Dyos requires:
- Knowledge of the water levels (which change constantly)
- Understanding of the solid paths (which aren't always obvious)
- Ability to navigate by the drowned trees (which all look similar)
- Acceptance that you will get wet, cold, and lost

**The Glivornaxi Advantage:** They know this terrain. They've mapped the paths, memorized the water patterns, and trained to fight in waist-deep muck. On their ground, they're nearly unbeatable.

**The Hedroscobbi Adaptation:** The Gatherers are lighter-armored than regular Hedroscobbi forces—they have to be. They move fast, hit specific algae beds, and try to extract before the patrols arrive. It's more like raiding than conventional warfare.

### Notable Features

**The Stone Markers:** Ancient boundary stones from before the current conflict, placed by someone—no one remembers who. Both sides claim they mark the "true" border in their favor. The stones are worn, weathered, and covered in moss.

**The Bleeding Pool:** A large algae bed that turns red during certain seasons. The Glivornaxi say this is sacred—the waters remember those who died defending them. The Hedroscobbi say it's just a different algae species that happens to be useless for smithing.

**The Ghost Village:** Ruins of a settlement that existed before the war. Both sides claim it was theirs originally. No one lives there now—it's too dangerous.

**The Watcher Trees:** Several massive drowned oaks that serve as observation posts. Whoever holds them can see movement across miles of marsh. Control shifts constantly.

### What Players Might Find

Yugurbas Dyos is dangerous but offers opportunities:

- **Algae samples** worth a fortune to the right buyers (or to Hedroscobb directly)
- **Lost equipment** from decades of fighting—weapons, armor, supplies
- **The truth** about the ancient boundary stones and who placed them
- **Neutral ground** where negotiations might happen (theoretically)
- **Passage** between Hedroscobb and Glivornax territory (if you're willing to risk it)

### Adventure Hooks

- Guide a Hedroscobbi Gatherer expedition through Glivornaxi patrols
- Help Glivornaxi defenders stop an unusually large Hedroscobbi incursion
- Investigate why the algae yields are declining—is someone poisoning the beds?
- Find and recover the body of a diplomat who disappeared in the marshes
- Discover what the ancient stone markers actually mean
- Broker a ceasefire (probably impossible, but someone's paying you to try)
