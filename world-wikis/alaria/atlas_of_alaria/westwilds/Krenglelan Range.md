## Krenglelan Range

Tags: mountains, geography

A vast mountain range spanning the northern Westwilds from coast to interior, the Krenglelan forms a natural barrier between the frozen Northlands and the temperate regions to the south. Its peaks are weathered granite and dark basalt, its valleys choked with ancient forest. The range is both a border and a world unto itself—home to things that predate human settlement and prefer to remain undisturbed.

### Geography

The Krenglelan stretches roughly east-west across the Westwilds, with the massive Everwood forest blanketing its southern slopes and valleys. North of the range lies scrubland transitioning to tundra; south lies the forest belt that eventually gives way to the Piktiniti Desert. Several passes allow travel through the mountains, though all are arduous and some are actively dangerous.

The western peaks are the highest and most remote, fading into coastal cliffs that overlook the sea toward the Western Isles. The eastern end descends gradually into the Tenekee Woods and the vast Walking Forest beyond.

### Mitasslus

In the western peaks, in a valley that appears on no reliable map, lairs Mitasslus—an earth dragon of immense age. His scales are the color of weathered sandstone; his eyes hold the patient darkness of deep caves. He has been here since before the Postronamas built their pillars, since before humans came to Clueanda, and he will be here long after.

Mitasslus guards a passage to the Underrealms—one of the deep gates connecting the surface to the vast cavern systems below. He doesn't guard it because he was asked to. He guards it because things come *up* through that gate, and he has decided they will not get past him.

The dragon is neither good nor evil by mortal reckoning—simply territorial beyond any negotiation. He won't attack travelers who keep their distance, but anyone who enters his valley uninvited will be buried under half a mountain. He hasn't spoken to a mortal in centuries; most believe he's incapable of speech. He is not. He simply doesn't see the point.

Occasionally, Mitasslus emerges to sun himself on the high cliff faces. When his silhouette appears against the sky, caravans on the northern trade routes know to detour. Locals leave offerings at the valley's mouth—not worship, exactly, but acknowledgment. The dragon ignores them, but the offerings are never disturbed.

### Quiet Mountain

The central peak of the Krenglelan Range, and the one travelers learn to avoid. Quiet Mountain is unnaturally, hungrily silent.

Sound doesn't simply fail to carry on the upper slopes—it is *consumed*. Speak above a certain elevation and your voice vanishes mid-word. Avalanches fall in eerie muteness. Birds don't sing there; they've learned not to waste the effort.

The silence is not natural. Something beneath or within Quiet Mountain absorbs vibration—a fragment of primordial Void that fell during the world's creation, some scholars believe. The Void hungers for the energy of sound, and the mountain is where it feeds. Those who stay too long report feeling "thinned," as if their own vitality is being consumed along with their words.

The Postronamas knew about Quiet Mountain. Their pillar-network forms an arc that carefully avoids pointing toward it, and some scholars believe this was deliberate—either to avoid the Void-shard's interference or to prevent their resonance magic from feeding it further. The mountain's relationship to the maddening crystal-music of the Piktiniti remains a subject of debate among those few who study such things.

Pilgrims occasionally climb seeking enlightenment through perfect silence. Most descend changed, hollowed, speaking in whispers for the rest of their lives. Some don't descend at all.

### The Everwood

A vast forest stretching across the Krenglelan's southern slopes and into the lowlands beyond, detailed in its own entry. The Everwood is a single massive organism that cannot die or decay, creating unique and dangerous conditions within its bounds.

### Ipt

On the western side of the Krenglelan Range, north of the Everwood and along a major trade route, stands Ipt—a formidable fortress built for Feriptus, an extremely powerful lich. The fortress serves as his primary research facility, where he conducts necromantic experiments in complete isolation.

Ipt is built into the mountainside with tall, iron-reinforced stone walls and heavy defensive wards that notify Feriptus of any approaching visitors. The fortress is supplied through a grim arrangement: a personal Enti trader makes bi-yearly trips south to acquire slaves, delivering fresh bodies for Feriptus's dark work. Despite its location along a trade route, travelers give Ipt a wide berth, knowing that those who approach uninvited rarely leave.
