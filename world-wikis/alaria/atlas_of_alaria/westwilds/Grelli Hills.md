## Grelli Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A sprawling highland region in the northwestern Westwilds, the Grelli Hills form a natural boundary between the Walking Forest to the south and the open plains to the north. The hills are notable for their unusual stability—despite being adjacent to the constantly migrating Walking Forest, the Grelli Hills have remained largely unchanged for centuries.

### Geography

The Grelli Hills stretch roughly 80 miles east to west and 40 miles north to south, a region of rolling terrain scattered with copses of ancient oak and pine. The hills themselves are modest—rarely exceeding a few hundred feet—but their cumulative effect creates a distinctive landscape of hidden valleys, sheltered hollows, and unexpected vistas.

**The Rootline**: The southern edge of the Grelli Hills marks where the Walking Forest's migration stops. Trees that drift north from the forest encounter the hills and go no further. Some scholars believe the bedrock beneath the hills contains minerals that the forest finds inhospitable; others think the hills sit on a ley line intersection that anchors land in place. The Grayls have no explanation, only observation: trees stop here.

**The Torzein Valley**: A river valley running northwest through the hills, carved by the Torzein River before it joins larger waterways to the south. The valley provides the main passage through the hills for traders and travelers.

### Inhabitants

The Grelli Hills are sparsely populated but not empty:

**Shepherds and Herders**: Small communities raise goats and sheep in the hills, moving between seasonal pastures. They trade wool and cheese with the settlements to the south and maintain a careful distance from the Walking Forest.

**Hermits and Exiles**: The hills' many hidden valleys make excellent places to disappear. Wanted criminals, disgraced nobles, and those simply tired of civilization have all found refuge here over the centuries.

**The Rootwatchers**: A small order of scholars who study the boundary between the Grelli Hills and the Walking Forest, trying to understand why the forest's migration halts at this particular location. They maintain a lodge near the Rootline and have documented decades of observations.

### Climate

Continental temperate with harsh winters. The hills catch weather systems moving across the northern plains, resulting in heavy snowfall in winter and unpredictable storms year-round. Summers are pleasant but brief.

### Why It Matters

The Grelli Hills are valuable precisely because they're stable. In a region dominated by the Walking Forest's unpredictable movements, the hills offer reliable terrain—roads stay where you put them, landmarks don't shift, and settlements can last more than a generation. For merchants traveling between the eastern orc states and the western territories, the Torzein Valley through the Grelli Hills is the safest route.
