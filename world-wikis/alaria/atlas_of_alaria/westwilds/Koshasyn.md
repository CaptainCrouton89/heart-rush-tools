## Koshasyn

Tags: settlement, geography

A small trading settlement in the clearing between Pystinwood and Milrar Forest, Koshasyn (sometimes spelled "Koshasya" on older maps) serves as the primary meeting point between the orc states, the steppe nomads, and the scattered communities of the northern Westwilds. It's not quite a town, not quite a camp—something in between that has persisted for generations without ever quite becoming permanent.

### Geography

Koshasyn occupies a natural clearing roughly three miles across, bounded by Pystinwood to the north, Milrar Forest to the south, and open grassland transitioning to the Steppe of Aziirn to the east. The clearing exists because of soil conditions—the ground here is rockier and less fertile than the surrounding terrain, unable to support the dense forest growth on either side.

**The Market Ground**: The center of the clearing, where traders set up temporary stalls and permanent residents maintain a few modest buildings. Nothing is elaborate; everything is built for function over form.

**The Northern Camp**: A semi-permanent encampment where pystin sap traders from the north gather. During harvest season, dozens of sap-tappers congregate here to sell their product.

**The Steppe Gate**: The eastern edge of the clearing, where the grassland begins and steppe nomads make camp when visiting to trade. A few carved posts mark the traditional boundary.

### Function

Koshasyn exists because everyone needs it and no one wants to control it:

**Neutral Ground**: Like Telwood to the south, Koshasyn is recognized as neutral territory. The orc states don't claim it; the northern communities don't fortify it; the steppe nomads don't raid it. Violence here is punished by exclusion—anyone who causes trouble is banned from trading.

**Trade Hub**: The settlement handles exchange between wildly different economies. Pystin sap goes east; steppe horses go west; orcish metalwork goes everywhere; information flows in all directions. The clearing sees more cultural exchange in a week than most regions see in a year.

**Information Market**: Beyond physical goods, Koshasyn trades in knowledge. News from the orc states, rumors from the steppe, reports from the northern forests—travelers share information here, and those who pay attention can learn the state of the entire region.

### Population

Perhaps two hundred people live in Koshasyn year-round, maintaining the market ground, running the few permanent establishments, and facilitating trade. During peak seasons—spring and autumn—the population can swell to over a thousand as traders arrive from all directions.

**The Permanent Residents**: A mix of outcasts, entrepreneurs, and people who simply prefer neutrality to belonging. They maintain the settlement's infrastructure and enforce its rules.

**The Seasonal Visitors**: Traders, herders, diplomats, and the simply curious who pass through regularly but don't stay. Some families have visited Koshasyn every year for generations.

### Why It Matters

Koshasyn is a node in the regional network—a place where connections are made, deals are struck, and news travels. Its neutrality makes it valuable; its persistence makes it reliable. For players traversing the eastern Westwilds, Koshasyn offers supplies, information, guides, and a temporary respite from the wilderness's challenges.
