## The Guiles

Tags: forest, geography, illusion

The Guiles is a dense forest wedged between the Hellion Hills to the west and the Twaan Forests to the north, stretching south toward Kobuk. It takes its name from the experience of traveling through it: the forest lies, and those who trust their senses here find themselves hopelessly lost.

No one is entirely certain why. The leading theories involve residual magic from the nearby ley lines, some property of the local flora, or the influence of creatures that prefer confused prey. The Guiles isn't actively malicious—people who stay calm and patient usually find their way out eventually—but it makes navigation nearly impossible through conventional means.

### The Forest

The Guiles covers perhaps fifteen miles east to west and twenty north to south, though measurements vary wildly depending on who's doing the measuring and when. The trees are primarily old-growth hardwoods—oak, ash, and maple—with dense understory growth that blocks sightlines and muffles sound.

The terrain appears uniform but isn't. Gentle slopes steepen without warning. Streams seem to flow uphill. Clearings that look a hundred yards away turn out to be adjacent, while nearby trees can take hours to reach. The sun is visible through the canopy, but it doesn't help—it seems to rise in different directions depending on where you stand.

Wildlife is abundant but difficult to track. Animals appear and vanish with disturbing regularity. Hunters who follow game trails find themselves circling back to their starting points.

### The Lies

The Guiles doesn't create illusions—at least, not obvious ones. Nothing looks wrong. The problem is that nothing is where it should be.

**Distance Distortion**: Distances in the Guiles bear no reliable relationship to travel time. A visible landmark might take minutes or hours to reach. Travelers who walk in straight lines end up somewhere other than where the line pointed.

**Directional Drift**: Compasses work, but the directions they indicate don't correspond to actual geography. The sun rises in the east, but "east" as measured inside the Guiles doesn't match "east" anywhere else.

**Memory Erosion**: Extended time in the Guiles makes it difficult to remember why you entered or where you were going. Not dangerous memory loss—travelers retain their identities and important information—but purpose and direction slip away. Many who get lost report forgetting they were lost, wandering contentedly until stumbling out days later.

**Sound Displacement**: Voices carry strangely. Conversations seem to come from the wrong direction. Echoes precede sounds. Silence falls suddenly and completely, then lifts just as suddenly.

### Surviving the Guiles

Those who must cross the Guiles have developed several techniques:

**Marking**: Physical marks on trees remain reliable. Blazing a trail creates a path that can be followed back, even when nothing else makes sense. The Cogheads of Kobuk use distinctive metal markers; the Twaan use claw-scored symbols.

**Tethering**: Groups sometimes use ropes to maintain physical connection. If you can touch someone, you know where they are, regardless of what your eyes and ears tell you.

**Night Travel**: Some travelers report that the distortion weakens after dark. This may be because there's less visual information to mislead, or because whatever causes the effect is less active at night. The tradeoff is navigating dense forest in darkness.

**Local Guides**: Both the Cogheads and the Twaan know paths through the Guiles that remain relatively stable. These guides are expensive and reluctant—neither group enjoys spending time in the forest—but they're the most reliable option.

### Inhabitants

**The Misled**: The local name for people who've been lost in the Guiles so long they've stopped trying to leave. Not a formal community—they rarely find each other—but individual hermits scattered through the forest, living off the land and occasionally helping (or further confusing) travelers they encounter. Most seem content. A few seem to have forgotten there's anywhere else to be.

**Displacers**: Predators native to the Guiles that have adapted to (or perhaps cause) the distortion. They appear where they shouldn't be, attack from unexpected angles, and vanish before retaliation. Whether they're magical creatures, mundane animals that have learned to exploit the terrain, or something else entirely is unclear.

**The Wardens**: Rumors persist of something intelligent in the deep Guiles—entities that maintain the distortion or benefit from it. No one has confirmed contact. The Twaan claim it's forest spirits. The Cogheads think it's a colony of creatures with natural illusion abilities. Both groups recommend not looking too hard for answers.

### Borders

**North**: The Guiles gradually merge with the southern reaches of the Twaan Forests. The transition is marked by the distortion weakening—the Twaan claim their territory "knows itself" and resists the Guiles' influence.

**West**: The Hellion Hills. The distortion ends abruptly at the treeline where volcanic terrain begins. Heat and sulfur replace confusion.

**South/Southeast**: Kobuk territory. The Cogheads have fortified their border with the Guiles, clearing trees and maintaining watch-posts. They've lost too many people to the forest to trust it.

**East**: Eventually opens into the broader Wurmspine foothills, though "eventually" is the operative word—the eastern edge is the deepest part of the distortion.
