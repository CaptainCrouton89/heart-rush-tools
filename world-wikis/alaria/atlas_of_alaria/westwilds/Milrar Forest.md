## Milrar Forest

Tags: forest, geography

The central forest of the eastern woodland belt, Milrar sits between Pystinwood to the north and Telwood to the south. Where Pystinwood has its narcotic trees and Telwood its storied history, Milrar is simply old—ancient, dense, and deep in a way that the other forests aren't.

### Geography

Milrar Forest covers roughly 50 miles east to west and 35 miles north to south, making it the largest of the three eastern forests. It lies west of the Steppe of Aziirn, south of Koshasya and Pystinwood, and north of Telwood.

**The Old Growth**: The forest's core is true old growth—trees that have stood for centuries, their canopy so thick that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight. The understory is a tangle of fallen logs, bracket fungi, and shade-loving plants. Navigation is difficult; getting lost is easy.

**The Koshasya Edge**: The northern boundary, where Milrar thins into the clearing around Koshasya settlement. This transitional zone shows evidence of past logging and clearing, though the forest has long since reclaimed abandoned fields.

**Ezra's Temptation**: A river that flows through the forest's eastern portion, named for a legendary explorer who followed it seeking the forest's heart and was never seen again. The river eventually flows southeast toward the steppe.

### Character

Milrar Forest has a reputation for swallowing people. Not through any specific danger—no monsters lurk here, no curses operate—but through sheer disorientation. The forest is so uniform, so densely layered, that travelers lose their sense of direction within hours of entering. They wander in circles. They think they're heading east when they're heading west. They emerge weeks later, miles from where they intended, if they emerge at all.

**The Silence**: Milrar is unnaturally quiet. Sound doesn't carry far through the dense growth, and the usual forest noises—birdsong, animal calls, wind in leaves—seem muted, absorbed by the trees themselves. Travelers report feeling watched by something that never reveals itself.

**Time Distortion**: Some who spend extended periods in Milrar report that time passes strangely. Days feel longer or shorter than they should. Travelers emerge after what felt like two days to find a week has passed, or vice versa. The effect isn't magical in any detectable way—just unsettling.

### Inhabitants

Milrar has no permanent settlements. The forest doesn't permit them. Attempts to establish camps or outposts have all failed—supplies rot faster than expected, buildings collapse without apparent cause, and residents develop an overwhelming urge to leave.

**The Foresters**: Hunters and gatherers who work Milrar's edges, harvesting game and forest products without ever penetrating the old growth. They know better.

**Passage-Seekers**: Occasional travelers who attempt to cross Milrar rather than go around. Some succeed. Most don't try twice.

### Milreun Palace

Deep in the old growth, where the trees grow thickest and the silence is absolute, stands Milreun Palace—or what remains of it. The palace predates recorded history; no chronicle names its builders or explains its purpose. It simply exists, half-consumed by the forest, its towers wrapped in ancient vines and its halls open to the sky where roofs have collapsed.

**The Structure**: What survives suggests a palace built for giants, or at least for beings with no regard for human scale. Doorways stand twenty feet tall. Staircases rise at angles too steep for comfortable climbing. The architecture follows no known tradition—the proportions are wrong, the decorative motifs abstract and unsettling.

**The Time Effect**: Milreun Palace is the heart of Milrar's time distortion. The forest's strange temporal effects grow stronger the closer one approaches. Those who enter the palace itself report hours that stretch into apparent days, or entire days that compress into moments. Some have emerged from the palace aged years despite spending only a night within its walls. Others emerged younger, though these cases are rare and never by more than a few months.

**What Remains**: The palace's interior is largely empty—picked clean by centuries of treasure hunters who braved the forest. What couldn't be removed remains: massive stone furniture too heavy to carry, faded murals on crumbling walls, and in the deepest chamber, a throne of black stone facing an empty dais. Something once sat on that dais. Whatever it was, it's long gone.

**The Guardians**: The palace isn't undefended. Those who spend too long in its halls—and "too long" varies unpredictably—attract the attention of shapes that move at the edge of vision, figures that might be shadows or might be something else. They don't attack directly, but those who see them consistently find themselves hopelessly lost when they try to leave, wandering the forest for weeks before emerging.

### Why It Matters

Milrar Forest is an obstacle that shapes regional geography. Traffic between the northern Westwilds and the orc states to the south routes around the forest, not through it—adding days to journeys but avoiding the very real risk of never arriving at all. The forest's reputation for swallowing people keeps the eastern forest belt largely depopulated despite its proximity to multiple settlements.

The existence of Milreun Palace adds another dimension to Milrar's danger. Some believe the palace is the source of the forest's strangeness—that whatever power once resided there infected the land around it. Others believe the palace was built to contain something that still lurks in the forest's depths. Both groups agree on one thing: Milrar Forest is not natural, and Milreun Palace is why.
