## Wildwood

Tags: forest, geography, orc

The Wildwood is the vast forested region that dominates the eastern Westwilds, stretching from the mountain passes of Vogenfeld in the south to the great lakes in the north. Outsiders call the entire region "Hedroscobb" after the orc state that controls its southern reaches, but the orcs themselves know it as a land of six nations, endless war, and waters that can heal the dying.

### Geography

The Wildwood covers roughly 400 miles north to south and 300 miles east to west—an ocean of ancient forest broken by rivers, lakes, swamps, and occasional clearings. The Grand Tolkarsus river system is its lifeblood, flowing from the Nirvanis Mountains in the northeast, southwest through the heart of orc territory, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake and beyond.

**Southern Wildwood:** Dense temperate forest with ironwood groves. This is Hedroscobb proper—the largest and most aggressive of the orc states. The terrain is rugged, with steep ravines and hidden valleys where the Hedroscobbi forge their terrible armor.

**Central Wildwood:** The forest transitions to wetter ground as the Tolkarsus spreads into marshes and flood plains. Tarn controls the river and the Plenjorn Swamp—the source of the healing waters that every power in the region covets. Glivornax, to the west, fights Tarn for access. The Yugurbas Dyos—a contested swamp-meadow transitional zone—lies between Hedroscobb and Glivornax to the south, and blood has been spilled over it for generations.

**Northern Wildwood:** The Ryunimir Forest in the northwest is the domain of the Uhionai—older, stranger, with trees that were once orcs and orcs that will become trees. To the northeast, the lake-dotted hills of Grieb territory stretch toward Cykravikus Lake, where the aquatic Griebi fish their cold waters and answer to their hag queen.

**Eastern Edge:** Where the forest thins into the Steppe of Aziirn, the Shazuihni boar riders make their camps. They're not truly a forest people—they're raiders who use the forest as cover for their endless attacks on everyone else.

### The Six States

The Wildwood is divided among six major orc nations:

| State | Territory | Character |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Hedroscobb** | Southern Wildwood | Largest, most aggressive; master smiths who forge corrosive algae-iron armor |
| **Glivornax** | Northwestern Wildwood | Most diplomatically sophisticated; fights for healing water access |
| **Tarn** | North-central, on the Tolkarsus | Spirit warriors; controls Plenjorn Swamp and the healing waters |
| **Uhionai** | Far northwest, Ryunimir Forest | Tree-bonded orcs who become trees when they die and can be reborn |
| **Grieb** | Northeastern lakes | Aquatic orcs ruled by a hag queen; universally avoided |
| **Shazuihn** | Eastern forest edge | Boar-riding raiders who attack everything that moves |

### The Conflict Web

The six states have warred among themselves for as long as anyone remembers. The current conflicts:

**Hedroscobb vs. Glivornax:** The War of the Marshes. The Hedroscobbi need specific swamp algae to forge their signature armor—and the richest beds lie in Yugurbas Dyos, on the border with Glivornax. The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of all the Tolkarsus watershed. This isn't a border skirmish; it's existential for both sides.

**Hedroscobb vs. Shazuihn:** The Eternal Raid. The Shazuihni attack from the east constantly—not for territory, but for plunder, slaves, and glory. The Hedroscobbi bleed for it year after year.

**Shazuihn vs. Tarn:** The boar riders also raid Tarn's river territory. The Tarni spirit warriors are hard to kill quickly, which makes raids costly, but the Shazuihni keep coming.

**Glivornax vs. Tarn:** The Water War. Tarn controls Plenjorn Swamp and its miraculous healing waters; Glivornax fights for access. The Tarni attack with spirit weapons that damage the soul itself; the Glivornaxi use terrain knowledge and defensive formations. Neither can defeat the other outright.

**Uhionai vs. Tarn:** Occasional border conflicts where the Ryunimir Forest meets Tarni territory. Neither side truly wants this war—the Uhionai need their sacred groves, and Tarn's focus is on the river—but young warriors prove themselves and sometimes it escalates.

**Grieb vs. Nobody:** The Griebi's lake territory is valuable, but fighting aquatic orcs is a nightmare—needle teeth, underwater ambushes, enemies who vanish into the depths and wait for days. The casualties aren't worth it. Everyone learned that lesson generations ago.

### The Orc Moot

Despite constant warfare, the six states maintain a loose confederation through the Orc Moot—irregular gatherings where grievances are aired, truces negotiated, and occasionally, collective threats addressed. The Moot has no binding authority; attendance is voluntary and agreements last only as long as they're convenient.

Still, the Moot represents the possibility of unity. If the orcs ever stopped fighting each other—if someone ever united the six states—their combined strength would overwhelm Tarkhon's northern defenses. The Vogenfeld dwarves watch for any sign of this nightmare scenario.

### Why It Matters

The Wildwood is a powder keg. The constant orc warfare has protected Tarkhon for centuries, but:

- The healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp are becoming known. Outsiders will come seeking them.
- Something is stirring in the north. Vogenfeld patrols report unusual gatherings, paused conflicts, signs that someone may be attempting to unite the tribes.
- The hag queen of Grieb has ruled for centuries. What does she want? What is she waiting for?
- The dragon Symonair has claimed his lake for millennia. His relationship with the orcs is unclear, but he's watching.

For now, the Wildwood remains a land of perpetual war—brutal, isolated, and dangerous to outsiders. But the balance could shift at any time.
