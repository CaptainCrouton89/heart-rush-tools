## Hellion Hills

Tags: hills, wurmspine, ley lines, fire, geography

The Hellion Hills mark the northwestern terminus of the Wurmspine range, where the great mountain chain fragments into a chaotic jumble of volcanic peaks, smoking vents, and treacherous ravines. The fire ley line cuts directly through this region, and the land shows it—the hills run hot, the air tastes of sulfur, and the ground itself seems to simmer.

The name isn't metaphorical. These hills are hell to cross.

### Geography

The Hellion Hills stretch roughly twenty miles east to west, forming a natural barrier between the Westwilds proper and the more hospitable Wurmspine territories to the south. To the east lies the Guiles, a dense forest that provides the only significant shade in the region. To the south, the hills descend into Kobuk, where the Coghead goblins have made their refuge.

The terrain is brutal: sharp volcanic rock, unstable slopes, sudden fissures that vent superheated steam without warning. The fire ley line keeps the ground temperature elevated year-round—snow never settles here, even in the deepest winter. In summer, the hills become genuinely dangerous; heatstroke claims unprepared travelers before the terrain does.

Scattered throughout are remnants of old volcanic activity: obsidian flows, collapsed lava tubes, and hot springs that range from pleasantly warm to instantly fatal. The hills don't actively erupt—the fire ley line keeps the energy diffuse rather than explosive—but they smolder constantly, and new vents open without warning.

### Hermelia's Lair

Near the center of the Hellion Hills, built into the side of a collapsed volcanic cone, lies the ruin known as Hermelia's Lair. This is where the infamous fire-and-air mage met her end, and the site still bears the marks of her power.

#### The Mage

Hermelia grew up in Shtaneres, a city in Breia, where she developed tremendous skill in fire and air magic. Something happened—the records are unclear, possibly deliberately destroyed—and she burned Shtaneres to the ground before fleeing. She made her way to the Hellion Hills, presumably drawn by the fire ley line, and constructed her lair in the volcanic landscape that suited her nature.

How she died remains uncertain. The lair shows signs of violence, but whether she was killed by hunters, betrayed by allies, or consumed by her own magic, no one knows. Her body was never found. The fire ley line may have taken it.

#### The Ruins

The lair itself is a series of chambers carved into volcanic rock, reinforced with fire-resistant materials and warded with magic that still partially functions decades later. The outer chambers have collapsed or been picked clean by scavengers. The inner chambers remain sealed—not by rubble, but by magical barriers that burn anyone who touches them.

What Hermelia kept in those chambers is unknown. Spellbooks, certainly. Research notes on fire magic. Possibly artifacts she stole from Shtaneres before burning it. The barriers suggest she intended to return, or that something inside is too dangerous to let out.

Treasure hunters occasionally attempt the lair. Most turn back at the barriers. The few who've found ways through haven't returned to report what they found.

#### Fire Echoes

The area immediately around the lair exhibits strange phenomena: flames that burn in patterns matching old conversations, heat mirages that show events from the past, and air currents that carry whispered words in Hermelia's voice. These "fire echoes" are probably magical residue from her decades of work here, imprinted on the ley line itself.

Some scholars believe the echoes contain fragments of her knowledge—that watching them carefully could teach fire magic techniques she developed. Others think they're traps, designed to lure the curious into dangerous areas. Both may be true.

### Inhabitants

Few things live in the Hellion Hills by choice.

**Fire Drakes**: Small, aggressive, and territorial. They hunt in the cooler hours of dawn and dusk, preying on anything they can catch. The ley line energy keeps their populations high despite the harsh conditions.

**Ash Crawlers**: Insectoid creatures that burrow through volcanic soil, emerging to feed on anything organic that dies in the heat. They're not dangerous individually, but they swarm corpses within hours.

**Fugitives**: The hills' reputation keeps most people away, which makes them attractive to those who don't want to be found. Criminals, exiles, and the occasional hermit scratch out existences in the few habitable spots, trading the dangers of the terrain for the danger of civilization.

### Travel

Crossing the Hellion Hills is possible but inadvisable. The terrain is treacherous, the heat is punishing, and the only reliable water sources are the hot springs (which require careful testing—some are drinkable, some will dissolve flesh).

Those who must cross typically hire guides from Kobuk's Coghead goblins, who know the hills well enough to avoid the worst hazards. The goblins charge steeply for this service and accept no responsibility if clients ignore their advice.

The fire ley line can be traced through the hills by following the hottest ground—useful for mages seeking to tap its power, dangerous for everyone else. Walking the ley line means walking through the most geothermally active areas, where the ground may give way without warning.
