## Desendrum Mountains

Tags: hills, mountains, geography

A rugged north-south ridge in the central Westwilds, the Desendrum range marks the transition between the forested west and the open plains to the east. Despite the name "mountains," the Desendrum are modest by Alarian standards—more accurately described as a highland spine of worn peaks and steep-sided valleys. Locals call them the Desendrum Hills with equal frequency.

### Geography

The Desendrum stretch roughly 120 miles from the Grelli Hills in the north to the approaches of Grieb territory in the south. The range averages 20-30 miles wide, with peaks reaching 3,000-4,000 feet—high enough to catch weather and channel winds, but low enough that determined travelers can cross at many points.

**The Spine**: The central ridge is rocky and exposed, a weathered backbone of ancient stone that has resisted the erosion that smoothed the surrounding terrain. Local legend claims the Spine is the skeleton of a dead titan, which accounts for its unnatural straightness.

**The West Face**: The slopes facing the Walking Forest are heavily forested—overflow from the migrating woods. These forests are technically part of the Walking Forest's peripheral movement, though they shift more slowly than the core territory.

**The East Face**: The eastern slopes are dryer, transitioning to the grasslands that eventually become the Steppe of Aziirn. Scrub brush and hardy grasses predominate.

### Passages

Several routes cross the Desendrum, though none are easy:

**The Shepherd's Gap**: The widest and most-traveled passage, roughly midway along the range. Traders moving between Grieb and the western territories use this route, though it adds days to any journey.

**The High Trail**: A narrow path along the Spine itself, passable only in summer. Faster than circumnavigation but dangerous—exposure and rockfall claim several travelers each year.

**The Runoff Cuts**: Seasonal streams have carved several narrow valleys through the range. These are passable when dry but become deadly torrents during spring melt or heavy rains.

### Inhabitants

**The Ridge Clans**: Small human communities who've lived in the Desendrum for generations, subsisting on hunting, herding, and guiding travelers through the passes. They maintain a strict neutrality between the orc states to the south and the human settlements to the north.

**Harpy Colonies**: The exposed peaks of the Spine host several harpy nesting sites. The harpies are territorial but not inherently hostile—they'll tolerate travelers who keep moving but attack anyone who lingers near their roosts.

### Climate

The Desendrum create their own weather patterns, forcing moisture from westerly winds to fall as rain on the western slopes while the east stays dry. Winters are harsh at elevation, with snow blocking the passes from late autumn to mid-spring.

### Why It Matters

The Desendrum are a natural barrier that shapes trade, migration, and politics throughout the central Westwilds. They separate the Walking Forest's influence from the eastern plains, channel travel through predictable routes, and provide refuge for those who want to avoid the orc states' attention.
