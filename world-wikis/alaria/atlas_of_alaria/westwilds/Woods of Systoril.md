## Woods of Systoril

Tags: forest, geography

A dense, dark coastal forest east of Melodia and south of the Piktiniti Desert. The Woods of Systoril have a reputation for strangeness that keeps most travelers away—and those who enter often report experiences they struggle to explain.

### The Name

Systoril was a Postronamas scholar-queen who, according to fragmentary records, refused to participate in the deep-crystal experiments that ultimately destroyed her civilization. When the madness began spreading through the resonance network, she gathered her followers—scholars, dissidents, those who had warned against pushing too deep—and led them into exile.

They entered this forest and were never seen again.

Whether Systoril died here, founded a hidden civilization, or became something else entirely is unknown. But the forest bears her name, and has for millennia.

### The Watchfulness

The Woods of Systoril feel *aware*.

Not hostile—travelers who enter with benign intentions report no direct threats. But watched. Observed. The sensation of attention following you through the trees is constant and unmistakable. The forest seems to notice you, to consider you, to make decisions about whether you belong.

Paths through the woods shift—not dramatically, not while you're watching, but a trail that led east yesterday may curve south today. Landmarks relocate. Travelers find themselves guided: toward the coast if they're heading that direction, away from certain clearings, toward or away from the forest's heart depending on something no outsider has identified.

Some say the forest is testing visitors. Others say it's protecting something. A few claim Systoril herself—or what she became—is the intelligence behind the watchfulness.

### What's Inside

No one knows for certain.

The forest's heart has never been mapped. Expeditions that go too deep either turn back (finding themselves inexplicably returned to the forest's edge) or don't return at all. The few who claim to have reached the interior describe impossible things: towers made of living wood, clearings lit by no visible source, figures in the distance who vanish when approached.

Perhaps there is a hidden civilization here—Systoril's descendants, masters of subtle forest magic who simply don't want to be found. Perhaps Systoril herself remains in some form, her consciousness distributed through the trees like the Postronamas crystal-network but organic, gentle, protective. Perhaps the forest has simply become strange through isolation and time, and the "watchfulness" is travelers' imaginations filling in patterns.

The truth remains a mystery—and the Woods of Systoril seem content to keep it that way.

### The Edges

At its borders, the Woods of Systoril are ordinary enough. The trees are dense, the undergrowth thick, the wildlife abundant. Hunters and foragers from coastal communities work the edges, careful not to go too deep. They've learned the signs that suggest the forest wants them to leave: paths that loop back on themselves, the feeling of being observed intensifying, animals going silent.

Those who heed the warnings find the forest cooperative. Those who don't... usually emerge eventually, days later, miles from where they expected, with gaps in their memory and no desire to return.

### Rumors

The coastal villages near the Woods of Systoril trade in stories:

- That on certain nights, lights can be seen deep within the forest, moving in patterns too regular to be natural.
- That the forest has never been successfully burned—fires set at its edge simply go out.
- That travelers who enter with violent intentions are found days later, alive but mind-blank, unable to remember their own names.
- That occasionally, someone emerges from the deep woods carrying gifts—rare herbs, worked artifacts of unknown make, books in no known language—with no memory of who gave them these things.

Whether any of these stories are true, the locals believe them. And they treat the Woods of Systoril with careful respect.
