## Symonair Lake

Tags: lake, geography, dragon

A deep, cold lake in the Wildwood's lake system, connected to Cykravikus Lake to the north. The lake is named for its inhabitant—the ancient blue dragon Symonair, who has claimed these waters for longer than any orc state has existed.

### Geography

Symonair Lake is smaller than Cykravikus but significantly deeper. Its waters are dark, cold, and still—unusually so. Even on windy days, the surface barely ripples. The lake connects to Cykravikus through a series of channels and eventually drains into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

The shores are forested but largely uninhabited. The orc states avoid building here. Travelers pass through quickly. Fishermen do not fish these waters.

### The Dragon

Symonair is a blue dragon—patient, water-attuned, and inscrutably deceptive. He dwells in underwater caverns beneath the lake, in chambers no surface dweller has ever seen. His presence is rarely visible, but everyone in the region knows he is there. Occasionally, travelers report a massive shadow moving beneath the surface, too large to be any natural creature.

Those who enter the lake without permission do not return. This is not legend—it is consistent fact across centuries of recorded history. Fishing boats, adventurers, war-parties pursuing enemies into the waters—all have vanished.

### The Balance

Symonair Lake and Cykravikus Lake form a connected system. The Hag Queen rules Cykravikus and the Griebi; Symonair rules his waters alone. The relationship between the dragon and the hag is unknown, but neither has attacked the other in all recorded history.

Some believe they have divided the waters between them—an arrangement of ancient powers that keeps the entire region stable. Others believe they are bound by something deeper, some pact or shared secret from before the orc states existed.

Whatever the truth, the balance holds. Neither the orc states nor any outside power has been willing to test it.

### What Lies Beneath

Rumors persist of Symonair's hoard—treasure accumulated over millennia, resting in underwater caverns beneath the lake. Dragon treasure is always tempting, but the logistics of reaching an underwater lair guarded by an ancient blue dragon who knows every inch of his domain have deterred all but the most foolish.

No expedition has ever returned with treasure. No expedition has ever returned at all.

### Adventure Hooks

- Recover something from the lake bottom (requires surviving Symonair's attention)
- Discover the truth of the dragon-hag relationship
- Negotiate passage across the lake for an urgent mission
- Investigate why the lake's water level has been rising
