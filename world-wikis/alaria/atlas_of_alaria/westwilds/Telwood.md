## Telwood

Tags: forest, geography

The southernmost of the three eastern forests, Telwood lies between Milrar Forest to the north and the Grieb Lakes region to the southwest. Unlike its mysterious northern neighbor, Telwood is thoroughly mapped, frequently traveled, and historically significant—it was the site of the first diplomatic contact between the expanding orc states and the human settlements of the northern Westwilds.

### Geography

Telwood covers roughly 40 miles east to west and 25 miles north to south, making it the smallest of the three eastern forests. It is bounded by Milrar Forest to the north, the Steppe of Aziirn to the east, Grieb territory to the southwest, and open plains transitioning toward Tarn territory to the south.

**The Council Clearing**: A large natural meadow near the forest's center where, centuries ago, representatives of seven different peoples met to establish trade agreements and territorial boundaries. The clearing is maintained by periodic burning and is still used for important negotiations.

**The Old Road**: An ancient path running roughly east-west through the forest, marked by stone cairns placed so long ago that no one remembers who built them. The road predates the orc states, predates most human settlement in the region, and shows signs of maintenance by hands unknown.

**The South Margin**: Where Telwood transitions into the wetlands approaching Grieb. The trees here are water-tolerant species—willow, alder, water oak—and the ground is frequently soggy.

### History

Telwood's historical significance stems from its position. When the orc states were consolidating centuries ago and expanding human settlements were pushing into the Westwilds, this forest sat at the intersection. Rather than fight over it, the various powers chose to meet here.

**The Telwood Compact**: The agreement reached at the Council Clearing, still nominally in force, established Telwood as neutral territory—no faction claims it, all may pass through peacefully, and disputes are supposed to be resolved through negotiation rather than violence. The compact has been violated numerous times but never officially abandoned.

**The Stone Markers**: Carved stones placed at Telwood's boundaries marking it as neutral ground. Most are weathered beyond reading, but locals know what they represent.

### Inhabitants

**The Wardens**: A loose organization of rangers who maintain Telwood's neutrality. They don't serve any particular power; they serve the forest and the compact. Membership is voluntary, training is informal, and authority derives purely from reputation. The Wardens escort travelers, mediate disputes, and occasionally remove those who violate the peace.

**The Forest Inns**: Several permanent inns have been established along the Old Road, serving traders, diplomats, and travelers. These are genuinely neutral establishments—violence against guests is met with permanent expulsion, and the Wardens enforce this strictly.

### Climate

Continental temperate, similar to the surrounding region. Telwood's relatively small size and open structure means it doesn't create its own microclimate the way Milrar does.

### Why It Matters

Telwood is a rare thing in the Westwilds: safe, neutral territory where different factions can meet without risking ambush. The Telwood Compact may be old and fraying, but it still provides a framework for diplomacy in a region where diplomacy is otherwise dangerous. Trade routes pass through Telwood specifically because it's safer than alternatives, making the forest economically important despite its modest size.
