## Magma Pits

Tags: ley lines, fire, earth, volcanic, geography, dangerous

The Magma Pits mark the convergence of Alaria's fire and earth ley lines at the eastern edge of Zlyverth Korn, where the Twaan Forests meet the foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains. This is one of the most powerful elemental convergences on the continent—a place where raw magical force has reshaped the land itself.

### The Convergence

Where fire meets earth, the ground bleeds.

The Magma Pits are exactly what the name suggests: open pools of molten rock, exposed to the sky, burning endlessly. Some pools are small, no larger than a cooking pot. Others stretch dozens of yards across, their surfaces roiling with heat that can be felt a hundred paces away. The largest pit—called the Throat by those who've seen it and survived—is said to descend beyond sight, a vertical shaft of liquid fire that pulses like a heartbeat.

The ley line convergence keeps the magma fluid and active. Normal volcanic features would crust over, cool, solidify. These don't. The fire ley line ensures the heat never fades; the earth ley line ensures the stone keeps flowing. The result is a landscape frozen in a moment of volcanic fury, perpetually erupting, perpetually dangerous.

### Geography

The Pits occupy a rough bowl in the terrain, perhaps two miles across, where the forest abruptly ends and bare stone begins. The Burning Corridor feeds into this area from the northwest—fire-trees growing right up to the edge of the scorched zone before the heat becomes too intense even for them.

The ground is a maze of cooled lava flows, razor-sharp obsidian ridges, and treacherous crusts that look solid but collapse into molten pools below. Steam vents hiss and shriek. The air shimmers with heat distortion, making distance and direction impossible to judge. Navigation requires either intimate knowledge of the terrain or a death wish.

The Kharvorn foothills rise to the east, and somewhere in those slopes lies the transition to Gymlstik goblin territory. The goblins don't come here. Whatever understanding they have with the Twaan, the Magma Pits aren't part of it—this place belongs to no one.

### What Lives Here

Not much. The heat alone is lethal to most creatures.

But the elemental convergence draws certain beings:

**Fire Elementals**: Wild, unbound elementals spawn in the larger pits, drawn into existence by the concentrated fire ley energy. They're mindless and aggressive, attacking anything that moves. The Twaan consider them pests.

**Salamanders**: The serpentine fire-creatures hunt in the cooled lava flows, ambushing anything foolish enough to approach the pools. They're not sapient, but they're cunning, and they've learned that two-legged creatures often carry metal (which conducts heat nicely).

**The Ashborn**: Rumors speak of something else in the deepest pits—humanoid figures seen walking through the magma itself, apparently unharmed. The Twaan call them the Ashborn and refuse to discuss them further. Whether they're elementals, cursed mortals, or something else entirely, no one living knows.

### Alchemical Significance

Beyond the fire-trees of the Burning Corridor, the Magma Pits themselves are an alchemist's dream. The elemental convergence produces materials found nowhere else:

**Convergence Stone**: Obsidian formed at the exact point where fire and earth magic meet. It holds enchantments related to both elements far better than normal materials.

**Living Magma**: Molten rock that stays liquid even when removed from the Pits, for a time. Extraordinarily dangerous to transport, extraordinarily valuable for forging.

**Ley Ash**: The powdery residue that collects around the pit edges, created when fire ley energy burns earth ley energy. Used in rituals, enchantments, and very expensive fireworks.

Harvesting any of these requires getting into the Pits and getting out alive. The Twaan control access to the area, and they don't allow unsupervised expeditions. Those few alchemists who've negotiated harvesting rights pay dearly—in gold, in favors, and in the knowledge that the Twaan are watching.

### The Throat

The largest pit. The heart of the convergence.

The Throat is a vertical shaft of magma roughly thirty yards across, its edges perfectly circular—too perfect, some say, to be natural. The molten rock within doesn't simply sit; it pulses, rising and falling in a slow rhythm that takes about a minute to complete. At its peak, the magma nearly breaches the rim. At its nadir, the shaft seems to descend forever.

The Twaan won't go near it. They've placed warnings—stone markers carved with their pictographic script—in a wide circle around the Throat, and they've made it clear that anyone who crosses that boundary is on their own.

What lies at the bottom of the Throat? The theories range from mundane (just more magma) to apocalyptic (a sealed passage to the elemental planes, held closed only by the balanced pressure of the convergence). The Twaan don't speculate. They just stay away.

### Reaching the Pits

There are three approaches:

**Through Twaan Territory**: The most common route, requiring negotiation with the Twaan of Zlyverth Korn. They'll assign guides, set strict limits on where you can go, and charge accordingly. Safest, if you can afford it.

**From Gymlstik**: Theoretically possible to approach from the east through goblin territory, but this means dealing with goblins, Cirthikin, and the treacherous mountain paths before reaching the Pits themselves. No one recommends this.

**From the South**: A longer route through the southern Westwilds, avoiding both Twaan and goblin territory. Requires crossing significant open ground and approaching the Pits from an angle the Twaan don't monitor as closely. Occasionally used by those who don't want the Twaan knowing what they're doing. Usually ends badly.
