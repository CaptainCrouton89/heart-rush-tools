## Hedroscobb

Tags: state, nation, orc

The largest orc state in the Wildwood, controlling the southern forest from Vogenfeld's mountain passes to the Yugurbas Dyos marshes. When outsiders speak of "the orc threat," they usually mean Hedroscobb.

### Geography

Hedroscobb occupies the southern third of the Wildwood—roughly 150 miles north to south and 100 miles east to west of dense temperate forest. The terrain is rugged: steep ravines, hidden valleys, ironwood groves, and rocky outcroppings where the Hedroscobbi have established their forge-complexes.

**The Ironwood Groves:** Ancient stands of iron-hard trees that provide fuel for the forges and material for weapon handles. The groves are considered sacred to the Hedroscobbi—their wood burns hot enough to work algae-iron properly.

**The Slag Halls:** Underground forge complexes beneath the central forest. The great forges never cool. Smoke rises through hidden vents throughout the territory.

**The Acid Gate:** The fortified southern approach, overlooking the passes to Vogenfeld. The dwarves watch from one side; the Hedroscobbi watch from the other.

### Borders

- **South:** Vogenfeld (the dwarven shield-state)
- **North:** Glivornax (hostile; the War of the Marshes over Yugurbas Dyos)
- **Northeast:** Tarn (neutral)
- **East:** Shazuihn (hostile; constant raiding)
- **West:** Plains of Oblivion (no one goes there)

### Climate

Continental temperate—cold winters with heavy snow, warm summers with occasional flooding in the lowlands. The underground forge-complexes maintain comfortable temperatures year-round.

### Why It Matters

Hedroscobb controls the passes between the Wildwood and Tarkhon. If the orcs ever decided to invade the empire, they would come through Hedroscobb. The Vogenfeld dwarves exist specifically to prevent this.

The Hedroscobbi's algae-iron armor makes them the most formidable conventional military force in the Wildwood. Their weakness is their dependence on swamp algae—which is why the War of the Marshes never ends.
