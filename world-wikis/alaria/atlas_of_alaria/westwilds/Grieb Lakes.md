A series of interconnected freshwater lakes in the Westwilds, home to the reclusive Griebi people.

### The Griebi: The Lakemen

The Griebi are a unique subspecies of aquatic orcs with blueish-gray skin adapted for underwater life. They are accomplished hunters and fishers who rarely interact with surface-dwellers and communicate sparingly even among themselves.

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Blueish-gray skin
- Ability to breathe underwater
- Long, needle-like teeth adapted for swimming and catching fish

**Culture & Society:**
- Subsist primarily through hunting and fishing
- Rarely speak, preferring non-verbal communication
- Ruled by a hag queen

The Griebi's terrifying appearance - particularly their needle-like dentition - makes encounters with them unsettling for most surface dwellers, though they are primarily focused on survival rather than aggression.
