## Grieb Lakes

Tags: lake, geography

A series of freshwater lakes in the hills of the northeastern Wildwood, home to the Griebi people. The largest is Cykravikus Lake; smaller lakes dot the surrounding hills.

### Geography

The Grieb Lakes occupy a region of forested hills north of Tarn territory. The terrain is rocky and hilly, with cold, deep lakes filling the valleys between ridges. The land isn't good for farming or logging, and no valuable minerals have been found—which is why no one else bothers with it.

Cykravikus Lake is the largest, with multiple inlets extending into the hills. It connects southward to Symonair Lake (claimed by the dragon of the same name) and eventually to Phyndarr Sound.

### The Griebi

The Griebi are aquatic orcs—they can breathe underwater, which makes them excellent fishers and divers. They have blueish-gray skin and rows of needle-like teeth adapted for catching fish.

**Settlements:** The Griebi build along the lakeshores, with structures extending partially into the shallows. They fish, gather lake plants, and keep largely to themselves.

**Communication:** The Griebi rarely speak above water, preferring gestures and expressions. Underwater, they communicate through clicks and tones. Surface dwellers find them unnervingly quiet.

**The Hag Queen:** An ancient figure who rules the Griebi from Cykravikus Lake. She's been there longer than anyone remembers. The Griebi serve her without question.

### Why Nobody Bothers Them

The Grieb Lakes offer nothing the other orc states want. No algae beds. No healing waters. No strategic passes. Just cold lakes in rocky hills.

The Griebi themselves are unsettling to fight—needle teeth, ability to retreat into water, patience to wait out any siege—but the main reason for peace is simpler: there's nothing here worth fighting over.
