## Ezra's Temptation

Tags: river, geography

A winding river that flows through the eastern portion of Milrar Forest before emerging onto the Steppe of Aziirn, named for a legendary explorer whose story serves as both cautionary tale and local joke.

### The Legend

Ezra was a cartographer and explorer—possibly the same era as Oregeg Tolkarsus, though the stories conflict—who became obsessed with mapping Milrar Forest's interior. Other cartographers gave up after getting lost; Ezra refused. He followed this particular river upstream, reasoning that rivers lead somewhere and would at least keep him from walking in circles.

The river did lead somewhere: deeper and deeper into Milrar, past the old growth, past the familiar, past anything previously mapped. Ezra kept following it, convinced the source would reveal something important—the forest's heart, a hidden civilization, ancient ruins, something.

He was never seen again.

Local tradition holds that the river was Ezra's "temptation"—the false promise of discovery that led him to his doom. Some say he still follows the river somewhere in Milrar's depths, endlessly walking upstream. Others say the river has no source at all, just spirals inward forever, and Ezra realized this too late.

### Geography

Ezra's Temptation rises somewhere in Milrar Forest's interior—the exact source is unknown, for obvious reasons. The river flows generally southeast, emerging from the forest roughly 20 miles north of where Milrar borders Telwood, then continuing onto the Steppe of Aziirn where it eventually loses itself in the dry grassland.

**The Forest Course**: Within Milrar, the river is surprisingly clear and cold—deeper than expected, flowing between banks of moss-covered stone. The forest canopy closes over it in places, creating tunnel-like passages. Following the river upstream is easy for the first few miles. Then the forest closes in.

**The Emergence**: Where the river leaves Milrar, it passes through a distinctive gap in the forest—a narrow canyon where the trees can't grow. This is one of the few places where the forest has a definite edge rather than a gradual transition.

**The Steppe Course**: Once on the steppe, Ezra's Temptation slows and spreads, its water absorbed by the thirsty grassland. During dry seasons, the river disappears entirely within a few miles of leaving the forest; in wet years, it might reach as far as the Grand Tolkarsus watershed.

### Use

**The Safe Way**: For those who must enter Milrar, Ezra's Temptation offers a navigation aid—follow the river in, follow it out. As long as you don't follow it too far in, this works. The problem is knowing when "too far" begins.

**Water Source**: The river provides reliable water along the forest-steppe border, making it a gathering point for travelers, herders, and wildlife. A small trading camp has grown up near the Emergence.

**The Warning**: Local guides use Ezra's story to warn overconfident travelers. "Don't follow it past the third fork," they say, or "turn back at the black rock." Whether these landmarks exist or are just invented to make the warning memorable is unclear.

### Why It Matters

Ezra's Temptation is a minor river with an outsized reputation. Its story embodies the Westwilds' character: here, curiosity can kill, and the land doesn't care about your maps or your ambitions. The river is useful—water, navigation, trade point—but the name reminds everyone that usefulness has limits.
