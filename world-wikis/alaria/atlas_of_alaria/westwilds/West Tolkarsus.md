## West Tolkarsus

Tags: river, geography

The northern tributary of the Grand Tolkarsus river system, the West Tolkarsus flows from the highlands north of the Westwilds, passing through the Homdrum Hills before joining with other waterways to form the larger river that eventually reaches the Grieb Lakes and Plenjorn Swamp.

### Course

The West Tolkarsus originates in the unnamed hills north of the Grelli Hills, flowing generally southeast through progressively lower terrain:

**The Upper Reaches**: The river begins as multiple streams gathering in the northern highlands, cold and clear from snowmelt. This section is largely inaccessible—no settlements, few travelers, and terrain too rough for easy passage.

**The Homdrum Passage**: The river curves through the northeastern Homdrum Hills, carving a shallow valley that provides the main route through this otherwise trackless region. The water here is slower, warmer, and muddier—it's picking up sediment from the surrounding hills.

**The Pystinwood Fork**: Near the northern edge of Pystinwood, the West Tolkarsus receives several smaller streams from the forest. The water here takes on a faintly sweet taste from pystin sap leaching into the tributary streams.

**The Confluence**: The West Tolkarsus eventually joins with streams flowing from the Desendrum range and the eastern watershed, forming the upper Grand Tolkarsus that flows southwest toward Tarn territory.

### Character

The West Tolkarsus is not a major river by Alarian standards—perhaps 50-100 feet wide through most of its course, shallow enough to ford in many places during dry season. What makes it significant is its role as a navigation aid and travel route through otherwise difficult terrain.

**Seasonal Variation**: Spring snowmelt turns the West Tolkarsus into a dangerous torrent; late summer reduces it to a series of connected pools. The best travel season is early autumn, when water levels are low but consistent.

**Naming**: The river was named by the cartographer Oregeg Tolkarsus, who traced the entire Grand Tolkarsus system from source to outlet. He named the western tributary for its position relative to his route, though locals had called it by other names for generations.

### Use

**Travel Route**: Traders and travelers use the West Tolkarsus valley as a path through the Homdrum Hills and toward the northern Westwilds. The riverbank provides landmarks, water, and a general sense of direction that the featureless hills otherwise lack.

**Fishing**: The river supports populations of various fish species, providing food for the sparse communities along its banks. The pystin-flavored water near the Pystinwood Fork produces fish with an unusual taste—prized by some, avoided by others.

**Water Access**: In a region where reliable water sources are precious, the West Tolkarsus is important simply for existing. Settlements cluster near it; travelers plan routes around it; conflicts sometimes arise over access to it.

### Why It Matters

The West Tolkarsus connects the northern Westwilds to the orc states in the south—not through traffic (the river isn't navigable for any significant distance) but through the route it enables. Following the river takes travelers through the Homdrum Hills without getting lost, past the eastern forests without entering them, and eventually toward the trade routes along the Grand Tolkarsus proper.
