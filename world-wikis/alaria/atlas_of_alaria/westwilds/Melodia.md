## Melodia

Tags: forest, geography

A forest on the southern edge of the Piktiniti Desert, spilling down toward the coast where the land becomes less arid. Melodia is named for its most distinctive quality: the trees sing.

### The Music

Melodia is dominated by pipe-willows—a species found nowhere else in Alaria. Their trunks are hollow and resonant, riddled with natural apertures that catch the wind. When air moves through the forest, the trees produce tones: low drones, high whistles, harmonics that shift with wind strength and direction.

On calm days, the forest is silent. On gentle-breeze days, something like music drifts through the trees—melodies that seem almost intentional, chords that resolve in satisfying ways. On stormy days, the forest becomes a cacophony audible for miles: a roaring, discordant symphony that can disorient travelers and even cause physical pain.

The trees aren't conscious. They don't compose. But something about their structure, their spacing, the way their apertures have evolved, creates patterns that the ear interprets as music.

### Origins

The pipe-willows contain trace deposits of twyl crystal in their wood—the same mineral that defines the Piktiniti Desert. This isn't natural. The forest grows along the paths of ancient Postronamas irrigation channels, now dry and buried. Whatever the Postronamas were doing here—whether deliberately creating a living instrument or simply allowing twyl-enriched water to feed these trees—Melodia is their legacy.

Some scholars believe Melodia was intentional: a Postronamas project to create music through natural resonance, a counterpart to their crystal-powered network. Others think it's an accident—twyl contamination that happened to create something beautiful rather than maddening.

### The Melodians

A small population of forest-dwellers has made Melodia their home—people who've learned to read the forest's music for weather, danger, and mood.

The Melodians are musicians by culture. Singing is sacred; their religious ceremonies are entirely vocal. Silence is spiritually dangerous—a Melodian who cannot sing is considered cursed or dying. They believe the forest's songs carry messages from ancestors, from spirits, from the land itself. Learning to interpret those messages is a lifetime's work.

Many Melodians are Postronamas descendants who fled the crystal-madness and found, in this naturally musical forest, a healthier relationship with resonance. Their culture has fragments of old Postronamas knowledge—techniques for working with twyl, understanding of harmonics—but transformed into something gentler.

### The Sound

For visitors, Melodia is disorienting. The constant music (when there's wind) makes conversation difficult. The tones can trigger emotional responses—melancholy on minor-key days, elation when the harmonics align into major progressions. Some travelers report vivid dreams or recovered memories after spending time in Melodia.

The Melodians say the forest responds to those within it. Whether this is literally true or simply projection, travelers often feel that Melodia's music reflects their own emotional states.

### Resources

Pipe-willow wood is valuable for musical instruments—its resonance properties are unmatched. But harvesting it requires Melodian permission (they consider the trees semi-sacred) and careful technique (cutting a pipe-willow wrong produces a shriek that can deafen).

The forest also contains unique herbs and fungi that grow nowhere else, possibly influenced by twyl in the soil. Alchemists pay well for Melodian botanicals.
