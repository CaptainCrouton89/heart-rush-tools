## Jüt

Tags: city, state, port, geography

A port city of roughly twenty thousand people positioned on Kettle Bay, where the Westwilds coast meets the sea. Jüt is the region's window to the outside world—the only significant harbor on this stretch of coastline, and the place where the Westwilds' strange goods reach the broader markets.

### Role

Jüt survives by being useful to everyone.

The city sits at a crossroads: Seyiki merchants bring pillar-crystals and dragonfly chitin down from the desert. Melodian traders arrive with resonant wood and rare botanicals. Lacirean caravans—making the long, careful journey through the Walking Forest and Tenekee Woods—carry spring water and Grayl-amber worth fortunes. Ships from the Western Isles bring metal, textiles, luxury goods, and everything else the land-locked interior can't produce.

Jüt doesn't produce much itself. It's a city of warehouses, trading houses, hostels, and middlemen. The locals joke that Jüt's main export is convenience.

### Character

Rough, pragmatic, polyglot.

The streets of Jüt echo with half a dozen languages. Gnomes bargain with orcs bargain with human sailors bargain with whoever else has washed up this week. The architecture is functional—stone and timber, built to withstand salt air and the occasional storm, not to impress. The wealthy merchants live in fortified compounds; everyone else makes do.

Crime is present but managed. The Jüt Council—a rotating body of the city's most successful trading houses—maintains order through a combination of paid militia, negotiated truces, and pragmatic tolerance. Violence is bad for business; everyone knows this. But theft, smuggling, and sharp dealing are facts of life.

The city has a reputation for accepting anyone. Criminals fleeing justice elsewhere find Jüt willing to overlook their pasts, as long as they behave locally and have something to offer. This makes Jüt cosmopolitan in ways that more "civilized" cities aren't—and dangerous in ways they aren't either.

### The Cliffs

Jüt is built into the base of the Cliffs of Shondromos—a dramatic wall of pale limestone rising from the sea to the east. The cliffs provide shelter from storms and a natural barrier against landward attack. The harbor itself is carved from a natural inlet where the cliffs recede.

The cliff face is riddled with caves at waterline. Officially, these belong to the city. Unofficially, smugglers have used them for generations, and the militia engages in endless cat-and-mouse with operators who know the cave systems better than any guard.

### Defenses

Being the only port means Jüt is everyone's target.

Pirates from the Western Isles raid when they think the city is weak. Orc warbands from the interior occasionally decide that raiding is easier than trading. Desperate communities—pillar-settlements that had a bad locust season, forest villages displaced by the Walking Forest's movement—sometimes arrive not as traders but as threats.

Jüt's response is layered:

**The Militia:** Well-funded, well-equipped, and experienced. Service in the militia is prestigious—it's one of the few paths to citizenship for outsiders.

**The Walls:** Landward, Jüt is fortified. The walls aren't massive, but they're solid, and the cliff at the city's back means attackers can only approach from limited directions.

**Protection Payments:** Jüt pays tribute in multiple directions. To the orc states that could overwhelm them if united. To certain Western Isles captains who guarantee safe passage for Jüt-flagged ships. To whoever else needs paying this year. It's expensive, but cheaper than war.

**Naval Power:** Jüt maintains a small but capable fleet—enough to discourage casual piracy and escort valuable shipments through dangerous waters.

### Trade Goods

What flows through Jüt:

**From Seyiki:** Twyl crystal fragments, dragonfly chitin, locust products (flour, oil, dried insects), Postronamas artifacts (rare and valuable)

**From Melodia:** Pipe-willow wood, unique botanicals, Melodian crafts

**From Lacire:** Waters of Vyowehr, Grayl-amber, Walking Forest herbs, guidance services

**From the Western Isles:** Metal (especially iron and steel), textiles, spices, luxury goods, weapons, slaves (technically illegal but widely practiced)

**From the Orc States:** Furs, worked leather, gemstones from Ruby Rock (cursed, buyer beware), mercenary contracts

### The Kettle

Kettle Bay itself is a broad, sheltered inlet—natural harbor formed where the coastline curves inward. The "kettle" name comes from the bay's shape and the way storms can trap ships inside, churning the water.

The bay's waters are productive fishing grounds, and Jüt's fishing fleet is substantial. Salted fish is one of the few goods Jüt actually produces rather than just trading.

### Governance

The Jüt Council consists of representatives from the twelve most powerful trading houses, rotating through leadership positions on an annual basis. Decisions require majority agreement; controversial matters require supermajority.

The system is corrupt, factional, and inefficient—but it works. The trading houses have too much to lose from instability to let disputes escalate into violence. Deadlocks are resolved through negotiation, bribery, or occasionally strategic assassination (though the last is considered gauche).

Citizenship in Jüt is tied to property ownership or guild membership. Non-citizens can live and work in the city but have no political voice—which suits most traders fine, since they're not staying anyway.
