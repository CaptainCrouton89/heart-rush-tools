## Uhionai

Tags: state, nation, orc

The far northwestern orc state, occupying the ancient Ryunimir Forest. The Uihonaii are the tree-bound orcs—they become trees when they die and can be reborn from their wooden forms. Their territory is less a nation and more a living graveyard of ancestors.

### Geography

Uhionai occupies the Ryunimir Forest—a dense, ancient woodland in the far northwest of the Wildwood. The forest is old, the trees massive, and the canopy so thick that little sunlight reaches the floor. Throughout the forest, clearings mark the sacred groves where the Reborn sleep.

**The First Grove:** The oldest sacred site, where the earliest Reborn took root centuries ago. Forbidden to outsiders.

**Waking Hollow:** Where trees on the verge of reawakening are tended. Strange whispers and half-heard voices fill the air.

**The Boundary Oaks:** Ancient trees along the southern border marking where Uhionai territory begins. Crossing them without permission is considered an act of war.

**The Speaking Glade:** Where the Grove Council meets and where outsiders may petition for audience.

### Borders

- **South/Southeast:** Tarn (occasional friction)
- **East:** Grieb (minimal contact)
- **North:** Unclaimed wilderness, eventually the Northlands
- **West:** More forest, eventually the Walking Forest

### Climate

Continental temperate, moderated by the forest. Winters are cold but the ancient trees break the wind; summers are cool beneath the canopy. The sacred groves maintain unusual warmth year-round—something about the Reborn's presence.

### Why It Matters

The Uihonaii are the oldest orc presence in the Wildwood. Their Reborn carry memories across centuries—First Root Yorunax remembers events from before the other orc states existed. Weapons carved from their sacred wood are sentient and extraordinarily powerful.

They take the long view on everything. They've watched empires rise and fall. They're patient because they have to be.
