## Grand Tolkarsus

Tags: river, geography

The longest river in the Westwilds, the Grand Tolkarsus stretches from the Nirvanis Mountains (part of the Kharvorn range) in the northeast, flowing southwest through orcish territory, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and the Deadwalk desert, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake. The lake connects to Symonair Lake, which empties into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

Named after the famed cartographer and explorer Oregeg Tolkarsus, who traveled its entire length and recorded his journey in meticulous detail.

### Course

**The Upper Tolkarsus**: The river begins as snowmelt streams in the Nirvanis Mountains, gathering strength as it descends toward the Westwilds. The upper river is cold, fast, and largely inaccessible—only mountain goats and the most determined travelers navigate these reaches.

**The West Tolkarsus**: A major northern tributary that joins the main river in the central Westwilds. The West Tolkarsus flows from highlands north of the Grelli Hills, through the Homdrum Hills, and past the eastern forests before merging with the Grand Tolkarsus. See separate entry.

**The Middle Tolkarsus**: The river's middle section flows through the orc states—passing through Tarn territory, skirting Glivornax, and defining the eastern edge of Grieb's influence. This is where the river is most used: for fishing, for transportation, for the miraculous healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp.

**The Steppe Crossing**: The Grand Tolkarsus crosses the southern Steppe of Aziirn, its valley the only green corridor through the dry grassland. Travel across the steppe follows the river; there is no other practical route.

**The Lower Tolkarsus**: The final stretch flows through increasingly marshy terrain before reaching Cykravikus Lake. The river slows here, spreading into multiple channels through wetland and floodplain.

### Significance

**The Lifeline**: The Grand Tolkarsus makes the central Westwilds habitable. Its water sustains the orc states, enables agriculture where the climate otherwise wouldn't allow it, and supports the ecosystems that provide food and resources. Without the river, the region would be desert.

**The Trade Route**: While not navigable for large vessels through its entire length, the Grand Tolkarsus serves as a transport corridor. Goods move along its banks; ferries cross at strategic points; and the river's course determines where settlements develop.

**The Healing Waters**: Within Plenjorn Swamp, the river's waters possess miraculous healing properties—able to cure even life-threatening injuries. Tarn controls this stretch fiercely, making the healing waters one of the most valuable resources in the Westwilds.

### Oregeg Tolkarsus

The cartographer who gave the river its name was a human explorer of the late imperial period who devoted decades to mapping the Westwilds. His survey of the Grand Tolkarsus—from mountain source to final outlet—took three years and nearly killed him twice. The resulting maps remained the most accurate available for centuries.

Tolkarsus's journals describe encounters with orc clans, negotiations for passage, and near-disasters in the rapids. He also named the West Tolkarsus tributary for its position relative to his route. The explorer disappeared during a later expedition into the Northlands; his final fate is unknown.

### Why It Matters

The Grand Tolkarsus defines the Westwilds' geography. It determines where settlements can exist, where armies can march, where trade can flow. Control of the river—or access to its waters—drives much of the region's politics. Tarn's power comes from controlling the healing waters; Grieb's isolation comes from being upstream of them; the steppe remains crossable because the river provides water and direction.

For travelers, the Grand Tolkarsus is both guide and goal: follow it and you'll reach civilization; need healing and you'll seek Plenjorn; want to cross the region and you'll use the river as your road.
