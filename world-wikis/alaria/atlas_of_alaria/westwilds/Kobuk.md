## Kobuk

Tags: mountains, wurmspine, goblins, cogheads, geography

Kobuk is a rugged mountain territory in the central Wurmspine range, bounded by the Hellion Hills to the north and the Hills to Nowhere to the south. It is home to the surviving Coghead goblins—refugees from two genocides who have built something remarkable in their exile.

The mountains here are steep and defensible, riddled with natural caves and old mining tunnels. The Cogheads have expanded these into a vast underground complex, combining their legendary engineering with desperate necessity. Kobuk is fortress, factory, and hidden city all at once.

### The Cogheads

The Coghead goblins were once partners with the Echi gnomes of Echea, working the Iri Mountains together in a collaboration that lasted generations. Gnomes provided elemental magic; goblins provided mechanical genius. Together they built wonders.

Then came the first massacre, two centuries ago. The partnership ended in blood. The Cogheads were driven from Echea, scattered across the continent. Some found refuge in Kobuk.

Fifty years ago came the second genocide. Echea decided to finish what they'd started. Every Coghead within reach was hunted down and killed. The Echi don't talk about it. The sealed chambers and abandoned workshops in the Iri Mountains tell the story they'd prefer to forget.

The survivors in Kobuk are what remains. Perhaps three thousand goblins, maybe fewer—they don't share population figures with outsiders. They've had fifty years to dig in, build up, and prepare for the day Echea decides to try again.

### Geography

Kobuk occupies a stretch of the Wurmspine roughly thirty miles north to south, characterized by steep-sided valleys, narrow passes, and peaks that reach above the treeline. The surface appears inhospitable—bare rock, thin soil, little vegetation—but this is by design. The Cogheads have made the surface deliberately uninviting, concentrating their civilization underground.

The northern border with the Hellion Hills is marked by increasing volcanic activity and rising temperatures. The Cogheads maintain watch-posts there, monitoring both the natural hazards and any approach from the north.

To the east lies more Wurmspine territory, eventually leading to Tarkhon-aligned lands. To the west, the mountains give way to the Westwilds and Twaan Forest territory. The southern border descends into the Hills to Nowhere—remote highlands that provide buffer space but little else.

### The Warrens

Beneath Kobuk's surface lies the Coghead civilization: a network of tunnels, chambers, and underground halls collectively called the Warrens. This is where the goblins live, work, and build.

The Warrens are divided into functional districts:

**The Forges**: Where Coghead engineers continue their ancestors' work, building machinery, weapons, and devices. The forges run constantly, powered by geothermal vents tapped from the Wurmspine's volcanic roots. The heat from the Hellion Hills to the north provides additional energy.

**The Sanctums**: Living quarters, organized by extended family groups. Space is tight but efficiently used—the Cogheads have had generations to optimize underground living.

**The Vaults**: Storage for food, water, materials, and the machines the Cogheads consider too dangerous or valuable to keep in active use. Access is tightly controlled.

**The Deeps**: Tunnels that extend far below the main Warrens, into rock that predates the Wurmspine. The Cogheads mine here, extracting metals and minerals for their forges. They've found other things in the Deeps as well—old ruins, strange crystals, sealed chambers they've chosen not to open.

### Griznak's Heart

At the center of the Warrens lies Griznak's Heart—the Cogheads' capital and their most heavily defended position. Named for the chieftain who led the first refugees to Kobuk, the Heart is a vast natural cavern expanded over generations into a functioning city.

#### The Machinery

Unlike the dispersed workshops throughout the Warrens, Griznak's Heart houses the Cogheads' most ambitious projects: massive machines too large to build elsewhere, experimental devices too dangerous to keep near living quarters, and the accumulated archives of Coghead engineering knowledge saved from the genocides.

The centerpiece is the Perpetual Engine—a device of unclear purpose that the Cogheads have kept running since their arrival. Some say it powers the Warrens' ventilation systems. Others claim it's a weapon, primed and waiting. The Cogheads don't explain, and outsiders don't get close enough to examine it.

#### Governance

The Heart serves as the seat of Kobuk's Council of Gears—the governing body of master engineers who make decisions for the community. Meetings are contentious, technical, and conducted in a dialect of Goblin so thick with engineering jargon that even fluent speakers struggle to follow.

The Council doesn't rule so much as coordinate. Coghead society runs on expertise and reputation; the Council's authority extends only as far as their collective competence justifies. Bad decisions get overturned. Good engineers get listened to. It's messy, but it's kept them alive.

#### Defenses

If Kobuk ever falls, Griznak's Heart will be the last holdout. The approaches are trapped, fortified, and designed to collapse on command. The Cogheads have spent fifty years preparing for a siege they expect will eventually come. Every tunnel can become a chokepoint. Every machine can become a weapon. The Heart will not fall easily, and taking it will cost more than it's worth.

### Relations

**With Echea**: Pure, cold hatred. The Cogheads remember both genocides in detail, preserved in their archives and taught to every child. They expect a third attempt and have spent fifty years preparing for it.

**With Tarkhon**: Cautious trade. The empire values Coghead engineering and star-metal goods; the Cogheads value imperial gold and the buffer of Tarkhon-aligned territories between themselves and Echea. Neither side trusts the other, but both benefit.

**With the Twaan**: Practical cooperation. The Twaan Forests border Kobuk to the west, and both peoples share a suspicion of outsiders. They trade occasionally—fire-wood for star-metal tools—and respect each other's boundaries.

**With the Hellion Hills**: The Cogheads monitor the hills carefully. They hire out as guides when the price is right, but they don't claim the territory. The fire ley line makes it too unstable, and Hermelia's Lair still radiates danger. Better to watch from a distance.

### What Travelers Should Know

- The surface of Kobuk is unwelcoming by design. The Cogheads want visitors to feel uncomfortable.
- Entry to the Warrens requires permission from the watch-posts. Attempting to find your own way in is treated as hostile action.
- Trade happens at designated surface markets, not in the Warrens themselves. The Cogheads bring goods up; buyers don't go down.
- Don't mention Echea. Don't ask about the genocides. Don't suggest the Cogheads should "move on" or "forgive." The wounds are fresh, and the Cogheads have long memories.
- Star-metal goods are available but expensive. The Cogheads set prices; negotiation is limited. Take it or leave it.
