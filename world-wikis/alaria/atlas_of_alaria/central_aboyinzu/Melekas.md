## Melekas the Stillbound

Tags: dragon, creature, ruler

Melekas is an ancient dragon who rules the state of Kadroka from the capital city of Ponoigari—though "rules" understates the complexity of the situation. For nearly eight hundred years, Melekas has been paralyzed from the neck down, fused with the bedrock beneath the city, unable to fly, walk, or leave the spot where the dragon landed after a catastrophic encounter with the Agony Stones.

### The Stillbinding

Around 800 years ago, Melekas flew to investigate the Agony Stones—a vast region of strange, contorted rock formations in the southern reaches of what is now Tythikerys. The dragon landed on the largest formation to examine it more closely. That was a mistake.

The stone *reached back*.

Petrification raced up the dragon's legs before Melekas could tear free. The dragon barely managed to take flight, but the curse—or infection, or sympathy-bond, scholars still argue—had already spread through most of the body. Melekas made it back to the settlement that would become Ponoigari and has been rooted there ever since.

### Present State

Melekas's body is fused with the bedrock beneath the capital. The dragon's immense form—several hundred feet from tail to snout—now serves as the foundation for the palace complex and surrounding government district. Only the head, neck, and one foreleg retain mobility. The scales have taken on a grey-stone cast that wasn't there before, and the line where living tissue meets petrified flesh creeps imperceptibly higher each decade.

The dragon can still breathe fire. Still think. Still speak in a voice that rattles windows across the city. But Melekas cannot fly, cannot walk, cannot project physical power beyond the reach of neck and flame.

The petrification continues to spread. Slowly—a few inches per decade—but inexorably. Melekas has perhaps four or five centuries before the head goes still. The dragon knows this. Everyone in Kadroka knows this.

### The Palace of the Stillbound

The royal palace is built *around* and *upon* the dragon's immobile body. Petitioners approach the living head while standing on the dragon's petrified flank. Audience chambers are carved into the spaces between frozen limbs. The dragon's one mobile foreleg occasionally gestures during conversation, a reminder that this is not a statue but a living ruler trapped in stone.

The architecture has evolved over centuries to accommodate both the dragon's needs and the practical requirements of governance. Heating systems draw from the dragon's body heat. Drainage channels redirect the occasional gout of flame. The throne room is simply the space before Melekas's face, with the dragon's eye—each larger than a wagon wheel—providing illumination and, some say, lie detection.

### Personality and Rule

Eight centuries of forced immobility have transformed Melekas from a creature of physical dominance into one of pure political cunning. The dragon who once ruled through terror and flight now rules through manipulation, information networks, and the careful cultivation of loyal agents. Melekas has become the ultimate stationary power—all of Kadroka must come to the dragon, never the reverse.

The dragon is patient in ways that shorter-lived beings cannot comprehend. Melekas plans in decades, thinks in centuries, and nurses grudges that span generations. The Tytheri orcs who now raid Kadrokan settlements with impunity? Melekas remembers when their ancestors were scattered tribes easily burned from the sky. The Agony Stones that trapped the dragon? Melekas has spent eight hundred years researching them, interviewing survivors who approached them, and sending agents to study them from safe distances.

The dragon desperately wants two things: a cure for the stillbinding, and revenge on whatever the Agony Stones actually are. These goals may be connected. Melekas suspects that understanding the Dying One—truly understanding it—might provide a way to reverse the petrification. But that would require someone to go *into* the Stones. Deep into them. And everyone who has tried that has either died or joined the Dying One's slow agony.

### Relationship with Kadroka

The people of Kadroka have a complicated relationship with their immobile ruler. On one hand, Melekas provides genuine protection—the dragon's fire can reach well beyond the city walls, and any army foolish enough to assault Ponoigari directly would face an enemy that cannot be flanked, cannot retreat, and has nothing to lose.

On the other hand, Melekas is still a dragon. Taxation is heavy. Dissent is noted and remembered. The dragon's network of informants—humans, naga, and others who serve the Stillbound—ensures that very little happens in Kadroka without Melekas eventually learning of it.

The naga population, in particular, has thrived under draconic rule. Dragons and naga share ancient connections, and many naga serve in Melekas's inner circle as advisors, spies, and interpreters of the dragon's will. Human Kadrokans sometimes resent this, creating ongoing tension within the realm.

### The Tytheri Problem

Melekas's paralysis has emboldened the Tytheri blood orcs to the southwest. They know the dragon cannot hunt them. They know Kadroka's military, without aerial support, struggles to project power into the rough terrain of Tythikerys. They raid with increasing boldness, and Melekas can do nothing but watch and scheme.

The dragon's hatred for the Tytheri is matched only by hatred for the Agony Stones that crippled Melekas in the first place—and the orcs' connection to those Stones, their harvesting of the Dying One's ichor, makes them doubly offensive. Melekas would give almost anything for a way to destroy both the orcs and the Stones that sustain them.

Almost anything.
