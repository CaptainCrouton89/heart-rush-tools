## Deadjack Forest

Tags: forest, geography, dangerous

Deadjack Forest is a dense woodland in southeastern Kadroka, positioned between the Fury Hills and the approaches to the Agony Stones. The forest is named for the jack pines that dominate it—trees that appear dead, with bare grey branches, but are very much alive and deeply unsettling.

### Geography

The forest covers approximately 30 miles east-west and 20 miles north-south, filling a basin between the Fury Hills to the north and the rising ground toward the Agony Stones to the south. The terrain is uneven, with rocky outcrops breaking through the forest floor and seasonal streams that flood during the wet season.

### The Trees

Deadjack pines are visually disturbing. Their bark is pale grey, almost white. Their branches are bare except at the very tips, where clusters of dark needles grow in twisted masses. The trees appear skeletal, corpse-like, as if the forest died long ago and forgot to fall down.

The trees are alive. They grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment. But they have adapted to conditions—possibly magical conditions, given the proximity to the Agony Stones—that have stripped away everything that makes a tree look healthy.

Walking through the Deadjack Forest feels like walking through a graveyard. The bare branches cast strange shadows. The wind through the needle-clusters makes sounds like whispered conversation. The overall effect is deeply oppressive.

### Sympathy Dampening

The Deadjack Forest has one notable property: it seems to dampen the sympathy effect from the Agony Stones.

Within the forest, the phantom pain and emotional disturbance caused by proximity to the Dying One is noticeably reduced. Not eliminated—travelers still feel something—but muted compared to equivalent distances in open terrain.

Why this occurs is unknown. Theories include:
- The trees absorb or redirect whatever emanates from the Stones
- The forest sits on a leyline that interferes with the sympathy effect
- Something in the soil or water neutralizes the transmission medium
- The forest itself is in sympathy with the Dying One and simply doesn't pass the effect to others

Whatever the cause, the dampening makes Deadjack Forest the safest approach route to the Agony Stones—which is not the same as safe.

### Wildlife

The forest supports unusual fauna:

**Deadjack Ravens:** Pale-feathered birds that nest in the skeletal branches. They watch travelers with apparent intelligence and occasionally follow groups through the forest. Their calls sound disturbingly like words.

**Grey Wolves:** A population of wolves with fur that matches the trees' bark, nearly invisible among the trunks. They hunt in the forest and rarely leave it.

**Other Things:** Reports of stranger creatures exist—things that might be corrupted by the Stones' influence, things that might have always lived here, things that might be the forest's own defenses. These reports are inconsistent and unverified.

### Traversing the Forest

For those attempting to reach the Agony Stones from Kadrokan territory, Deadjack Forest is the preferred route:

1. Cross the Fury Hills (contested, storm-prone)
2. Enter the forest from the north
3. Navigate south through approximately 20 miles of dead-looking trees and unsettling fauna
4. Emerge on the northern approaches to the Stones

The journey takes 2-3 days for a prepared party. The dampening effect makes sleep possible, though rarely restful. The forest's residents are dangerous but not inevitably hostile.

Most who attempt this route are doing so at Melekas's behest, seeking knowledge of the Dying One or a cure for the dragon's stillbinding. Few return with good news.
