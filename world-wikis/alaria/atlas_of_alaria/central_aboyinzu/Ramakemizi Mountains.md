## Ramakemizi Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

The Ramakemizi Mountains form the eastern boundary of Kadroka, separating the dragon-ruled savanna state from the Dalizi Confederation and Chechol beyond. They are Kadroka's lifeline—the only reliable route for external trade—and the reason the state has not been completely isolated by the Tytheri blockade.

### Geography

The range runs roughly north-south for over 200 miles, with peaks reaching 8,000-12,000 feet. The mountains are rugged but not impassable; several valleys and passes allow transit between Kadroka and the eastern territories.

**Western Slopes (Kadroka side):** Gradual descent into savanna, with foothills that support agriculture and the city of Sukinada.

**Eastern Slopes (Dalizi side):** Steeper, descending into the territories of Chechol and the broader Dalizi Confederation.

### The Passes

Several routes cross the Ramakemizi:

**The Sukinada Pass:** The primary trade route, connecting the Kadrokan city of Sukinada to Chechol. Wide enough for pack trains, maintained by both sides, and patrolled to discourage bandits. Most Kadrokan external trade flows through here.

**The Lagasuki Route:** A secondary passage following the Lagasuki River valley. Less traveled, more difficult, but useful when the main pass is blocked by weather or politics.

**Smaller Trails:** Numerous goat paths and footways cross the mountains, known primarily to locals, smugglers, and those with reason to avoid official routes.

### Economic Importance

With Bluesong Bay controlled by the Tytheri, the Ramakemizi passes are Kadroka's only connection to broader trade networks. Everything that enters or leaves the state by legitimate means crosses these mountains.

This gives the eastern cities—particularly Sukinada—disproportionate influence. Control of the passes means control of trade, and control of trade means wealth and power. The relationship between Sukinada's merchant families and the dragon in Ponoigari is complex and occasionally tense.

### The Dalizi Connection

Beyond the mountains lies the Dalizi Confederation, a massive alliance of city-states that provides Kadroka's primary trading partners. Dalizi merchants are common in Sukinada; Kadrokan goods—particularly leather and cattle—are valued in Dalizi markets.

Chechol, the nearest Dalizi territory, serves as an intermediary for much of this trade. The relationship is mutually beneficial: Kadroka gets access to goods they cannot produce; Dalizi gets products from the isolated western regions.

### Dangers

The mountains are not safe:

**Weather:** Storms can close passes for days. Winter snows make several routes impassable for months. Sudden temperature drops kill unprepared travelers.

**Wildlife:** Mountain predators, territorial creatures, and things that have wandered up from the lowlands all pose threats. The Morygun mountain goats that plague the northern Morygun range are less common here but not absent.

**Bandits:** The passes attract those who would prey on trade caravans. Kadrokan and Dalizi patrols reduce but do not eliminate the threat.

### Relationship to Melekas

The dragon Melekas understands the mountains' importance and maintains careful relationships with the powers that control the eastern approaches. The dragon cannot personally enforce anything beyond the foothills, but Kadrokan diplomacy ensures the passes remain open.

Some in Sukinada wonder how long this arrangement will last—and what happens to Kadroka's trade when the dragon finally falls silent.
