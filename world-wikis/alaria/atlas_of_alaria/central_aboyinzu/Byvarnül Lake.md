## Byvarnül Lake

Tags: lake, geography

A broad, shallow lake in the southeastern reaches of Luendrokrül, roughly fifteen miles across at its widest point. The water is dark—not murky, but deep-colored, like tea steeped too long. The lake is still. Unnaturally still. Even when wind moves through the surrounding trees, the water's surface barely ripples.

### The Drowned Ruins

The lake has risen over centuries, swallowing structures that once stood on dry ground. Stone walls break the surface near the shore, their tops worn smooth by time and water. Further out, shapes are visible beneath the surface on clear days—larger structures, partially collapsed, built from stone blocks too massive for human construction.

The architecture doesn't match the other ruins scattered through Luendrokrül. Those are human-scale, built with human techniques. The drowned ruins at Byvarnül are something else: doorways twice normal height, corridors wide enough for processions, and a central structure—visible only as a dark mass in the lake's deepest point—that defies easy categorization.

Divers have explored the shallower ruins. They report halls filled with preserved objects: furniture, tools, containers that might have held food or offerings. No bodies. No bones. Whatever lived here left, and they took their dead with them.

No one has reached the central structure. Divers who've tried report difficulty—the water grows colder as they descend, currents appear where none should exist, and something about the depths discourages progress. Not danger exactly. Just a growing certainty that they should turn back.

### The Shore Settlements

The lake's shores show signs of later habitation—the human-scale ruins found throughout the forest. These settlers built over and around the earlier structures, incorporating the strange architecture into their own. A village wall might include blocks scavenged from the drowned ruins. A foundation might rest on an older, larger foundation meant for different purposes.

These settlers stayed longer than anywhere else in Luendrokrül. The ruins here are more extensive, more developed, suggesting generations of occupation. And then they left too, just like the rest, with no explanation and no trace.

Whatever drew them to the lake—the earlier ruins, the water itself, something they found or hoped to find—apparently wasn't enough to keep them.

### Local Beliefs

The Ix'Lorett won't discuss Byvarnül Lake in detail. When pressed, they acknowledge knowing about it, acknowledge that it predates their presence in M'Svyla, and decline to say more. Their silence isn't hostile—it's simply complete.

The Old Terrenians in the Cowardly Mountains have stories, fragments passed down from ancestors who knew the forest before it became what it is now. They speak of the lake as a door—not metaphorically, but literally. A door to somewhere else, opened long ago by the tall builders, never properly closed.

In their telling, the builders didn't die or flee. They went through. And the door, left ajar, changed the forest around it. The settlers who came later were drawn by the opening, trying to follow, trying to understand. One by one, family by family, they found what they were looking for.

The Old Terrenians don't enter Luendrokrül. They don't look toward the forest if they can help it. When asked why, they give the same answer as everyone else: *some doors shouldn't be opened, and some should never have been left open*.
