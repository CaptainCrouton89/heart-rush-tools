## M'Svyla

Tags: state, nation, forest

A two-hundred-mile stretch of temperate forest running east from the Crystal Mountains into the Central Aboyinzu grasslands. Home to the Ix'Lorett—a lizardfolk people who have turned their homeland into something between a nation and a living gallery.

### The Forest

M'Svyla is old growth, the kind of forest that remembers when different creatures walked beneath its canopy. Broadleaf trees dominate—oak, ash, and species with no common tongue names—their crowns forming a broken ceiling that filters light into green-gold shafts. The understory is dense but navigable, threaded with game trails that the Ix'Lorett have walked for generations.

The forest thins as it stretches east, transitioning gradually from dense woodland to scattered copses to the open savanna of interior Aboyinzu. The western edge presses against the Crystal Mountain foothills, where mountain streams feed into the forest's river network. Xia Lake sits in the south-central forest, a broad shallow body of water ringed by some of the oldest Ix'Lorett settlements.

The Esosa River flows down from the north, cutting through the forest's eastern reaches before continuing south into the grasslands. Smaller tributaries web through the woodland, and the Ix'Lorett have built their villages along these waterways for as long as anyone can remember.

### The Ix'Lorett

The Ix'Lorett are iguana-like lizardfolk—slow-moving, ancient in appearance, patient beyond human comprehension. They live long lives and spend them deliberately. An Ix'Lorett might dedicate thirty years to a single sculpture, or fifty to mastering a particular technique of gem-setting. They do not rush. They do not need to.

Their villages are art installations as much as settlements. Mosaic pathways wind between dwellings, each stone placed with intention. Trees bear carved panels depicting local history or abstract meditations on light and shadow. Gemstones from the Crystal Mountains are set into everything—doorframes, communal halls, the handles of everyday tools—not for wealth, but for the way they catch the light.

The Ix'Lorett philosophy centers on inner cultivation. They believe that patience and presence are the highest virtues, that a life lived deliberately is worth more than a life lived long. Their legendary regenerative abilities—they can regrow lost limbs over months of focused healing—are seen not as biological accident but as physical proof that the body follows the mind's intention.

They are not pacifists. An Ix'Lorett will fight to defend their home, their art, their people. But violence is a failure state, a sign that patience and wisdom were insufficient. They would rather outlast a threat than destroy it.

### Governance

The Ix'Lorett govern by consensus, and consensus takes time.

The Slow Council meets in a great hall near Xia Lake, its walls covered in centuries of accumulated mosaic work. Representatives from every village attend, though "attend" may mean sitting in contemplative silence for days before speaking. Decisions emerge gradually, shaped by discussion and meditation, tested against the community's collective sense of rightness. A proposal might take months to resolve. Major questions—war, alliance, fundamental changes to Ix'Lorett society—can take years.

This makes the Ix'Lorett maddening partners in diplomacy. Ambassadors from faster-paced nations have grown old waiting for answers. But decisions made by the Slow Council stick. They've been considered from every angle, accepted by every faction. There are no hasty mistakes to walk back, no factions nursing grievances over railroaded votes.

### The Unfinished Work

Deep in the western forest, where the oldest trees grow, the Ix'Lorett have been building something for six hundred years.

They call it the Unfinished Work—a complex of structures, sculptures, gardens, and mosaic installations that sprawls across a square mile of forest floor. Each generation adds to it. Each addition must harmonize with what came before while leaving space for what comes after. The project has no planned endpoint. It will be finished when it is finished, or it will never be finished at all.

Outsiders who've seen the Unfinished Work describe it as overwhelming. The accumulated weight of centuries of patient craft, each piece perfect in itself and part of a larger whole too vast to comprehend. Some find it beautiful. Some find it terrifying—a reminder of how small a single lifetime is against the scale of Ix'Lorett intention.

### Refugees and Healing

M'Svyla has become, almost by accident, a place where broken people come to mend.

It started with the Crystal Mountain defenders. Wounded soldiers stumbled down from the passes and found Ix'Lorett healing stations in the foothills. Some recovered and returned to the fighting. Others didn't—couldn't—and drifted deeper into the forest instead. The Ix'Lorett didn't turn them away. They simply made room.

Now M'Svyla hosts a scattered population of refugees, veterans, scholars fleeing war-torn libraries, anyone who needs time and quiet to rebuild themselves. The Ix'Lorett ask nothing of them except respect for the forest and its ways. Some stay for months, then leave. Some stay for years. Some, eventually, begin learning the Ix'Lorett crafts—not because they're required to, but because the slow, deliberate work gives them something they'd lost.

The Ix'Lorett view this as natural. Healing is what they do. The forest has room.

### The Shadow in the North

The Ix'Lorett know what waits beyond the Crystal Mountains. They've seen what comes down from the passes—the wounded, the traumatized, the ones who've looked into the eyes of Xynoth's legions and somehow survived. They know the defenders are losing.

They do not discuss it often. There is no panic, no urgency that would satisfy a human observer. But the Slow Council has been deliberating on the question for three years now: what will M'Svyla do when the mountains fall?

Some argue for preparation—fortification, alliance with southern powers, stockpiling weapons. Others argue that such preparations would transform M'Svyla into something it isn't, destroy the very thing they'd be trying to save. Still others suggest evacuation, abandoning the forest before the dead arrive.

No consensus has emerged. The Ix'Lorett continue their crafts, tend their wounded, add to the Unfinished Work. Perhaps they are paralyzed by indecision. Perhaps they trust that the right answer will become clear in time. Perhaps they've simply accepted that some problems have no solutions, only responses.

The mountains still hold. For now, that's enough.
