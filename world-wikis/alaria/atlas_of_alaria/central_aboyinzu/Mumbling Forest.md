## Mumbling Forest

Tags: forest, geography, mysterious

The Mumbling Forest dominates the southwestern coast of Tythikerys, a dense woodland that stretches from Bluesong Bay to the southern reaches of the region. It is named for the constant low sound that pervades it—not quite voices, not quite wind, but something in between that never stops.

### Geography

The forest covers approximately 60 miles of coastline and extends 20-30 miles inland. The trees are ancient, tall, and densely packed, their canopy blocking most sunlight from the forest floor. The terrain is uneven, with ravines, hidden streams, and sudden clearings that appear without pattern.

The coast where the forest meets Bluesong Bay is rocky and difficult to navigate, with few natural landing spots for ships.

### The Sound

The "mumbling" that gives the forest its name is audible from the forest's edge and grows louder within. It sounds like distant conversation—multiple voices speaking simultaneously in no language anyone has identified. The sound comes from no particular direction; it simply exists throughout the forest, part of the ambient environment.

Some who have spent time in the forest report that the mumbling occasionally seems to form words—phrases in their native tongue, names, warnings. Whether this is a property of the sound or a product of minds trying to find meaning in noise is unknown.

The sound does not cease at night. Some say it grows louder.

### Inhabitants

Whatever lives in the Mumbling Forest has never been clearly documented.

**What is known:**
- The Tytheri avoid the forest despite its proximity to their territory
- Animals from the surrounding area do not enter
- Travelers who venture in often become lost despite simple routes
- Some travelers who enter do not return; others emerge with no memory of what they saw

**Speculation:**
- A fae presence of some kind, possibly connected to the darker courts
- Spirits or ghosts from some ancient tragedy
- A form of plant life that has achieved collective consciousness
- Something from another plane, bleeding through
- Nothing at all—the forest is simply strange, and strangeness is its own category

### Relationship with the Tytheri

The Tytheri blood orcs and the Mumbling Forest have an unspoken arrangement: the orcs do not enter, and whatever lives within does not emerge.

This arrangement has held for as long as anyone remembers. Orc camps stay well clear of the forest's edge. Hunting parties that pursue prey into the trees turn back. Even Ichor-maddened raiders, desperate for violence, find reasons to seek it elsewhere.

Some scholars theorize the forest's presence is why the Tytheri never developed maritime ambitions—the coast is blocked by something they instinctively avoid.

### Approach

Those who wish to enter the Mumbling Forest should understand that:

1. The sound will become omnipresent and impossible to ignore
2. Navigation will become unreliable—compasses work, but sense of direction does not
3. Time may not pass at the expected rate
4. Something is watching
5. The forest may or may not choose to let you leave

The wisest approach is not to enter at all.
