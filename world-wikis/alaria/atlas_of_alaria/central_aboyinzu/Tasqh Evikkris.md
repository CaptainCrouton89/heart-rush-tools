## Tasqh Evikkris

Tags: river, geography, trade route

A broad, slow-moving river marking the western boundary of Echem Yiakraxes, the Tasqh Evikkris is the only safe passage through the region—and "safe" is relative. The name comes from an indigenous Aboyinzan language, roughly translating to "the watching water" or "water that sees." Locals claim the river has a spirit, and that spirit dislikes the Terrogones.

### The Lifeline

For caravans, pilgrims, and anyone else who needs to transit the northwestern Deadloop region without crossing Terrogone territory, the Tasqh Evikkris is the only option. The river runs roughly north-south, fed by highland tributaries in the Anna P'Sue region and eventually emptying into the Deadloop's western reaches.

Traffic stays close to the water. Flat-bottomed barges carry goods and passengers, poled along by crews who know the river's moods intimately. Portage points at rapids and shallows see small communities—not quite towns, more like permanent camps—where travelers can resupply, hire guards, or wait for safer conditions.

The crossing from the river's western bank to anywhere east of Echem Yiakraxes requires either a very long detour south or a very dangerous shortcut through Terrogone hunting grounds. Most choose the detour.

### Why the Terrogones Avoid It

The Terrogones don't hunt the riverbanks. They'll pursue prey to within a hundred yards of the water, then break off. They don't drink from the Tasqh Evikkris when other water sources are available. Family groups whose territories border the river treat it as a hard boundary, not contested ground.

**Theories:**

- **The current.** The Tasqh Evikkris runs deceptively fast beneath its calm surface. Terrogones are powerful but not buoyant; several have drowned attempting to cross.
- **The spirit.** Indigenous peoples have maintained shrines along the river for generations. Some believe an elemental or nature spirit inhabits the water, one with ancient grudges against the Chulpe.
- **Learned behavior.** Something in the river—crocodilian predators, aggressive fish, waterborne parasites—made the Terrogones' ancestors avoid it, and the prohibition passed down.
- **Agreement.** The most unsettling theory: that whatever controls Nyavminthk Castle established the river as a boundary, and the Terrogones obey.

Whatever the reason, the effect is consistent. The Tasqh Evikkris flows through Terrogone territory without being part of it.

### The River Itself

Murky brown water, fifty to eighty yards wide in most stretches, deepening to thirty feet in the main channel. The current looks gentle from shore but pulls hard once you're in it. The banks are muddy, thick with reeds and low scrub—the only significant vegetation in this part of Echem Yiakraxes.

Wildlife congregates here in stark contrast to the barren plains. Wading birds, small mammals, fish visible in the shallows when the sun hits right. Crocodilian predators (called *krisev* locally) patrol the deeper stretches; they're dangerous but predictable, and the barge crews know how to avoid them.

The smell is mud and green growth—shocking after days in the dry savanna. Sound carries differently near the water; voices and splashes echo off the far bank. At night, the river produces a low, constant susurration that locals claim is the water spirit breathing.

### River Communities

Permanent settlements are rare—the Terrogone proximity makes large populations unwise. Instead, a network of semi-permanent camps serves travelers:

- **Portage stations** at rapids and sandbars, where goods transfer between barges
- **Wayhouses** offering food, shelter, and local knowledge (for a price)
- **Shrine-keepers** who maintain the old worship sites and claim to speak for the river spirit
- **Guides** who know the territory east of the river, for those foolish enough to hire them

These communities are polyglot, transient, and deeply practical. They don't waste energy on hospitality theater; you pay for what you need, you don't cause trouble, you move on. The river provides, but it doesn't coddle.

### For Adventurers

The Tasqh Evikkris offers:

- **Safe transit** through otherwise impassable territory, with all the encounters that implies
- **River communities** as sources of information, supplies, and local guides
- **The mystery** of why the Terrogones avoid it—and whether that protection can be extended or exploited
- **The spirit** that locals believe inhabits the water, which may or may not be real, and may or may not be friendly
- **A staging point** for expeditions into Echem Yiakraxes, including attempts on Nyavminthk Castle
