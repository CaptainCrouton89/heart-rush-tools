## Bloodswamp

Tags: swamp, geography, wetland

The Bloodswamp is a large wetland in southwestern Kadroka where the region's major rivers converge before flowing into Tytheri territory. It marks the effective border between Kadrokan civilization and the orc-controlled scrublands to the south—and it is named for the battles that have been fought there for centuries.

### Geography

The swamp forms where the Royko River's tributaries—the Sikuri, the Noara, and smaller streams—merge into a single drainage. The terrain is a maze of channels, pools, reed beds, and sodden ground. During the wet season, the swamp expands dramatically; during the dry season, it contracts to a still-substantial core of permanent wetland.

**Approximate dimensions**: 15-20 miles north-south, 30-40 miles east-west at maximum wet-season extent.

### The Name

"Bloodswamp" is not poetic exaggeration.

For as long as Kadroka and the Tytheri have been in conflict, this wetland has been contested ground. Orc raiding parties push north through the swamp; Kadrokan forces try to stop them. Bodies sink into the muck. Blood mixes with the water. Some say the reeds grow taller here because of what feeds them.

During dry seasons when the water level drops, bones surface—human, orc, and older things. The locals collect them, burn some, sell others. War is the swamp's economy.

### Strategic Importance

The Bloodswamp is both obstacle and gateway.

**For the Tytheri**: The swamp is difficult terrain, but it provides water and cover during the long push into Kadrokan territory. Experienced raiders know paths through the worst of it. Less experienced ones drown.

**For Kadroka**: The swamp is the last defensible line before the savanna heartland. Naga troops excel in this terrain; human forces struggle. Fortified positions on dry ground overlook the main channels, but there are always alternative routes.

Neither side can truly *hold* the Bloodswamp. It is too large, too mutable, too easy to infiltrate. Instead, both sides maintain presence, conduct patrols, and fight when they meet.

### Ecology

The swamp supports a rich and dangerous ecosystem:

**Flora**: Dense reed beds, floating vegetation mats, gnarled trees on the higher ground. Some plants have developed interesting properties—natural painkillers, hallucinogens, poisons. Kadrokan herbalists know which are which; outsiders often do not.

**Fauna**: Crocodilian creatures patrol the deeper channels. Venomous snakes occupy the shallows. Clouds of biting insects make extended stays miserable. Larger predators—swamp cats, massive serpents—hunt both prey and unwary travelers.

**Disease**: The water breeds illnesses. Parasites, infections, and swamp fevers afflict those who drink untreated water or spend too long in the wet. Kadrokan troops rotate frequently; Tytheri raiders push through quickly for the same reason.

### Settlements

No permanent settlements exist within the swamp proper. The nearest substantial population centers are:

- **Dranabaru** (north): Kadrokan city overlooking the swamp's northern edge, housing most of the garrison forces.
- **Arigaska** (east): Frontier city that faces both swamp and savanna threats.

Temporary camps, outposts, and watch stations dot the swamp's margins, but flooding makes permanent construction impractical.

### Naga Presence

The Bloodswamp is where Kadroka's naga population proves most valuable.

Naga troops operate in the swamp with an ease human soldiers cannot match. They move through water silently, see in the murky depths, and fight effectively in environments that exhaust ordinary infantry. Some of the most successful defenses against Tytheri raids have been organized by naga commanders who understand the terrain intimately.

This military importance reinforces naga political influence in Kadroka generally. Human generals cannot dismiss naga contributions when naga soldiers are the ones holding the line.

### Crossing the Swamp

For travelers (or adventurers) who need to pass through:

**From the North** (Kadroka): Kadrokan patrols can provide guidance to known paths—for a fee, and with questions about your business. Going south means going toward the orcs; that attracts attention.

**From the South** (Tythikerys): Good luck. Any path you find was made by orc raiders. If you're not an orc, the orcs will find you. The swamp's dangers pale compared to meeting a Tytheri war party.

**Guides**: A few individuals—human, naga, and otherwise—know the swamp well enough to navigate it safely. Their services are expensive and their availability is unpredictable. Most won't guide anyone into Tytheri territory.

### What Lies Below

The swamp has accumulated centuries of battle detritus.

Weapons, armor, and other war material sink into the muck and stay there. Scavengers retrieve what they can reach, but the deeper layers remain untouched. Somewhere below the surface is a layered record of every conflict fought here—an archaeological treasure trove for anyone willing to dig through a monster-infested, disease-ridden, actively contested war zone.

Rumors persist of older things beneath the battlefield debris. The swamp existed before Kadroka, before the Tytheri. What people fought here in earlier ages, and what they left behind, is unknown.
