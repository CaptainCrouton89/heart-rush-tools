## Qintas

Tags: state, nation

A coastal state in Central Aboyinzu, home to a significant Amverela high elf population and famous across Alaria for Sondoros wine. Where neighboring Grustos is rugged and complicated, Qintas is refined and deliberate—a place where decisions are made slowly, buildings are built to last centuries, and outsiders are welcomed with patience that can feel like condescension.

The Amverela have lived here for millennia, long enough to have weathered multiple civilizational collapses and rebuilt each time. Their cities were old when human kingdoms were young. Their libraries contain records of eras most scholars consider mythological. They are not immortal, but they live long enough that "long-term planning" means something different to them than to other peoples.

The Light leyline passes through Qintas, continuing from Grustos to the east. The high elves acknowledge its presence but do not worship it as the Kryaaji do—to them, it is simply another feature of the landscape, no more sacred than a river or a hill.

### Geography

#### Freshwater Sound

A large bay or sound dominating the northwestern coast, providing Qintas with access to maritime trade. The waters are calm, protected from ocean storms by the peninsula that curves around from Grustos, making Freshwater Sound one of the safest harbors in Central Aboyinzu.

The Amverela were never great sailors—they prefer the patience of land-based pursuits to the unpredictability of the sea—but they've always been willing to let others do the sailing. Freshwater Sound's ports welcome traders from across Alaria, all eager to purchase Sondoros wine and whatever else the high elves deign to sell.

#### Sothills

A range of gentle hills in the northern region, where the land rises from the coastal plain toward the Torulius Mountains of Grustos. The Sothills are pastoral—sheep, goats, and the occasional dairy operation—producing wool and cheese that never quite achieve the fame of Sondoros wine but remain steady exports.

The hills are dotted with small estates, many owned by Amverela families who have tended the same flocks for generations. The pace of life here is even slower than in coastal Qintas, which some visitors find restful and others find maddening.

### Forests

#### Sondoros

The most famous forest in Qintas—possibly in all of Central Aboyinzu—renowned for the strange grape-like fruit that grows on vines climbing its trees. The wine produced from this fruit is legendary, said to be fit for gods, and is sought after by connoisseurs across Alaria.

The Amverela guard the Sondoros jealously. The vines refuse to grow elsewhere—many have tried transplanting them, all have failed—so the wine can only be produced here. This has made Qintas wealthy and has given the high elves leverage in negotiations that their military strength could never provide.

Harvesting is a precise art, governed by moon phases, weather patterns, and traditions that predate written records. The Amverela claim to know exactly when each vine is ready; outsiders suspect they simply enjoy making the process seem mysterious.

#### Ojos Goros

A southern forest whose name translates to "watching eyes"—a reference to the sensation all visitors report of being observed from within the trees. The forest is not hostile, exactly, but it is unsettling. Animals fall silent when travelers approach. Branches seem to track movement. The feeling of scrutiny never quite fades.

The Amverela avoid Ojos Goros when possible and refuse to discuss it when asked. Local legends speak of something that dwells in the forest's heart—not a creature, exactly, but an awareness. What it watches for, no one knows. What it would do if it saw something concerning is a question best left unanswered.

### Settlements

#### Constancias

The capital of Qintas, a city of white stone and silver filigree built on terraces rising from the coastal plain. Constancias is beautiful in the way that only Amverela construction can be—every building positioned to catch light at optimal angles, every street aligned with sight lines to distant landmarks, every public space designed for contemplation.

The city is old. Not ancient in the way of ruins, but old in the way of living things that have simply continued existing. Buildings erected in ages past still house the same families. Gardens planted by elves long dead still bloom according to their original designs. The Amverela do not change Constancias; they maintain it.

Government is conducted through councils that meet rarely and decide slowly. Urgent matters are handled by delegated officials; truly urgent matters—war, plague, catastrophe—are handled by emergency procedures that have been invoked perhaps twice in living memory. The Amverela approach to crisis is to have planned for it centuries ago.

#### Mataojo

A northern port city on Freshwater Sound, serving as Qintas's primary maritime trade hub. Mataojo is livelier than Constancias—more humans, more visitors, more of the chaos that comes with commercial activity.

The Amverela tolerate this because trade is useful and because concentrating foreign activity in Mataojo keeps it away from the rest of the state. The city's architecture is mixed: elven foundations supporting human additions, elegant stonework adjacent to practical wooden warehouses. The combination works better than it should.

#### Lomas Radiales

A town in the Sothills, serving as the center of Qintas's pastoral economy. Wool markets operate here year-round; cheese aging facilities line the main roads; shepherds from across the hills bring their flocks for sale and breeding.

The town's name—"radial hills"—refers to the way roads spread from its center like spokes on a wheel, connecting scattered hill estates to a central point. The Amverela planned it this way millennia ago. It still works.

#### Piedritas

A town near the Sondoros forest, existing primarily to support the wine industry. During harvest season, Piedritas swells with workers; the rest of the year, it maintains equipment, ages wine in vast cellars, and waits.

The town has developed its own culture, distinct from coastal Qintas—rougher, more practical, defined by the annual rhythm of the harvest. Vineyard workers from across the region gather here, sharing techniques and gossip. Some are human; the Amverela prefer to employ outsiders for the physical labor.

#### Puerto Carmele

A coastal town south of Mataojo, smaller and quieter. Puerto Carmele was once a significant port; silting and shifting currents have reduced its harbor to shallow-draft vessels only. The town persists on fishing and nostalgia.

Some Amverela families maintain estates here specifically because it's unfashionable—a retreat from the sophistication of Constancias and the commerce of Mataojo. The pace of life in Puerto Carmele is slow even by high elf standards.

#### Barro Triste

A village in the eastern region whose name—"sad mud"—reflects its primary characteristic. The ground here is perpetually damp, the weather perpetually overcast, and the mood perpetually melancholic. The village exists because someone has to farm the rich bottomland soils, and the crops grown in sad mud are nutritious if joyless.

Barro Triste has produced several notable Amverela poets, all writing extensively about rain, grey skies, and the weight of existence. Literary scholars consider this a coincidence. No one else does.

#### Soya

A small village in the agricultural interior, unremarkable except for its beans. Soya produces a particular variety of legume that grows nowhere else in Qintas, forming the basis of several traditional dishes. The village is proud of its beans. Visitors are expected to admire them.

#### Valentinas

A village on the southern fringe, near the Ojos Goros forest. Valentinas exists in the forest's shadow—not quite within it, but close enough to feel watched. The villagers have adapted, conducting their lives with the awareness that something might be observing. They don't discuss the forest. They don't enter it. They pretend it isn't there.

This works about as well as might be expected.

### What Makes Qintas Interesting

- **Sondoros wine**: Legendary, irreplaceable, and the source of Qintas's wealth and influence. Everyone wants it; only Qintas has it.
- **Amverela society**: Long-lived elves who plan in centuries. Their patience is an advantage and a vulnerability—they sometimes fail to respond to fast-moving threats.
- **Ojos Goros**: The watching forest. What's in there? The elves won't say.
- **Buffer against Chaal Nazzerox**: If the undead break through Grustos, Qintas is next. The Amverela know this. Their preparations are characteristically long-term and characteristically opaque.
- **Cultural collision**: High elf elegance meets human commercial energy in Mataojo. The friction produces interesting results.
