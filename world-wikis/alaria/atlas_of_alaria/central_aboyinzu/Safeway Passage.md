## Safeway Passage

Tags: pass, geography

The only reliable route through the Cowardly Mountains, connecting the western territories to the grasslands and forests of Central Aboyinzu. The name is either optimistic or ironic, depending on who you ask. The passage is safer than the alternatives—which says more about the alternatives than the passage itself.

### The Route

The Safeway Passage runs roughly twelve miles through the Cowardly Mountains' narrowest point. The path follows a river canyon for the first third, climbs through a series of switchbacks to a high saddle, then descends through rockfall-prone slopes to the eastern foothills above the Minas River.

The passage is wide enough for wagons in most places, though several pinch points require careful navigation. Spring snowmelt makes the canyon section treacherous, and winter snows can close the upper reaches entirely. The optimal travel window runs from late spring through early autumn—roughly five months when the passage is reliably open.

Even in good conditions, the journey takes two to three days. Faster travelers have made it in one hard push, but the terrain punishes haste. Rockslides, washed-out sections, and the simple difficulty of mountain travel claim lives every year.

### Horan's Hut

The fortress called Horan's Hut guards the eastern approach to the passage. Despite the diminutive name—a joke that stopped being funny generations ago—the fortification is substantial: thick walls, a defensible gate, and enough garrison space for a hundred soldiers. In practice, the garrison runs thirty to fifty depending on the season and the political situation in the surrounding territories.

The fortress serves three purposes:

**Tariff collection**: Every caravan passing through pays for the privilege. The rates are steep but predictable, and the alternative routes are worse. Merchants grumble and pay.

**Passage security**: The garrison maintains the route, clears rockslides, and occasionally escorts high-value caravans through the worst sections. This service costs extra.

**Watching the mountains**: The Cowardly Mountains harbor things that occasionally cause problems. The garrison keeps track of what moves in the heights, maintains relationships with the more approachable inhabitants, and responds when something dangerous comes down from the peaks.

The fortress takes its name from its founder, a Terrenian officer named Horan who established the first fortification here after the fall of his homeland. The original structure was indeed a hut—a timber blockhouse barely large enough for a dozen soldiers. Three centuries of expansion have transformed it into something considerably more impressive, but the name stuck.

### Why Not the Forest?

Every few years, someone proposes cutting a route through Luendrokrül instead. The forest crossing would be shorter, lower, and avoid the passage tariffs entirely. The proposals always fail.

Survey expeditions don't return, or return without useful information. Workers sent to clear paths abandon the project within weeks. One attempt to establish a waystation in the forest's western edge ended when the entire work crew walked off the job simultaneously, unable to explain why but unanimous in their refusal to continue.

The passage authorities don't discourage these attempts. They've learned that nothing convinces people faster than letting them try. The survivors become the passage's most reliable advocates.

### Politics

Horan's Hut operates semi-independently, technically owing allegiance to no single power. The garrison recruits from multiple nations and maintains careful neutrality in regional conflicts. This independence survives because everyone benefits from the passage remaining open and because no single power wants their rivals controlling it.

The arrangement is stable but not permanent. Rising powers eye the passage as a strategic asset. Declining powers worry about losing access. The garrison commander—currently a pragmatic veteran named Thessaly Vorn—spends as much time on diplomacy as defense, balancing interests and reminding everyone that a fight over the passage would close it to everyone.
