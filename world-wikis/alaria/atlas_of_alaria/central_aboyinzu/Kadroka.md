## Kadroka

Tags: state, nation, region

Kadroka is a savanna region in southwestern Central Aboyinzu, dominated by open grasslands and the drainage basin of the Royko River system. The region takes its name from the state that controls it—a dragon-ruled territory centered on the capital city of Ponoigari.

### Geography

The landscape is classic African-style savanna: golden grass beneath wide skies, scattered acacia-like trees, and seasonal watering holes that draw both wildlife and settlement. The terrain rises gradually toward the Ramakemizi Mountains in the east and descends toward the coastal lowlands in the west (though Kadrokan territory does not reach the coast).

**Key Features:**
- **Ramakemizi Mountains**: Eastern boundary, separating Kadroka from the Dalizi Confederation
- **Penor Syalki / Sokorgül**: Dense forests forming the northern and northwestern boundaries
- **Bloodswamp**: Wetland in the southwest where multiple rivers converge
- **Tythikerys**: Arid scrubland to the south, controlled by blood orcs

### River System

The rivers of Kadroka drain generally southwest toward Bluesong Bay, though they pass through Tytheri territory before reaching the coast:

- **Noara River**: Major northern river, flowing south through the settled heartland
- **Molotai River**: Feeds into the Royko from the Lonesome Lake region
- **Hurikono**: Stream system in the north, joining the Molotai
- **Sikuri River**: Southern tributary joining the Royko at the Bloodswamp
- **Royko River**: The main drainage, collecting all tributaries and flowing southwest through Tythikerys to the sea
- **Lagasuki River**: Eastern river draining the Ramakemizi foothills

### Settlements

Kadroka is relatively densely settled for Central Aboyinzu, with a road network connecting major population centers:

**Cities:**
- Ponoigari (capital) — Built around the paralyzed dragon Melekas
- Sukinada — Eastern gateway to mountain passes
- Ibasaka — Northern river city
- Dranabaru — Southern city near the Bloodswamp
- Arigaska — Frontier city facing Tytheri raids

**Towns:** Seyezka, Gaku, Eshesei, Skara, Toan

**Villages:** Gomato, Noka, Tomgichi, Kandaki, Apuku, Ika, Jehikita, Bwaruta, Sira, and others

Settlement density decreases sharply toward the south and southwest, where Tytheri raids make permanent habitation dangerous.

### Climate

Wet and dry seasons dominate the annual cycle. The wet season brings flooding to low-lying areas (particularly near the Bloodswamp), while the dry season turns the grasslands golden and concentrates wildlife around permanent water sources.

Temperatures are warm year-round, though the eastern highlands near the Ramakemizi Mountains are noticeably cooler.

### Wildlife

The savanna supports large herbivore populations—analogous to African plains fauna—along with the predators that hunt them. The rivers teem with fish and the crocodilian creatures that eat them.

More dangerous fauna include various magical beasts drawn to the leyline-adjacent areas near the mountains, and the occasional creature wandering north from the cursed Agony Stones region.

### Political Control

For detailed political information, see the state entry for Kadroka in Nations & Powers. The region is ruled by the dragon Melekas from Ponoigari, with a mixed human-naga administration handling day-to-day governance.
