## Crystal Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A fifty-mile spine of peaks running northwest to southeast through Central Aboyinzu, separating Terrenia and the horrors of Chaal Nazzerox from the forests of M'Svyla and the southern grasslands. The range takes its name from the dense quartz formations that stud its slopes—on clear days, the peaks catch the sun and throw light across the foothills in blinding sheets.

### Geography

The Crystal Mountains rise sharply from the surrounding terrain, their western faces particularly sheer where they border Chaal Nazzerox. The eastern slopes descend more gradually into the temperate forests of M'Svyla. Dozens of passes cut through the range, though only a handful are wide enough for an army. These chokepoints have determined the fate of the region for centuries.

The mountains are riddled with cave systems, many of them lined with crystal formations that grew over geological ages. Quartz veins run through the granite like frozen lightning, and in places the crystal deposits are so dense that natural light penetrates deep into the mountainside, refracted through countless facets until it emerges in unexpected places. Miners speak of "light wells"—shafts where sunlight travels hundreds of feet through crystal channels to illuminate chambers that have never seen the sky.

### The Crystal Mines

Mining operations dot the eastern slopes, extracting quartz and rarer mineral formations for trade. The work is dangerous—not from magic, but from the mountains themselves. Crystal formations are brittle and unpredictable. Miners have been buried by sudden collapses, blinded by light concentrated through crystal lenses, or simply lost in the labyrinthine cave networks. The Ix'Lorett of M'Svyla prize certain resonant crystals for their craft, and a steady trade flows between the mining settlements and the forest villages below.

The most valuable deposits lie deeper, in chambers where the crystal formations have grown for millennia undisturbed. Expeditions into the deep mines return with specimens worth fortunes—or don't return at all.

### The Defenders

Someone holds the passes against Chaal Nazzerox. They have held them for years.

The defenders are not a single army. They are remnants of Terrenian border garrisons who refused to flee, mercenary companies paid by southern states who fear what happens if the mountains fall, volunteers from a dozen nations who'd rather die in the passes than see the undead flood south. Religious orders maintain fortified monasteries on strategic peaks. Exiles from Chaal Nazzerox itself—the living who escaped Xynoth's conquest—fight alongside people who would have been their enemies a generation ago.

There is no unified command. Cooperation happens through necessity and mutual desperation. Some passes are held by hardened professionals; others by farmers with spears who happened to live in the wrong valley when the dead came north.

They are losing. Slowly, year by year, pass by pass. The undead do not tire, do not starve, do not break. The defenders do all three. Every winter, the line contracts. Every spring, the dead probe further. The mathematics are simple and merciless: Xynoth has forever, and the defenders do not.

### The Northern Threat

The Crystal Mountains are all that stands between Chaal Nazzerox and the living south. Xynoth's undead legions mass in the Prowling Hills and along the mountain's northern approaches, testing defenses, probing for weakness. The terrain favors the defenders—narrow passes, steep approaches, positions that can be held by few against many—but terrain only delays the inevitable when your enemy never stops coming.

Why Xynoth hasn't committed his full strength remains unclear. Perhaps the cost isn't worth the gain. Perhaps something in the mountains gives him pause. Perhaps he's simply patient, content to grind down the defenders over decades rather than spend his armies in costly assaults. The lich king's motives are not human motives, and those who try to predict him rarely survive their miscalculations.

### The Southern Slopes

Below the eastern passes, the mountains give way to forested foothills that blend into M'Svyla. The transition is gradual—bare rock to scrub pine to the temperate broadleaf forests where the Ix'Lorett make their homes. Streams cascade down from snowmelt and mountain springs, feeding the rivers that water the forests below.

The Ix'Lorett maintain healing stations in the foothills, tending to wounded defenders who make it down from the passes. It's quiet work, far from the fighting, but essential. The lizardfolk ask no questions about allegiance or origin. They simply heal what can be healed and bury what cannot.

Some defenders, broken by the fighting, never return to the passes. They drift into M'Svyla's forests and stay, finding something in the Ix'Lorett's patient philosophy that the endless war had burned out of them.
