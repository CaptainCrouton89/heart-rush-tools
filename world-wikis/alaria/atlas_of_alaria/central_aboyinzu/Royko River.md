## Royko River

Tags: river, geography, waterway

The Royko River is the main drainage of the Kadroka-Tythikerys region, collecting waters from multiple tributaries and flowing southwest through orc territory to Bluesong Bay. It is the lifeline of Tytheri existence and a constant reminder to Kadrokans of what they cannot control.

### Course

The Royko forms in the Bloodswamp where the Sikuri River and other tributaries converge. From there, it flows southwest through the arid scrubland of Tythikerys for approximately 150 miles before emptying into Bluesong Bay through a marshy delta.

### Tributaries

**From the North (Kadrokan territory):**
- **Noara River**: The major northern tributary, flowing south through the Kadrokan heartland
- **Molotai River**: Drains the Lonesome Lake region, joining the Royko system via the Hurikono
- **Hurikono**: Stream system feeding the Molotai
- **Sikuri River**: Southern tributary joining at the Bloodswamp

**From the South (Tythikerys):**
- **Dutunimako River**: Flows to Redreed Lake rather than the Royko proper, but part of the same watershed

**From the East:**
- **Lagasuki River**: Drains the Ramakemizi foothills, joining the system through Kadrokan territory

### Significance

The Royko is the only permanent water source through most of Tythikerys. The orcs cannot survive without it. Their camps cluster along its banks; their movements follow its course; their control of the region depends on controlling the river.

For Kadroka, the Royko represents frustration. The river drains their territory, carries their water, and empties into a bay they cannot use. Every drop that flows past the Bloodswamp benefits the orcs who raid Kadrokan settlements.

Proposals to dam or divert the Royko surface periodically in Kadrokan policy discussions. All have been rejected as impractical—the engineering would be massive, the location would be in contested territory, and the orcs would certainly attack any such project.

### Navigation

The Royko is navigable by small boats through much of Tythikerys, though no one sane attempts it. The orcs don't build boats, but they watch the river, and any vessel would be an obvious target.

In Kadrokan territory, the upper tributaries support limited boat traffic—primarily for fishing and local transport rather than long-distance trade.
