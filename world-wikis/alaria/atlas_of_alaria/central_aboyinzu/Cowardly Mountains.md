## Cowardly Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A sub-range of the Crystal Mountains, curving southwest from the main spine to form Luendrokrül's northwestern boundary. The name is old, possibly older than the common tongue version suggests, and no one agrees on its origin. What everyone agrees on is that things live here that live nowhere else—and most of them came from somewhere else.

### Geography

The Cowardly Mountains are lower and more broken than the Crystal Mountains proper. Where the main range presents sheer faces and defined peaks, the Cowardly Mountains are a jumble of ridges, box canyons, hidden valleys, and cave systems that honeycomb the stone. The terrain is defensive by nature—easy to hide in, hard to search, impossible to hold against someone who knows it better than you.

The western slopes drop into the foothills above the Minas River. The eastern faces overlook Luendrokrül's canopy, offering views that would be spectacular if anyone wanted to look at that forest for long. The Safeway Passage cuts through the range's narrowest point, the only reliable route between the western territories and the lands beyond.

### The Refuge

The Cowardly Mountains earned their name—or perhaps always had it—because things flee here. Not just animals seeking territory. People. Creatures. Things that needed to disappear.

Refugees from Chaal Nazzerox's expansion found their way here generations ago, the living who escaped before Xynoth's conquest was complete. Their descendants still inhabit hidden valleys, speaking old Terrenian dialects and practicing customs that died everywhere else. They don't welcome outsiders, but they don't attack them either. They've learned that staying hidden is safer than staying hostile.

Other things came later. Deserters from a dozen armies. Criminals whose crimes were severe enough to warrant real pursuit. Cultists whose worship drew too much attention. Monsters intelligent enough to know when they were being hunted. The mountains don't judge. They just provide cover.

Not everything here fled from something. Some things fled *to* something—the forest below, Luendrokrül, draws certain minds the way a wound draws flies. Pilgrims who believe something waits in the ruins. Scholars obsessed with the vanished civilization. Madmen who heard voices promising answers. They pass through the Cowardly Mountains on their way down, and the mountain-dwellers let them go. Anyone that determined to enter Luendrokrül won't be stopped by warnings.

### The Inhabitants

No census exists of who or what lives in the Cowardly Mountains. The terrain makes surveying impossible and the inhabitants make it inadvisable. What's known comes from occasional contact at the Safeway Passage, rare trading encounters, and the testimony of the few who've traveled deeper and returned.

**The Old Terrenians**: Descendants of refugees, clustered in three or four hidden valleys. They raise goats, grow what the thin soil allows, and maintain traditions from a country that no longer exists. Suspicious of outsiders but not automatically violent. Will trade for metal goods and news from the wider world.

**The Unaffiliated**: A catchall term for everyone else—bandits, hermits, exiles, and stranger things. No organization, no common cause, just people and creatures who needed to be somewhere no one would look. Mostly avoid each other as much as they avoid outsiders.

**The Listeners**: A name used by the Old Terrenians for something else in the mountains. Not human, not quite animal, seen only at the edges of vision. They don't attack, don't communicate, don't seem to want anything. They just watch. The Old Terrenians leave offerings at certain stones and don't speak of them to outsiders.

### Why "Cowardly"

Theories abound. The mountains shelter cowards and refugees. The stone is geologically unstable, "cowardly" rock that crumbles under stress. An old legend claims the mountains themselves fled here during some primordial cataclysm, cowering at the edge of the world.

The Old Terrenians have their own explanation, which they don't share with outsiders. When traders at the Safeway Passage have asked, the answer is always the same: *The mountains know what's in the forest. So do we. Wouldn't you hide too?*
