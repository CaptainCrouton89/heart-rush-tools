## Ponoigari

Tags: city, capital, settlement

Ponoigari is the capital of Kadroka and one of the most unusual cities in Aboyinzu. It is built around, upon, and into the petrified body of the dragon Melekas, who has ruled from this spot for nearly eight hundred years—unable to move, unable to leave, unable to do anything except think, speak, and occasionally breathe fire.

### Layout

The city radiates outward from the dragon's immobile form in roughly concentric rings:

**The Dragon District**: The innermost area, comprising the dragon's body itself and the palace complex built into it. Government functions, the treasury, and the quarters of the dragon's closest servants occupy this zone. Access is restricted and heavily guarded by the Stillwatch.

**The Inner City**: Wealthy residential areas, major temples, the homes of naga advisors and prominent human families. Streets are well-maintained, patrols are frequent, and the dragon's presence looms—literally—over everything.

**The Middle City**: Markets, craftsmen's quarters, ordinary residences. This is where most of Ponoigari's population lives and works. The atmosphere is busy but watchful; the dragon's informants are everywhere.

**The Outer City**: Poorer districts, warehouses, the camps of seasonal workers and recent arrivals. Less orderly, less safe, but also less scrutinized.

**The Approaches**: Beyond the walls, roads lead to the surrounding savanna. Fortifications protect against Tytheri raids, though no orc band has seriously threatened Ponoigari in generations—the dragon's fire makes direct assault suicidal.

### The Palace of the Stillbound

The heart of Ponoigari is the dragon's body.

Melekas's petrified form—several hundred feet from snout to tail—serves as the foundation for the palace complex. The dragon's immobile limbs and torso have been incorporated into the architecture over centuries: audience chambers carved between frozen legs, administrative offices built upon the great stone back, gardens planted in the shadow of wings that will never spread again.

The living portions of the dragon—head, neck, and one foreleg—occupy the palace's central courtyard. The throne room is simply the space before Melekas's face. Petitioners approach across stone scales, watched by an eye the size of a wagon wheel, and speak their business while the dragon's breath warms the air.

Heat radiating from the still-living portions of Melekas is channeled through the palace, warming the complex in cooler weather. Drainage systems redirect the occasional gout of flame (Melekas still sneezes, sometimes). The palace has adapted to its unique occupant over eight centuries of continuous renovation.

### Population

Ponoigari is the largest city in Kadroka, though exact population figures are uncertain. Estimates range from 30,000 to 50,000, swelling during the dry season when herders and traders come to the capital.

**Humans** form the majority. Farmers, merchants, craftspeople, soldiers—the ordinary population of any thriving city.

**Naga** are disproportionately represented in positions of power. Their ancient connection to dragons gives them privileged access to Melekas, and many naga families have served the Stillbound for generations. Human resentment of this arrangement is a constant undercurrent in city politics.

**Others**: Small populations of elves, dwarves, and other peoples pass through or settle temporarily. Kadroka's position on the mountain trade routes brings diverse visitors.

### Governance

All power flows from Melekas.

The dragon does not involve itself in day-to-day administration—eight centuries have taught patience, and human affairs move too quickly for constant draconic attention. Instead, Melekas sets broad policy, adjudicates major disputes, and maintains an extensive network of informants who report on anything significant.

Practical governance is handled by a council of advisors, heavily weighted toward naga but including prominent humans. The council interprets the dragon's will, manages taxation, oversees the military, and generally keeps the city running. Their authority derives entirely from Melekas; any advisor who loses the dragon's favor is quickly replaced.

### The Stillwatch

The city's elite guard serves the dragon directly. Stillwatch members are fanatically loyal—selection involves extensive vetting, and betrayal is punished with creative severity. They guard the Dragon District, protect the approaches to the palace, and serve as Melekas's eyes and hands throughout the city.

In combat, the Stillwatch trains to coordinate with the dragon's fire. They know exactly how far Melekas can reach, exactly how to herd enemies into the kill zone, exactly how to shelter while flame washes over their positions. Attacking Ponoigari means facing soldiers who fight alongside a weapon that cannot be flanked and does not miss.

### Economy

Ponoigari thrives on:

**Trade**: The city sits at the intersection of routes from the Dalizi Confederation (east, over the mountains) and the forest territories (north). Goods flow through regardless of the Tytheri blockade—just not by sea.

**Administration**: Government salaries, military pay, and the dragon's household expenditures inject substantial currency into the local economy.

**Craftsmanship**: Kadrokan leatherwork and metalwork are renowned. The city's artisans supply both local demand and export markets.

**Dragon Tourism**: A minor but notable industry. Some travelers come simply to see the Stillbound—one of the only paralyzed dragons in the known world, accessible to visitors (for a fee) in a way that mobile dragons never are.

### Daily Life

Living in Ponoigari means living under the dragon's eye.

Most residents have never spoken to Melekas directly and never will. But everyone knows the dragon is there, always watching, always listening through an army of informants. Major dissent is rare; minor grumbling is constant. People adapt to surveillance—they learn what topics are safe, what criticisms will be tolerated, what ambitions will draw unwanted attention.

The trade-off is genuine security. Tytheri raids that devastate frontier settlements never reach Ponoigari. Crime within the walls is swiftly punished. The streets are orderly. Compared to the chaos of many Aboyinzu settlements, the capital offers stability—at the price of freedom.

### The Dragon's Condition

Everyone in Ponoigari knows the dragon is dying.

The petrification that trapped Melekas eight hundred years ago continues to spread. Slowly—inches per decade—but visibly. The line where living scale meets dead stone creeps higher each generation. The dragon's neck moves a little less freely than it did a century ago. The one mobile foreleg responds a little more slowly.

Scholars estimate Melekas has four or five centuries before the head goes still. The dragon knows this. The dragon's advisors know this. And everyone wonders what happens to Kadroka when the Stillbound finally becomes the Still.
