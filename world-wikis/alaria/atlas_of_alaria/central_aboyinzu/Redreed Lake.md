## Redreed Lake

Tags: lake, geography

Redreed Lake is a terminal lake in southern Tythikerys, fed by the Dutunimako River and ringed by distinctive reddish reeds. It serves as one of the few permanent water sources in the southern reaches of orc territory—and it sits uncomfortably close to the Agony Stones.

### Geography

The lake occupies a shallow basin approximately 5 miles across, fed by the Dutunimako River from the east. With no outlet, the water is mildly brackish—drinkable but not pleasant.

The signature red reeds grow in dense bands around the shore, reaching heights of 8-10 feet. The coloration may come from mineral content in the water, adaptation to the local soil, or—as some suggest—proximity to the Agony Stones affecting the plant life.

### Proximity to the Stones

Redreed Lake lies roughly 15 miles north of the Agony Stones—close enough that the sympathy effect can sometimes be felt at the lakeside on bad days.

The orcs report that the sensation is worse during certain seasons, possibly connected to whatever passes for the Dying One's biological rhythms. On these days, camping at the lake becomes unpleasant: headaches, joint pain, and disturbed sleep. The orcs simply move their camps further north and wait for the effect to pass.

This proximity may explain why the lake remains a camping ground rather than developing into anything permanent. Even addicted to the Ichor, the Tytheri don't want to live this close to the source.

### Tytheri Use

During the driest months, orc bands gather at Redreed Lake—one of the only reliable water sources in southern Tythikerys. The gatherings are not formal; different warbands simply end up in the same area when water becomes scarce elsewhere.

These seasonal concentrations are the closest the Tytheri come to anything resembling a society beyond individual warbands. Disputes are settled. Information is exchanged. Thralls are traded. Tythmasters size up their rivals. Then the rains return, water becomes available elsewhere, and the bands scatter back to their territories.

### The Water

Despite its proximity to the Agony Stones, the lake water shows no obvious supernatural properties. It doesn't cause sympathy pain when drunk. It doesn't spread the petrification curse. Whatever affects people near the Stones doesn't seem to transmit through the water.

This may be because the Dutunimako River originates far from the Stones, carrying clean water into the basin. Or the lake may simply be far enough away that the effect doesn't reach. Or there may be something about water itself that doesn't carry the Dying One's influence.

The orcs don't question it. They just drink.
