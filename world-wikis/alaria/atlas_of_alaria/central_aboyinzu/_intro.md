# Central Aboyinzu

## Geography

Central Aboyinzu is the vast interior of the continent—a general term encompassing the savanna heartlands, the Deadloop inner sea, and the territories between the major mountain ranges. The terrain is a mix of tan and light green, characteristic of vast savanna and dry grassland. Think of the African Serengeti—endless golden grass beneath wide skies, punctuated by scattered trees and watering holes.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Terrenia and the states of Chaal Nazaerox, Grustos, and Quintas
- **East**: The Elderwilds peninsula and South Sea
- **South**: The Morygun Mountains and Dragon's Spine range
- **West**: Korgül forest, the Mumbling Forest, and largely uncharted wilderness of grassland and forest

### Major Geographic Features

#### The Deadloop (Inner Sea)

A large inland sea cutting into the continental interior. Key features around the Deadloop:
- **Echem Yiakraxes**: Large plains in the northwestern portion of the Deadloop
- **Donclik Sound**: Body of water due east of Echem Yiakraxes
- **Mikisapi Forest**: An island/peninsula within the Deadloop, encircled by the waterway
- **Tenches**: A city-state on Mikisapi Forest

#### The Crystal Mountains

A major mountain range running southwest to northeast across central Aboyinzu. At their southwestern point, they connect to the Morygun Mountains. At their northeastern extent, they overlap with the mountains of Grustos. Chaal Nazaerox lies to their north.

#### The Morygun Mountains

Running northwest to southeast, these mountains connect the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region (home to satyr).

### States and Territories

- **Chaal Nazaerox**: The massive northern state (shared with Terrenia)
- **Grustos & Quintas**: Eastern states near the Crystal Mountains
- **Kadroka**: Southern territory
- **Chechol**: Eastern territory, south of the Deadloop and northwest of Dalizi
- **Korgül**: Western forest region, home to satyr

## Notable Locations

### Frogsong River

Inhabited by extremely poisonous frogs.

### Crystal Mountains

#### Blinding Mines

Located deep within the Crystal Mountains at the intersection of void and air leylines, the Blinding Mines are filled with crystals of pure light that illuminate the tunnels with blinding intensity. However, the mines are extremely dangerous—the intersection of void and air leylines causes unpredictable teleportation throughout the tunnels, leading miners to become hopelessly lost or teleported into solid rock.

Despite these hazards, the mines contain valuable crystals and magical resources, drawing prospectors willing to risk the supernatural dangers. Many elves have died attempting to exploit the mines' riches.

### Morygun Mountains

A major mountain range running northwest to southeast, connecting the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region. The southern reaches of the Morygun Mountains connect to the Remakemizi Mountains north of Kadroka state.

The mountains are home to the fearsome Morygun mountain goats—thunderous ram-centaur creatures attuned to both air and earth magic. These vicious predators are violently territorial, charging at intruders with devastating force and using their elemental attunement to cause rockslides and wind blasts. Traversing the Morygun range means risking an encounter with these deadly guardians of the peaks.

#### Phaerhom

A hidden valley deep in the far southern Morygun Mountains, southeast of the Korgül forest region. This secluded vale is home to Dead Claws—dangerous predators that have adapted to the mountain environment—and a small enclave of fairies and pixies who have claimed the valley as their sanctuary.

The fairy enclave guards the valley fiercely, using illusion magic to hide the entrance and nature magic to make the surrounding mountains nearly impassable. Few outsiders even know Phaerhom exists, and those who stumble upon it are usually led astray by fairy glamours before they can find their way in.
