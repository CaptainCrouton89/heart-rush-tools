# Central Aboyinzu

## Geography

Central Aboyinzu is the vast interior of the continent—a general term encompassing the savanna heartlands, the Deadloop inner sea, and the territories between the major mountain ranges. The terrain is a mix of tan and light green, characteristic of vast savanna and dry grassland. Think of the African Serengeti—endless golden grass beneath wide skies, punctuated by scattered trees and watering holes.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Terrenia and the states of Chaal Nazaerox, Grustos, and Quintas
- **East**: The Elderwilds peninsula and South Sea
- **South**: The Morygun Mountains and Dragon's Spine range
- **West**: Korgül forest, the Mumbling Forest, and largely uncharted wilderness of grassland and forest

### Major Geographic Features

#### The Deadloop (Inner Sea)

A large inland sea cutting into the continental interior. Key features around the Deadloop:
- **Echem Yiakraxes**: Large plains in the northwestern portion of the Deadloop
- **Donclik Sound**: Body of water due east of Echem Yiakraxes
- **Mikisapi Forest**: An island/peninsula within the Deadloop, encircled by the waterway
- **Tenches**: A city-state on Mikisapi Forest

#### The Crystal Mountains

A major mountain range running southwest to northeast across central Aboyinzu. At their southwestern point, they connect to the Morygun Mountains. At their northeastern extent, they overlap with the mountains of Grustos. Chaal Nazaerox lies to their north.

#### The Morygun Mountains

Running northwest to southeast, these mountains connect the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region (home to satyr).

### States and Territories

- **Chaal Nazaerox**: The massive northern state (shared with Terrenia)
- **Grustos & Quintas**: Eastern states near the Crystal Mountains
