## Melway Pass

Tags: pass, geography, mountain

Melway Pass is a route through the northern Morygun Mountains, connecting the Korgül forest region to the lands beyond. It is one of the few reliable passages through this section of the range—and one of the most dangerous.

### Geography

The pass winds through the mountains at moderate elevation, following an ancient riverbed that has long since dried. The route is approximately 40 miles from entrance to exit, passable by foot or pack animal but not by wagon.

The terrain is rugged but navigable: rocky slopes, narrow defiles, and exposed ridgelines alternate with sheltered valleys where travelers can rest. Water is available from springs and snowmelt for most of the year.

### The Dangers

Melway Pass is dangerous not because of its terrain but because of what inhabits it.

**Morygun Mountain Goats**: The fearsome ram-centaur creatures that give the mountains their name are particularly active in this area. These territorial predators attack anyone they perceive as intruders—which is everyone. They use air and earth attunement to cause rockslides and wind blasts, making straightforward combat nearly impossible.

**Weather**: The pass channels wind into savage gusts that can knock travelers off exposed sections. Storms roll in with little warning. Snow is possible even in summer at the higher elevations.

**The Satyrs**: Korgül lies at the western end of the pass, and Greater Satyrs sometimes range into the mountains. Their attitude toward travelers varies from helpful to hostile depending on factors outsiders rarely understand.

### Usage

Despite the dangers, Melway Pass sees regular use by those who need to cross the Morygun range:

- **Traders** moving goods between Korgül and the eastern territories
- **Scholars** seeking Phaerhom or the Valley of the Witches
- **Refugees** fleeing various troubles in one direction or another
- **Adventurers** with business in the wild mountains

Most travelers hire guides—either satyr, human, or occasionally fae—who know the pass's rhythms: when the mountain goats are most active, which valleys provide safe shelter, where water can be found.

### The Name

"Melway" is attributed to various sources: a legendary traveler who first mapped the route, a corruption of an older fae term, or a descriptive phrase meaning "middle way" in some tongue. The true origin is lost.

### Relationship to Kadroka

Melway Pass lies north of Kadrokan territory, in the mountains that form the boundary between Central Aboyinzu and the wilder regions beyond. Kadrokans who wish to reach the northern forests without going through Phaerhom (and dealing with fairies) sometimes use this route.

The dragon Melekas has no particular interest in the pass, which lies far beyond the range where Kadrokan authority meaningfully extends.
