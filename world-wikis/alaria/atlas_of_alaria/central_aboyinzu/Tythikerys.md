## Tythikerys

Tags: plains, region, orc territory

Tythikerys is a vast stretch of arid scrubland in southwestern Central Aboyinzu, homeland of the Tytheri blood orcs. The region is largely empty of permanent settlement—the orcs are raiders and harvesters, not builders—but it serves a crucial strategic purpose: it separates Kadroka from the coast, landlocking the dragon-ruled state and denying it maritime trade.

### Geography

The terrain transitions from the savanna of Kadroka into increasingly dry, rocky scrubland. Sparse vegetation, seasonal watercourses, and exposed stone characterize most of the region. The land is not truly desert—rain falls, grass grows—but it is harsh and unforgiving.

**Key Features:**
- **Agony Stones**: The cursed region in the south-central area, source of the Ichor that defines Tytheri culture
- **Bluesong Bay**: Western coastline, controlled by the Tytheri but barely used
- **Mumbling Forest**: Southwestern coastal forest, avoided by most orcs
- **Bloodswamp**: Northern border region where multiple rivers converge before entering Tytheri territory
- **Fury Hills**: Southeastern hills bordering Kadroka
- **Redreed Lake**: Terminal lake in the south, fed by the Dutunimako River

### The Royko River

The Royko River is the region's main water artery, flowing southwest from the Bloodswamp through Tytheri territory to Bluesong Bay. The river and its tributaries (Sikuri, Dutunimako) provide the only reliable year-round water in the region.

Tytheri camps cluster near the river, moving seasonally to follow water and prey. The orcs have no permanent settlements on the Royko—or anywhere else—but certain traditional camping grounds are used generation after generation.

### The Tytheri Blood Orcs

The Tytheri are not a nation in any conventional sense. They are a raiding culture sustained by addiction.

Generations ago, the orcs discovered the Agony Ichor—the weeping fluid of the Dying One that lies at the heart of the Agony Stones. They learned to harvest it, process it, and consume it in rituals that grant strength, pain resistance, and the bleached-white skin that marks their kind.

But the Ichor exacts a price. Long-term consumption deadens emotion until violence is the only sensation that registers. The orcs raid Kadroka not just for resources but because they *need* to inflict suffering to feel alive. Withdrawal brings the Dying One's agony crashing down on the user—phantom pain with no physical source, lasting until more Ichor is consumed or death provides release.

### Social Structure

**Tythmasters**: Orcs fed the richest concentrations of Ichor grow to enormous size—ten feet or taller—and lead through raw physical dominance. Each warband follows a Tythmaster, and the Tythmasters loosely coordinate through tradition and mutual self-interest rather than formal hierarchy.

**Harvesters**: Specialized orcs who approach the Agony Stones to collect Ichor. This is dangerous work—the sympathy pain of the Dying One affects even the hardened Tytheri—but it is also prestigious. Harvesters know the safe paths and timing that minimize exposure.

**Raiders**: The majority of Tytheri warriors. They strike Kadrokan settlements, take what they need (cattle, slaves, supplies), and retreat before organized response can arrive.

**Thralls**: Captured slaves from Kadroka and elsewhere. Thrall life is brutal and short. Many are worked to death; some are consumed in Ichor rituals; a few are traded to other peoples for goods the Tytheri cannot make themselves.

### Raiding Patterns

Tytheri raids follow seasonal patterns:

**Dry Season**: Peak raiding activity. The orcs range far into Kadrokan territory, striking isolated settlements and herding camps. Kadrokan border patrols are spread thin trying to cover all possible approach routes.

**Wet Season**: Reduced activity. Flooding along the Royko and its tributaries makes movement difficult, and the orcs focus on internal matters—Ichor processing, thrall management, resolving disputes between warbands.

**Harvest Periods**: Several times per year, warbands send harvesting parties to the Agony Stones. These are solemn occasions—even addicted orcs fear the Stones—and raiding typically pauses while the harvest is conducted.

### Why They Hold Empty Land

Outsiders sometimes wonder why the Tytheri control such vast territory when they barely use it. The answer is simple: denial.

As long as the Tytheri hold the coastal approaches and the land around the Agony Stones, Kadroka cannot access the sea and cannot threaten the Ichor supply. The empty scrubland is a buffer zone, a killing ground for any Kadrokan force that tries to push through.

The orcs don't need to build cities. They just need to make sure no one else does either.

### The Agony Stones

The Agony Stones dominate the southern portion of Tythikerys—forty miles east to west, twenty miles north to south of contorted, branching stone formations. Even the Tytheri approach with caution.

Harvesting parties know specific routes and timing that minimize exposure to the sympathy pain. They collect Ichor from the outer formations only—no orc goes deep into the Stones. The Harvesters have traditional knowledge passed down through generations: which paths are safer, how long you can stay, what signs indicate you've pushed too far.

What lies at the center of the Stones, what the Dying One actually is, the orcs neither know nor particularly care. The Ichor flows. That is enough.

### Mumbling Forest

The southwestern coast of Tythikerys is dominated by the Mumbling Forest, a dense woodland that most Tytheri avoid. The forest gets its name from the constant low sound that pervades it—not quite voices, not quite wind, but something in between.

Whatever lives in the Mumbling Forest, it does not bother the orcs and the orcs do not bother it. A tacit understanding exists: the forest is not Tytheri territory, regardless of what maps might suggest.

### Redreed Lake

In the southern reaches of Tythikerys, the Dutunimako River feeds into Redreed Lake—a terminal lake with no outlet. The water is brackish and the reeds that ring it grow with a distinctive reddish tinge (possibly from mineral content, possibly from something else).

The lake is one of the few permanent water sources in southern Tythikerys, and orc camps gather there during the driest months. It is also uncomfortably close to the Agony Stones—close enough that the sympathy effect can sometimes be felt at the lake's edge on bad days.

### Entering Tythikerys

Outsiders who enter Tytheri territory face three threats:

1. **The Orcs**: Obviously. Small parties will be hunted. Larger parties will be watched and harassed until they leave or die.

2. **The Land**: Harsh terrain with limited water. Navigation is difficult. The orcs know every water source; outsiders do not.

3. **The Stones**: Anyone approaching the Agony Stones faces the same dangers as the orcs—sympathy pain, petrification risk, dream invasion—without the traditional knowledge that makes survival possible.

The safest approach (using that term loosely) is from the sea via Bluesong Bay. The Tytheri have no navy and rarely patrol the coast. But landing safely is only the beginning of the problem.
