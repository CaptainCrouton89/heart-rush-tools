## Falsehaven Bay

Tags: bay, geography

A broad, sheltered bay on Central Aboyinzu's western coast, where Satyr Wood meets the sea. The name dates back centuries, to a time when ships still occasionally sailed these waters and learned—too late—that the bay's shelter came with costs.

### Geography

Falsehaven Bay cuts roughly fifteen miles inland, protected from open ocean swells by a curving headland to the north. The water is deep enough for large vessels, the anchorage good, the beaches suitable for landing. By every practical measure, it's an excellent natural harbor.

The problem is what surrounds it.

The bay's shores are mostly wetland—coastal marsh fed by the Bluecras River and smaller streams draining from Satyr Wood. The ground is soft, the vegetation dense, and the transition from water to solid land unclear. Beyond the marshes, the forest begins immediately, pressing down to the waterline in places where the ground firms up enough to support trees.

Noso Lake sits just inland from the bay's eastern shore, connected to the sea by a tidal channel that floods twice daily. The lake's western edge effectively merges with the coastal wetlands, creating a maze of waterways, mudflats, and reed beds that only locals can navigate reliably.

### The Name

Ships used to shelter here. The bay offered protection from storms, fresh water from the river, and what appeared to be safe anchorage far from any obvious threats.

Then the pipes would start.

The satyrs learned early that their music carried across water. A Pipe-Lord on the shore could reach sailors anchored in the bay, drawing them toward land with songs that promised safety, pleasure, rest. Some crews resisted. Most didn't. Those who came ashore rarely returned to their ships.

The bay earned its name from survivors—the few who escaped, the occasional vessel that fled before the music took hold. They carried warnings south and north: the haven is false, the shelter is a trap, the bay belongs to something that hunts with sound.

### Current State

Traffic along this coast has dwindled to almost nothing. The shipping lanes run further west, avoiding the entire shoreline. Fishing vessels from distant ports occasionally appear, but they know better than to anchor overnight. The bay sits empty most of the year, its natural harbor wasted on creatures who have no use for ships.

The satyrs still watch the water. The war-bands that control the Noso Lake territory maintain lookouts on the headlands, more from habit than necessity. When a vessel does appear—once every few years, usually storm-driven or lost—the old techniques still work. The pipes still carry. The songs still compel.

But mostly the bay is quiet. The marshes breed insects and waterfowl. The tides come and go. The forest watches the sea, and the sea has learned to watch back.

### The Coastal Satyrs

The war-bands near Falsehaven Bay occupy an unusual position in satyr society. Their territory includes the only significant contact point between Satyr Wood and the outside world, which gives them access to goods and knowledge that inland bands lack—but also marks them as tainted by that contact.

They're the satyrs most likely to speak common tongue, most likely to have human-made goods, most likely to understand how the outside world works. Other war-bands view them with suspicion, as if proximity to the coast has somehow diluted their satyr nature. The coastal bands view the inland bands as provincial and ignorant, fighting the same territorial squabbles for generations while the world beyond the forest changes without them.

This tension rarely escalates to open conflict—the coastal bands are too useful as a source of outside goods, and too far from the political center at Pirison Lake to threaten anyone's position. But it adds another layer to the already complicated caste dynamics of satyr society.
