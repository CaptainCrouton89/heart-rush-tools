## Fyrsan Al Troikas

Tags: mountains, geography

A jagged mountain range forming the eastern boundary of Satyr Wood, running roughly north-south for over a hundred miles. The name is old—possibly Spine Goblin in origin, possibly older—and translates approximately to "the teeth that bite back." The mountains have earned the name. They're treacherous for everyone, including the goblins who call them home.

### Geography

The Fyrsan Al Troikas rise sharply from the forest floor, their western faces a wall of broken cliffs and unstable scree slopes. The peaks are not particularly high by mountain standards, but they're brutally steep, with knife-edge ridges connecting summits that seem designed to funnel travelers into dead ends and killing grounds.

The rock itself is unreliable. Shale and limestone dominate, prone to crumbling underfoot and sheering away without warning. Paths that existed last season may have collapsed. Handholds that look solid give way. The mountains punish anyone who doesn't know them intimately, and even those who do sometimes miscalculate.

Weather adds another layer of danger. Storms blow in from the east without warning, turning slopes slick and filling ravines with flash floods. Fog settles in the valleys and doesn't lift for days. Snow lingers in the high passes well into summer, hiding crevasses and weak points in the ice.

### The Spine Goblins

The Spine Goblins have lived in these mountains long enough that no one—including the goblins themselves—remembers when they arrived. They're adapted to the terrain in ways that seem almost deliberate: smaller and lighter than lowland goblins, with longer fingers for gripping rock and an uncanny sense of balance. They move through the mountains like the terrain was built for them, which it effectively was—they've spent generations learning every stable path, every reliable handhold, every route that won't collapse.

They live in the peaks themselves. Not caves at the base of the mountains, but warrens carved into the ridges and summits, accessible only by climbs that would kill most other creatures. From these positions they watch everything below—the forest, the approaches, the satyr war-bands that occasionally attempt to push into the mountains.

Spine Goblin society is organized around raiding. They have little capacity for agriculture and less interest in it. What they need, they take: food from the forest edge, metal from occasional traders foolish enough to enter their territory, captives for labor and darker purposes. Their raids into Satyr Wood are quick, brutal, and carefully calculated—they know exactly how far they can push before the satyrs respond in force, and they rarely miscalculate.

The satyrs hate them with a passion that borders on religious. Generations of border warfare have created blood feuds that neither side can abandon. Greater Satyr war-bands mount expeditions into the mountains regularly, seeking to clear goblin warrens and claim revenge for past raids. These expeditions usually fail. The goblins know the terrain too well, retreat too easily, and return too quickly once the satyrs withdraw.

### The Border War

The conflict between Satyr Wood and the Fyrsan Al Troikas has no beginning anyone remembers and no end anyone expects. It's simply a fact of life in this region—satyrs raid into the mountains, goblins raid into the forest, both sides take losses, neither side gains ground permanently.

For the satyrs, the war serves a purpose beyond territory. It provides enemies to fight, glory to claim, and a way for ambitious warriors to prove themselves. A satyr who returns from a mountain raid with goblin trophies gains status. A satyr who leads a successful expedition gains more.

For the goblins, the war is survival. They need what the forest provides, and they lack the numbers or strength to take it by force. Raiding is the only option, and defending against satyr reprisals is the cost.

The border itself is poorly defined—a rough line where forest gives way to mountain slope, contested ground that belongs to whoever holds it at any given moment. Watch-posts change hands regularly. Ambush sites are used by both sides depending on who gets there first. The only constant is the fighting.

### Beyond the Mountains

East of the Fyrsan Al Troikas, the terrain drops into lower hills and eventually the coastal regions beyond. Few from Satyr Wood have seen this—the mountains are an effective barrier in both directions. Trade routes that might otherwise connect the satyr lands to the eastern coast instead swing far north or south, avoiding the goblin-held passes entirely.

The Spine Goblins maintain some contact with the lands to the east, though the nature of this contact is unclear. Traders occasionally appear from that direction, and the goblins have metal goods and worked materials that they certainly didn't make themselves. Whether this represents formal trade relationships or simply the proceeds of raiding is impossible to say from the satyr side of the mountains.
