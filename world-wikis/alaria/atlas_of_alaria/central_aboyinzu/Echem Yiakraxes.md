## Echem Yiakraxes

Tags: savannah, plains, geography, terrogone, dangerous

A vast killing ground in northwestern Central Aboyinzu, Echem Yiakraxes is Terrogone territory—and everyone knows it. The name translates roughly from Old Aboyinzan as "the Empty Throne," though whether this refers to some forgotten kingdom or the Terrogones' unchallenged dominion is lost to history. Caravans route around it. Armies avoid it. The few explorers who've returned describe endless tan grass under a bleached sky, the silence broken only by wind and the distant crack of bones.

### The Claimed Land

The Terrogones have hunted here for centuries, and the land shows it. Prey animals have been culled to near-extinction; what remains are creatures too fast, too poisonous, or too clever to catch. The grass grows sparse and brittle. Watering holes are killing grounds, ringed with the gnawed remains of the desperate and the foolish.

Terrogone family groups claim territories of dozens of square miles, marked at the borders by **bone totems**—vertical stakes of fused skulls and femurs, treated with some substance that preserves them against rot. The message is clear. Travelers who ignore it rarely get a second warning.

The scattered mountain formations in the northern reaches serve as Terrogone strongholds. Caves and overhangs provide shelter, elevation for spotting prey, and defensible positions during the rare inter-family conflicts. These aren't settlements in any civilized sense—more like predator dens scaled up for creatures that stand six feet tall on all fours.

### What the Terrogones Protect

The Chulpe race file mentions that Terrogones serve as "protector of the region's most dangerous secrets." This isn't metaphor. Something lies at the heart of Echem Yiakraxes that the Terrogones guard with unusual deliberation—not merely hunting intruders, but *preventing access* to specific locations.

Nyavminthk Castle is the obvious candidate. The Terrogones don't occupy the ruin, but they patrol its approaches. Scholars who've studied Terrogone behavior from safe distances note that family groups that normally war over territory cooperate when it comes to the castle's perimeter. Whatever's inside, they want it to stay there.

Local theories range from the mundane (a breeding ground, a food cache) to the apocalyptic (a sealed daemon, a leyline wound, something from before the current age). The Terrogones aren't talking.

### Survival and Transit

Nobody crosses Echem Yiakraxes by choice. Those who must—usually pursuing bounties, fleeing worse things, or catastrophically lost—follow a few hard-won rules:

- **Travel by night.** Terrogones hunt dawn and dusk. Midday heat and full darkness offer narrow windows.
- **Stay downwind.** Their sense of smell is extraordinary. Experienced travelers carry packets of bitter herbs that mask scent.
- **Never approach water.** Terrogones stake out every watering hole. Bring everything you need or die thirsty.
- **If you see a bone totem, you're already being watched.** Turn back. Running triggers pursuit.

The Tasqh Evikkris river along the western edge offers the only reliable transit. River traffic stays close to the water; the Terrogones rarely hunt the banks. Why they avoid the river is unclear—possibly the current is too strong for their bulk, possibly something in the water they've learned to respect.

### What It Looks Like

Endless tan grass, knee-high and razor-edged, stretching to a horizon that shimmers with heat. The soil is pale and powdery, kicked into dust clouds by the constant wind. Scattered acacia-like trees offer the only shade, their branches hung with old kills—Terrogone markers or simply convenient storage. The sky feels too large, too empty. Sound carries for miles, which means silence is survival.

The smell is dry grass, old blood, and something musky-sharp that travelers learn to recognize as Terrogone scent. Once you know it, you never forget it.

### For Adventurers

Echem Yiakraxes offers:

- **Nyavminthk Castle** at its heart—a dungeon guarded not by traps but by apex predators
- **Terrogone politics** to exploit, if you're clever enough to play family groups against each other
- **Ancient secrets** the Terrogones are protecting, which means someone powerful wants them protected
- **Survival challenges** that test resource management, stealth, and the wisdom to know when to turn back
- **The question** that drives the foolhardy: what could possibly be worth guarding this hard?
