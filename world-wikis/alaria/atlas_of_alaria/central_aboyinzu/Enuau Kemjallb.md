## Enuau Kemjallb

Tags: citystate

The radiant House of the Sun—a golden city-state of the Kryaaji sun elves, forbidden to outsiders. Enuau Kemjallb rises from the shores of Sopona Fia lake in western Grustos, its white stone towers and golden domes reflecting sunlight in displays visible for miles. The Light leyline passes directly through the city, and the Kryaaji believe this is no coincidence.

The sun elves maintain strict isolation not from arrogance but from sacred duty. They believe their light and their home are too pure for outsiders to touch—that contact with the wider world would diminish what they guard. Visitors are turned away at the boundary markers, politely but with spears ready. The Lightbearer priests who patrol these borders radiate actual sunlight from their eye sockets, a reminder that the Kryaaji's faith is not merely symbolic.

Trade with the outside world occurs at designated boundary markets along the Flejdeaako Yni river, never within the city itself. Merchants leave goods at appointed places; the elves collect what interests them and leave payment. No haggling. No conversation. The system works because Kryaaji craftsmanship commands premium prices, and their Wysynnbre-trained eagles are beyond price entirely.

### The Wysynnbre

The golden, luminant eagles of the Sunwing Peaks nest in eyries maintained by the Kryaaji for generations. These magnificent creatures bond with sun elf handlers through rituals of magical symbiosis—each pair sharing senses, emotions, and something deeper. A Kryaaji with a bonded Wysynnbre can see through the eagle's eyes across vast distances, and the eagle gains a measure of its partner's wisdom.

The eagles are never sold. Occasionally, one chooses a non-Kryaaji handler—this is rare, disturbing to the sun elves, and considered a matter for the individual eagle's judgment rather than elven intervention.

### The Order of Bryn

The Kryaaji maintain their own sect of the Order of Bryn, differing from mainland branches in one crucial belief: they hold that Bryn, the Awakened Sun, was an elf rather than a human. This theological distinction has caused friction with other Bryn-worshippers, but the Kryaaji consider outside opinions irrelevant. Their Lightbearer priests demonstrate powers that mainstream clergy cannot replicate, which they take as vindication.

### Relations

**Grustos**: The sun elves technically reside within Grustos's claimed territory, but no one in Cañas pretends to have authority over Enuau Kemjallb. The relationship is one of mutual non-interference.

**Giant Herders**: The nomadic giants who pass through Giants' Corridor give the sun elf city wide berth. Whether this is respect, fear, or simply disinterest is unclear.

**Aciabro Goblins**: The blood-mechanists of the Sunwing Peaks have no contact with the Kryaaji. Both peoples prefer it that way.
