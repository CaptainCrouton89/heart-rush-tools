## Nyavminthk Castle

Tags: fortress, poi, ruins, dungeon, mystery

A crumbling fortress at the heart of Echem Yiakraxes, Nyavminthk Castle is the reason the Terrogones are here—or at least, the reason they stay. The massive Chulpe predators that dominate the surrounding plains don't occupy the ruin, don't hunt within its walls, and don't let anyone else approach it. Family groups that spend generations warring over territory cooperate seamlessly when it comes to the castle's perimeter. Whatever's inside, they want it to stay there.

### The Structure

What remains suggests the castle was never large—more a fortified keep than a sprawling complex. The outer wall, where it still stands, encloses perhaps two acres. A central tower rises four stories, its upper levels collapsed into rubble. Secondary structures cluster around the tower's base, their purposes unclear beneath centuries of weathering and deliberate damage.

The architecture is wrong for the region. The stonework shows techniques associated with the high elves of the Second Eon—precision-cut blocks fitted without mortar, corners aligned to astronomical positions, foundations driven deep into bedrock. But high elves never settled this far into Aboyinzu, and the castle's isolation makes no strategic or economic sense by elven standards.

The name "Nyavminthk" appears in no known elven lexicon. Linguists who've studied the word suggest it might be a corruption or a loanword from something older.

### What the Terrogones Do

The Terrogones maintain a permanent watch on the castle from a distance of roughly half a mile. Scouts from multiple family groups patrol overlapping routes, ensuring no approach goes unobserved. This cooperation is unprecedented—Terrogones are violently territorial with each other everywhere else in Echem Yiakraxes.

They don't enter the castle. They don't approach the walls. When prey animals flee toward the ruin, Terrogones break off pursuit at an invisible boundary line. When intruders attempt to reach the castle, Terrogones intercept them well before they arrive.

This behavior suggests *instruction*—that at some point, something taught the Terrogones to guard this place and stay out of it. Whether this instruction came from within the castle or from an outside party is unknown.

### What's Inside

No reliable accounts exist. The few expeditions that penetrated Terrogone territory and reached the castle walls found the gates sealed—not locked, but fused, as if the stone had melted and rehardened. Windows on the lower levels are similarly blocked. The upper tower, accessible in theory via climbing, has collapsed inward, filling potential entry points with debris.

**What's suspected:**

- **A prison.** The sealed entrances, the guards who won't enter, the cooperation between territorial predators—all consistent with containment.
- **A leyline wound.** Some catastrophic magical event that scarred reality. The Terrogones might be protecting travelers *from* the castle rather than protecting something inside.
- **A daemon's anchor.** A binding site for one of the major or minor daemons, with the Terrogones serving as unwitting (or willing) wardens.
- **Something from before.** First Eon artifacts. Pre-human construction. Things that shouldn't exist in the current age.

**What's been observed:**

- The castle produces no light, no sound, no smell.
- Birds don't land on it. Insects don't approach.
- The stone is cold to the touch even in the height of summer.
- Magical detection reveals nothing—either the castle is warded against scrying or there's genuinely nothing inside to detect.

### Getting There

Reaching Nyavminthk Castle requires crossing miles of Terrogone hunting ground, evading or surviving apex predators who specifically watch for anyone heading in this direction, and then finding a way past sealed entrances designed to stay closed.

Known approaches:

- **Overland from the west**: Follow the Tasqh Evikkris river as far south as possible, then cut east across open savanna. Estimated three days of travel through active Terrogone territory.
- **Through the Forest of Avarice**: Enter the forest from the Deadloop coast and navigate west, emerging onto the plains closer to the castle. Trades Terrogone danger for whatever hunts in the forest.
- **Aerial approach**: Theoretically possible for those with flight magic or tamed flying mounts. The Terrogones can't pursue into the sky—but landing near the castle puts you in the middle of their territory with no easy retreat.

No approach is safe. All have been tried. None have resulted in entry to the castle itself.

### For Adventurers

Nyavminthk Castle offers:

- **The ultimate dungeon delve**—if you can get in, if there's anything inside, if you can get out
- **A mystery** that's survived for centuries: what's worth this much protection?
- **Terrogone politics** as potential leverage—what would a family group accept in exchange for looking the other way?
- **The sealed doors** as a puzzle: what force could unseal them?
- **The possibility** that the Terrogones are right, and some doors should stay closed
