## Grustos

Tags: state, nation

A mountainous state in Central Aboyinzu defined by the uneasy coexistence of three very different peoples: the isolationist Kryaaji sun elves of Enuau Kemjallb, the blood-mechanist Aciabro goblins in the high peaks, and the nomadic giant herders who pass through seasonally. The human population—concentrated in the central lowlands around Cañas—has learned to navigate between these powers, profiting where possible and staying out of the way when necessary.

The Light leyline cuts east-west through Grustos, passing directly through Enuau Kemjallb before continuing into Qintas. Whether this explains the sun elves' presence or merely validates their choice of location depends on who you ask.

Grustos is not wealthy by Aboyinzu standards. The mountains limit agriculture; the sun elves don't share; the goblins trade only in blood-soaked machinery no sane person wants. What prosperity exists comes from the giant herder migrations—seasonal trade fairs that briefly transform sleepy towns into chaotic markets—and from serving as a buffer between the undead horrors of Chaal Nazzerox to the west and the more civilized states to the east.

### Mountains

#### Sunwing Peaks

The western mountain range, named for the magnificent Wysynnbre—golden, luminant eagles that soar among the peaks. These are not ordinary birds. They glow with inner light, live for centuries, and bond with the Kryaaji sun elves through rituals of magical symbiosis.

The Kryaaji maintain eyries throughout the Sunwing Peaks, tending generations of eagle lineages. Non-elves who venture too deep into eagle territory are not attacked but are watched—and reported. The sun elves know everything that happens in their mountains.

The Aciabro goblins also inhabit the Sunwing Peaks, in workshops carved into the rock far from the eagle eyries. The two peoples ignore each other with practiced determination.

#### Giants' Corridor

A broad passage between the Sunwing Peaks and the Torulius Mountains, carved by glaciers in some forgotten age. The corridor is the traditional route for nomadic giant herders bringing their flocks between summer and winter pastures.

The giants are pastoral, not aggressive—enormous figures tending herds of equally enormous beasts, moving through human lands like ships passing fishing boats. They trade at designated stops, exchanging wool, leather, and exotic meats for manufactured goods they can't produce while nomadic. Then they move on, and the corridor falls quiet until the next migration.

The corridor towns have adapted. Buildings are reinforced against accidental giant footsteps. Markets include giant-scale stalls. Children learn early to watch the ground for shadows.

#### Torulius Mountains

The northern range, less dramatic than the Sunwing Peaks but more accessible. Mining operations extract iron and copper from the Torulius slopes, feeding Grustos's modest metalworking industry.

The mountains are not uninhabited—small communities of herders and miners dot the lower slopes—but they lack the dramatic populations of the Sunwing Peaks. No sun elves, no blood-goblins, no giants. Just rock, ore, and people trying to make a living.

### Forests

#### Sobrevire

A substantial forest along the eastern border with Qintas, claimed by both states and controlled by neither. The Sobrevire serves as a buffer zone—Grustani woodcutters work the western edges while Qintan vintners harvest from the east, and both sides pretend the middle doesn't exist.

The forest is old, dense, and poorly mapped. Travelers who stray from the main roads report disorientation, lost time, and the sense of being observed. Whether this reflects actual danger or merely the forest's reputation is unclear. Most people stick to the roads.

#### Bolsaña P'Suelos

A southern forest whose name translates roughly as "bag of soils"—a reference to the unusual variety of ground conditions within its boundaries. Sandy patches border clay deposits border rocky outcrops, sometimes within the same clearing. Botanists find the forest fascinating; everyone else finds it annoying.

The varied soil produces varied flora, including several medicinal plants found nowhere else in the region. Herbalists from across Central Aboyinzu make pilgrimages to Bolsaña P'Suelos, though they often hire local guides—the forest's patchwork terrain makes navigation difficult.

### Lakes and Rivers

#### Sopona Fia

A large lake in the western region, its shores dominated by the gleaming towers of Enuau Kemjallb. The Kryaaji consider the lake sacred—its waters reflect sunlight in patterns they read for omens, and bathing in its depths is part of their religious practice.

Outsiders are not permitted on the lake. Those who try find their boats mysteriously becalmed, their oars heavy, their progress impossible. The sun elves don't need guards when the lake itself enforces their boundaries.

#### Sopona Strempele

A smaller lake in the central region, near the town of Opela Sopona. Unlike its larger cousin, Sopona Strempele welcomes visitors—fishing boats work its waters, and swimming is a popular summer activity.

Local legend claims the two Sopona lakes were once connected, separated when a sun elf priest raised the land between them to create privacy for Enuau Kemjallb. The geological evidence is ambiguous.

#### Flejdeaako Yni River

The primary river feeding Sopona Fia, flowing from the Torulius Mountains through the northern lowlands. The Kryaaji boundary markets operate along this river—the closest most traders ever get to the sun elf city.

The river's name is Kryaaji, roughly translating to "golden approach." In certain light, the water does seem to carry a golden tint, though whether this is mineral content, leyline influence, or elven magic is debated.

#### Sopo Calisando River

A southern river draining the Bolsaña P'Suelos forest toward the coast. The Calisando is shallow, slow, and warm—poor for transport but excellent for irrigation. The farms along its banks produce most of Grustos's grain.

#### Tasah Evikktus River

A southwestern river notable primarily for what it passes: the ruins of Skyloft Castle. The river's name predates the castle's fall, suggesting it was significant before the fortress was built—or that the fortress was built because of the river's significance.

### Settlements

#### Cañas

The capital of Grustos, positioned centrally where the Giants' Corridor meets the lowland roads. Cañas exists because someone has to coordinate between the state's disparate populations, and the humans decided it might as well be them.

The city is practical rather than beautiful—sturdy buildings, wide streets (for giant traffic during migration seasons), and a government focused on keeping everyone calm. The ruling council includes representatives from all major populations: human merchants, giant clan-speakers (when available), and a perpetually empty chair reserved for the Kryaaji, who have never sent a delegate.

The Aciabro goblins are not represented. They've never asked to be.

#### Amaro

A northern city near the Torulius Mountains, serving as the primary market for giant herder goods during migration seasons. For three months of the year, Amaro transforms into one of the largest trade fairs in Central Aboyinzu. The rest of the year, it's a quiet mining town wondering where everyone went.

#### San Isidrio

A central city along the main road between Cañas and Qintas. San Isidrio has positioned itself as a waystation for travelers and merchants, offering comfortable inns, reliable supplies, and absolutely nothing memorable. This is intentional—the city profits from traffic passing through, not from giving anyone reason to linger.

#### Tacuarembo

A city in the agricultural heartland, surrounded by the farms that feed Grustos. Tacuarembo is quietly proud of being boring—no sun elves, no goblins, no giants, just humans growing food and minding their business. Visitors from the more dramatic parts of the state often find it restful.

#### Belén

A southern city near the Skyloft Castle ruins, drawing scholars and treasure-hunters interested in whatever caused the fortress to fall. Belén's economy has become dependent on these visitors—guides, supplies, lodging, and discreet medical care for those who return injured.

The city council officially discourages exploration of the ruins. The city economy would collapse without it.

#### Tropizo

A town in the corridor route, existing primarily to service giant herder caravans. The buildings are reinforced; the streets are wide; the locals have perfected the art of getting out of the way quickly.

#### Alejendrina

A town in the central region, known for its pottery. The varied clays of the Bolsaña P'Suelos forest provide raw materials; local artisans have developed distinctive glazing techniques. Alejendrina ceramics are minor exports, nothing compared to Sondoros wine, but they have their admirers.

#### Opela Sopona

A lakeside town on Sopona Strempele, the accessible lake. Fishing, swimming, and a relaxed atmosphere draw visitors from across Grustos—the closest thing the state has to a resort town. The proximity to Enuau Kemjallb adds exotic appeal, even though the sun elf city is neither visible nor accessible from here.

#### Zambullón

A small village in the southern forest fringe, surviving on herbalism and logging. Zambullón guides are considered essential for anyone entering the Bolsaña P'Suelos—they know which patches of ground will support weight and which will swallow a traveler to the knees.

### Points of Interest

#### Skyloft Castle

A ruined fortress on the Tasah Evikktus river, its towers collapsed and its walls breached. What happened to Skyloft is unclear—the records are incomplete, and the survivors (if any) didn't explain.

The ruins are old, predating the current political arrangement by centuries. Some architecture suggests giant construction; other elements are clearly human-scale. The fortress may have been built cooperatively, in an era when such things were possible.

Whatever destroyed Skyloft left traces. The ruins are not safe. Expeditions report structural instability, residual magical effects, and—occasionally—things moving in the lower levels. Belén's economy depends on these expeditions. Belén's graveyards receive their failures.

### What Makes Grustos Interesting

- **Three peoples, one territory**: Sun elves, blood-goblins, and giant herders share space with humans. The balance is delicate.
- **The Light leyline**: Passes through Enuau Kemjallb and affects... something. The sun elves know more than they share.
- **Giant migration seasons**: Twice yearly, the state transforms. Trade booms, then vanishes.
- **Skyloft's secrets**: Whatever destroyed the castle is still there. Adventurers keep trying to find out what.
- **Buffer state**: Grustos sits between Chaal Nazzerox's horrors and Qintas's civilization. If the undead break out, Grustos falls first.
