## Chechol

Tags: region, state

A landlocked territory in southeastern Central Aboyinzu, defined by three river valleys that drain northward into the Deadloop inner sea. Chechol sits between the vast savannas of the interior and the Dalizi Confederation to the south—a transitional zone where the flat grasslands begin to rise into the Dalizi highlands.

The landscape is rolling savanna punctuated by river-cut valleys. The valleys themselves are green and cultivated—wheat, vegetables, orchards—while the highlands between them remain wild grassland dotted with Rentar monasteries. From the highlands, you can see for miles: golden grass rippling in the wind, the distant gleam of the Deadloop to the north, and the hazy rise of the Dalizi mountains to the south.

### The Three Rivers

Three river systems define Chechol's geography, each carving a valley from the southern highlands to the northern lowlands:

#### Chechik River

The westernmost and largest river, originating in the highlands near the Pyramid of Five Sides and flowing north-northeast toward the Deadloop drainage. The Chechik Valley is the political and economic heart of Chechol.

**Major Settlements:**
- **Sevich** (capital, ~15,000): Where the Chechik widens before joining the Deadloop system. Seat of Duke Vorotny, home to the Grand Temple of Communion.
- **Astopol** (~8,000): Upriver from Sevich, a market town serving the central valley's agricultural lands.
- **Pyadrov** (~6,000): Near the river's headwaters, the gateway to the southern highlands and the Pyramid.

#### Stulov River

The central river, smaller than the Chechik but supporting the most productive farmland. The Stulov Valley is Chechol's breadbasket—wide, flat, and intensively cultivated.

**Major Settlements:**
- **Stulovka** (~7,000): The valley's main town, a prosperous agricultural center known for grain markets.
- **Yeletity** (~4,000): A smaller town upriver, increasingly dominated by a nearby Rentar monastery.

#### Riki River

The easternmost river, closest to the Dalizi border and the School of Summoning. The Riki Valley is the most rural and the most Rentar-influenced—fewer human farms, more monasteries, and a growing atmosphere of religious intensity.

**Major Settlements:**
- **Prozny** (~5,000): The largest town in the Riki Valley, serving as a waystation for travelers to the School of Summoning.

### The Highlands

Between the river valleys, the highlands rise in gentle swells of savanna grass. These uplands are sparsely populated by human standards, but they're where the Rentar have made their home.

**Rentar Monasteries**

Scattered across the highlands are dozens of Rentar monasteries—stone compounds built for contemplation, martial training, and spiritual communion. Each monastery maintains gardens, livestock, and training grounds sufficient for self-sufficiency. They trade with the valley towns but could survive without them.

The largest concentration of monasteries lies between the Stulov and Riki valleys, in the highlands south of Yeletity. This region has become informally known as the **Holy Hills**, though the name makes human residents uncomfortable—it feels presumptuous, like the Rentar are claiming the land's soul.

**The Pyramid of Five Sides**

In the highlands between the Chechik and Stulov valleys, southeast of Pyadrov. See the full entry for details. The Pyramid predates human settlement—a stepped structure whose fifth face exists only in Celestia. Pilgrims come from across Aboyinzu to meditate in its shadow.

### Lake Ntsa

A small lake on the eastern border, straddling Chechol and the Dalizi city-state of Turbuni. The School of Summoning overlooks Lake Ntsa from a ridge on its western shore. The lake itself is unremarkable—good fishing, pleasant views—but its border position makes it diplomatically significant.

### Climate and Terrain

Chechol has a classic savanna climate: wet season (roughly 60 days) brings thunderstorms and flooding in the river valleys; dry season means golden grass and dust. The highlands stay cooler than the valleys, catching breezes from the south.

Travel is easiest along the river valleys, where roads connect the major towns. Highland travel requires guides—the terrain isn't dangerous, but it's featureless enough that travelers lose their bearings. The Rentar navigate by landmarks invisible to outsiders: a particular rock, a twisted tree, a monastery bell audible only at certain hours.

### Borders

- **North**: The Deadloop inner sea and its surrounding territories
- **East**: The Dalizi city-states (Turbuni directly borders)
- **South**: The Dalizi highlands, rising toward Lake Tonactlet Chipe
- **West**: The open savannas of Central Aboyinzu

### Notable Locations

#### Sevich

The capital city, where the Chechik River widens into a marshy delta before joining the Deadloop drainage. Sevich sprawls along both banks, connected by three bridges. The ducal palace sits on the western bank's highest point; the Grand Temple of Communion dominates the eastern bank.

The city feels old and comfortable—stone buildings weathered by centuries, streets worn smooth by generations of feet. It's also quieter than it should be. Visitors notice that people speak softly, defer quickly, avoid disagreement. The Rentar presence isn't overbearing, but it's pervasive. Even the humans seem to be waiting for guidance before acting.

#### The Pyramid of Five Sides

A stepped pyramid of unknown origin, its four visible faces oriented to the cardinal directions. The structure is made of stone that doesn't match any local quarry—pale gray, almost luminous in certain light. The fifth face exists only in Celestia; those who enter during specific celestial alignments can cross between planes.

The Pyramid is tended by the Keepers of the Fifth Face, an order of Rentar monks who've maintained the site for centuries. Pilgrims come to meditate, seek visions, or attempt the crossing. Most experience nothing. A few receive genuine celestial inspiration. Rarely, someone doesn't come back.

#### The School of Summoning

On a ridge overlooking Lake Ntsa, technically on the border with Turbuni. The School has operated for over two thousand years, training summoners and communion practitioners who serve across Aboyinzu. Its campus includes the Spire of Calling, the Communion Halls, the Binding Grounds, and the Archives.

#### The Holy Hills

The highland region between the Stulov and Riki valleys, where Rentar monasteries are most concentrated. This isn't an official designation—maps call it the Southern Highlands—but locals use the name, sometimes reverently, sometimes uneasily.

The monasteries here are older and larger than those elsewhere in Chechol. Some have stood for over a thousand years. Their bells ring at dawn and dusk, audible for miles across the grasslands—a sound that human residents have grown up with, comforting and unsettling in equal measure.

### Roads and Travel

**The Valley Road**

A well-maintained road connecting Sevich to Prozny via Stulovka, running roughly north-south through the river valleys. This is Chechol's main artery—merchants, pilgrims, and officials travel it constantly.

**The Pyramid Road**

A secondary route from Pyadrov to the Pyramid of Five Sides, then continuing south into the Dalizi highlands. Less traveled, more scenic, and increasingly used by Rentar moving between monasteries.

**Highland Tracks**

Unmarked paths connecting the monasteries across the highlands. Outsiders need guides; the Rentar navigate by sound, smell, and landmarks invisible to others.

### What Visitors Notice

First-timers to Chechol often describe feeling watched—not threatened, but observed. The Rentar are everywhere, even when you can't see them. Their monastery bells mark the hours. Their silent figures stand on hilltops at dawn. Their certainty fills every conversation.

The humans are friendly but reserved. They answer questions but rarely volunteer information. They smile but rarely laugh. Longtime visitors say the population has grown quieter over the decades—more deferential, less argumentative, slower to make decisions without consultation.

The land itself is beautiful. Golden savannas, green river valleys, ancient monuments. It would be peaceful if not for the feeling that everyone is waiting for something.
