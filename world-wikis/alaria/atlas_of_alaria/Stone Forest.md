## Stone Forest

Tags: forest

The entire forest is made of stone, including all of the wildlife. Entry is forbidden by a pact long forgotten, but agreed to by Enymu and Nektuna. In the roots of the trees of the forest lie strange crystals, known as titan crystals. When touched by sentient beings, they ring out at a frequency only titans can hear. They may cause Hykravones to stir.
