## Da Trang

Tags: state, nation

Da Trang controls the northern reaches of the Jungles of Godahi, a territory defined by its position between the Green Mountains and the deeper jungle to the south. The nation commands the jungle interior and the vital mountain passes connecting the Godahi basin to the coastal settlements around Micah Inlet.

### Geography

Da Trang's territory stretches roughly 80 miles east to west and 70 miles north to south. Its defining features:

- **North**: The Green Mountains form Da Trang's northern boundary, rising dramatically from the jungle floor
- **West**: Borders Qet Yemani, where the Darkwater Swamp lies just across the frontier
- **East**: Shares a border with New Chimea, meeting at the Hell's Paradise region
- **South**: The jungle continues into the territories of Qet Yemani and Vystrilik

The **Nuodyak River** flows south through the heart of Da Trang, providing the primary route through the dense jungle interior. This river is Da Trang's lifeline—nearly all settlements cluster along its banks or tributaries.

### Green Mountains

The Green Mountains rise 6,000-8,000 feet along Da Trang's northern frontier, forming a natural wall between the jungle basin and the coastal lowlands around Micah Inlet. Despite their name (derived from the dense vegetation on their lower slopes), the higher peaks are bare granite, often shrouded in clouds.

The mountains are notorious for their dangerous inhabitants. **Trolls** lair in the caves and ravines, emerging at night to hunt. **Wyverns** nest on the upper cliffs, and their territorial flights are a constant hazard for travelers. The mountain passes are few and well-guarded—controlling them gives Da Trang significant leverage over trade between the coast and the interior.

### Major Settlements

#### Tunrrus

A fortified town in the northern jungle, positioned near the approaches to the Green Mountain passes. Tunrrus serves as Da Trang's gateway to the north—caravans heading to or from the coastal regions gather here before attempting the mountain crossing. The town maintains a garrison experienced in mountain warfare and troll-hunting.

#### Gjetlak

A settlement on the upper Nuodyak River, Gjetlak functions as a waypoint between Tunrrus and the interior. The town handles the first sorting of goods coming up from the south before they continue toward the mountain passes.

#### Tygoss

A mountain settlement in the Green Mountains themselves, Tygoss occupies a defensible position along one of the main passes. The town is smaller and harsher than the lowland settlements, home to miners, hunters, and the soldiers who guard the pass. Tygoss has a reputation for independence—the mountain folk here consider themselves Da Trang citizens only when convenient.

#### Nyuonaw

The largest settlement in Da Trang, Nyuonaw sits in a clearing in the central jungle along the Nuodyak. The town serves as the administrative center of the nation, where Da Trang's rulers hold court. Nyuonaw is more refined than the frontier settlements, with stone buildings and established institutions.

#### Evurcluuh

A southern town on the lower Nuodyak, near Da Trang's borders with Qet Yemani and New Chimea. Evurcluuh is a crossroads settlement, handling traffic between the three nations. The town has a mixed population and a reputation for neutral ground where traders from rival nations can meet.

### Relations with the Coast

The settlements north of the Green Mountains—Gherdikhisar, Kalemeydani, and others along Micah Inlet—are not part of Da Trang proper. While Da Trang controls the passes and extracts tolls from trade, the coastal towns maintain their own governance. This arrangement creates tension: the coast depends on mountain trade but resents Da Trang's tariffs, while Da Trang covets direct sea access but lacks the strength to hold territory beyond the mountains.
