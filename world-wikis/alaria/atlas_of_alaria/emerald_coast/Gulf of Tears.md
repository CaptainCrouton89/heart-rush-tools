## Gulf of Tears

Tags: sea, bay, geography, emerald coast

The body of water separating Phirexes from the broader Emerald Coast region to the northwest, where the Sweet Water River empties into the sea and the fogs of the swamp finally release their hold. The gulf is named for the tears of Dengar refugees who have made it this far—close enough to smell freedom, to see the fog-free horizons—only to realize they cannot go further.

### The Fog Line

The most striking feature of the Gulf of Tears is where the fog ends. Sailing northwest from Phirexes, there comes a point—usually about five miles from shore, though it varies with the queen's moods—where the mist simply stops. One moment you're in the perpetual grey; the next, you can see blue sky and distant shores.

For those without fog-binding, this is merely a geographical curiosity. For the Dengar who've lived in Phirexes long enough, it's a wall more impenetrable than any stone. The fog-binding sickness hits hard at the boundary. Symptoms that were manageable in the mist become unbearable in clear air: splitting headaches, vertigo so severe victims cannot stand, a bone-deep wrongness that only grows worse with distance.

Most refugees who make it to the fog line turn back. They have no choice. The few who push through—powered by desperation, medication, or sheer stubborn will—often collapse on the other side and have to be carried the rest of the way by smugglers. Some don't survive the crossing. Their bodies are typically found washed up on the bone beaches, having drifted back toward the land that killed them.

### Waters and Currents

The gulf itself is unremarkable by Emerald Coast standards—warm tropical waters, moderate depths, seasonal storms that can turn nasty but rarely catastrophic. The currents flow generally northward along the coast, which makes escape from Phirexes slightly easier (sailing with the current) and return slightly harder (sailing against it).

The Sweet Water River's outflow creates a freshwater lens near the shore, where the river water floats atop the denser seawater. This layered zone has unusual properties—the fog seems to have trouble maintaining coherence here, and some refugees report that swimming in the mixed waters eases their withdrawal symptoms. Whether this is true or merely wishful thinking, the river mouth has become a gathering point for those trying to build up tolerance before attempting the crossing.

### The Watching Ships

Queen Phendexelas cannot control the gulf, but she can watch it. Her agents maintain a small fleet of shallow-draft vessels that patrol the waters, officially to "protect Dengar travelers from the dangers of the sea." In practice, they intercept anyone trying to leave and escort them firmly back to Maurevelious.

The watching ships don't pursue past the fog line—their crews are fog-bound too, and the queen won't risk losing them. But within the mist, they're relentless. They know the waters, they know the smuggler routes, and they have standing orders to sink any vessel that refuses to heave to.

The smugglers play a constant cat-and-mouse game with the watching ships, using the fog itself as cover, timing their runs for when the patrols are elsewhere, occasionally sacrificing a decoy vessel to draw pursuit away from the real cargo. It's dangerous work, but the alternative—leaving the refugees without supply lines—is unthinkable.

### The Name

"Gulf of Tears" is a Dengar name, predating the queen by centuries. The original meaning has been lost—perhaps it referred to some ancient tragedy, some long-forgotten sorrow. But the modern Dengar have reinterpreted it. They say the gulf is fed by the tears of everyone who's ever had to choose between freedom and life, between escape and survival.

The refugees who gather at the river mouth, working up courage for the crossing they might not survive, say you can taste salt in the water that isn't from the sea.
