## Eoga

Tags: state, nation

Eoga controls the southern reaches of the Jungles of Godahi, a territory defined by its wetlands and its position at the edge of the mountain barriers. Of the five jungle nations, Eoga is the most isolated—hemmed in by the Cloud Mountains to the south and surrounded by the territories of larger, more powerful neighbors. This isolation has bred a fiercely independent culture and a reputation for treachery.

### Geography

Eoga's territory extends roughly 80 miles east to west and 70 miles north to south. Much of this area is marginal land—swamps, marshes, and jungle too wet for easy settlement:

- **North**: Borders Qet Yemani through the Jungles of Godahi
- **East**: Borders Vystrilik
- **South**: The Cloud Mountains rise abruptly from the jungle floor
- **West**: The Misty Marsh and The Drift dominate the western territory

The **Ellis Cozwa** river winds through Eoga, providing the primary water route through the territory.

### Misty Marsh

A vast expanse of shallow water, reed beds, and floating vegetation in western Eoga. The marsh is perpetually shrouded in fog—warm water meeting cooler air creates mist that rarely lifts completely, even at midday. Visibility is often less than 100 feet.

The Misty Marsh is not impassable, but travel requires specialized knowledge. A network of channels connects scattered dry hummocks where small communities survive on fishing, trapping, and harvesting marsh plants. These marsh-dwellers navigate by sound, smell, and an intimate knowledge of the waterways impossible for outsiders to replicate.

The marsh is home to dangerous fauna—giant leeches, poisonous frogs, water serpents, and worse things that hunt in the fog. It also harbors fugitives from all the jungle nations, who disappear into its channels and are never seen again.

### The Drift

The most treacherous terrain in the Jungles of Godahi. The Drift is not a swamp in the traditional sense but a region where the land itself seems unstable—floating islands of matted vegetation drift on deeper water, channels appear and disappear, and the boundary between solid ground and drowning-depth liquid is impossible to determine.

The Drift earned its name from the constant motion of its surface. A path that exists in the morning may be gone by afternoon. Travelers who survive the crossing describe a surreal landscape where the horizon shifts and the ground moves beneath their feet.

Despite its dangers, The Drift must be crossed to reach certain passes through the Cloud Mountains. Those seeking to travel south have few alternatives—the routes around The Drift add weeks to the journey.

### Cloud Mountains

The Cloud Mountains form Eoga's southern boundary, rising 8,000-10,000 feet in a dramatic escarpment. The range is named for the perpetual cloud cover that blankets its peaks—moisture from the jungle below condenses as it rises, creating an environment of constant rain and fog.

The mountains contain passes leading to:
- **Phirexes**: The swamp-nation to the southeast
- **Kyagos**: The mountainous peninsula far to the south

These passes are high, cold, and dangerous, crossing through terrain utterly different from the jungle below.

### Major Settlements

#### Dylania

The capital and largest city in Eoga. Dylania occupies one of the few large areas of solid ground in the nation, a rocky outcrop rising above the southern jungle near the Cloud Mountain foothills. The city is built vertically, climbing the slopes of its foundation rock in tiers of wooden buildings connected by stairs and rope bridges.

Dylania controls access to the Cloud Mountain passes and extracts tolls from all traffic heading south. This geographic chokepoint is the primary source of Eoga's revenue and political relevance.

#### Eddletress

A northern settlement near the border with Qet Yemani. Eddletress serves as Eoga's gateway to the other jungle nations, handling trade and traffic coming from the north.

#### Gozwana

A town in northern Eoga along the Ellis Cozwa river. Gozwana is positioned where the river enters Eoga's territory, making it a natural waypoint for river traffic.

#### Lyfus

A central-western settlement at the edge of the Misty Marsh. Lyfus serves the marsh communities and handles the unique products harvested from the wetlands—fish, marsh plants, and goods that can only be found in the fog-shrouded waters.

### Political Character

Eoga's rulers have a reputation across the Jungles for duplicity. Surrounded by more powerful neighbors and controlling land that others consider worthless, Eoga has survived through cunning rather than strength. The nation frequently plays its neighbors against each other, sells information to all sides, and breaks agreements when advantageous.

This reputation is partly deserved and partly cultivated—Eoga's leaders find it useful when others expect treachery. A nation everyone distrusts is a nation no one bothers to conquer.
