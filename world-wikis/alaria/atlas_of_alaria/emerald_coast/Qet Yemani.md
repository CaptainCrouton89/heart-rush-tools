## Qet Yemani

Tags: state, nation

Qet Yemani is the largest of the five jungle nations, controlling the western reaches of the Jungles of Godahi. Its vast territory encompasses the great Tora Mazîl forest, extensive swamplands, and the western highlands where the jungle meets the mountains. Where other jungle nations measure their domains in tens of miles, Qet Yemani spans over 120 miles from its eastern borders to the Hekat Valley in the west.

### Geography

Qet Yemani's territory is defined by three major terrain types: the elevated forest of Tora Mazîl, the treacherous swamplands scattered throughout, and the western valleys and hills.

- **North**: Borders Da Trang, with Darkwater Swamp and the Greenflow river marking the frontier
- **East**: Jungle frontiers with New Chimea and Vystrilik, with Deadwood Swamp in the eastern interior
- **South**: Borders Eoga, where the Misty Marsh begins
- **West**: The Hills of Anaotki and Hekat Valley mark the transition to the western highlands

The **Hekat River** flows south through the western portion of Qet Yemani, draining the Hekat Valley. The **Greenflow** runs along the northeastern border with Da Trang.

### Tora Mazîl

The heart of Qet Yemani—a vast elevated forest covering the central and northern portions of the nation. Tora Mazîl sits on a subtle plateau above the surrounding jungle, creating a distinct ecosystem. The trees here grow even taller than elsewhere in the Jungles, with some specimens exceeding 200 feet. The forest floor is more open than typical jungle, allowing easier travel but also harboring different dangers.

Tora Mazîl is sacred to the people of Qet Yemani. Ancient groves within the forest are sites of religious significance, and the harvest of certain tree species is strictly regulated by traditional law. The forest produces some of the most valuable hardwoods in Alaria—dense, beautifully grained timber that commands premium prices in distant markets.

### Hills of Anaotki

A range of forested hills in northwestern Qet Yemani, marking the transition between the jungle lowlands and the western highlands. The hills are less densely vegetated than the deep jungle, with rocky outcrops and small clearings. They serve as a natural defensive barrier and contain several minor passes leading west.

### Valleys

#### Hekat Valley

The western lowland along the Hekat River, a relatively open area compared to the dense jungle elsewhere. The valley supports some agriculture and serves as Qet Yemani's connection to the western regions beyond the jungle.

#### Oskwatch Valley

A southern valley in the foothills, containing the settlement of Dy. The valley watches the approaches from the south and west.

### Swamps and Marshes

Qet Yemani's territory includes four major wetlands:

#### Oto Q'Azadi

A northern marsh in the upper reaches of Tora Mazîl. The village of Iyalmr sits at its southern edge.

#### Darkwater Swamp

Located in northeastern Qet Yemani, at the border with Da Trang. The swamp takes its name from the tea-colored water stained by tannins from decaying vegetation. Darkwater is navigable by experienced guides who can pole flat-bottomed boats through the channels, providing routes between Qet Yemani and Da Trang.

#### Dreamroot Marsh

A haunted expanse in the central-southern lowlands of Qet Yemani. The marsh is named for the dreamroot plant that grows abundantly in its shallow waters—a sedge whose roots, when prepared properly, induce prophetic visions. Less properly prepared, they induce madness and death. The marsh is home to isolated communities of root-gatherers who have developed immunity to the plant's ambient toxins. Outsiders who spend more than a few days in Dreamroot Marsh begin experiencing vivid hallucinations.

#### Deadwood Swamp

Located in east-central Qet Yemani. Unlike the living swamps elsewhere, Deadwood is a place of death—the trees stand skeletal and gray, killed by some ancient blight that persists to this day. Nothing grows in the black water except mats of pale fungus. The swamp is shunned by locals, who believe it to be cursed. Those who venture in report that wounds taken there do not heal properly, and sickness follows survivors for months.

### Major Settlements

#### Iyalmr

A settlement in the northern part of Tora Mazîl, at the edge of the Oto Q'Azadi marsh. Iyalmr serves as one of Qet Yemani's primary trading centers, positioned where the forest meets the wetland.

#### Uchaelv

A western settlement on the Hekat River, serving as Qet Yemani's gateway to the western highlands. Uchaelv handles trade coming through the Hills of Anaotki and down the Hekat Valley.

#### Uvedr

An eastern settlement near Deadwood Swamp. Despite its proximity to the cursed swamp, Uvedr persists as a trading post for goods moving between Qet Yemani and the eastern nations. The town's residents have learned to avoid the swamp and profit from travelers who need guidance around it.

#### Chemuva

A central-southern town at the edge of Dreamroot Marsh. Chemuva is the center of the dreamroot trade—harvesters bring their carefully gathered roots here for processing and sale. The town has a strange atmosphere, its permanent residents showing the subtle signs of long-term dreamroot exposure.

#### Dy

A small settlement in Oskwatch Valley, in the southwestern part of Qet Yemani. Dy watches the southern and western approaches and serves the scattered communities of the highland frontier.

#### Tel Askati

A settlement in southwestern Qet Yemani, near the Kos Askati river and the approaches to the Myjornis Mountains. Tel Askati marks the edge of jungle civilization, where the lowland forests give way to mountain terrain.
