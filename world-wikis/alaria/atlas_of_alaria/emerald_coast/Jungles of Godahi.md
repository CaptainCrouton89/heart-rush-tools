## Jungles of Godahi

Tags: jungle, region, geography

The Jungles of Godahi form the vast interior basin of the northern Emerald Coast—a sea of green canopy stretching roughly 300 miles east to west and 200 miles north to south. This is the heart of jungle civilization on Rimihuica's eastern seaboard, home to five distinct nations that have carved domains from the endless green.

### Geography

The Jungles occupy a natural basin bounded by mountain ranges on three sides:
- **North**: The Green Mountains separate the jungle interior from the coastal lowlands around Micah Inlet
- **Southeast**: The Tambrielle Mountains mark the boundary with the coastal territories
- **Southwest**: The Cloud Mountains and Mylornir Mountains define the southern and western edges

The basin drains through several river systems: the **Nuodyak River** flowing through Da Trang, the **Vorlek River** and **Siber River** running through Vystrilik and New Chimea toward the coast, the **Hekat River** draining western Qet Yemani, and the **Ellis Cozwa** winding through Eoga.

### Climate and Terrain

The jungle receives abundant rainfall from ocean moisture carried over the eastern mountains. The canopy is dense and multi-layered, with emergent trees reaching 150 feet or more. Visibility at ground level rarely exceeds 50 feet except along rivers and in cultivated clearings.

Scattered throughout the jungle are extensive marshlands where drainage is poor—the Dreamroot Marsh, Darkwater Swamp, Deadwood Swamp, and Misty Marsh being the largest. These wetlands are often more dangerous than the jungle itself.

### The Five Nations

The Jungles of Godahi are divided among five states, each controlling a portion of the basin:

- **Da Trang** (north): Controls the northern jungle and the approaches to the Green Mountains
- **Qet Yemani** (west): The largest territory, encompassing the Tora Mazîl forest and the western swamplands
- **New Chimea** (northeast): A coastal power with territory extending from the jungle to the eastern sea
- **Vystrilik** (east): Controls the eastern interior and access to the Tambrielle Mountain passes
- **Eoga** (south): The southern reaches, including the Misty Marsh and the treacherous Drift

### Cascades of Ygg

The most sacred site in the Jungles—a series of massive waterfalls where the Silver River drops over 400 feet in a series of cascades before entering the lowland jungle. The falls mark the traditional boundary between Da Trang and Qet Yemani. Ancient shrines dot the cliffsides, and the spray creates a perpetual rainbow visible for miles. Pilgrims from all five nations travel here, and by ancient compact, no army may approach within ten miles.

### Travel and Trade

Overland travel through the Jungles is arduous—thick undergrowth, dangerous fauna, and hostile terrain slow even experienced jungle travelers to 10-15 miles per day. The rivers serve as the primary highways, with canoe and barge traffic carrying most goods between the nations.

The jungle produces valuable exports: rare hardwoods, exotic spices, medicinal plants, dyes, and jungle animal products (feathers, pelts, venoms). These flow down the rivers to coastal ports and onward to markets across Alaria.
