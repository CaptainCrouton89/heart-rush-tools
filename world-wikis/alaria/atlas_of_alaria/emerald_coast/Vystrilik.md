## Vystrilik

Tags: state, nation

Vystrilik occupies the eastern interior of the Jungles of Godahi, controlling vital territory between the coastal nations and the deep jungle. Uniquely among the jungle nations, Vystrilik's domain extends across the Tambrielle Mountains—the nation holds territory on both the jungle side and the eastern coastal lowlands, giving it strategic importance as a crossroads between regions.

### Geography

Vystrilik's territory spans from dense jungle in the west to coastal lowlands in the east, divided by the massive Tambrielle Mountains running through its heart. This trans-mountain position defines the nation:

- **North**: Borders New Chimea, sharing the Smokestack volcano at the frontier
- **West**: Jungle borders with Qet Yemani, Da Trang, and Eoga
- **South**: The Tambrielle Mountains continue southward
- **East**: Coastal territory facing the open ocean

The **Siber River** and **Vorlek River** drain the western jungle portions of Vystrilik, providing water routes through the interior.

### Tambrielle Mountains

The Tambrielle Mountains form the spine of Vystrilik, rising 5,000-7,000 feet where the jungle meets the highland. These mountains divide the nation into two distinct regions—the jungle west and the coastal east. Several passes cut through the range, all controlled by Vystrilik.

Control of these passes gives Vystrilik leverage over trade between the Emerald Coast and the eastern seaboard. Caravans crossing between regions must use Vystrilik's routes or take longer, more dangerous paths. This geographic advantage has made Vystrilik wealthy despite having less coastline than New Chimea.

### Smokestack

The volcanic peak marking Vystrilik's northern border with New Chimea. Smokestack perpetually vents steam and sulfurous gases, its plume visible for miles. The volcano is shared territory—both nations claim it, and both profit from the sulfur and mineral deposits on its slopes. The uneasy joint administration of Smokestack is a constant source of diplomatic tension.

### Major Settlements

#### Western Settlements (Jungle Side)

##### Vystril

The capital of Vystrilik, situated in the central-western jungle at the base of the Tambrielle Mountains. Vystril is a prosperous trading city controlling the primary mountain passes. The city's architecture reflects its role as a crossroads—influences from the coast, the jungle interior, and the eastern seaboard blend in its buildings and marketplaces.

The city maintains extensive warehouses where goods are sorted, taxed, and transferred between jungle canoes and the pack trains that cross the mountains.

##### Oklyüne

A northwestern town near the borders with New Chimea and Da Trang. Oklyüne sits along the Vorlek River and handles traffic coming from the northern jungle nations.

##### Dywea

A western settlement in the jungle interior, serving as a waypoint for goods moving between the deep jungle and Vystril.

##### Klovuk

A west-central town positioned between the jungle and the mountain foothills. Klovuk serves travelers preparing to cross the Tambrielle passes.

##### Shyonn

A southwestern settlement near the border with Eoga. Shyonn has historically been contested territory—relations between Vystrilik and Eoga are complicated, and the town has changed hands multiple times.

##### Alezre

A northern settlement in the foothills, near the approaches to Smokestack and the New Chimea border.

##### Zure

A small northern town serving the communities around the Smokestack region.

##### Gli

A central settlement near Vystril, functioning as an extension of the capital's commercial activity.

#### Eastern Settlements (Coastal Side)

##### Garum

The primary port on Vystrilik's eastern coast. Garum handles goods that have crossed the Tambrielle passes, loading them onto ships for transport along the coast or across the sea. The town is a working harbor—efficient at moving cargo but less refined than the ports of New Chimea.

##### Chîtakee

An inland town on the eastern side of the mountains, positioned along the routes descending from the passes toward the coast.

##### Elbow

A coastal settlement south of Garum, serving fishing communities and providing an alternate port for coastal traffic.

### Shambling Forest

On the eastern slopes of the Tambrielle Mountains lies the Shambling Forest, a dense woodland with an unsettling reputation. The forest earned its name from travelers' reports of trees that seem to move when unobserved—paths shift, landmarks relocate, and those who enter often emerge miles from where they expected. Whether this is natural disorientation, magical influence, or something stranger remains disputed.

### Trans-Mountain Character

Vystrilik's control of both sides of the Tambrielle Mountains creates a unique dual identity. The western jungle settlements share culture and trade patterns with the other Godahi nations, while the eastern coastal towns look outward to sea trade. Vystril, at the center, bridges both worlds—its merchants are equally comfortable negotiating jungle timber prices and coastal shipping rates.

This position makes Vystrilik indispensable to regional commerce but also creates internal tensions. Eastern and western Vystrilik sometimes have competing interests, and the capital must constantly balance the needs of its divided population.
