## New Chimea

Tags: state, nation

New Chimea occupies the northeastern corner of the Jungles of Godahi, unique among the five jungle nations for its extensive coastline and direct access to ocean trade. The nation spans the Seawatch Mountains, with settlements scattered across both the jungle interior and the coastal lowlands.

### Geography

New Chimea's territory covers roughly 120 miles of coastline and extends 80 miles inland across the Seawatch Mountains. Its position gives it natural advantages:

- **North**: Coastal territory and the Green Mountains (shared with Da Trang)
- **West**: Jungle border with Da Trang
- **Southwest**: Borders Vystrilik at Hell's Paradise
- **South**: Shares the Smokestack volcano with Vystrilik
- **East**: The open ocean, with rich fishing grounds and sea trade routes

The **Seawatch Mountains** form the spine of New Chimea, running roughly north-south through the nation. Unlike most jungle nations confined to lowlands, New Chimea's settlements spread across these mountains.

The **Siber River** marks part of New Chimea's southwestern boundary.

### Seawatch Mountains

A substantial mountain range running through the heart of New Chimea, the Seawatch Mountains rise 4,000-6,000 feet above the coastal plain. The range earned its name from the watchtowers and signal stations built along its peaks, allowing rapid communication between the coast and interior.

The mountains are heavily settled compared to other ranges in the region. Fertile valleys, defensible positions, and mineral resources have drawn population into the highlands. Trails and passes crisscross the range, connecting the coastal settlements to the jungle interior.

### Smokestack

The volcanic peak at New Chimea's southern border, shared with Vystrilik. Smokestack perpetually vents steam and sulfurous gases—on clear days, the plume is visible from 50 miles at sea, serving as a navigation landmark for ships approaching the coast.

The volcano is active but not violently so—minor eruptions occur every few decades, producing lava flows that rarely threaten settled areas. The volcanic soil in the surrounding lowlands is extraordinarily fertile. A settlement of the same name clings to the mountain's slopes, processing sulfur and volcanic minerals.

### Hell's Paradise

A notorious stretch of jungle at New Chimea's southwestern border with Vystrilik. The region earned its name from the combination of exceptional natural beauty and extreme danger—crystalline streams, flowering trees, and abundant wildlife exist alongside venomous creatures, carnivorous plants, and quicksand bogs. Travelers who survive the crossing speak of it as the most beautiful and terrifying landscape in the Jungles.

### Major Settlements

#### Coastal Settlements

##### New Chimus

The capital and largest city in New Chimea, built around a natural harbor on the eastern coast. New Chimus is the commercial heart of the entire Emerald Coast—goods from all five jungle nations eventually flow through its markets and docks. The city sprawls along the waterfront, with older stone buildings near the harbor giving way to wooden structures as you move inland.

The harbor can accommodate ocean-going vessels, making New Chimus the primary point of contact between the Jungles of Godahi and the wider world. Merchants from across Alaria maintain trading houses here.

##### Cayor

A coastal settlement south of New Chimus. Cayor serves fishing communities and handles overflow trade from the capital.

##### Greenhook

A northern coastal town, positioned where a hooked peninsula provides natural harbor shelter. Greenhook handles coastal traffic from the north.

##### Blorvus

The northernmost coastal settlement, near where New Chimea's territory meets the open sea. Blorvus serves as a waypoint for ships traveling along the coast.

#### Mountain Settlements

##### Meddleton

A central town in the Seawatch Mountains, positioned at a major crossroads where several mountain trails converge. Meddleton is the commercial hub of the highlands.

##### Domri's Pass

A settlement controlling one of the primary passes through the Seawatch Mountains. Domri's Pass handles traffic moving between the coast and the jungle interior.

##### Widdleto

A northern mountain town in the upper Seawatch range. Widdleto serves mining operations and highland communities.

##### Bumla

A northwestern settlement in the foothills where the Seawatch Mountains meet the Green Mountains. Bumla watches the approaches from Da Trang.

##### Firstiddle

An eastern mountain town on the coastal side of the Seawatch range, serving as a waypoint between the highlands and the coast.

#### Interior Settlements

##### Oswald

A western settlement in the jungle lowlands, near the border with Da Trang and Vystrilik. Oswald handles trade coming from the other jungle nations.

##### Daphnia

A southern town near the Smokestack volcano. Daphnia processes volcanic minerals and jungle products, with a rougher, more industrial character than the coastal settlements.

##### Smokestack

A settlement on the slopes of the Smokestack volcano, specializing in sulfur extraction and mineral processing. The town serves as a waystation for travelers crossing between New Chimea and Vystrilik.
