# Emerald Coast

## Geography

The Emerald Coast occupies the eastern seaboard of Rimihuica, a verdant strip of jungle and coastline running from south of Ofrenia all the way to Phirexes in the southeast. True to its name, this region is deep, lush green—dense rainforest benefiting from ocean moisture, creating fertile territory where life thrives in abundance.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Begins south of Ofrenia (the island in the Middle Sea), with Micah Inlet marking the northern coast and Swampdeep beyond
- **West**: The Myjornis Mountains and western highlands separate the coast from the Gulf of Tears region and the United Free Nations
- **South**: Extends to Phirexes (a misty swamp) and borders Kyagos (the mountainous southeastern peninsula) via the Cloud Mountains
- **East**: Faces the open ocean; the permanent storm Oblivion churns offshore to the northeast

### Geographic Extent

The Emerald Coast stretches along the entire eastern shoreline of Rimihuica's jungle regions. It includes:
- The **Jungles of Godahi**: The great interior basin containing five distinct nations (Da Trang, New Chimea, Qet Yemani, Vystrilik, Eoga)
- The coastal portions of **New Chimea** and **Vystrilik**, states that span across the mountain divide from the Innerrim
- **Phirexes**: A misty, fog-shrouded swamp marking the southeastern extent of the coast, positioned north of the mountainous Kyagos peninsula

### Major Mountain Ranges

- **Green Mountains**: Northern range separating the Jungles of Godahi from the Micah Inlet coast; filled with trolls and wyverns
- **Seawatch Mountains**: Interior range running through New Chimea, separating the coastal nation from the deep jungle
- **Tambrielle Mountains**: Southeastern range on the border of Vystrilik, containing passes to the Innerrim
- **Cloud Mountains**: Southern boundary separating Eoga from Phirexes and the routes to Kyagos
- **Myjornis Mountains**: Southwestern range marking the edge of the Emerald Coast region

### Major Rivers

Three river systems drain the Jungles of Godahi:

- **Silver River**: Originates in the Green Mountains and flows south through Da Trang, cascading over the famous Cascades of Ygg before continuing into Qet Yemani. The primary trade artery for the western Jungles.
- **Vortek River**: Flows east through Vystrilik to the sea at Garum. The main route connecting the interior jungle to the eastern coast.
- **Elite Creek**: A secondary waterway winding through central Qet Yemani, connecting the Tora Mazîl forest to the broader river network.

### Coastal Waters

- **Micah Inlet**: A large inlet on the northern coast, bounded by the Green Mountains to the south. The ports of Gherdikhisar, Kalemeydani, and Donokasi serve as Da Trang's connection to sea trade.
- **Sea of Seven Snakes**: The body of water between Phirexes and Kyagos/Gorath to the south
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm northeast of the coast, between the Middle Sea and open ocean. Anyone who enters forgets everything they know and sails out in confusion.

## Political Climate

The Emerald Coast is dominated by the five nations of the Jungles of Godahi, each controlling a portion of the interior basin:

- **New Chimea**: The most powerful, controlling the best harbors and the bulk of ocean trade
- **Vystrilik**: Strategic control of mountain passes gives it leverage over trans-regional commerce
- **Da Trang**: Controls the northern approaches and the routes through the Green Mountains
- **Qet Yemani**: Largest territory but mostly deep jungle; wealthy from timber and rare plants
- **Eoga**: The smallest and poorest, surviving through cunning and control of southern passes

Beyond the Jungles, **Phirexes** controls the southeastern swamps, maintaining an independent character distinct from the jungle nations.

## What Makes It Interesting

The Emerald Coast offers:
- **Political complexity**: Five nations in close proximity, constantly maneuvering for advantage
- **Treacherous terrain**: Dense jungle, vast swamps, and dangerous wildlife make travel an adventure
- **Valuable resources**: Rare hardwoods, exotic spices, medicinal plants, and the legendary Crystal Caverns
- **Cultural isolation**: Cut off by mountains and ocean, the Jungles have developed unique traditions

## What Will Go Wrong

The Crystal Caverns are destabilizing. Centuries of harvesting have removed more force-dampening crystals than can regrow, and the Force/Earth leyline intersection is approaching critical instability. Earthquakes have increased 40% over the past century. Coastlines are subsiding. The Kendor who understand the situation have begun sabotaging Chimeyan harvesting operations, but their warnings go unheard.

If harvesting continues at current rates, the intersection will catastrophically destabilize within two to three centuries—possibly within decades if extraction accelerates. The resulting shockwave will trigger earthquakes along the entire Golus leyline network and force discharges along the Nilus, affecting regions far beyond the Emerald Coast.

Meanwhile, the nations of the Jungles of Godahi remain focused on their petty border disputes, oblivious to the slowly mounting disaster beneath their waters.

## Notable Locations

### Crystal Caverns

Submarine cave systems beneath the coastal waters of New Chimea, located at the intersection of Force and Earth leylines. The caverns contain volatile force-attuned crystals that store immense kinetic potential—highly valuable to mages and artificers, but catastrophically dangerous to harvest. New Chimea controls the primary access points and has built a profitable (and increasingly unsustainable) industry around crystal extraction.

See [Crystal Caverns](./Crystal%20Caverns.md) for full details.

### Slumber Deep

An abyssal trench forty miles off the coast of Phirexes, where Force and Water leylines intersect to create a zone of absolute stasis. Ships and creatures that drift into the Deep hang frozen forever, preserved but conscious. At its heart lies [Aphoryis](../../bestiary/Aphoryis.md), the fortress of the octopus-lich Mirsalyenar the Cruel.

See [Slumber Deep](./Slumber%20Deep.md) for full details.

### Cascades of Ygg

See [Jungles of Godahi](./Jungles%20of%20Godahi.md) for details on this sacred waterfall site.

### Hell's Paradise

A notorious stretch of jungle between New Chimea and Vystrilik. See [New Chimea](./New%20Chimea.md) for details.

### The Drift

A treacherous region of unstable terrain in Eoga. See [Eoga](./Eoga.md) for details.
