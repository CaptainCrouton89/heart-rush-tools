# Emerald Coast

## Geography

The Emerald Coast occupies the eastern seaboard of Rimihuica, a verdant strip of jungle and coastline running from south of Ofrenia all the way to Phyrexes in the southeast. True to its name, this region is deep, lush green—dense rainforest benefiting from ocean moisture, creating fertile territory where life thrives in abundance.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Begins south of Ofrenia (the island in the Middle Sea) and Swampdeep
- **West**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form the western boundary, separating the coast from the Innerrim basin
- **South**: Extends to Phyrexes (a misty swamp) and borders Kyagos (the mountainous southeastern peninsula)
- **East**: Faces the open ocean; the permanent storm Oblivion churns offshore to the northeast

### Geographic Extent

The Emerald Coast stretches along the entire eastern shoreline of Rimihuica's jungle regions. It includes:
- The coastal portions of **New Chimea** and **Vystrilik**, states that span across the mountain divide from the Innerrim
- **Phyrexes**: A misty, fog-shrouded swamp marking the southeastern extent of the coast, positioned north of the mountainous Kyagos peninsula

### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Seven Snakes**: The body of water between Phyrexes and Kyagos/Gorath to the south
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm northeast of the coast, between the Middle Sea and open ocean. Anyone who enters forgets everything they know and sails out in confusion.
