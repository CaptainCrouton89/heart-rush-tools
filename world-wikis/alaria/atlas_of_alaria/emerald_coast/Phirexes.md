## Phirexes

Tags: state, nation, swamp, emerald coast

A fog-shrouded swampland at the southeastern edge of the Emerald Coast, Phirexes is a place of creeping dread disguised as salvation. For sixty years, the gorgon queen Phendexelas the Beautiful has ruled over the Dengar halflings from her city of Maurevelious, having "saved" them from a catastrophe she herself created. The perpetual fogs that blanket the marshes don't just obscure vision—they bind those who stay too long, creating a magical dependency that makes escape nearly impossible.

The landscape is a maze of stagnant pools, thorn-choked wetlands, and forests where the trees seem to watch. What was once a dangerous but livable swamp has become something worse: a prison without walls, where the inmates thank their jailer nightly for keeping them safe from the horrors she unleashed.

### The Fogs

The defining feature of Phirexes is not its swamps but its mists. The Fogs of Phirexes are semi-sentient, responding to Queen Phendexelas's mood and will. On days when she is pleased, they thin to a silvery haze through which the pale sun occasionally breaks. When she is angry, they thicken until visibility drops to arm's length and the air itself seems to press against the skin.

The Dengar have developed an elaborate system of reading fog density to predict royal temperament. Thick fog on a festival day means cancelled celebrations. Thin fog before the queen's nightly walk means she may be feeling generous. Children learn fog-reading before they learn to swim.

But the fogs do more than obscure. Prolonged exposure—months, then years—creates a dependency that the Dengar call "fog-binding." Those who have lived in Phirexes long enough cannot leave for extended periods without suffering withdrawal: disorientation, memory gaps, a creeping paranoia that the swamp is calling them back. The fog becomes a need, like water or air. This is the queen's true hold over her subjects—not fear of her gaze, but the simple biological fact that they can no longer survive without her mists.

### Misty Marshes

The heartland of Phirexes, a vast expanse of fog-shrouded wetland stretching from the Croaking Briars in the west to the Crocodile Coast in the east. The marshes are not uniform—some areas are relatively solid ground covered in pale grasses, others are treacherous bogs that can swallow a person in minutes. The Dengar have mapped safe paths through generations of trial and fatal error, but the fogs make navigation treacherous even for natives.

The wildlife here has adapted to the perpetual mist. Insects grow large and slow, their compound eyes useless in the murk. Fish have developed lateral lines so sensitive they can navigate by pressure changes alone. The birds have mostly fled or died; those that remain are silent, having learned that calls attract predators they cannot see coming.

#### Cragwood Swamp

The poisoned heart of the Misty Marshes, where the catastrophe began. When Phendexelas first arrived and the fogs descended, this is where the swamp beasts went mad. Now, sixty years later, Cragwood is a nightmare zone that even the queen approaches with caution.

The creatures here are fog-touched—warped by decades of concentrated exposure into something between animal and aberration. Fog Crocodiles breathe mist instead of air and can phase partially through solid matter, their jaws materializing inside a victim's chest. Marsh Stalkers were once deer-like grazers; now they hunt in packs on too many legs, fog leaking from eyes that glow with dim intelligence. And in the deepest pools lurk the Old Ones—what the swamp's apex predators became when the madness took them. Massive, patient, and intelligent in ways they should not be, the Old Ones remember what they were before and hate what they've become.

The queen built Maurevelious deliberately close to Cragwood's edge. She wants her subjects to see the horrors beyond the walls, to understand viscerally what waits for them outside her protection. Occasionally, she sends dissidents into Cragwood for "meditation." None have returned sane.

#### Groaning Creek

A waterway that winds through the northern Misty Marshes, named for the constant low groan that emanates from its waters. The Dengar insist this is merely wind through hollow reeds, but the groan grows louder when the fogs thicken, and sometimes—especially on Hollownights when both moons are dark—it sounds almost like words.

The creek's source has never been found. It emerges from the fog fully formed, groaning, and flows southeast toward Cragwood before disappearing into the marshes. Some refugees claim the creek is trying to warn them about something. Others say it's mourning. The queen has forbidden any organized expedition to find its source.

#### Hag's Pasture

A clearing in the northern marshes where nothing grows but pale, knee-high grass that sways even when there's no wind. The fog is thinner here—not absent, but reduced, as if something else has claimed this territory and the queen's power cannot fully penetrate it.

The name comes from old Dengar legend: hags supposedly tend this "pasture" for livestock no one has ever seen. The grass is always cropped short, as if grazed, but no animal tracks mark the soft earth. Sometimes, at night, lights bob in the distance—too steady for will-o'-wisps, too purposeful for swamp gas.

The Dengar avoid Hag's Pasture. Even the queen's soldiers won't camp here. Whatever arrangement exists between Phendexelas and the pasture's owners, it is not spoken of.

### Maurevelious

The capital of Phirexes rises from the swamp on stilts and floating platforms, a city that seems grown rather than built. Queen Phendexelas constructed it in a single impossible year after her arrival, and the architecture reflects her alien aesthetics: organic curves, living wood that still grows and must be trimmed like hedges, windows of smoky glass that seem to watch passersby. The streets are raised boardwalks connecting platform-neighborhoods, and beneath them the swamp water laps eternally at the foundations.

Thirty thousand Dengar live here, the vast majority of Phirexes' population. They are not slaves—they own businesses, raise families, practice their ancestral craft of swamp alchemy. But they are not free either. The Fog Gates at each city entrance "recognize" those who have lived here long enough; attempting to leave triggers the fog-binding sickness. And every evening, without exception, they line the Queen's Walk to prostrate themselves before their savior.

The Dengar's cultural philosophy—"the worse it gets, the better it was"—has curdled here into something like mass Stockholm syndrome. They survived the catastrophe, so this must be good. They have homes and work, so they should be grateful. The worse life was before the queen saved them, the better life is now by comparison. This self-gaslighting is the queen's most insidious weapon; she barely needs to oppress them when their own culture does it for her.

#### The Queen's Walk

A raised boardwalk of polished blackwood that circuits the city's central district. Every evening at dusk, Queen Phendexelas emerges from her palace and walks this path, her gorgon form draped in silks that hide everything but her beautiful, terrible face. The citizens line the walk, kneeling with heads bowed—to look upon her directly is death, but more than that, it would be ungrateful.

She speaks to them as she walks, her voice carrying supernaturally to every ear. She tells them how much she loves them. How hard she works to keep them safe. How the fogs are a blessing, not a curse. By the end of her circuit, many are weeping with devotion.

Those who fail to attend the Queen's Walk are noted. Those who fail repeatedly are visited.

#### The Cauldron District

The industrial heart of Maurevelious, where the Dengar practice their ancestral art of swamp alchemy. Hundreds of still-houses crowd this district, their copper pipes and glass vessels gleaming through the fog. The air here smells of fermentation, sulfur, and stranger things.

The Dengar produce medicines that no other culture can match—salves that cure infections, elixirs that dull pain, compounds that can purge poisons from the blood. They also produce "swamp spirits," a violently alcoholic brew that doubles as paint stripper, wound cleanser, and (according to the Dengar) a perfectly acceptable breakfast drink. These exports are Phirexes' primary source of outside wealth.

The queen controls this district carefully. All rare ingredients must be harvested with her permission, and her agents monitor what the alchemists produce. Any formula that might counteract fog-binding is immediately confiscated, and its creator disappears.

#### The Gratitude Plaza

The central square of Maurevelious, dominated by a statue of Queen Phendexelas in her most benevolent aspect—arms spread wide, face serene, as if embracing the entire city. Public thanksgivings are held here weekly, mandatory assemblies where citizens compete to express their devotion most eloquently.

The plaza's stones are etched with the names of the "Remembered"—Dengar who died in the catastrophe before the queen built the city. It is presented as a memorial. The refugees outside the walls know the truth: many of those names belong to people the queen killed herself, dissidents erased and rewritten as martyrs.

#### The Fog Gates

At each entrance to Maurevelious stands a gate of twisted iron and living wood, wreathed in concentrated fog. These are not merely checkpoints—they are magical constructs that sense the fog-binding in those who pass through. Citizens may come and go freely for short trips, but attempting to leave permanently triggers the gates' true purpose: they mark the would-be escapee, ensuring the fog-binding sickness strikes with full force within hours.

Some have tried to destroy the gates. The fog simply flows around the damage and rebuilds them overnight. Some have tried to sneak past. The gates have no guards because they need none—they see through the fog itself.

### Old One's Wood

A primordial forest in southern Phirexes that predates the fogs by millennia. The trees here are ancient beyond reckoning, their trunks wider than houses, their canopy so thick that perpetual twilight reigns below. The Dengar called it Old One's Wood long before Phendexelas arrived, named for the spirits and creatures that dwelt here—beings the halflings negotiated with carefully, offering respect in exchange for safe passage.

When the fogs came, Old One's Wood changed differently than the rest of Phirexes. It did not go mad like Cragwood. It became *calculating*. Trees that move when you're not looking, repositioning themselves to close off paths or open new ones. Roots that trip those the forest dislikes and steady those it favors. Something in the heart of the wood—no one knows what—has made a decision about the queen, and that decision was hatred.

Phendexelas has never been able to subjugate Old One's Wood. Her fogs penetrate it but do not control it; her creatures enter but do not return. This is where the Dengar refugees hide—the few hundred who escaped Maurevelious and refused to return. The forest tolerates them because they share a common enemy.

The refugees live in camps scattered through the wood, moving frequently, sustained by the Sweet Water River that flows along the forest's edge. They are sick, all of them—the fog-binding withdrawal is a constant companion—but they endure. Some say they've found ways to manage the sickness using the forest's own plants. Others say the forest itself is healing them, slowly, as payment for their defiance.

### Grove of Migwam

"Migwam" in the old Dengar tongue means "grandmother" or "wise mother." Before the queen came, this grove in the northern reaches of Old One's Wood was the Dengar's holiest site—a ring of ancient grandmother-trees where ancestors' ashes were scattered and their spirits were said to linger. Dengar would make pilgrimages here to seek guidance, and the ancestors would answer through rustling leaves and prophetic dreams.

Now the queen has claimed the grove as a shrine to herself. She visits monthly, performing rituals she claims channel the ancestors' blessing upon her reign. The grandmother-trees have been hung with silk banners bearing her image, and an altar of white stone stands at the grove's center where she receives "the ancestors' wisdom."

But the ancestors have gone silent. Since the fogs came, no pilgrim has received a true vision at Migwam. The leaves do not rustle with messages. The dreams are empty. The refugees believe the ancestors have withdrawn in disgust—or that the queen's presence has driven them away entirely. Some fear something worse: that the fogs have trapped the ancestors too, binding them as they bind the living.

### Sweetwoods

The northernmost forest in Phirexes, a relatively mundane woodland of sweetgum and cypress that provides most of Maurevelious's timber. Dengar woodcutters work here in rotating crews, harvesting lumber for construction and fuel.

"Relatively mundane" is a low bar in Phirexes. Even here, the fog has seeped in. Workers report hearing voices in the trees—conversations just below the threshold of comprehension, as if the forest were gossiping about them. Shadows move wrong, lingering a moment after their casters have passed. Tools go missing and reappear in strange places.

The queen maintains a logging camp at Sweetwoods' edge, more for surveillance than efficiency. Any woodcutter who spends too long in the forest alone is quietly reassigned. Whatever the trees are saying, Phendexelas doesn't want her subjects to hear it.

### Croaking Briars

A vast expanse of thorn-covered wetland forming Phirexes' western border, separating the swamps from the Thunderdark Peaks where the Strømgodden of Trømgar dwell. The briars are alive in an uncomfortable way—they grow toward warmth, toward blood, their thorns hooked and barbed to catch and hold.

The Dengar say Phendexelas planted the briars as a living wall against invasion, but older halflings remember: the briars were always here. The queen didn't create them. She woke them up.

The Strømgodden battle dwarves have tried to cut through many times—they war constantly with everyone, and Phirexes' weakness seems like easy conquest. But the briars grow back overnight, faster where blood has been spilled. A Strømgodden war party that breaches the barrier at dawn finds it whole again by dusk, often with their fallen comrades' bones already tangled in the thorns.

The briars do not attack the Dengar who live near them, but they don't welcome them either. Passage through the Croaking Briars is possible for those who know the safe paths, but those paths change weekly, and the briars seem to delight in trapping the unwary.

### Duskwood Forest

A dense forest in southwestern Phirexes named for the permanent twilight under its canopy. This is not a fog effect—the trees here grow so thick, their leaves so broad and overlapping, that sunlight simply cannot penetrate. The forest floor exists in eternal dusk, cool and dim and silent.

This darkness nurtures things that grow nowhere else. Fungi that glow with bioluminescence in colors the Dengar have names for but other languages don't. Mosses that can be processed into medicines for ailments other healers cannot touch. Flowers that bloom only in absolute darkness, their petals worth their weight in gold to alchemists who know their uses.

Before the queen came, Duskwood was where the Dengar's greatest alchemists gathered their rarest ingredients. Now, entry requires royal permission. Phendexelas controls the medicine supply by controlling access to what makes it. Petitions to harvest in Duskwood are granted sparingly, and always with a price—usually information about one's neighbors.

### Whispering Mangroves

The eastern edge of Phirexes, where the swamps meet the Crocodile Coast. Here the mangrove trees grow in the brackish water, their roots forming an impenetrable maze that extends for miles along the shore. The mangroves whisper constantly—a susurrus of voices just below comprehension, thousands of speakers saying things that almost make sense.

Old Dengar say these are the voices of those who tried to escape by sea and drowned, their spirits caught in the roots, forever trying to warn others away. The queen says they're singing her praises, the gratitude of the saved echoing through the wood. Neither explanation is comforting.

The mangroves are the last barrier for anyone trying to flee Phirexes by water. Beyond them lies the Crocodile Coast with its monster-infested waters, but the mangroves themselves are danger enough. Their roots grab at boats, pulling them into dead-end channels. The whispers grow louder the deeper you go, until it sounds like screaming. Few who enter unprepared ever find their way out.

Smugglers who supply the refugees have learned the safe passages—routes that the mangroves seem to tolerate, perhaps because they too hate the queen. These smugglers are the only lifeline between the refugees and the outside world.

### Ogzwad Swamp

The southeastern corner of Phirexes, a remote marshland where the queen's control is weakest. Technically within her borders, Ogzwad has become a kind of neutral territory since the dragon Pfustias claimed it as her domain.

The swamp here is much like the rest of Phirexes—foggy, treacherous, full of things that want to kill you—but it lacks the queen's direct attention. Creatures here are fog-touched but not directed. The mists respond to weather rather than royal moods. It feels almost natural, in a horrible sort of way.

Pfustias permits no large settlements in her territory, but she tolerates the occasional Dengar who wanders in, provided they pay appropriate tribute (usually information, sometimes alchemical compounds, occasionally something stranger). Some refugees have tried to shelter here, but the dragon's idea of "hospitality" is unpredictable.

#### Pfustias' Lair

Somewhere in the depths of Ogzwad Swamp, Pfustias has made her home. No one knows exactly where—those who've been summoned there describe being led through fog so thick they couldn't track the path, arriving at a hummock of solid ground that shouldn't exist in this waterlogged terrain.

The lair itself is said to be surprisingly comfortable: dry ground, a cave system in rock that has no business being here, and a collection of treasures that makes no conventional sense. Pfustias hoards information more than gold—books, letters, maps, the written confessions of dying men. Her nest is lined with secrets.

### Sweet Water River

The only freshwater river in Phirexes, flowing from the Cloud Mountains in the south through Old One's Wood and the Misty Marshes before emptying into the Gulf of Tears. The name is literal—this water is clean and sweet, untainted by the brackishness that afflicts most of the swamp.

The Sweet Water River predates the fogs and seems partially resistant to them. The water is clearer along its banks, the fog thinner, the creatures less warped. Queen Phendexelas has tried and failed to corrupt it fully; something in the river's nature—perhaps its mountain origin, perhaps something older—refuses her influence.

This makes the river the refugees' lifeline. Their camps cluster along its banks where the fog-binding sickness is weakest. The water itself seems to ease withdrawal symptoms, and plants that grow only along the river's edge have properties that help manage the addiction. The queen knows this and has tried to dam or divert the river multiple times. Each attempt has failed—the water finds new channels, sometimes overnight, as if the river itself is fighting back.

### Mud Run

A sluggish, turbid waterway that feeds the Misty Marshes from the northwest, the dark twin of the Sweet Water River. Where the Sweet Water resists the fogs, Mud Run embraces them. The water itself is foggy—not just clouded with sediment but literally infused with the same magical mist that blankets the land.

Drinking from Mud Run causes hallucinations: visions of the swamp as it was before the queen came, or as it might be after she falls, or as it exists in some parallel Phirexes where everything went differently. Some visions are beautiful. Most are terrifying. A few have been prophetic.

The Dengar alchemists prize Mud Run water for certain rituals and formulas—it's a key ingredient in several compounds that can only be made in Phirexes. The queen monitors its harvest carefully, as she does all valuable resources, but she cannot fully control access to a river.

Refugees avoid Mud Run. The hallucinations it causes tend to show them what they've lost, what they can never have again. That's a cruelty they don't need.
