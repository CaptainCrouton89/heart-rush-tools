# Sandreach

## Geography

Sand Reach is the massive desert that stretches across the entire northern portion of Upoceax, extending all the way to the northern coast. This is one giant barren desert—a scorching expanse of sand, rock, and relentless heat.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The desert extends to the northern coast—there is no land north of Sand Reach
- **East**: Transitions to Sequestria (barren plains) and the Free Isles offshore
- **South**: The Sand Reach Mountains form the southern boundary
- **West**: Reaches toward the Seacleft Coast and Greenwater Sea

### The Two Deserts

Sand Reach is divided into two major desert regions:

- **Mendari Desert**: The western portion of Sand Reach
- **Luquihn Desert**: The eastern portion, extending to the Salt Flats at its northeastern tip

### Major Features

#### Belo Jenari

A large volcanic mountain rising from the center of the desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape.

#### Salt Flats

Located at the northeastern tip of Luquihn Desert, where the desert meets the coast.

### Surrounding Waters and Regions

- **Greenwater Sea**: To the west, containing the island of Urok
- **Roule**: A halfling state north of Urok and north of Sand Reach
- **Free Isles**: Island cluster to the east
- **Sequestria (Siquestrya)**: Barren plains to the southeast, between Sand Reach and the coast

## Notable Regions

### Sequestria (Siquestrya)

South of the Sandreach Desert and east of the Sandreach Mountains lies Sequestria—a plain savannah wasteland south and west of the Free Isles. North and west of this region rise the Lyagnadarr Mountains, home to Svorinthak the dragon.

Sequestria is home to warring centaur tribes engaged in constant posturing and attempts to assert dominance over each other. Each tribe is ruled by a chieftain who can be challenged by anyone willing to fight for the position. Combat follows mercy rules, and armor is rare—hard to make, slows you down, and inaccessible to most. Most warriors wield spears, bows, and scimitars.

The centaur tribes generally capture and sometimes kill visitors. They don't want anyone interfering with their way of life or their tribal conflicts.

## Notable Locations

### Forever Beach

Sand makes perfect hourglass sand. Magical sand with all sorts of time-related properties. The beach causes you to age much faster though, and non-living things age even faster.

### Breia

A state within the Sandreach desert, notable for its ancient ruins and dangerous magical sites.

#### Shtaneres

The ruins of an ancient city in Breia, built at the intersection of fire and air leylines. The city was destroyed long ago, its structures reduced to rubble by magical catastrophe.

##### Hermelia's Lair

Rising from the ruins of Shtaneres stands Hermelia's Lair—not a traditional dungeon but a tall sequence of connected spires reaching into the desert sky. This was the crypt and final home of Hermelia, a powerful mage who mastered both fire and air magic, granting her the ability to fly and rain down devastating fireballs on her enemies.

The spires are now inhabited by rocs—massive predatory birds that nest among the heights. At the core of the tallest spire runs a "spine" of concentrated fire magic, a pillar of flame that extends from base to peak. This spine stabilizes the entire structure, but it is also catastrophically dangerous—if the fire spine is broken or disrupted, the accumulated magical energy will detonate in a colossal explosion capable of leveling everything for miles around.

Treasure hunters brave enough to enter must contend with territorial rocs, navigate crumbling architecture hundreds of feet above the desert floor, and avoid damaging the fire spine at all costs.
