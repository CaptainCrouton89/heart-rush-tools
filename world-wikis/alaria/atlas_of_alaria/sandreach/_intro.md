# Sandreach

## Geography

Sand Reach is the massive desert that stretches across the entire northern portion of Upoceax, extending all the way to the northern coast. This is one giant barren desert—a scorching expanse of sand, rock, and relentless heat.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The desert extends to the northern coast—there is no land north of Sand Reach
- **East**: Transitions to Sequestria (barren plains) and the Free Isles offshore
- **South**: The Sand Reach Mountains form the southern boundary
- **West**: Reaches toward the Seacleft Coast and Greenwater Sea

### The Two Deserts

Sand Reach is divided into two major desert regions:

- **Mendari Desert**: The western portion of Sand Reach
- **Luquihn Desert**: The eastern portion, extending to the Salt Flats at its northeastern tip

### Major Features

#### Belo Jenari

A large volcanic mountain rising from the center of the desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape.

#### Salt Flats

Located at the northeastern tip of Luquihn Desert, where the desert meets the coast.

### Surrounding Waters and Regions

- **Greenwater Sea**: To the west, containing the island of Urok
- **Roule**: A halfling state north of Urok and north of Sand Reach
- **Free Isles**: Island cluster to the east
- **Sequestria**: Barren plains to the southeast, between Sand Reach and the coast

### Forever Beach

Sand makes perfect hourglass sand. Magical sand with all sorts of time-related properties. The beach causes you to age much faster though, and non-living things age even faster.
