# Sandreach

## Geography

Sand Reach is the massive desert that stretches across the entire northern portion of Upoceax, extending all the way to the northern coast. This is one giant barren desert—a scorching expanse of sand, rock, and relentless heat.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The desert extends to the northern coast—there is no land north of Sand Reach
- **East**: Transitions to Sequestria (barren plains) and the Free Isles offshore
- **South**: The Sand Reach Mountains form the southern boundary
- **West**: Reaches toward the Seacleft Coast and Greenwater Sea

### The Two Deserts

Sand Reach is divided into two major desert regions:

- **Mendari Desert**: The western portion of Sand Reach
- **Luquihn Desert**: The eastern portion, extending to the Salt Flats at its northeastern tip

### Major Features

#### Belu Jenari

A large volcanic mountain rising from the center of the desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape. Site where the legendary Demon Horn of Fire was forged.

#### Salt Flats

Located at the northeastern tip of Luquihn Desert, where the desert meets the coast.

### Surrounding Waters and Regions

- **Greenwater Sea**: To the west, containing the island of Urok
- **Roule Channel**: The strait separating Roule from the mainland
- **Roule**: A halfling state north of Urok and north of Sand Reach
- **Lightning Passage**: Treacherous strait between the Sunshine Coast and the Free Isles, prone to violent electrical storms
- **Free Isles**: Island cluster to the east
- **Sequestria (Siquestrya)**: Barren plains to the southeast, between Sand Reach and the coast

### Eastern Coastline

The eastern edge of the Sandreach and Siquestrya regions meets the sea along several distinct coastal zones:

#### Sunshine Coast

The northeastern coastal stretch where the Luquihn Desert meets the sea. Named for the relentless, unbroken sunlight that bakes this shore—there is little cloud cover this far into the desert's rain shadow. The coast is rocky and inhospitable, with few natural harbors. Small communities of salt-harvesters and fishermen eke out an existence here, trading with passing ships from the Free Isles.

#### Geyser Bay

A bay on the eastern coast where Siquestrya meets the sea. The bay takes its name from the thermal vents that dot the coastline and shallow waters, sending plumes of steam and mineral-rich water into the air at irregular intervals. The geysers make navigation treacherous for larger vessels, but the warm waters attract unusual marine life and the mineral deposits have modest value to alchemists. The centaur tribes of Siquestrya generally avoid this coastline, considering the geysers ill-omened.

#### Sandwurm Coast

The southeastern coastal region south of Geyser Bay. This desolate stretch earned its name from the massive burrowing wurms that hunt in the transitional zone where sandy soil meets the sea. The wurms are drawn to vibrations—ships anchoring too close to shore or travelers moving across the beach risk attracting these predators. The few who must travel this coast do so at low tide, moving quickly across wet-packed sand that muffles footfalls.

## Notable Regions

### Sequestria (Siquestrya)

South of the Sandreach Desert and east of the Sandreach Mountains lies Sequestria—a plain savannah wasteland south and west of the Free Isles. North and west of this region rise the Lyagnadarr Mountains, home to Svorinthak the dragon.

Sequestria is home to warring centaur tribes engaged in constant posturing and attempts to assert dominance over each other. Each tribe is ruled by a chieftain who can be challenged by anyone willing to fight for the position. Combat follows mercy rules, and armor is rare—hard to make, slows you down, and inaccessible to most. Most warriors wield spears, bows, and scimitars.

The centaur tribes generally capture and sometimes kill visitors. They don't want anyone interfering with their way of life or their tribal conflicts.

## Notable Locations

### Forever Beach

Sand makes perfect hourglass sand. Magical sand with all sorts of time-related properties. The beach causes you to age much faster though, and non-living things age even faster.

### Breia

A state within the Drystone Mountains (part of the Sandreach Mountains system), notable for its ancient ruins and dangerous magical sites.

#### Shtaneres

The ruins of an ancient city in Breia, built at the intersection of fire and air leylines. The city was destroyed long ago, its structures reduced to rubble by magical catastrophe.

##### Hermelia's Lair

Rising from the ruins of Shtaneres stands Hermelia's Lair—not a traditional dungeon but a tall sequence of connected spires reaching into the desert sky. This was the crypt and final home of Hermelia, a powerful mage who mastered both fire and air magic, granting her the ability to fly and rain down devastating fireballs on her enemies.

The spires are now inhabited by rocs—massive predatory birds that nest among the heights. At the core of the tallest spire runs a "spine" of concentrated fire magic, a pillar of flame that extends from base to peak. This spine stabilizes the entire structure, but it is also catastrophically dangerous—if the fire spine is broken or disrupted, the accumulated magical energy will detonate in a colossal explosion capable of leveling everything for miles around.

Treasure hunters brave enough to enter must contend with territorial rocs, navigate crumbling architecture hundreds of feet above the desert floor, and avoid damaging the fire spine at all costs.
