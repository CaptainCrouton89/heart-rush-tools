## Lightning Passage

Tags: strait, geography

A treacherous strait separating the Sunshine Coast from the Free Isles to the northeast. The passage takes its name from the violent electrical storms that sweep through with alarming frequency—sailors attribute this to the convergence of hot desert air from the Sandreach with cooler maritime winds from the open sea.

The strait is navigable but dangerous. Experienced captains time their crossings carefully, watching for the telltale cloud formations that precede the lightning storms. Ships caught mid-passage during a storm face not only the lightning itself but the choppy, unpredictable waves the storms generate.

Despite the danger, Lightning Passage sees regular traffic—it's the most direct route between the Free Isles and the Sunshine Coast's salt-harvesting settlements. Some merchants consider the crossing a worthwhile gamble; others prefer the longer but calmer route around the northern tip of the Free Isles.
