## Temple of the Sun

Tags: poi, ruin

An ancient temple complex in the central Luquihn Desert, south of the Dunes of Kalamesh. Unlike the destroyed Temple of Bryn near Belu Jenari, this temple remains largely intact—its builders constructed it from massive blocks of white stone that have resisted centuries of sandstorms.

The temple is dedicated to sun worship, though scholars debate which tradition built it. The architecture predates known human settlement in the region, and the carvings show stylized sun imagery that doesn't match any contemporary religious iconography. Some theorize it was built by an early Murazi surface civilization before they retreated underground; others attribute it to a forgotten human culture.

The interior remains sealed. The main entrance is blocked by a stone door covered in worn glyphs that have resisted all attempts at translation. Treasure hunters have tried to breach the walls, but the white stone is unnaturally hard—picks and chisels barely scratch it. Whatever secrets the Temple of the Sun holds, it guards them jealously.
