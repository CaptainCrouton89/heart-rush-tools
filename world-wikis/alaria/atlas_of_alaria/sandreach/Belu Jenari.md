## Belu Jenari

Tags: poi, volcano

A massive volcanic mountain rising from the center of the Sandreach desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape. This volcano was the site where the legendary Demon Horn of Fire was forged, drawing on the convergence of fire and light leylines beneath the mountain.

### Temple of Bryn

Located in the foothills north of Belu Jenari, at the intersection of the fire and light leylines, the Temple of Bryn was once a magnificent structure dedicated to Bryn, the sun-god. The temple featured extremely bright eternal flames and a brilliant artificial sun at its center, channeling the raw elemental power of the leyline convergence.

The temple was destroyed during the formation of Belu Jenari itself—the volcanic eruption that created the mountain also devastated the temple, leaving only ruins. However, one artifact survived the cataclysm.

#### The Dawnbringer Stone

Within the ruins of the Temple of Bryn lies the Dawnbringer Stone, a sacred pedestal that holds Dawnbringer—a legendary sword forged from fire and light. The blade still rests in the stone, waiting for a worthy wielder who can withstand the searing heat and blinding radiance of the temple's remains.
