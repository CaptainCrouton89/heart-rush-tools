## Sandstorm Straits

Tags: strait, geography

A turbulent stretch of water separating the northeastern coast of the Sandreach from the mainland to the north. The straits take their name from the massive dust storms that blow off the Luquihn Desert and sweep across the water, reducing visibility to near zero and coating ships in layers of fine sand.

### Navigation Hazards

The Sandstorm Straits present multiple dangers to shipping:

**Dust Storms**: The namesake phenomenon occurs when hot desert winds pick up sand from the Luquihn and carry it out to sea. These storms can last hours or days, forcing ships to anchor and wait them out—assuming they can find safe anchorage before the storm hits.

**Shallow Waters**: The straits are dotted with sandbars that shift unpredictably as currents and storms redistribute sediment. Charts of the straits are notoriously unreliable; local pilots who know the current conditions are essential for safe passage.

**Crosscurrents**: Where the strait narrows, conflicting tidal flows create dangerous crosscurrents that can push vessels off course or into shallow water.

### Strategic Importance

Despite the hazards, the Sandstorm Straits see significant traffic. Ships traveling between the Greenwater Isles and the eastern coast must either brave the straits or take the much longer route around the northern cape. For merchants dealing in time-sensitive goods—or those trying to avoid attention—the straits offer a faster if riskier passage.

The lack of any major port along the strait means ships must carry enough supplies to wait out storms at anchor. This limitation keeps the straits relatively free of pirates, who prefer waters with more predictable shelter.
