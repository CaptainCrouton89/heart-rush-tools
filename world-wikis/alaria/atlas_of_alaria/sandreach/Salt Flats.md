## Salt Flats

Tags: desert, geography, region

The Salt Flats mark where the Luquihn Desert meets the Gindrik Sea—a blinding white expanse of crystallized salt stretching roughly a hundred miles along the coast. What was once a shallow inland sea dried up over millennia, leaving behind salt deposits dozens of feet thick in places. The terrain is brutally flat, offering no shade and reflecting the sun with punishing intensity.

### Geography

The Flats occupy the northeastern corner of the Luquihn Desert, bounded by:
- **North**: The Gindrik Sea coastline
- **East**: Open water toward the Strymün Isles and Gindrik Sea
- **South**: The Bone Hills, rising from the salt like the spine of some buried leviathan
- **West**: The endless dunes of the Luquihn Desert proper

The salt crust varies in thickness and stability. Near the coast, it's firm enough to support wagons and even small structures. Further inland, treacherous thin patches conceal brine pools that can swallow the unwary. Seasonal flooding during winter storms deposits new salt layers and reshapes the terrain annually.

Water is the Flats' most precious commodity. The few permanent springs are jealously guarded, and most inhabitants rely on distillation or imported water. The salt itself contaminates everything—metal corrodes within days, leather cracks, wounds heal slowly if at all.

### Climate

Summers are lethal. Temperatures exceed what unprotected flesh can survive, and the reflected glare causes snow-blindness even with eye protection. The Kuzagt work their slaves primarily at night during these months, with daytime reserved for rest in underground shelters.

Winters bring relief and danger in equal measure. Storm surges from the Gindrik Sea can flood miles of the Flats within hours, dissolving the salt crust and creating temporary lagoons. These floods deposit fish, seaweed, and driftwood—harvested quickly before the water evaporates back to salt.

### Resources

Salt is the obvious export, but not all salt is equal. The Kuzagt have identified dozens of distinct varieties based on mineral content, crystal structure, and depth of excavation. Some preserve meat better. Some enhance magical rituals. Some are poisonous to specific creatures. This specialized knowledge represents centuries of accumulated expertise that outsiders cannot easily replicate.

The Bone Hills provide a different resource entirely—ancient fossils and occasional mineral deposits. See below.

## Bonnetaz

Tags: city, state, nation

Bonnetaz rises from the Salt Flats like a fever dream—towers of white salt-brick and bone, their surfaces carved with geometric patterns that catch the light. From a distance, the city appears beautiful. Up close, visitors notice that much of the "bone" ornamentation is human.

The Kuzagt have ruled here for over a thousand years, since before humans arrived in significant numbers on this continent. Their city predates the slave camps, but the camps have made it wealthy beyond measure.

### The City

Bonnetaz is built partially above ground and partially below. The surface city contains the administrative towers, trading halls, and residences of the ruling elite. The undercity—far more extensive—houses salt-processing facilities, cisterns, storage vaults, and the entrances to the slave tunnels that radiate outward beneath the Flats.

Architecture here follows Kuzagt aesthetics: angular, asymmetrical, with sharp edges and narrow windows. Buildings are constructed from salt-brick reinforced with bone (animal and human alike) and sealed with a resinous lacquer that prevents moisture damage. The older structures have developed a yellowish patina; the newest gleam white.

The city lacks walls. The Kuzagt consider fortification unnecessary—the Flats themselves are defense enough. Any army crossing the salt would lose more soldiers to exposure than combat.

### Population

Approximately twelve thousand Kuzagt dwell in Bonnetaz proper, organized into an oligarchical council of thirteen. Each council seat is hereditary within certain bloodlines, with internal succession determined by assassination, ritual combat, or occasionally democratic vote depending on the family's traditions.

Rank is displayed through skull ornamentation. Common Kuzagt leave their distinctive cheekbone protrusions unadorned. Minor nobility embed small gems—garnets, amber, jade. Council members and their immediate families wear diamonds, sapphires, or rubies, sometimes multiple stones arranged in patterns that denote specific lineages.

The human population within the city proper is difficult to count. Perhaps three thousand work as domestic servants, skilled laborers, or specialized craftspeople—those whose talents make them too valuable for the camps. Their status falls somewhere between slave and citizen, permitted certain freedoms but never permitted to leave.

### The Camps

Outside the city, the slave camps stretch across the Flats in a network of underground warrens connected by tunnels. Conservative estimates place the enslaved population at forty thousand, though the Kuzagt don't share precise figures. The camps serve multiple purposes:

**Salt Extraction**: The primary industry. Slaves excavate salt deposits, process them into various grades, and package them for export. Work shifts follow the seasons—surface work at night during summer, daytime during winter.

**Infrastructure Maintenance**: The tunnel network requires constant expansion and repair. Cave-ins are common. Workers who survive a collapse are considered lucky, not injured.

**Specialized Production**: Some camps focus on specific products—particular salt grades, bone processing, or the creation of goods from human materials. Kuzagt leather workers are renowned for their craftsmanship. They do not advertise their primary material.

Escape from the camps is theoretically possible but practically suicidal. The Flats offer no shelter, no water, and no direction. Those who flee typically die within days. The Kuzagt recover what remains and put the bones to use.

### Trade and the Ivory Hand

Bonnetaz does not participate directly in slave acquisition—the Kuzagt consider such work beneath them. Instead, they purchase slaves through intermediaries, primarily the Ivory Hand merchant network. This organization maintains permanent representatives in the city, handling the logistics of human trafficking while the Kuzagt focus on "productive employment."

The Ivory Hand connection extends beyond mere commerce. Several Bonnetaz merchants hold membership in the organization, participating in its darker activities—including the supply of sacrificial subjects for Deoric rituals. The Kuzagt officially disapprove of Deoric magic but accept payment for "specialized inventory" without asking questions.

Other exports include processed salt (various grades), bone crafts, and certain alchemical compounds produced from the Flats' unique mineral deposits. Imports focus on food, water, metal goods, and luxury items for the elite.

### Governance

The Council of Thirteen meets in the Pale Spire, the tallest structure in Bonnetaz. Sessions are closed to non-Kuzagt, and decisions are announced rather than debated publicly. The council handles external relations, major resource allocation, and disputes between bloodlines.

Day-to-day administration falls to appointed overseers, each responsible for specific aspects of city function: salt production, camp management, trade, water distribution, and so forth. These positions are held by Kuzagt of middling status, ambitious enough to work hard but not powerful enough to threaten the council.

The council's current composition has remained stable for nearly a century—unusual by historical standards. Some attribute this to the current prosperity; others whisper that the eldest members have found ways to extend their already considerable lifespans.

### Relations with Neighbors

**Ethadia**: The nearest significant power. Ethadian merchants trade with Bonnetaz, carrying salt and bone-goods to markets across the Gindrik Sea. This relationship is profitable for both parties and maintained through careful diplomatic neutrality. The Ethadians know what happens in the camps. They do not discuss it.

**Gorath**: The Kuzagt view Gorath's slave trade with contempt—clumsy, brutal, and wasteful. They consider their own practices more refined, their treatment of slaves more "efficient." Gorath considers Bonnetaz too distant and too entrenched to conquer profitably. The two powers ignore each other.

**The Free Isles**: Occasional trading partners, though the Isles' populations include many escaped slaves. Bonnetaz merchants visiting the Isles do not discuss their city's economy.

### What Outsiders Experience

Visitors to Bonnetaz are rare and carefully managed. Those with legitimate trade purposes are housed in designated quarters near the harbor, permitted access to trading halls and select entertainment venues, and prohibited from approaching the camps or residential districts.

The Kuzagt present a face of sophisticated commerce. Transactions are conducted with formal courtesy. Contracts are honored precisely. Violence is reserved for those who violate the rules.

Most visitors leave with valuable goods and a vague sense of unease they cannot articulate. The city is too clean, too quiet, too orderly. The Kuzagt smile with their thin lips while their dark eyes assess each guest's potential value.

Some visitors never leave at all. The Kuzagt do not discuss these disappearances.

## Bone Hills

Tags: hills, geography

The Bone Hills rise from the southern edge of the Salt Flats—a low range of weathered ridges that mark the transition from salt pan to true desert. The name predates Kuzagt settlement, though the elves have certainly contributed to its appropriateness.

### Geology

The Hills are composed primarily of limestone and chalk, the compressed remains of ancient sea life from when this region lay beneath an inland ocean. Erosion has carved the soft stone into strange formations—pillars, arches, and honeycomb patterns that from a distance resemble skeletal architecture.

More significantly, the Hills contain genuine fossils. The ancient sea teemed with massive creatures, and their bones remain embedded in the rock. Some specimens are merely large. Others suggest beasts of sizes that strain credibility—skulls the size of houses, vertebrae requiring teams of slaves to excavate.

The Kuzagt harvest these fossils for construction material, decorative use, and occasionally religious purposes. Their bone-working traditions incorporate ancient remains alongside more recent acquisitions.

### Mineral Deposits

Beyond fossils, the Hills contain useful mineral deposits: sulfur springs (valuable for alchemy), copper veins (largely exhausted), and occasional pockets of salt with unusual properties. Mining operations dot the hillsides, worked by slaves under Kuzagt supervision.

The most significant deposit is the Weeping Vein—a formation that produces a thick, oily substance with preservative properties. Applied to organic material, it prevents decay indefinitely. The Kuzagt use it on their most valued slaves, extending useful service lives by decades.

### The Ossuary Roads

Ancient paths wind through the Hills, marked by standing stones and the occasional monument. These predate the Kuzagt, belonging to an unknown culture that left no written records. The monuments feature carved bones—or bone-shaped carvings—arranged in patterns that may be decorative or may be linguistic.

The Kuzagt have studied these sites without reaching conclusions. They maintain the paths for practical transportation purposes while leaving the monuments undisturbed. Some council members privately believe the original builders were ancestors of the Kuzagt themselves, though they cannot prove this theory.

### Hazards

The Hills are not safe. Sinkholes open without warning where underground chambers collapse. Sulfur vents release toxic gases. And the fossils are not always entirely dead.

Certain excavations have uncovered remains that resist extraction—bones that move when unobserved, that appear in different positions from one day to the next, that occasionally disappear entirely only to resurface miles away. The Kuzagt have learned which sites to avoid. They do not share this knowledge with outsiders.

## Castle Alexandr

Tags: poi, fortress, ruins

Castle Alexandr stands on a promontory overlooking the channel between Bonnetaz and the Strymün Isles—a fortress of dark stone utterly unlike the salt-and-bone architecture of its Kuzagt neighbors. The castle predates Kuzagt settlement by centuries, possibly millennia.

### History

No records survive to explain who built Castle Alexandr or why. The architecture suggests human construction—the proportions are wrong for elves—but no human civilization in the region's known history possessed the engineering skill evident in its construction. The walls are fitted stone blocks, each weighing tons, joined without mortar in a technique that modern builders cannot replicate.

The name itself is a mystery. "Alexandr" appears in no Kuzagt genealogy, no Ethadian chronicle, no surviving document from any regional power. The castle simply is, and has been, for as long as anyone can remember.

The Kuzagt occupied the castle briefly after establishing Bonnetaz, intending to use it as a watchtower and naval base. They abandoned it within a decade. The official explanation cites "strategic considerations." The unofficial explanation—shared only among council members—involves incidents the Kuzagt refuse to describe.

### Current State

The castle stands empty but not ruined. Its walls remain intact, its towers upright, its gates functional. This is peculiar. Abandoned structures in the salt environment should corrode and crumble. Castle Alexandr does not.

Visitors report that the interior is spotlessly clean—no dust, no debris, no signs of animal habitation. Furniture remains in place, preserved as if the occupants stepped out moments ago. Food left in the kitchens does not rot. Water in the cisterns remains fresh.

The castle does not welcome extended stays. Those who attempt to sleep within its walls experience dreams of drowning, of darkness, of something vast and patient waiting beneath the sea. Most leave by morning. Some leave immediately. A few do not leave at all.

### Strategic Position

Despite its unsettling nature, Castle Alexandr's position makes it valuable. The promontory commands the main shipping channel between the Gindrik Sea and the approach to Bonnetaz. Any power controlling the castle could effectively blockade Kuzagt trade.

The Kuzagt solve this problem by ensuring no one controls it. They patrol the waters nearby, discourage explorers, and spread stories emphasizing the castle's dangers. These stories are not exaggerated.

Periodically, ambitious captains or desperate refugees attempt to claim Castle Alexandr as a base of operations. The Kuzagt do not interfere. They simply wait. Within weeks—sometimes days—the new occupants are gone.

### What Lies Beneath

The castle's cellars extend downward farther than the promontory's geology should allow. Explorers who have descended report passages that seem to continue indefinitely, opening into chambers of increasing size. The deepest reached—according to a Kuzagt expedition whose survivors refused to discuss their findings—contained seawater despite lying hundreds of feet below sea level.

Something lives in the depths. Or something sleeps there. Or something waits. The Kuzagt have sealed the cellar entrance with salt, bone, and old magic, and they check those seals regularly.

The castle remains standing. The seals remain intact. The Kuzagt consider this sufficient.
