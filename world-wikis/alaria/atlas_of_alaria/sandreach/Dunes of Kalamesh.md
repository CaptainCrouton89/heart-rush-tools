## Dunes of Kalamesh

Tags: desert, geography

A vast expanse of towering sand dunes in the northeastern Luquihn Desert, stretching inland from the Sunshine Coast. The dunes here reach heights of several hundred feet—massive, shifting mountains of pale gold sand that reshape themselves with every windstorm.

The Kalamesh dunes are notoriously difficult to navigate. Landmarks disappear overnight as the sands shift, and the dunes create disorienting echo effects that confuse travelers. Local guides use the stars and the position of distant mountain peaks to navigate, but even experienced desert-dwellers treat the Kalamesh with caution.

Beneath the deepest dunes, rumors persist of buried ruins—remnants of a civilization that existed before the desert expanded to its current boundaries. Whether these ruins connect to the underground Murazi settlements is unknown; the Murazi themselves are secretive about what lies beneath the sands.
