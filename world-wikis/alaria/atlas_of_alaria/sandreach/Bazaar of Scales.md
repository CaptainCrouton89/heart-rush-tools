## Bazaar of Scales

Tags: poi, settlement, trade

A sprawling desert market in the southern Luquihn Desert, positioned at the edge of the Lyagnadarr Mountains. The Bazaar of Scales is one of the few places where surface-dwellers can reliably trade with the Murazi—the underground merfolk who dwell beneath the desert.

The bazaar takes its name from its primary trade goods: scales, hides, and bones from desert creatures, along with the iridescent scales the Murazi harvest from subterranean fish. The market operates in a shallow canyon where ancient wells tap into underground water sources—likely Murazi engineering, though they neither confirm nor deny it.

Trade here follows its own rules. The Murazi emerge at dawn and dusk when temperatures are tolerable, conducting business through intermediaries who have learned their trade-sign language. Violence in the bazaar is met with swift collective punishment—the Murazi simply seal the wells, and without water, the surface market dies. This threat keeps even the most unscrupulous merchants civil.

The bazaar also serves as a waypoint for travelers heading to or from the Lyagnadarr Mountains, and a place to hire guides who know the deep desert routes.
