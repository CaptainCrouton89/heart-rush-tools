## Dustforge

Tags: citystate, settlement

A city-state in the southeastern Luquihn Desert, built around Esedin Lake—a large oasis fed by underground aquifers. Dustforge is one of the few permanent settlements in the Sandreach, made possible by reliable water access and ingenious architectural adaptation to the brutal desert environment.

### Geography

Dustforge sits at the edge of Esedin Lake, where the flat desert gives way to rocky outcroppings that provide natural wind barriers. The city is largely underground, with most structures carved into the bedrock or built as reinforced bunkers. Only essential surface structures—watchtowers, trade pavilions, and the famous forges—brave the windstorms that scour the Luquihn Desert.

The city's position places it roughly equidistant from Belu Jenari to the northwest and the Lyagnadarr Mountains to the south, making it a natural waypoint for travelers crossing the desert.

### Economy

#### Mushroom Trade

The underground caverns of Dustforge host extensive mushroom farms, fed by the moisture seeping from Esedin Lake. These fungi are cultivated in carefully controlled conditions and are prized across Alaria for their unique flavors and medicinal properties. Some varieties are mildly psychoactive; others have genuine healing properties. The mushroom trade forms the backbone of Dustforge's economy.

#### Dustforged Weapons

The city's namesake comes from its legendary smiths, who have perfected the art of sintering—a technique for working metals with extremely high melting points. Dustforged weapons are made from tungsten alloys that hold an edge longer than steel and resist breaking under stress. The process requires specialized furnaces that burn hotter than conventional forges, fueled by oils extracted from certain desert creatures.

Dustforged blades are expensive and rare outside the city. The smiths guard their techniques jealously, and the raw materials are difficult to source.

### Esedin Lake

The oasis that makes Dustforge possible. Esedin Lake is roughly two miles across at its widest point, fed by aquifers that tap into deep underground water sources. The lake's shores are the only place for hundreds of miles where vegetation grows naturally—date palms, hardy scrub, and the distinctive blue-green algae that the mushroom farms use as a nutrient base.

The lake is considered sacred by the city's inhabitants. Contaminating its waters is a capital offense.
