## Fernius Sound

Tags: sea, geography

The body of water east of Petrona Septia Island, separating the island from the scattered archipelagos and open waters beyond. Fernius Sound is broad, deep, and relatively calm — better sailing than the hazardous waters around the Tyvern Isles to the north or the shallow approaches to Phylos Bay in the west.

The sound sees moderate traffic: fishing boats from the Petrona Septia settlements, occasional merchant vessels heading to or from Rilyn, and the rare ship making for the more remote eastern destinations. It's not a major trade route — Petrona Septia's states don't generate enough commerce for that — but it's navigable and relatively safe.

### Character

Fernius Sound lacks the dramatic dangers of other regional waters. No hidden reefs tear at hulls. No supernatural darkness bleeds from nearby shores. No volcanic ridges lurk below the surface. The sound is simply a stretch of sea that ships cross without incident.

This very ordinariness makes Fernius Sound valuable. Ships that want to avoid the complications of Scatter Sound or the Kappa-controlled approaches to Moigos can circle around through Fernius Sound instead. The route is longer but simpler — useful for captains who prefer predictable sailing over faster passages with complications.

### Surkelm Coast

The eastern shore of Fernius Sound belongs to the Surkelm region — forested coastline stretching northeast from Petrona Septia toward the mainland. The coast is lightly populated, with scattered fishing villages and the occasional logging camp. No significant settlements exist here; the terrain is too rough and the connections to larger markets too poor.

The Surkelm forests supply timber to those willing to pay for it, but harvesting and transporting the logs is difficult enough that most buyers look elsewhere. The region's main significance is as a landmark — ships navigating Fernius Sound use the Surkelm headlands for orientation.

### Rilyn's Access

Rilyn, the Splinkreen city-state on Petrona Septia's eastern shore, has its primary sea access through Fernius Sound. The Splinkreen aren't major seafarers — their culture is oriented toward forests rather than water — but they maintain small harbors for the fishing and limited trade that their economy requires.

Ships visiting Rilyn typically approach through Fernius Sound, avoiding the more complicated routes around the island's other coasts. The Splinkreen welcome visitors, in their slow and deliberate way, though the city-state doesn't generate enough trade to attract many merchant vessels.

### The Eastern Waters

Beyond Fernius Sound lies the open sea — the Agreben Sea to the south and east, eventually reaching the distant coasts of other lands. Few ships from Petrona Septia venture that far. The island's states are oriented inward, toward each other and the nearby coasts, not toward distant maritime connections.

Occasionally, ships from far lands appear in Fernius Sound, having crossed the open water for reasons of their own. These visitors are rare enough to be memorable. What they're looking for on Petrona Septia — trade, information, something else entirely — varies with each arrival.
