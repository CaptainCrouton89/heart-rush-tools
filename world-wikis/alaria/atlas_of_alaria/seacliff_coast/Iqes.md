## Iqes

Tags: state, nation

A state on the Seacleft Coast, notable for the dangerous archipelagos in its territorial waters.

### Golem's Teeth

An archipelago of jagged islands east of Iqes proper, named for the sharp, tooth-like rock formations that rise from the sea. The treacherous waters and razor-sharp rocks have claimed countless ships over the centuries.

#### Islands North of Golem's Teeth

The smaller islands scattered north of the main Golem's Teeth archipelago are avoided by sailors who know the local legends.

##### Dreadwreck

The location of a cursed shipwreck—a Gruynmar vessel that ran aground after its entire crew was petrified by a gorgon. The ship smashed against the rocks and now lies broken on the shore, its stone crew still frozen in their final moments of terror. The wreck is shunned by all who know of it, as the gorgon still makes its lair among the petrified sailors, waiting for new victims to add to its collection of statues.

### Ederri

An underwater sinkhole region off the eastern coast of Iqes in the Agreben Sea. The sinkholes descend into deep underwater caverns and passages.

#### Voidlock Passage

Deep within the Ederri sinkholes lies the collapsed, underwater Voidlock Passage—once a seagate leading to the underrealm of Zylogmus Eternus. The passage has collapsed but remains partially functional in a strange way: as you descend deeper and deeper into the flooded tunnels, the water becomes shared between the two locations, existing in both places simultaneously. This creates a dangerous phenomenon where currents from Zylogmus Eternus can pull swimmers into the underrealm without warning.
