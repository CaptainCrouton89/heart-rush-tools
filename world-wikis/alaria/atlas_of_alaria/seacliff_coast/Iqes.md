## Iqes

Tags: state, nation, island

A large, heavily forested island off the Seacleft Coast, roughly three hundred miles long and two hundred fifty miles wide. Iqes is home to the Qindo people — dark-skinned humans and halflings with distinctive piercing blue eyes — though political power lies largely with foreign-descended merchant families who control the island's glittering coastal cities.

The island's terrain is dominated by dense forest, cut by two major river systems and ringed by waters that range from merely dangerous to actively lethal. The interior remains largely traditional Qindo territory; the coasts are where foreign influence concentrates, where the coral-and-mica cities rise, and where the wealth flows.

### Ntando

The forested western interior of Iqes, Ntando is the traditional Qindo heartland — the region where native culture survived most intact after foreign merchants took control of the coastal cities. The name means something like "the old places" in the Qindo tongue, and the description is apt.

While the coastal cities glitter with coral architecture and foreign fashions, Ntando remains a land of forest villages, subsistence farming, and traditions that predate the merchant takeover. The foreign elite consider it backwards and poor. The Qindo consider it *real* — the place where ancestors are properly honored, where the old ways persist, where being Qindo means something more than a servant class in someone else's city.

Ntando is governed by village elders rather than voting rings. The council in Mjiqa claims authority here, but enforcement is spotty; ring-holders who venture into the deep forest find their writs carry little weight. Tax collectors come through seasonally; they take what they can and leave. Open rebellion is rare, but so is genuine compliance.

The highlands along Ntando's western edge hold particular significance. This is where the halflings once had their mountain caves — elaborate underground communities destroyed during the foreign consolidation. The entrances are collapsed now, poisoned or buried, but the halflings remember. Some still make pilgrimages to the ruined sites.

### The Rivers

**Shulka River**: The main waterway of Iqes, flowing from the forested interior southeast to the coast at Mjiqa. The Shulka is the island's economic artery — broad enough for trade boats through most of its length, essential for moving goods from the interior to the capital. Whoever controls the Shulka controls Iqes's internal commerce.

The river's upper reaches flow through traditional Qindo territory, lined with fishing villages and small farming communities. As it approaches Mjiqa, the banks become increasingly developed — warehouses, docks, the estates of ring-holders who want river access without living in the crowded capital.

**Myusha River**: The northern river, flowing past Zukisani to the coast. Slower and broader than the Shulka, the Myusha serves the northern forests and connects to the fishing grounds near Gyosha. The name reportedly means "gentle water" or "mother river" in old Qindo.

The Myusha valley is more integrated than the Shulka — Qindo and foreign-descended communities mix more easily here, the result of generations of intermarriage and shared economic interests. Zukisani, at the river's mouth, reflects this relative harmony.

### Cities

#### Mjiqa

The capital of Iqes, situated at the mouth of the Shulka River. Mjiqa is where the coral-and-mica architecture reaches its most dramatic expression — towers of cultivated pink coral, walls that shimmer with mica flakes, broad plazas where the wealthy display their status in imported fashions and ostentatious jewelry.

Look past the glitter and you see the machinery of power: the Ring Hall where the council meets, the Coral Docks where trade flows, the Privateers' Berths where licensed raiders spend their earnings. And in the crowded Qindo Quarter, the workers who make it all function — dockworkers, servants, sailors, craftspeople whose labor builds the wealth they'll never share.

Mjiqa is two cities in one. The ring-holders see a jewel of commerce and culture. The Qindo see a stolen inheritance.

#### Simphiwe

The western city, gateway to Ntando. Simphiwe sits at the edge of the great forests, serving as the commercial bridge between the traditional interior and the coastal economy. This is the most Qindo of the cities — foreign merchants come here to buy Ntando goods, but they don't dominate the way they do in Mjiqa.

The architecture blends coral-city style with traditional Ntando woodwork. The markets sell forest products alongside imported luxuries. The voting rings matter here, but so do older forms of respect — a ring-holder who insults local customs finds their business mysteriously difficult.

Simphiwe has the largest urban halfling population, many maintaining connections to the destroyed cave-homes in the nearby mountains. The halfling district is culturally significant; ceremonies commemorating the lost caves happen here, attended by halflings from across Iqes.

#### Zukisani

The northern city on the Myusha River, controlling river trade from the northern forests and serving as Iqes's connection to Gyosha and the waters beyond. Less grand than Mjiqa, more practical — a working city where ships are built, goods are processed, and the fishing fleet operates.

Zukisani has a reputation for relatively honest dealing. The ring-holders here are merchants and shipwrights, not aristocrats playing political games. Qindo and foreign-descended residents mix more easily; the inequality remains, but the contempt is muted.

The shipyards of Zukisani are famous across the Seacleft Coast. The city also serves as the primary port for trade with Mirko and Gyosha — connections that bring both commerce and complications.

#### Zuko

The southern interior city, controlling land routes through Iqes's forested heart. Zuko is where the ring-holders maintain their grip on the interior — tax collection, law enforcement, and military garrisons when the elite feel threatened by Ntando restlessness.

Less beautiful than Mjiqa, more fortified, Zuko is the fist inside Iqes's velvet glove. The garrison here is larger than a trading city needs; its purpose is control rather than defense. The Tax Houses process tribute from villages throughout the interior.

Ironically, Zuko also contains the best-organized resistance cells. The city that suppresses dissent is close enough to Ntando to feel its grievances, and not everyone in the garrison is loyal to the ring-holders.

Near Zuko lie the ruins of the largest halfling cave-complex — deliberately destroyed during the consolidation, now a scar on the landscape that halflings visit in quiet pilgrimage.

### Towns and Villages

**Menzi**: A river town upstream from Mjiqa on the Shulka, where goods transfer between river boats and pack animals heading into the interior. A waystation for commerce, busy during trading seasons.

**Zendile**: A fishing town on the Ripmaw Sound coast, with connections to the Cast Cays. The local pilots who guide ships through Ripmaw Sound's dangerous channels often come from Zendile.

**Qonwabi**: A traditional Qindo village in the western highlands, near the ruined halfling caves. Relatively isolated, maintaining old customs with minimal foreign interference.

**Feza**: A crossroads town in the southern interior, where routes from Zuko meet paths to the coast. Small but strategic; travelers heading anywhere in southern Iqes likely pass through.

### Golem's Teeth

An archipelago of jagged islands east of Iqes proper, named for the sharp, tooth-like rock formations that rise from the sea. The treacherous waters and razor-sharp rocks have claimed countless ships over the centuries.

The Golem's Teeth mark the eastern boundary of safe navigation around Iqes. Beyond them lie the open waters of the Agreben Sea and the underwater hazards of Ederri. Ships that must pass the Teeth do so carefully, following established channels and praying the weather holds.

#### Islands North of Golem's Teeth

The smaller islands scattered north of the main Golem's Teeth archipelago are avoided by sailors who know the local legends.

##### Dreadwreck

The location of a cursed shipwreck — a Gruynmar vessel that ran aground after its entire crew was petrified by a gorgon. The ship smashed against the rocks and now lies broken on the shore, its stone crew still frozen in their final moments of terror. The wreck is shunned by all who know of it, as the gorgon still makes its lair among the petrified sailors, waiting for new victims to add to its collection of statues.

### Ederri

An underwater sinkhole region off the eastern coast of Iqes in the Agreben Sea. The sinkholes descend into deep underwater caverns and passages.

#### Voidlock Passage

Deep within the Ederri sinkholes lies the collapsed, underwater Voidlock Passage — once a seagate leading to the underrealm of Zylogmus Eternus. The passage has collapsed but remains partially functional in a strange way: as you descend deeper and deeper into the flooded tunnels, the water becomes shared between the two locations, existing in both places simultaneously. This creates a dangerous phenomenon where currents from Zylogmus Eternus can pull swimmers into the underrealm without warning.
