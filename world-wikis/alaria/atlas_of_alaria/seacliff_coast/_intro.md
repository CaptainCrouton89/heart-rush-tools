# Seacleft Coast

## Geography

The Seacleft Coast occupies the northwestern edge of Upoceax—a rugged coastal region featuring dramatic cliffs that drop into the ocean. This is a land of precipitous shorelines, scattered states, and the gateway between the Farlands to the south and the waters beyond.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Northern coastline
- **East**: The Greenwater Sea and Sand Reach desert
- **South**: Transitions into the Farlands; the Vokas Enrisikna mountain range marks the boundary
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

### The Vokas Enrisikna Range

A small mountain range that stretches between the Ocean of Elorinia to the west and the Bejeweled Sea to the east. This range serves as the geographic boundary between the Seacleft Coast and the Farlands to the south.

### States

The Seacleft Coast contains a smattering of states, arranged roughly from south to north:

- **Ios** (southernmost)
- **Moigos**
- **Iqes**
- **Enavadi** (northernmost)

Plus several scattered city-states throughout the region, including Rilyn.

### Petrona Septia Island

A major island in the Seacleft Coast containing the states of Ios and Moigos, as well as the city-state of Rilyn. The Screech Peaks mountain range divides the island, with Ios on the southwestern side and Rilyn in Puma Wood forest on the northeastern slopes.

### Terrain

The defining feature is the coastline itself—high cliffs dropping dramatically into the ocean. The interior is less dramatic but still rugged, transitioning from the coastal cliffs to the mountain boundaries.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Ocean of Elorinia**: The western ocean
- **Bejeweled Sea**: Eastern waters, between the Seacleft Coast and the Greenwater Sea
- **Greenwater Sea**: Further east, dominated by the island of Urok
