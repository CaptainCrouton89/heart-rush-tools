## Moigos

Tags: state, nation

A state on the Seacleft Coast, positioned between mainland Upoceax and the Tyvern Isles.

### Isle of the Night

West of the mainland settlement of Eskiloko, situated in the waters between Moigos and the Tyvern Isles, lies the Isle of the Night—a mysterious island enveloped within the Gloomterror Forest.

#### Gloomterror Forest

An otherworldly forest that covers the island, where darkness is absolute and unnatural.

##### Blackpoint

An island location within the Gloomterror Forest, totally shrouded in impenetrable shadows. No source of light works on this island—torches gutter, magical light fails, and even the sun seems unable to pierce the supernatural darkness.

Immense treasure is said to be buried on Blackpoint, drawing countless treasure hunters despite the impossibility of searching in absolute darkness. The island is guarded by umbral citadels—living shadows that have taken fortress-form, attacking any who dare set foot on the lightless shore.
