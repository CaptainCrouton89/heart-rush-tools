## Moigos

Tags: state, nation

The northern state on Petrona Septia Island, Moigos occupies the lowland forests and river valleys north of the Screech Peaks. The terrain is wet — streams, bogs, and flooded forests dominate the landscape — and the Kappa who rule here prefer it that way. The toad-folk crime lords have built their power in these swampy woodlands, running a state where official government is a polite fiction and real authority flows through debts, favors, and fear.

Moigos settlements are inland, clustered along the two major rivers that drain the region. There's no significant coast — the shoreline is either the supernatural darkness around the Isle of the Night or the treacherous waters of Scatter Sound. Trade that reaches Moigos comes overland or through carefully negotiated passages.

### Rivers

**Qulyintes River**: The primary waterway of Moigos, flowing from the foothills of the Screech Peaks northwest through the heart of the state. The capital Thetin sits where the river widens into a series of connected pools and channels. Calentia lies upstream, closer to the mountains.

The Qulyintes is navigable for flat-bottomed boats through most of its length, making it the main artery for moving goods and people through Moigos. The Kappa control river traffic — not officially, but through ownership of the boats, the docks, and the warehouses where cargo changes hands.

**Skraigos River**: The western waterway, running roughly parallel to the Qulyintes before draining into Phylos Bay. Ragusa and Hepetas sit along its banks. The Skraigos is narrower and faster than the Qulyintes, less useful for commerce but important for the settlements it serves.

### Settlements

**Thetin** — The capital, though "capital" implies a formality that Moigos doesn't really have. Thetin is simply where the most powerful Kappa live, where the largest markets operate, and where anyone who wants to do serious business in Moigos must eventually come.

The town sprawls across both banks of the Qulyintes where the river spreads into a maze of channels and islands. Buildings are built on stilts or artificial mounds, connected by bridges and boardwalks. The architecture is practical rather than beautiful — wood and wattle construction that can be rebuilt when floods or fires claim it.

The Kappa don't rule from a palace. They rule from counting houses, from backroom tables, from anywhere a debt can be recorded and a favor called in. Thetin's nominal government — a council of merchant families — meets regularly and accomplishes nothing that the Kappa haven't already decided.

**Calentia** — Upstream on the Qulyintes, closer to the Screech Peaks. Calentia handles trade coming over the mountains from Ios and serves as a waystation for goods moving to and from Thetin. The town is drier than the capital, built on higher ground where the river valley narrows.

Calentia has a reputation for being slightly more honest than Thetin — the Kappa presence is lighter here, and legitimate merchants can operate with fewer complications. This reputation is carefully cultivated and only partially true.

**Ragusa** — The larger of the two Skraigos River towns, Ragusa sits where the river is still navigable. The town processes timber from the Alegheim forest and agricultural products from the surrounding wetlands. It's a working town, less political than Thetin, more focused on actual production.

**Hepetas** — Smaller and further upstream on the Skraigos, Hepetas marks the edge of navigable water. Beyond here, the river becomes too shallow and fast for boats. The town serves the villages and farms of the upper valley and handles overland traffic heading west toward Phylos Bay.

### Urun Mountains

The eastern wall of Moigos, separating the swamplands from Fernius Sound. Where the Screech Peaks divide Petrona Septia's interior, the Urun range defines its eastern coast — a spine of grey granite and black shale running north-south along the water's edge. The mountains aren't tall, but they're steep and densely forested on the lower slopes, giving way to bare rock and scree above.

The Kappa treat the Urun differently than they treat the swamps. The lowland forests are their domain, woven through with debts and obligations. The mountains are... storage.

#### Lower Slopes

The accessible valleys and foothills are where the Kappa keep what they don't want found. Mining camps work veins of copper and iron, staffed by debtors who defaulted and found themselves with no other way to pay. The work isn't slavery — technically. The workers chose this over the alternatives the Kappa offered. They'll be free when their debts are cleared. The debts, somehow, never quite clear.

Beyond the mines, the lower Urun hold caches known only to specific Kappa families. Wealth that can't be kept in counting houses. Evidence that might prove useful someday. Bodies that were never meant to be found. The mountains don't judge, and stone keeps secrets better than swamp mud.

Calentia serves as the gateway to the Urun. Anyone heading into the mountains passes through, and the Kappa-connected merchants there note who goes up and who comes down. Legitimate prospectors are tolerated — they occasionally find something valuable, and their discoveries always seem to benefit the right people. Treasure hunters heading for rumored caches are watched more carefully. Most don't come back.

#### Upper Reaches

Above the treeline, the Kappa's influence fades. Not because they lack the reach, but because they choose not to extend it.

The toad-folk keep records going back centuries — meticulous accounts of debts, agreements, and territorial arrangements. Those records include a simple note, repeated across generations: *don't dig too deep*. No explanation. No context. Just the instruction, passed down like any other piece of institutional knowledge.

Something was in the Urun before the Kappa came to Moigos. Before humans settled Petrona Septia. Ruins mark certain peaks — foundations of structures built from stones too large to have been carried up the slopes, carved with symbols that don't match any known script. The screechers from the Screech Peaks won't fly over certain ridges. Goats that wander too high don't come back, but neither do their bones turn up.

The Kappa don't talk about the upper Urun. They don't forbid travel there — that would invite questions. They simply ensure that anyone asking about the high peaks receives no useful information, and anyone who goes looking finds the paths surprisingly difficult to follow.

Whatever sleeps in the upper Urun has been sleeping a long time. The Kappa see no reason to wake it.

#### The Fernius Gap

A single pass cuts through the Urun to the Fernius Sound coast — a narrow defile that sees occasional use by traders who'd rather avoid the longer route around the mountains. The Kappa control both ends, naturally. Tolls are reasonable. Delays are not unheard of. Cargo is occasionally "inspected" and found to be in violation of regulations that no one can quite cite.

The gap is also how certain goods enter and leave Moigos without appearing in any official records. Ships anchor in hidden coves along Fernius Sound; cargo moves through the pass by night; by morning, it's in Kappa warehouses with paperwork showing it arrived through entirely legitimate channels. The merchants of Calentia know better than to ask questions.

### Alegheim

The forest covering northern Moigos, stretching from the Qulyintes River to the coast near Blink Creek. Alegheim is dense, wet, and dark — the canopy blocks most sunlight, and the ground is perpetually soggy. The trees are adapted to standing water, their roots spreading wide and shallow.

The Kappa consider Alegheim their natural territory. The swampy forest suits their physiology, and they've maintained hidden places throughout — meeting spots, caches, bolt-holes for when affairs in town become complicated. Humans and other races live in Alegheim too, in villages along the rivers and clearings, but they live with the understanding that the forest belongs to others.

The forest's edge approaches the Isle of the Night and the Gloomterror's influence. The western reaches of Alegheim are darker than they should be, and the things that live there are stranger than ordinary swamp creatures.

### Isle of the Night

West of the mainland, situated in the waters between Moigos and the Tyvern Isles, lies the Isle of the Night — a mysterious island enveloped within the Gloomterror Forest.

#### Gloomterror Forest

An otherworldly forest that covers the island, where darkness is absolute and unnatural. The boundary between normal forest and Gloomterror isn't sharp — light fades gradually as you approach, colors drain away, and by the time you realize something is wrong, you're deeper than you meant to go.

##### Blackpoint

An island location within the Gloomterror Forest, totally shrouded in impenetrable shadows. No source of light works on this island — torches gutter, magical light fails, and even the sun seems unable to pierce the supernatural darkness.

Immense treasure is said to be buried on Blackpoint, drawing countless treasure hunters despite the impossibility of searching in absolute darkness. The island is guarded by umbral citadels — living shadows that have taken fortress-form, attacking any who dare set foot on the lightless shore.

The Kappa don't control Blackpoint — no one does. But they control who gets to try reaching it. Expeditions seeking the island's rumored wealth must pass through Moigos, and the Kappa take their cut coming and going. They've funded expeditions, profited from failures, and collected on debts owed by the dead.
