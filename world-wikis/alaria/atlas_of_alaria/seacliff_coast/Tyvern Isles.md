## Tyvern Isles

Tags: island, geography, tuktuk

A group of islands off the Seacleft Coast, home to the Tuktuk people. The islands are dominated by dense jungle and mysterious ruins, with settlements clustered along the coasts and rivers where the turtle-folk have built their warrior culture over generations.

The Tuktuk claim these islands as their ancestral territory — not by ancient occupation but by conquest and settlement within recorded history. Whatever peoples lived here before the Tuktuk arrived left only ruins behind. The turtle-folk found the islands, fought for them, and made them their own.

### Tuktuk Villages

The Tuktuk organize themselves by clan and village, each settlement a defensive holdfast centered on extended family groups. Villages are built to withstand assault — thick walls, choke-point approaches, communal structures that can shelter the entire population during attacks. The architecture reflects a people who expect to fight for what they have.

Eight major villages dot the Tyvern Isles:

**Nkoko** — Northernmost village, closest to the Tower of Gwyndar. The warriors of Nkoko consider themselves guardians of the ancient fortress, though they guard it from outside rather than within. Known for producing scouts and rangers who know the jungle paths intimately. When outsiders ask too many questions about the tower, Nkoko's elders are the ones who decide whether to answer.

**Mtrako** — Eastern coastal village and the primary seafaring settlement. Shipwrights work here, building the sturdy vessels the Tuktuk use for fishing, raiding, and trade. Mtrako's warriors are the most likely to interact with outsiders — they raid foreign shipping and occasionally engage in legitimate commerce. The village maintains a rough harbor where non-Tuktuk ships can anchor, though visitors should expect close observation.

**Iiunas** — Interior village deep in the forested hills. The Tuktuk here are hunters and trackers who work the deep jungle. They maintain the paths between villages, know which routes are safe and which have become dangerous, and keep the forest's threats in check. When something comes out of the jungle that shouldn't, Iiunas deals with it.

**Unu** — Small village positioned between the coast and interior, serving as a waypoint and trading post between the seafaring and forest-dwelling clans. Marriages between coastal and interior families often happen here, and the village has developed a reputation for diplomacy — by Tuktuk standards, which still involves formal duels but with more negotiation beforehand.

**Trokos** — Eastern settlement known for metalworkers and crafters. The forges of Trokos produce weapons and armor prized across the Tyvern Isles, working imported metals into blades that hold edges through brutal use. Trokos smiths are respected throughout Tuktuk society, and young warriors from other villages often serve apprenticeships here.

**Minos** — Southern village near the Ribwood Forest, primary defenders against logging expeditions. These Tuktuk have perfected forest ambush tactics, making the cost of unauthorized ribwood harvesting extremely high. They're fiercer and more hostile to outsiders than most Tuktuk — too many have watched their homeland ravaged by foreign profiteers.

**Ugna** — Central village that often hosts clan councils and major duels. The closest thing the Tuktuk have to a capital, though they'd reject that term — no single village rules the others. When decisions affecting all Tuktuk must be made, representatives gather at Ugna. When champions must settle disputes that affect multiple clans, they fight at Ugna. The village maintains neutral ground and sacred dueling circles.

**Mkoto** — Southwest village, closest to the waters facing the Torguli Islands. Watchers here monitor the southern and western approaches, noting what ships pass through Winzy Strait and what movements occur among the outer islands. They're the first to know if something unusual approaches from the direction of Aleve Akribus.

**Vitruk** — Coastal village facing Scatter Sound, the primary contact point with Moigos. Trading happens here despite cultural tensions — the Tuktuk need some goods they can't produce, and the Kappa's networks can provide them. The relationship isn't friendly, but it's practical. Vitruk's elders have learned to deal with the toad-folk crime lords without being consumed by their webs of debt and obligation.

### Jungles of Tyvern

The interior of the Tyvern Isles is covered in thick tropical jungle, dangerous and wild. The Tuktuk have cleared areas around their villages and maintain paths between settlements, but the deep jungle remains untamed — home to predators, ruins, and things the turtle-folk prefer to avoid.

#### Tower of Gwyndar

An ancient fortress deep in the jungles, visible above the canopy, serving as a landmark that sailors use for navigation even as they avoid approaching. The Tower of Gwyndar sits at the intersection of Dark and Void leylines — a nexus of shadow and emptiness that predates memory.

The tower is black stone, seamless, with no visible mortar or joints. The architecture is wrong — doorways too tall, stairs with uneven risings, rooms that seem larger inside than outside. Whoever built it wasn't human-sized, and they weren't thinking in human ways. The Tuktuk found it when they settled these islands; they didn't build it. No one knows who did.

The leyline intersection creates *absence*. Within the tower, shadows are deeper than they should be. Sounds don't carry. Memories fade. Visitors who stay too long find themselves forgetting why they came, what they were looking for, who they are.

The Nkoko village considers themselves guardians, but "guardian" means keeping things from coming *out*. They don't enter except in dire need, and those who do enter don't always return unchanged. Expeditions from outside occasionally try to explore; the Tuktuk warn them once, then let the tower handle the problem.

#### Black Forest

Located in the jungles near the Tower of Gwyndar, the Black Forest is an unnatural place where nearly all color has been drained away. Your shadow can leave your body here, becoming separated and wandering independently — a deeply unsettling phenomenon that can result in permanent loss of one's shadow.

Large ogres that have lost their shadows live in this forest, hunting by the absence of light rather than its presence. The forest is extremely dangerous, as those who lose their shadows often lose part of their essence, becoming hollow and susceptible to possession by shadow entities.

### Southern Tyvern

The southern islands of the Tyvern archipelago feature different terrain and resources from the central jungles.

#### Ribwood Forest

A forest on the southern Tyvern Islands, home to a rare and valuable tree species known as ribwood. This remarkable wood is completely fireproof — it doesn't burn under any circumstances, making it incredibly valuable for shipbuilding. Wealthy merchants and pirates prize ribwood vessels above all others, as they're immune to fire arrows, Greek fire, and the countless other flame-based hazards of naval warfare.

However, harvesting ribwood comes at a cost. The Tuktuk people live in and around the Ribwood Forest, and they fiercely resent outsiders who ravage their homeland for profit. Logging expeditions into the forest frequently end in violence, with Tuktuk warriors — particularly those from Minos village — ambushing the loggers. Despite the danger, the lure of fireproof ships ensures that treasure-seekers continue to risk the Tuktuk's wrath to harvest the precious wood.
