## Tyvern Isles

Tags: island, geography

A group of islands off the Seacleft Coast, home to the Tuktuk people. The islands are dominated by dense jungle and mysterious ruins.

### Jungles of Tyvern

The interior of the Tyvern Isles is covered in thick tropical jungle, dangerous and wild.

#### Tower of Gwyndar

An ancient fortress deep in the jungles, serving as a landmark and strategic position. The tower predates current Tuktuk settlement and shows signs of much older construction.

#### Black Forest

Located in the jungles near the Tower of Gwyndar, the Black Forest is an unnatural place where nearly all color has been drained away. Your shadow can leave your body here, becoming separated and wandering independently—a deeply unsettling phenomenon that can result in permanent loss of one's shadow.

Large ogres that have lost their shadows live in this forest, hunting by the absence of light rather than its presence. The forest is extremely dangerous, as those who lose their shadows often lose part of their essence, becoming hollow and susceptible to possession by shadow entities.

### Southern Tyvern

The southern islands of the Tyvern archipelago feature different terrain and resources from the central jungles.

#### Ribwood Forest

A forest on the southern Tyvern Islands, home to a rare and valuable tree species known as ribwood. This remarkable wood is completely fireproof—it doesn't burn under any circumstances, making it incredibly valuable for shipbuilding. Wealthy merchants and pirates prize ribwood vessels above all others, as they're immune to fire arrows, Greek fire, and the countless other flame-based hazards of naval warfare.

However, harvesting ribwood comes at a cost. The Tuktuk people live in and around the Ribwood Forest, and they fiercely resent outsiders who ravage their homeland for profit. Logging expeditions into the forest frequently end in violence, with Tuktuk warriors ambushing the loggers. Despite the danger, the lure of fireproof ships ensures that treasure-seekers continue to risk the Tuktuk's wrath to harvest the precious wood.
