## Ripmaw Sound

Tags: sea, geography, hazard

The western waters between Iqes and the Upoceax mainland, Ripmaw Sound earned its name from the volcanic rock formations that lurk beneath its surface. Ships that stray from the known channels find their hulls ripped open by jagged basalt ridges invisible until the moment of impact.

The sound is navigable — generations of Qindo sailors have mapped safe passages through its dangers — but the channels shift. Volcanic activity continues deep below, slowly raising new ridges and collapsing old ones. Charts more than a decade old are unreliable. Charts from outsiders are worthless.

### The Ripmaw Ridges

Unlike the crystalline formations of the Shardmaw Isles or the dramatic spires of the Golem's Teeth, the Ripmaw ridges are insidious. Dark volcanic rock, often covered with seaweed and barnacles, sits just below the waterline — invisible in anything but the calmest, clearest conditions. A ship can sail over a ridge a hundred times safely, then catch it wrong on the hundred-and-first passage when the tide is slightly lower or the hull sits slightly deeper.

The ridges run roughly north-south in parallel lines, remnants of ancient lava flows that cooled into razor-sharp formations. The safe channels wind between them in patterns that seem random but follow the geological logic of the seafloor. Qindo pilots learn these patterns as children; outsiders learn them the hard way.

### Navigation

Passage through Ripmaw Sound requires either a local pilot or extraordinary luck. The Qindo villages along the Ntando coast produce pilots who hire out to foreign vessels — one of the few reliable sources of outside income for the traditional communities. These pilots are well-paid and well-respected, even by the foreign elite in Mjiqa who otherwise dismiss Ntando as backwards.

The piloting tradition is closely guarded. Routes are taught within families, passed from parent to child through years of apprenticeship. Attempts to chart the sound systematically have failed; the channels shift too frequently, and the pilots have no interest in making their knowledge obsolete.

### The Cast Cays

Scattered through the northern reaches of Ripmaw Sound, the Cast Cays are a loose collection of small islands — volcanic remnants too small or poor for permanent settlement. The name refers to their scattered, cast-off appearance, as if a giant had thrown handfuls of rock into the sea.

The cays serve several purposes:
- **Emergency shelter** for ships caught in storms or needing repairs
- **Fishing camps** during seasonal runs
- **Smuggler hideouts** for those who'd rather not dock in proper ports
- **Exile** for those who've made enemies and need to disappear

No one governs the Cast Cays. No one claims them. They exist in the margins, useful precisely because they're ignored.

### What Lives Below

Sailors who work Ripmaw Sound speak of things in the water — shapes glimpsed in the murk, impacts against hulls that weren't rocks, crews that vanished from anchored ships without explanation. Most attribute these stories to the sound's genuine dangers and the human tendency to invent monsters. The ridges are threat enough without adding creatures.

But the old Qindo pilots pour offerings into certain waters and avoid certain channels regardless of the tide. They say the sound has moods, and a wise sailor learns to read them. What creates those moods — currents, pressure, or something with intentions — they decline to specify.

The wrecks that litter the seafloor between the ridges attract scavengers. Some of those scavengers are fish. Some are larger. The pilots know which wrecks to avoid, and they don't explain why.
