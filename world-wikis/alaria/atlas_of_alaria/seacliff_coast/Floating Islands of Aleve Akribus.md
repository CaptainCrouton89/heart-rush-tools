## Floating Islands of Aleve Akribus

Tags: island, geography, magical

A cluster of islands that hang suspended in the air above the sea, southwest of the Torguli Islands chain. The Floating Islands of Aleve Akribus drift at altitudes ranging from fifty to several hundred feet, their positions shifting slowly with winds that don't match the currents below. From a distance, they appear as dark shapes against the sky — obviously solid, obviously not where islands should be.

No one knows why they float. The islands have hung in the air for as long as anyone remembers, and theories about their origin range from ancient magic to leyline anomalies to something buried in the islands' cores that defies natural law. Whatever the cause, the effect is undeniable: these islands do not touch the water.

### The Islands

The cluster contains perhaps a dozen major islands and numerous smaller rocks, all suspended at varying heights. The largest islands support vegetation — trees grow sideways from cliff edges, roots dangling into empty air; grasses cover the upper surfaces; vines trail down toward the sea below without ever reaching it. The smallest are bare rock, slowly eroding as wind and rain wear them away with nothing below to catch the debris.

The islands drift. Not quickly — their movement is measured in feet per day rather than miles — but continuously. The cluster's general position remains consistent (southwest of the Torguli chain), but individual islands shift relative to each other. Gaps that existed yesterday may be closed today; islands that were neighbors may have drifted apart.

Some islands trail vegetation, vines, or even waterfalls from their undersides — fresh water from springs that have nowhere to go but down. This water falls into the sea, a continuous rain beneath the floating rocks.

### Access

Reaching Aleve Akribus is the primary challenge. The islands have no harbors because ships cannot dock at something that floats in the air. The approaches include:

**Flight**: The obvious solution, available to those with wings or magic. Flying creatures can reach the islands easily, and whatever lives there presumably uses this method.

**Climbing**: Some islands trail vegetation low enough to grab from a ship's mast or a small boat. Climbing the vines is possible but dangerous — the plants are living things that sway in the wind, and falling means falling into the sea from significant height.

**The Bridges**: Rumors persist of rope bridges connecting some islands to the Torguli chain's outermost rocks — constructed by someone, maintained by someone, used by someone. If these bridges exist, they're not visible from normal sailing distances, and those who know their locations don't advertise them.

### Inhabitants

The islands aren't empty. From below, observers have seen:
- Smoke rising from structures that can't be clearly resolved
- Lights at night, moving between islands
- Shapes that might be people, or might be something else
- What appear to be buildings, though their architecture doesn't match any known culture

Whoever or whatever lives on Aleve Akribus doesn't come down. Ships that anchor beneath the islands and wait are ignored. Shouts go unanswered. Signals aren't returned. The inhabitants — if that's what they are — show no interest in contact with those below.

Occasionally, things fall from the islands. Usually debris — branches, rocks, fragments of what might be pottery or tools. Rarely, more significant objects: an artifact of unknown purpose, a body of indeterminate species, a sealed container with contents that raise more questions than answers. These falls appear accidental rather than intentional, but with beings who won't communicate, intentions are impossible to determine.

### Speculation

Theories about Aleve Akribus fill tavern conversations across the Seacleft Coast:

**Ancient refuge**: The islands were lifted deliberately by some ancient power, creating an inaccessible sanctuary. The current inhabitants are descendants of whoever fled there, or guardians left behind, or something else entirely.

**Natural phenomenon**: Certain rocks, under certain conditions, simply float. The islands are a geological curiosity rather than a magical creation, and the inhabitants are simply people who found a way to reach them and decided to stay.

**Prison**: The islands were raised to isolate something dangerous. What lives there isn't a population — it's a captive, or captives, kept away from the world for reasons that remain valid.

**Ongoing experiment**: Someone is using the islands for something, and the lack of contact is deliberate concealment rather than indifference.

None of these theories can be confirmed without reaching the islands and speaking to their inhabitants — neither of which has been accomplished by anyone willing to share what they learned.
