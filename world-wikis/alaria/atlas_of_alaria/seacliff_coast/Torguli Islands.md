## Torguli Islands

Tags: island, geography

A long, curving chain of islands stretching southwest from the main Tyvern archipelago into open water. The Torguli Islands arc across perhaps a hundred miles of sea, each island visible from the next, forming a natural pathway that sailors have followed since before recorded history.

The islands are uninhabited in any permanent sense. They're too small, too exposed, and too far from the resources needed for sustained settlement. But their chain-like arrangement makes them invaluable for navigation — following the Torguli will take you southwest toward deeper waters, and each island serves as a waypoint confirming you're still on course.

### Character

The islands share a common character: low, rocky, wind-scoured. Vegetation is sparse — salt-tolerant grasses, scrub bushes, the occasional twisted tree that's learned to grow nearly horizontal. Fresh water is scarce; some islands have brackish pools that collect rainfall, but most offer nothing drinkable.

Seabirds nest here in enormous numbers. The islands' isolation and lack of ground predators make them ideal breeding grounds, and during nesting season the rocks are covered with birds and the air filled with their calls. Egg-collectors sometimes make the journey out, but the birds defend their nests aggressively, and the trip rarely proves worth the effort.

### Uses

**Navigation**: The primary value of the Torguli Islands is showing the way. Sailors heading southwest use them as stepping stones, each island confirming position and providing a landmark for the next leg. Heading northeast, the chain guides travelers back toward the Tyvern Isles and the inhabited waters beyond.

**Temporary shelter**: Ships caught by weather can anchor in the lee of the larger islands, waiting out storms in relative safety. The islands don't offer much, but they break the wind and waves enough to make the difference between riding out a storm and being swamped.

**Disappearing**: The Torguli Islands offer privacy for those who need it. Smugglers cache goods here; fugitives hide between the rocks; people who need to meet without witnesses find the isolation convenient. The chain is long enough and the islands numerous enough that someone who wants to lose themselves can do so effectively.

### The Outer Islands

The southwestern end of the chain trails off into increasingly scattered rocks, eventually disappearing into open water. The outermost islands are rarely visited — too far from anything useful, too exposed to weather, too empty of resources. Sailors who've gone that far report that the final islands are little more than wave-washed rocks, barely above the waterline.

Beyond the chain's end lies the Floating Islands of Aleve Akribus, visible on clear days as distant shapes that hang in the air rather than resting on the water. Some believe the Torguli Islands once extended all the way to Aleve Akribus, and that the floating islands are simply the chain's continuation — lifted into the sky by forces unknown.

### Local Knowledge

The Tuktuk don't claim the Torguli Islands the way they claim the main Tyvern archipelago, but they know them better than anyone. Tuktuk fishermen and raiders have used the chain for generations, and their villages hold accumulated knowledge of each island — which have water, which offer shelter, which are treacherous despite appearing safe.

This knowledge isn't shared freely. Outsiders who want to traverse the Torguli can hire Tuktuk guides, but the guides show only what's necessary for the immediate journey. The chain's secrets remain with those who've earned them through years of experience.
