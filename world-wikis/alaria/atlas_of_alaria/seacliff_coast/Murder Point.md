## Murder Point

Tags: poi, landmark, history

A rocky headland on Iqes's eastern coast, jutting into the dangerous waters near the Golem's Teeth. The name is not metaphorical.

Murder Point has served as an execution site for over two centuries — first during the foreign merchant takeover of Iqes, when native leaders who resisted were thrown from its cliffs, and continuously since as the preferred disposal method for the ring-holders' enemies. The bodies go into the churning water below, where currents carry them into the Golem's Teeth. Few are ever recovered.

### The Original Murders

When foreign merchants consolidated their control over Iqes roughly two hundred years ago, resistance concentrated among the traditional Qindo leadership — village elders, halfling clan-chiefs, and the loose council of headmen who'd governed before the outsiders arrived. These leaders were systematically eliminated.

The merchants wanted the deaths to be public, memorable, and deniable. Murder Point provided all three. Victims were brought to the headland, accused of various crimes against commerce and order, and pushed from the cliff edge. The official story was that they'd been exiled and the sea had claimed them. Everyone knew the truth. That was the point.

Dozens died here in the consolidation period. The Qindo remember their names. The ring-holders do not.

### Continuing Use

The headland never stopped serving its purpose. The voting ring system created new enemies — rivals, rebels, criminals, and those who simply knew too much. Formal execution was messy, created martyrs, invited questions. Murder Point was cleaner.

A prisoner brought to the point at night, witnesses kept minimal, a brief ceremony of accusation, and then the drop. The currents did the rest. By morning, any evidence had scattered across miles of seafloor or been pulled into the rocks of the Golem's Teeth.

The practice continues. Ring-holders don't discuss it openly, but everyone in Mjiqa knows what it means when someone "went to the point." The phrase has become a threat, a warning, a promise of consequences for those who cross the wrong people.

### The Place Itself

Murder Point is not impressive to look at — a bare rock promontory perhaps a hundred feet above the waterline, scoured by wind and spray, with no structures or markers. The cliff edge is crumbling in places, undercut by centuries of waves. Standing there, you can see the Golem's Teeth to the northeast, the waters churning between the jagged rocks.

The Qindo avoid the headland. They say the ghosts of the murdered linger there, unable to rest because their bodies were never properly buried. Some claim to have seen lights on the point at night, or heard voices calling from the cliff edge. The ring-holders dismiss these stories as native superstition.

Whether superstition or truth, something about Murder Point unsettles even skeptics. The wind sounds wrong there. The shadows fall at odd angles. Animals won't approach the cliff edge. Those who've witnessed executions report that the victims sometimes seem to be pulled rather than pushed — as if something below reached up to claim them.

### Significance

Murder Point represents Iqes's dual nature. The glittering coral cities, the proud trading culture, the sophisticated voting ring system — all of it rests on a foundation of violence and dispossession. The Qindo know this. The foreign elite prefer not to think about it.

For players, Murder Point is both a location and a symbol. Someone brought here is meant to disappear. Someone who escapes from here has defied the powers that rule Iqes. And someone investigating the headland's history might uncover secrets that powerful people would kill to keep buried — if killing could be done more discreetly than usual.
