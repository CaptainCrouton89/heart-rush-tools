## Scatter Sound

Tags: sea, geography

The body of water between the Eskiloko coast, the Tyvern Isles, and the Isle of the Night. Named for the countless small islands, rocks, and reefs scattered across its surface, Scatter Sound is a maze of hazards and hiding places that rewards local knowledge and punishes overconfidence.

The sound isn't deep — much of it can be waded at low tide if you know where to step. This makes it navigable for small craft but treacherous for larger vessels, whose keels find the bottom unexpectedly. The scattered islands break up waves and currents, creating calm patches next to sudden turbulence.

### The Scattered Islands

Dozens of islands dot the sound, ranging from bare rocks that barely break the surface to forested islets large enough to camp on. None support permanent settlement — they're too small, too exposed, or too frequently submerged — but they serve countless temporary purposes.

**Fishing camps** appear seasonally when particular species run through the sound. Fishermen from both Tuktuk villages and Eskiloko settlements work these waters, maintaining an uneasy coexistence based on tradition and practicality. Certain islands are "Tuktuk rocks" and others are "mainland stones," divisions everyone knows but no one officially acknowledges.

**Smuggler caches** hide among the islands. The sound's complexity makes it ideal for stashing goods away from official eyes — whatever "official" means in a region where the Kappa run everything that matters. Small boats can weave through channels that larger patrol vessels can't follow, dropping cargo on islands that look identical to the uninitiated.

**Meeting points** for those who don't want to be seen meeting. The islands provide neutral ground between factions, private spaces for negotiations that can't happen in town, and convenient locations for exchanges that benefit from witnesses being absent.

### The Gloomterror Approach

The western reaches of Scatter Sound border the Isle of the Night, where the Gloomterror Forest's unnatural darkness bleeds into the water. Sailors report that the boundary isn't sharp — you don't sail from normal water into supernatural shadow. Instead, the light dims gradually, colors fade, and by the time you realize something is wrong, you're deeper in than you meant to go.

The islands nearest the Isle of the Night are avoided. They sit in permanent twilight even at noon, and the things that wash up on their shores aren't always identifiable. Fishermen who work the western sound learn exactly how far they can go — and they don't go farther.

### Navigation

Working Scatter Sound requires either intimate local knowledge or a willingness to move slowly and sound constantly. The channels between islands shift with storms and seasons; what was passable last month may ground you today. Both Tuktuk and Eskiloko pilots know the sound's moods, and hiring one is the only safe way for outsiders to traverse it.

The alternative is going around — south through Winzy Strait or north past the Tyvern Isles. Most merchant traffic takes these longer routes rather than risk the sound's hazards. Only locals, smugglers, and the desperate thread their way through the scattered islands.

### Tensions

Scatter Sound is contested water in the sense that everyone uses it and no one controls it. The Tuktuk consider it part of their ancestral territory. The Kappa consider it part of their operational area. Neither group has the ability or desire to enforce exclusive control, so both tolerate the other's presence while maintaining the option to cause problems if needed.

The result is a working peace punctuated by incidents. A Tuktuk fishing boat cuts the nets of an Eskiloko competitor. A smuggler cache is raided by persons unknown. A meeting on a neutral island ends in violence. These events rarely escalate — everyone benefits too much from the sound's usefulness to let any single dispute poison the whole arrangement — but the potential for escalation keeps everyone careful.
