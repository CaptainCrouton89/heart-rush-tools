## Ios

Tags: state, nation

The southwestern state on Petrona Septia Island, Ios occupies the lands between the Screech Peaks and the sea. Once a prosperous civilization that solved the problem of labor through magical automation, Ios is now in slow decline — its animated stone servants are breaking down, the art of creating them is lost, and the society built around their labor is struggling to adapt.

The terrain varies from mountain foothills around the capital Todakres, through river valleys where most settlements cluster, to the Koilos forest in the south. The Dipindre River and its tributary the Nioplenese provide water and transportation, while the coast offers limited access to the sea through the shallow harbor at Methons.

### Rivers

**Dipindre River**: The main waterway of Ios, flowing from the Screech Peaks southwest through the heart of the state before reaching the coast near Methons. The river valley is where most of Ios's population lives — the land is fertile, the water is reliable, and the terrain is gentler than the surrounding hills and mountains.

Settlements dot the Dipindre's banks: Tolosa and Capsa in the middle reaches, with smaller villages and farms throughout. The river is navigable for small boats, though nothing like the commerce that flows through Moigos's waterways.

**Nioplenese River**: A tributary joining the Dipindre from the east, draining the lands between the mountains and the Koilos forest. The Nioplenese valley is less populated than the main river, but the eastern settlements depend on it for water and transportation.

### Capital and Cities

**Todakres** — The capital of Ios, built into the foothills of the Screech Peaks where the mountains provide natural defenses and the high ground offers strategic advantage. Todakres is old — older than the current state, older than the stone doll tradition, old enough that no one remembers who built the original fortifications.

The city is vertical, climbing the mountainside in terraces connected by stairs and ramps. The stone dolls that once handled all heavy labor made this possible — goods could be carried up endless stairs by tireless servants, water could be hauled from the river below, waste could be removed without human effort. Now, with the dolls failing, the upper terraces are being abandoned. The population is slowly migrating downward, leaving empty buildings and broken mechanisms behind.

The ruling families of Ios maintain their estates in Todakres, clinging to traditions established when the stone dolls made such luxury possible. They're aware of the crisis. They have no idea how to solve it.

**Methons** — The coastal city, such as it is. Methons sits on Phylos Bay where the Dipindre River reaches the sea, but the harbor is shallow and silted — suitable for fishing boats, not merchant vessels. What little maritime trade Ios conducts happens here, with goods transferred to smaller craft that can navigate the difficult approaches.

Methons has always been secondary to Todakres. The stone dolls made coastal access less important — why trade by sea when your automated servants can carry anything overland? Now that the dolls are failing, Methons's limitations are becoming a serious problem. Ios can't easily import what it needs or export what it produces.

### Settlements

**Petras** — A hill town in the upper Dipindre valley, known for quarrying the stone used to make the dolls. The quarries still operate, producing building materials, but the specialized stone that went into doll construction was exhausted generations ago — or so the craftspeople claim. Some believe deposits remain undiscovered.

**Rhodanos** — A farming community in the central valley, one of the most productive agricultural areas in Ios. The stone dolls worked the fields here within living memory. Now humans must do the work, and the fields are shrinking as the labor force proves inadequate.

**Tolosa** — A market town where the Dipindre valley widens, serving as a trading hub for the surrounding settlements. Tolosa has adapted better than most to the loss of the dolls — it was always a place of commerce rather than production, and commerce can continue even when production falters.

**Capsa** — A town at the confluence of the Dipindre and Nioplenese rivers, strategically positioned to control traffic on both waterways. Capsa has a defensive tradition, having served as a strongpoint in various conflicts, and maintains walls that most Ios settlements lack.

### Koilos

The forest covering southern Ios, stretching from the Dipindre valley to the coast. Koilos is dense and largely unexplored — the stone dolls never worked there (they were designed for agriculture and construction, not forestry), and Ios never developed a timber industry.

The forest is rumored to hold ruins from before the current settlement, structures that predate even Todakres. Whether these are remnants of an earlier civilization or something else entirely, no one knows. Few Ios citizens venture into Koilos, and those who do don't always return.

### The Screech Peaks (Ios Side)

The southwestern slopes of the Screech Peaks define Ios's northern boundary. The mountains provide natural defenses, mineral resources, and the headwaters of the Dipindre River. The passes through to Moigos are few and difficult, limiting contact between the states.

Todakres is built against these mountains, using their height for defense and their stone for construction. The upper reaches above the city are wild — home to the creatures that give the Screech Peaks their name.
