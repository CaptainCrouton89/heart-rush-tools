## Rilyn

Tags: state, citystate, nation

A city-state on Petrona Septia Island in the Seacleft Coast region. Located north/northeast of Ios and southeast of Moigos, Rilyn sits within the forest of Puma Wood on the northeastern side of the Screech Peaks (Ios lies on the southwestern side of the range).

Home to the Splinkreen—woodland people whose souls were transplanted from mighty trees into humanoid forms. Their bark-like skin ranges from smooth birch white to rough oak brown, and the forested environment of Puma Wood suits them perfectly.
