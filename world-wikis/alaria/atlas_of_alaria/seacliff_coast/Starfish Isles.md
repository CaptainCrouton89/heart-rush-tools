## Starfish Isles

Tags: island, geography, fishing

A sprawling archipelago of low-lying islands, sandbars, and reef systems stretching north of Enavadi into open water. The Starfish Isles take their name from the vast colonies of brilliantly colored starfish that cling to every submerged surface—orange, crimson, and gold creatures whose pigments form the foundation of Linas's dye trade.

The isles are less a coherent landmass than a maze of shallow tidal flats, partially submerged reefs, and sandy spits that appear and disappear with the tides. Deep-draft vessels cannot navigate here; only flat-bottomed harvesting boats and small fishing craft can work these waters safely. This natural barrier has kept the isles largely uninhabited despite their economic value.

### The Harvesting Grounds

The shallow waters of the Starfish Isles contain the richest shellfish beds on the Seacleft Coast. Starfish, snails, and clams grow here in extraordinary concentrations, their shells saturated with the orange and crimson pigments that make Linas dye famous across Alaria. Hundreds of Linas harvesting ships work these waters daily during the warm seasons, their crews diving to collect shellfish by hand or dragging specialized nets across the sandy bottom.

Linas claims exclusive harvesting rights to the isles, enforced by armed dye-guild vessels that patrol the major channels. In practice, the waters are too vast and the channels too numerous for complete control. Poachers—independent harvesters, Mirko-affiliated smugglers, and opportunistic fishermen from a dozen ports—work the edges of the grounds constantly. The guild ships catch perhaps one in ten, and the fines are simply a cost of doing business.

### The Tide-Singers

On the outermost isles, where the Starfish Isles give way to the deep water of the Walker Depths, a small religious order maintains a scattering of weathered shrines. The Tide-Singers—never more than a few dozen souls—believe that the drowned dead who walk the seafloor below are ancestors trapped between worlds, unable to pass on because they died without proper rites.

The Tide-Singers perform ceremonies at the turning of tides, singing names into the water to "release" specific dead. Whether the rituals work is a matter of faith. What's certain is that desperate families sometimes make the journey to the outer isles, paying the Singers to call for a lost relative. The Singers accept no coin—only objects that belonged to the deceased, which they weight with stones and drop into the depths.

Most Linas harvesters consider the Tide-Singers harmless eccentrics, tolerated because they harm no one and occasionally provide shelter to boats caught in sudden storms. A few old salts speak of them differently—claiming the waters near the shrines are calmer, that the walking dead below give those places a wide berth. The Singers themselves say nothing either way.

### The Walker Depths

The deep channel between the Starfish Isles and the coast of Mueras to the west contains the Walker Depths—waters where the drowned dead walk the seafloor in endless, silent procession. Fishermen avoid these waters not from physical danger (the walkers rarely surface) but from unease. On still nights, lights can be seen moving below the surface, and weighted lines sometimes come up tangled in ways that suggest grasping hands.

The Tide-Singers believe these are the restless dead of shipwrecks past, trapped by improper burial. Scholars in Linas theorize it's some form of necromantic current or planar bleed. Whatever the truth, wise captains chart their courses around the Depths rather than through them.

### Navigation and Hazards

The Starfish Isles are navigable only by those who know them. Channels shift with storms and seasons; sandbars that were passable last month may ground a boat today. Linas pilots train for years before earning certification to guide vessels through the major routes, and even they refuse to work unfamiliar channels without local guides.

Beyond the navigational challenges, the outer isles border genuinely dangerous waters. To the west lie the Walker Depths. To the northwest, the approaches to Mueras and the Labyrinth Sound. Ships that stray too far from the harvesting grounds may find themselves in waters where the hazards are more than geographical.
