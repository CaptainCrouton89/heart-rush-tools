## Phylos Bay

Tags: sea, geography

A large bay on the western coast of Petrona Septia Island, where the Dipindre River meets the sea and the city of Methons maintains its shallow harbor. Phylos Bay is broad and sheltered from the worst weather, but its waters are treacherously shallow — the bay floor rises gradually from the open sea, limiting access to vessels with modest drafts.

The bay's limitations have shaped the development of western Petrona Septia. A deep harbor here would have made Methons a significant port; instead, the city remains a fishing town with delusions of maritime commerce. Ships that want to trade with Ios must either anchor in the outer bay and transfer cargo to smaller boats, or find other routes entirely.

### The Shallows

The central problem of Phylos Bay is the seafloor. Sediment from the Dipindre River has accumulated over centuries, building up sandbars and mudflats that extend far from the shoreline. The navigable channel shifts with storms and seasons, and even local pilots sometimes misjudge the depth.

Large merchant vessels don't attempt the inner bay at all. They anchor in the deeper water near the bay's mouth and wait for lighters — small, flat-bottomed boats — to ferry cargo to and from Methons. This adds cost, time, and complication to every shipment, making trade with Ios less profitable than it might otherwise be.

The fishing boats that work Phylos Bay have no such problems. Their shallow drafts let them navigate anywhere in the bay, and the same silted bottom that frustrates merchants creates excellent habitat for the fish and shellfish that sustain Methons's economy.

### Methons Harbor

The harbor at Methons is adequate for fishing — protected from weather, with beaches where boats can be hauled out and docks where catches can be landed. It's inadequate for serious commerce, lacking the depth for merchant vessels and the infrastructure for large-scale cargo handling.

The Ios ruling families have discussed dredging the harbor for generations. The stone dolls could have done it easily; human labor makes it impractical. The harbor remains as it's always been — useful for fish, frustrating for everything else.

### The Skraigos Outflow

The Skraigos River empties into the northern reaches of Phylos Bay, adding its sediment to the Dipindre's. The river mouth is even shallower than Methons harbor — navigable only for the smallest boats, and even those must know the channels. The Moigos towns on the Skraigos have no meaningful sea access through Phylos Bay.

### Western Approaches

Beyond Phylos Bay lies the open western sea — the Ocean of Elorinia, stretching toward distant lands. Ships heading west from Petrona Septia must navigate out of the bay's shallows before finding deep water, a process that takes hours and requires careful attention to the bottom.

The bay's mouth is marked by a series of rocky islets that provide some protection from storms but also narrow the entrance. In bad weather, the waves breaking over these rocks make the approach dangerous. Sensible captains wait for calmer conditions rather than risk the bay entrance in a storm.

### Isolation

Phylos Bay's shallows contribute to Petrona Septia's isolation from maritime trade. The island's position should make it a useful waypoint for ships traveling the western Seacleft Coast, but the difficulty of actually reaching its ports discourages most traffic. Merchants prefer routes that don't require lightering cargo through a silted bay.

This isolation was less significant when Ios's stone dolls made overland transport practical. Now that the dolls are failing, Phylos Bay's limitations are becoming a genuine problem. Ios needs to trade but can't easily get goods to market; the shallow harbor that never mattered when dolls carried everything now matters very much indeed.
