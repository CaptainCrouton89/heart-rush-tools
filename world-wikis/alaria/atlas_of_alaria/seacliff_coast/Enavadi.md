## Enavadi

Tags: state, nation, fishing

A stretch of rocky coastline and sheltered bays along the Seacleft Coast, home to the most skilled fishermen in Alaria. Enavadi is less a unified nation than a confederation of fishing villages bound by shared customs, intermarriage, and a deep suspicion of outsiders. The land is poor—thin soil, few resources, no strategic value—but the waters are rich, and the Enavadi have built everything around them.

The coast runs roughly north-south, with Edko Sound and the Floss Islands forming a natural harbor complex in the north, and Prince's Bay opening to the south toward the waters around Gyosha. Between them lie a handful of fishing villages, each with its own specialty and character, collectively producing catches that feed markets across the Seacleft Coast.

### Edkovic

The capital, if Enavadi can be said to have one. Edkovic is the largest settlement—perhaps five thousand souls—but it feels like an overgrown fishing village that happens to host the government. No walls protect it. No monuments celebrate past victories. The architecture is practical: wooden buildings clustered around an enormous harbor complex, everything oriented toward the sea.

The **Great Docks** stretch for miles along the waterfront—a maze of wooden piers, boathouses, and chandleries organized by an elaborate system of family berths that outsiders find incomprehensible. Each extended family maintains hereditary rights to specific dock sections, passed down through generations. Disputes over berth boundaries have occasionally ended in violence, though the net-councils usually resolve such matters before blood is shed.

The **Smoking Halls** dominate the town's interior—massive communal facilities for preserving fish. The smell defines Edkovic. Visitors notice it immediately and never entirely stop noticing. The smoke-scent clings to hair, clothes, and skin for days after departure. Locals claim they can identify which village a person comes from by the particular character of smoke in their clothes.

The **Stranger's Quarter** occupies a single district where outsiders may stay, eat, and conduct trade. It is clean, adequate, and utterly without warmth. A low stone wall—not defensive, merely symbolic—separates it from the rest of Edkovic. Outsiders who venture beyond this boundary are not physically prevented, but they are watched, followed, and made to understand they are not welcome.

The **Empty Temple** stands near the Stranger's Quarter—a stone building with no god's name carved above its door. A missionary from the Middle Sea raised it three centuries ago, convinced he could bring foreign faith to these simple fishing folk. The Enavadi let him build it. They never entered. It has been a warehouse for dried nets for two hundred years, and the missionary's name has been forgotten.

### Prince's Bay

The large southern bay where Enavadi's coast curves toward Gyosha's waters. The name carries a double meaning that locals argue about endlessly.

The historical explanation: centuries ago, a prince of Veldoraine wrecked his ship in this bay during a storm. The Enavadi rescued him, healed his injuries, and then—true to their isolationist traditions—refused to let him leave. Once you've lived among them, once you've seen how they fish, you don't go back to tell outsiders. Prince Aldric of Veldoraine lived out his decades as a fisherman, reportedly became quite skilled at it, and is buried somewhere along the bay's northern shore. His descendants, if any survive, have been Enavadi for generations.

The practical explanation: "prince" is Enavadi slang for an exceptionally large catch. Prince's Bay is where the biggest fish school, so it's "where you catch a prince."

Ask an Enavadi fisherman which explanation is correct, and they'll smile and say "both."

Somewhere in Veldoraine's dusty archives, there's still a theoretical claim to "Prince Aldric of the Enavadi Shore." No one has pressed it in two hundred years, and any envoy who tried would find the Enavadi remarkably unimpressed by foreign titles.

### Vukaden

The northernmost village, closest to Edkovic and practically its suburb. Many Vukaden residents work in the capital but prefer village life—quieter, cleaner, with better neighbors. The village is known for **boat-building**. The Vukaden hull design—shallow draft, stable in chop, easily rowed when winds fail—has become the standard fishing vessel across the Seacleft Coast. Master shipwrights here are as respected as master fishermen, and apprenticeships are fiercely competitive.

### Krizan

The central village, positioned where Edko Sound narrows toward Prince's Bay. Krizan is known for two things: **net-making** and **records**.

The nets that come from Krizan workshops are works of art—fine mesh that catches small fry without tangling, weighted precisely for different current conditions, repaired so skillfully that a net can last generations. "Krizan thread catches what Enavadi eyes can't see," the saying goes.

More importantly, Krizan maintains the oldest **tide-charts** in Enavadi—generations of meticulous records documenting current patterns, storm approaches, fish movements, and seasonal variations. These charts are copied for other villages but never sold to outsiders. They represent accumulated knowledge that cannot simply be purchased, and the Krizan record-keepers guard them accordingly.

### Dijana

The southernmost village, nearest the waters around Gyosha. By Enavadi standards, Dijana is cosmopolitan—which isn't saying much. The village is known for **fish preservation**: salting, smoking, and drying techniques that allow Enavadi catches to travel far beyond fresh-fish range. Dijana's preserved fish reaches markets across the Seacleft Coast and beyond.

The village's proximity to Gyosha has other consequences. Some quiet trade happens with Mirko here—smugglers who know Dijana's shores, fishermen who occasionally carry cargo that isn't fish. The Tide Council in Edkovic pretends not to notice. Dijana's elders justify the arrangement as "keeping the criminals where we can see them," and everyone maintains the polite fiction that Enavadi has no dealings with the lawless city-state to the south.
