## Shredwreck

Tags: shipwreck, poi, salvage

The scattered remains of the *Golden Sovereignty*, a treasure galleon that went down in the waters near the Golem's Teeth three generations ago. Unlike most shipwrecks, Shredwreck isn't a single location — the ship was torn apart by the rocks and currents, its cargo scattered across more than a mile of seafloor in dozens of separate debris fields.

The treasure is real. The *Golden Sovereignty* was carrying the accumulated wealth of a failed merchant house — a final desperate voyage to relocate their fortune before creditors could seize it. Gold, silver, gems, trade goods, and reportedly several items of magical significance went down with the ship. Enough has been recovered over the decades to prove the stories true. Enough remains to keep treasure hunters coming.

### The Wreck

The *Golden Sovereignty* struck the Golem's Teeth during a storm, trying to thread a passage that experienced captains avoid even in calm weather. The ship didn't sink cleanly — it was shredded, hence the name, torn apart by successive impacts as currents drove it through the rock formations.

The main hull lies in perhaps sixty feet of water, broken into three major sections. The bow wedged between two tooth-like spires; the midsection settled on a sandy shelf; the stern was never found intact, only fragments scattered across the deeper water to the east. Between these sections, smaller debris fields mark where cargo spilled as the ship broke apart.

### Salvage Operations

Shredwreck has been worked continuously since its discovery. The early years saw a fortune recovered — gold bars, coin chests, the easily accessible cargo. What remains is harder to reach: items buried under collapsed timbers, cargo that settled in the deeper debris fields, the mysterious stern section that may have held the most valuable goods.

The salvage trade has its own economy. Licensed salvagers pay fees to the ring-holders in Mjiqa for exclusive rights to specific debris fields. Unlicensed salvagers work the margins, risking fines or worse if caught. Diving crews hire out their skills; equipment suppliers profit regardless of who finds treasure; and the town of Blackpoint exists entirely to service the operation.

Fortunes have been made here. More fortunes have been lost — spent on equipment, fees, and living expenses while searching for treasure that was already found or never existed. The salvage economy runs on hope as much as gold.

### The Debris Fields

**The Bow Section**: Wedged between two rock spires, accessible only at certain tides. The captain's quarters were here; whatever he kept closest has likely been recovered, but the rocks make systematic searching difficult.

**The Midsection**: The most thoroughly salvaged area. The main cargo hold was here, and most of the confirmed treasure came from this section. Salvagers still work it, convinced that sealed compartments or hidden caches remain.

**The Stern Debris**: Scattered across deeper water, harder to reach, less thoroughly searched. The ship's strong room was supposedly in the stern — the most secure compartment, where the most valuable cargo would have been kept. No one has found it. Either it was destroyed completely, or it lies somewhere in the debris field, waiting.

**The Deep Scatter**: Beyond the main debris fields, individual items carried by currents into deeper water. Occasional finds here suggest more remains to be discovered, but searching the open seafloor is nearly impossible.

### Blackpoint

The salvage town that grew up to service Shredwreck sits on a volcanic headland overlooking the wreck site. The "point" is black basalt, jutting into waters that are dangerous on calm days and deadly in storms.

Blackpoint is rough, transient, and lawless. No ring-holders bother claiming it; no garrison keeps order. The town exists because treasure hunters need somewhere to sleep, eat, buy equipment, and spend their earnings (or borrow against future finds). Disputes are settled privately. Credit is extended at ruinous rates. Fortunes change hands in back-room deals.

The permanent population is small — merchants, tavern-keepers, equipment suppliers, and the sort of people who profit from desperation. The transient population fluctuates with the seasons and the rumors; a credible story of new treasure discovered can double the town's size in a week.

### Dangers

The waters around Shredwreck are dangerous for the same reasons that sank the *Golden Sovereignty*. The Golem's Teeth don't forgive carelessness, and salvage operations require working in close proximity to the rocks that kill ships.

Diving itself carries risks — the depths involved push the limits of breath-holding, currents can trap divers against wreckage, and the debris is unstable. Collapses have killed salvagers. So have encounters with whatever lives in the deeper water.

And then there's the human danger. Salvagers guard their claims jealously. Theft of recovered treasure is common. Violence over particularly valuable finds is not unknown. Blackpoint's lack of law means disputes escalate quickly, and bodies occasionally join the wreckage on the seafloor.

### Rumors

The wreck has accumulated legends over the generations:

**The Strong Room**: The ship's most secure compartment, supposedly containing items too valuable to store in the main hold. No one has found it. Some believe it lies in the unsearched stern debris; others think it was ejected during the breakup and lies somewhere in the deep scatter; a few claim it was never on the ship at all.

**The Merchant's Ghost**: The head of the failed house reportedly went down with his fortune. Divers occasionally report seeing a figure in outdated clothing watching them from the murk, always just at the edge of visibility, always gone when approached.

**The Cursed Cargo**: Something in the hold wasn't gold or silver. Something the merchant house was transporting for someone else, something that may have caused the storm that sank them. Salvagers who find the wrong item don't always surface.
