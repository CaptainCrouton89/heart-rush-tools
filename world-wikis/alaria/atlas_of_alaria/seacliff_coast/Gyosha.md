### Coral Hills

Hills made of coral/sandstone that have been revealed after sea levels fell. Full of deep caves. Rumored that lots of pirates have their treasure buried here. Immune to stone magic, so quite secure.

### Shardmaw Isles

Northwest of Gyosha and west of the Coral Hills lie the Shardmaw Isles—a treacherous archipelago rich in magical crystals. These razor-sharp crystalline formations jut from the seafloor, some rising up to forty feet above the water's surface. The crystals are prized for weapon-making, capable of holding an impossibly keen edge, but they are equally effective at destroying ships.

Navigating the Shardmaw Isles is a deadly proposition—the crystalline protrusions tear through hulls with ease, sending vessels to the bottom. The isles are adjacent to the Shipwreck Hills, where boats torn to pieces by the crystal fangs frequently wash ashore, their wreckage a testament to the danger these waters pose.

### Shipwreck Hills

West of Gyosha lie the Shipwreck Hills—a series of islands whose hills are dotted with the remains of countless wrecked vessels. Ships destroyed by the nearby Shardmaw Isles wash ashore here, their broken hulls littering the landscape like tombstones in a maritime graveyard.

The hills are inhospitable not just because of the treacherous terrain, but because they are home to rusalka and wyrms. The wyrms—serpentine creatures that once roamed the crust of the world as titans the size of mountain ranges—have diminished over the ages. Now they rarely exceed a thousand feet in length, but they are still formidable predators. The combination of predatory wyrms and deadly water spirits makes the Shipwreck Hills a place to avoid, despite the potential salvage opportunities among the wrecks.
