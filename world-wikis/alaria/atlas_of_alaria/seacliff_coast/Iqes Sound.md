## Iqes Sound

Tags: sea, geography, trade

The body of water south of Iqes, between the island and the Upoceax mainland. Unlike the treacherous Ripmaw Sound to the west or the ship-killing waters around the Golem's Teeth to the east, Iqes Sound is relatively safe — the main artery for legitimate trade flowing to and from Mjiqa.

The sound is broad, deep, and well-charted. Merchant vessels from across the Seacleft Coast pass through daily, carrying goods to Iqes's markets and returning laden with exports. The waters are busy enough that pirates rarely operate here openly; too many witnesses, too many potential rescuers, too much risk of encountering an Iqes privateer who'd rather eliminate competition than share hunting grounds.

### Trade Routes

Three major shipping lanes cross Iqes Sound:

**The Mjiqa Approach** — The direct route from the southern mainland ports to Iqes's capital. Wide, well-marked, and patrolled by privateers who protect paying merchants (and note which ships haven't paid). This is how most foreign trade reaches Iqes.

**The Coastal Run** — A route hugging the Iqes shoreline, connecting the smaller ports and fishing villages. Local traffic mostly — Qindo fishermen, coastal traders, small merchants who can't afford privateer protection and rely on being too poor to rob.

**The Eastern Passage** — The route toward the Golem's Teeth and beyond to Ederri and the deeper Agreben Sea. Less traveled, more dangerous, used by ships heading to the salvage operations at Shredwreck or the truly desperate seeking the Voidlock Passage.

### The Privateer Presence

Iqes Sound is where the privateers make their money legitimate. Licensed raiders who prey on foreign shipping in distant waters return here to sell their captures, resupply, and enjoy their earnings. The sound itself is neutral ground — attacking ships in Iqes Sound would invite retaliation from every ring-holder whose commerce depends on safe passage.

This creates an odd dynamic: the same captains who'd happily sink a merchant vessel in open water will escort that vessel's sister ship through Iqes Sound for a fee. Business is business. The privateers maintain a rough order in the sound, not from virtue but from self-interest.

### The Pin Isles

The northern boundary of Iqes Sound is marked by the Pin Isles — a chain of narrow, pointed islands stretching between Iqes and Gyosha. The isles are named for their distinctive shapes: vertical spires of rock that jut from the water like pins stuck in a cushion.

The Pin Isles mark the boundary between Iqes's waters and Gyosha's sphere of influence. Fishing rights in the channels between the pins are contested; Iqes fishermen and Mirko-affiliated boats from Gyosha regularly clash over the best grounds. These disputes rarely escalate beyond thrown punches and cut nets — neither side wants to start a real conflict — but tensions simmer constantly.

The isles themselves are uninhabited. The rock is too steep for settlement, the soil nonexistent, the exposure too brutal. But the channels between them are excellent fishing grounds, and the spires make useful landmarks for navigation. Several of the larger pins have been marked with painted symbols — territorial claims, navigation aids, or warnings, depending on who you ask.

### Weather and Hazards

Iqes Sound is safer than neighboring waters, but "safer" is relative. Storms sweep through seasonally, and the sound's broad expanse offers no shelter once weather turns. Ships caught in the open have two choices: run for the nearest port or ride it out and hope.

The sound's depth means few submerged hazards, but the currents can be treacherous. Where the sound meets Ripmaw Sound to the west, conflicting currents create confused seas that have swamped unwary vessels. The eastern approaches toward the Golem's Teeth grow progressively more dangerous as the seafloor rises and rock formations multiply.

Fog is common in spring and autumn, reducing visibility to ship-lengths and making navigation by landmark impossible. Experienced captains anchor and wait; impatient ones sometimes find the coast sooner than expected.
