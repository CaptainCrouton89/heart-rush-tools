## Birthday Wreck

Tags: shipwreck, landmark, hazard

A famous shipwreck visible at extreme low tide in the waters near the Shardmaw Isles. The shattered hull of *The Fortunate Daughter* lies in thirty feet of water, her ribs exposed like a rotting carcass, a monument to wealth, hubris, and the unforgiving nature of the Shardmaw crystals.

### The Disaster

The story of the Birthday Wreck is taught to every child in Mirko as a cautionary tale about mainlanders who think money protects them from the sea.

Aldos Vermilion was a Linas dye-merchant who'd made an enormous fortune during a particularly successful harvesting season. To celebrate his only daughter Senna's sixteenth birthday, he hired *The Fortunate Daughter*—the grandest pleasure barge available—and announced an expedition to view the famous crystal formations of the Shardmaw Isles. He invited forty of Linas's most prominent families, hired musicians, performers, and the finest cooks money could buy. He loaded the vessel with gifts for his daughter, including a commissioned necklace from Mirko's most accomplished jeweler.

He also hired local guides. He ignored their advice about the route.

The pilots warned him that the northern approach to the viewing point required threading through a narrow channel where submerged crystals could shift position between tides. They recommended the southern route—longer, but safer. Vermilion, impatient and confident, insisted on the faster path. The guides refused to navigate it. Vermilion fired them and promoted his own helmsman.

The Shardmaw crystals opened the hull in six places. The barge sank in minutes. Forty-three people died, including Senna Vermilion. Only seven survived, Aldos among them, found clinging to a cask of his own wine by a fishing boat the next morning.

Aldos Vermilion never spoke another word. He died three years later, reportedly by his own hand, having distributed his entire fortune to the families of the dead.

### The Wreck Today

*The Fortunate Daughter* lies on a sandy shelf between two crystal outcroppings. At extreme low tide, her masts break the surface—a grim navigation marker that locals call "the Birthday Candles." The hull is largely intact but riddled with crystal punctures, and the interior has become a maze of collapsed decks and scattered debris.

The obvious salvage was recovered decades ago. Crystal harvesters stripped the immediately accessible valuables within months of the sinking. What remains are the fragments too dangerous or too difficult to reach—cargo hold goods buried under collapsed timbers, personal effects wedged in inaccessible corners, and whatever lies in the sealed captain's cabin at the ship's lowest deck.

### Rumors and Hooks

Despite thorough salvaging, rumors persist about treasures yet unfound:

**The Vermilion Necklace**: The birthday gift commissioned for Senna—a fortune in worked gold and enchanted stones—was never recovered. Some say it went down with Senna herself, clasped around her neck in a final gesture by her father before the sinking. Others claim it was never on the ship at all, that Aldos had it delivered separately and it was stolen during the chaos of the disaster.

**The Uninvited Guest**: Passenger manifests recovered after the sinking listed forty-two guests. Forty-three bodies were eventually recovered or confirmed dead. Someone was aboard who wasn't supposed to be, and their locked traveling chest—marked with an unfamiliar seal—has never been found.

**The Laughter Below**: Salvagers who work the wreck too long report hearing sounds from the lower decks—music, laughter, the clink of glasses. Most dismiss this as currents moving through the ruined hull, creating sounds that tired minds interpret as celebration. Others note that the sounds are always clearest on Senna Vermilion's birthday, and that divers who follow the laughter too deep don't always surface.

### Hazards

The Birthday Wreck sits in dangerous waters. The same crystal formations that sank the ship still guard the approach. The channel that Aldos Vermilion insisted on taking has claimed at least a dozen salvage vessels since, their crews' ambition exceeding their caution.

Beyond the crystals, the wreck itself is unstable. Decks have collapsed. Timbers are rotten. The current pulls debris in unpredictable directions. And the crystal outcroppings continue to grow—slowly encroaching on the wreck, as if the Shardmaw Isles are determined to digest their most famous victim entirely.
