## Free Isles

Tags: island

The Free Isles are an archepelago populated by Chargon, Nyolci, Eloweir, Swuigrach, Craven, Ayblek, Shapers, and Qord'ik. The cities within are massive trading ports, which have attracted people from all over the world.

The cities are extremely colorful, beautiful places, but are super deadly if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Huge colliseums have been built for gladiatorial fights. Best of all the gladiators is Red, the Screaming Blade.
