## Gyerekas

Tags: hills, geography

The southern boundary of the Dunes of Kunagi, where the sand sea breaks against a range of low, strange hills that aren't hills at all. Gyerekas is a fossilized reef—the remains of an ocean floor from an age when the desert was seafloor, now thrust up and exposed by geological forces older than human memory.

The Husakas call it the Bone Garden. They're not far wrong.

### The Ancient Reef

Millions of years ago, a shallow sea covered what is now the Dunes of Kunagi. Coral grew in vast formations, shellfish the size of wagons burrowed in the muck, and creatures that left no descendants swam in warm, clear waters. When the sea retreated and the land rose, it left behind a graveyard frozen in stone.

The "hills" of Gyerekas are fossilized coral heads, some rising fifty feet above the surrounding sand. Wind erosion has carved them into fantastic shapes—spires, arches, hollow domes, and whorled formations that look disturbingly organic. The rock is pale gray-white, veined with darker mineral deposits, and rings hollow when struck.

Between the coral formations, the ancient seabed lies exposed: compressed layers of shell, bone, and sediment hardened into stone. Giant ammonite spirals jut from the ground. The ribcages of creatures with no modern name arc like the frames of sunken ships. Teeth the size of swords lie scattered like dropped coins.

### Resources

The reef draws treasure seekers despite its dangers:

**Fossil Salt** — The ancient shells contain deposits of pure, crystallized salt from the vanished sea. This salt commands premium prices in desert trade—it's said to be more pure than any modern source, and some claim it has preservative properties beyond ordinary salt. The Husakas extract it carefully, knowing the formations that yield the best deposits.

**Memory Dust** — Certain fossils, when ground fine, produce a powder that desperate people believe can restore lost memories. It doesn't work—the Husakas have tested it extensively on their Twice-Born—but that doesn't stop outsiders from paying fortunes for it. The scorpion riders consider this trade distasteful but profitable. They never correct the buyers.

**Coral Stone** — The fossilized coral is surprisingly strong and takes a beautiful polish. Wealthy patrons in distant cities prize Gyerekas coral for decorative work. Extracting it is difficult and dangerous, but a single wagon-load can fund a caravan for years.

**Intact Specimens** — Scholars and collectors pay extraordinary sums for well-preserved fossils: complete ammonites, articulated skeletons, unusual formations. The reef has been picked over for generations, but new specimens still emerge as wind strips away covering sand.

### The Bone Gardens

The central region of Gyerekas, where the fossil beds are densest and most exposed. Here, the ancient seabed creates a landscape like nothing else in Alaria—a forest of stone ribs and spiral shells, bleached white by countless suns, stretching for miles.

Walking through the Bone Gardens is disorienting. The formations create natural mazes, block sightlines, and play tricks with sound. Echoes bounce unpredictably. Winds moan through hollow coral like breath through a skull. The scorpion riders use it for training: if you can navigate the Gardens, you can navigate anywhere.

At the Gardens' heart lies the **Leviathan's Rest**—the nearly complete skeleton of something enormous. The skull alone is thirty feet long, filled with teeth like curved swords. The spine stretches back two hundred feet before disappearing into a dune. No one knows what it was. The Husakas leave offerings at its base and do not camp within sight of it.

### The Coral Caves

The hollow coral formations create natural shelters throughout Gyerekas—cool in the day's heat, warm enough at night, protected from wind and sand. These caves have been used for generations:

**Clan Moots** — Several large coral formations contain chambers big enough for dozens of people. The Husakas clans use these as neutral meeting grounds, second only to the Gathering Stones in importance. The largest is the **Chamber of Echoes**, where words spoken at one end can be heard clearly at the other, a hundred feet away.

**Hermit Dens** — Smaller caves throughout the reef house those who've chosen solitude: outcasts, mystics, the grieving, and the mad. The Husakas respect their privacy but check on them periodically. Some hermits have lived in the reef for decades.

**The Deep Warrens** — Below the surface caves, a network of passages extends into darkness. These natural tunnels follow ancient water channels through the reef rock. Most are tight squeezes, but some open into larger chambers. What lies in the deepest warrens is unknown—exploration has been limited by the difficulty of navigation and the things that occasionally emerge from below. Pallid, eyeless creatures adapted to utter darkness. The Husakas seal known entrances when they can.

### Dangers

**Collapse** — The coral formations are ancient and weathered. Hollow chambers can give way without warning, dropping climbers into the rubble or sealing cave entrances. The reef shifts constantly, grain by grain, and structures that stood for millennia can fall in an instant.

**The Dwellers Below** — Something lives in the deepest warrens. The Husakas don't know what—glimpses only, pale shapes retreating from torchlight, scratching sounds from sealed tunnels. They've learned which passages to avoid, which cave entrances to block with stone. Whatever dwells below has never emerged in force, but those who venture too deep don't always return.

**Sand Traps** — The spaces between coral formations fill with fine sand that can behave like quicksand during temperature shifts. Experienced travelers know to test their footing, especially at dawn and dusk when the sand is most unstable.

**Getting Lost** — The reef extends for roughly forty miles east to west, and navigation is treacherous. The formations all look similar, landmarks shift as sand moves, and the maze-like structure defeats simple direction-finding. Without a guide, travelers can wander for days within a few miles of safety.

### Encountering Gyerekas

The reef serves as the primary meeting ground between the Husakas and outsiders. Caravans heading south toward the jungles, or north into the deep desert, often pause at Gyerekas to trade, hire guides, or simply rest in the coral caves' shade.

The scorpion riders maintain semi-permanent camps at several points along the reef's northern edge, where the sand gives way to fossil stone. These camps offer:
- Guides through the reef (expensive but essential)
- Trade in fossil salt, coral stone, and "memory dust"
- Information about conditions in Husakas proper
- Warnings about which caves and formations to avoid

The reef is considered neutral territory—clan feuds are suspended within Gyerekas, and violence against traders or travelers is punished severely. This makes it the safest place in the region to encounter the scorpion riders, if safety is a relative term.
