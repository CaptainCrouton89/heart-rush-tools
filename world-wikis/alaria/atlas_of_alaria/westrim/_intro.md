# Westrim

## Geography

Westrim occupies the northwestern quadrant of Rimihuica, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert and ringed by mountains and deadly jungles. This is a land of extremes—scorching desert sands, impenetrable jungle, and the mountain fortresses of dwarven city-states.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eronia Range forms the northern boundary, separating Westrim from the Tarkhon Empire. This mountain range includes several smaller ranges home to dwarven city-states.
- **East**: Transitions into the Innerrim jungle basin
- **South**: The Ishnit Jungles wrap around the southern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi
- **Southwest**: The Agreben Sea and the Greenwater Isles
- **West**: The Western Isles lie offshore; the state of Mueras occupies the western coastal region

### Major Features

#### Dunes of Kunagi

The dominant feature of Westrim—a vast, kidney-shaped desert of golden sand stretching across the interior. Home to giant sand wurms reminiscent of *Dune*. The only reliable water source for hundreds of miles is Benshu's Promise, an oasis guarded by a deadly sphinx who demands riddles be answered before any may drink.

#### Ishnit Jungles

Covering the entire southern side of the Dunes of Kunagi, the Ishnit Jungles are among the most dangerous wilderness areas in Alaria. Home to the Naruaghin people and countless deadly monsters. Notable locations include:
- **Ekomorn**: A rift extending to the center of the material plane, feared by all
- **Demonwatch**: A darkstone palace on the southern cape, overrun by confined but immortal demons

#### Eronia Range

The northern mountain barrier, home to multiple dwarven city-states nestled among the peaks. These mountains catch moisture from the north, contributing to the rain shadow that creates the Dunes of Kunagi.

### Surrounding Seas

- **Agreben Sea**: Southwest of Westrim, south of Mueras, west of the Ishnit Jungles
- **Gulf of Norag**: South of the Ishnit Jungles

## Notable Locations

### Dunes of Kunagi

#### Husakas

A desert region in the southwest Dunes of Kunagi, roamed by scorpion riders who have adapted to the harsh conditions. Husakas contains one of the few sources of water in this part of the dunes—a network of seasonal streams and creeks that flow during rare rains.

However, the water carries a terrible curse: drinking from these streams causes complete loss of long-term memory. Victims forget their past, their identity, everything except the immediate present. The water's power is bound to the region—if transported away from Husakas, it becomes ordinary water. This creates a grim trap: travelers dying of thirst must choose between death and losing themselves entirely.

The scorpion riders who patrol Husakas have developed techniques to survive on minimal water, avoiding the cursed streams except in the direst emergencies.

### Mueras

The western coastal state of Westrim, positioned between the Taflex Forest and Grimreach in the southwest, overlooking the Agreben Sea.

#### Darkened Coast

East of the Taflex Forest and south of Grimreach, along the northwest coast of the Agreben Sea, lies the Darkened Coast—a stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow. The waters teem with dark-attuned sea creatures: shadow rays that glide beneath the waves, void eels that drain light from their surroundings, and worse things that rise from the lightless depths during moonless nights.

Sailors avoid this coast when possible, as ships that venture too close risk being pulled under by creatures that exist more in shadow than flesh.
