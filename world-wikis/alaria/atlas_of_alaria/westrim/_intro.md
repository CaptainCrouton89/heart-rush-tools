# Westrim

## Geography

Westrim occupies the northwestern quadrant of Rimihuica, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert and ringed by mountains and deadly jungles. This is a land of extremes—scorching desert sands, impenetrable jungle, and the mountain fortresses of dwarven city-states.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eronia Range forms the northern boundary, separating Westrim from the Tarkhon Empire. This mountain range includes several smaller ranges home to dwarven city-states.
- **East**: Transitions into the Innerrim jungle basin
- **South**: The Ishnit Jungles wrap around the southern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi
- **Southwest**: The Agreben Sea and the Greenwater Isles
- **West**: The Western Isles lie offshore; the state of Mueras occupies the western coastal region

### Major Features

#### Dunes of Kunagi

The dominant feature of Westrim—a vast, kidney-shaped desert of golden sand stretching across the interior. Home to giant sand wurms reminiscent of *Dune*. The only reliable water source for hundreds of miles is Benshu's Promise, an oasis guarded by a deadly sphinx who demands riddles be answered before any may drink.

#### Ishnit Jungles

Covering the entire southern side of the Dunes of Kunagi, the Ishnit Jungles are among the most dangerous wilderness areas in Alaria. Home to the Naruaghin people and countless deadly monsters. Notable locations include:
- **Ekomorn**: A rift extending to the center of the material plane, feared by all
- **Demonwatch**: A darkstone palace on the southern cape, overrun by confined but immortal demons

#### Eronia Range

The northern mountain barrier, home to multiple dwarven city-states nestled among the peaks. These mountains catch moisture from the north, contributing to the rain shadow that creates the Dunes of Kunagi.

### Surrounding Seas

- **Agreben Sea**: Southwest of Westrim, south of Mueras, west of the Ishnit Jungles
- **Gulf of Norag**: South of the Ishnit Jungles

### Dunes of Kunagi

#### Husakas

A desert region in the southwest Dunes of Kunagi, roamed by scorpion riders who have adapted to the harsh conditions. Husakas contains one of the few sources of water in this part of the dunes—a network of seasonal streams and creeks that flow during rare rains.

However, the water carries a terrible curse: drinking from these streams causes complete loss of long-term memory. Victims forget their past, their identity, everything except the immediate present. The water's power is bound to the region—if transported away from Husakas, it becomes ordinary water. This creates a grim trap: travelers dying of thirst must choose between death and losing themselves entirely.

The scorpion riders who patrol Husakas have developed techniques to survive on minimal water, avoiding the cursed streams except in the direst emergencies.

### Mueras

The westernmost state of Rimihuica, Mueras occupies a stretch of brutally fragmented coastline where the land has shattered against the sea. Cliff-walled islands, treacherous channels, and hidden harbors define this region—geography that created the merchant-king oligarchy. Those who know the waters control the trade; those who control the trade rule Mueras.

The coast runs roughly 400 miles north to south, from the Mueras Highlands and Hammer Coast in the north to the Beak of Mueras peninsula in the south. Inland, the arid Dustwind Plateau separates the wealthy coastal cities from the darker eastern reaches—the Taflex Forest, Grimreach, and the shadow-haunted Darkened Coast.

Key features include:
- **Labyrinth Sound**: A maze of treacherous channels controlled by pilot guilds loyal to the merchant-kings
- **Corpse Bay**: Waters where the dead wash ashore with disturbing regularity
- **Kaspion**: The old capital, death-cursed when King Kasper fell 118 years ago, now a ghost-haunted ruin
- **Bazz**: The de facto capital, seat of the Council of Seven merchant-king houses
- **The Darkened Coast**: A stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow, home to dark-attuned sea creatures
- **Sal'emri Bay**: Tarkhon trading enclaves maintaining careful neutrality in merchant-king politics

### Atriik

A confederation of four city-states in southwestern Westrim, occupying the territory between the Milras Forest (north), the Dunes of Kunagi (east), the Bloodlands and Ishnit Jungles (south), and Shark Bay (west). The Kor and Sharabha peoples here share a culture of elaborate courtesy that masks constant political maneuvering.

Key features include:
- **The City-States**: Lupuno, Byonowidi, Shinii, and Wykakas—three Kor monarchies and one Sharabha
- **Mykala**: A ruined fortress at the base of a colossal tree (30-mile canopy), sacred to all four city-states
- **Milras Forest**: Dense old-growth woodland containing the time-warped ruins of Milreun Palace
- **Fatiik Forest**: Contested woodland on the Naruaghin border
- **Sprenwood**: Managed coastal forest providing timber and furs
- **Shark Bay**: Maritime access controlled by the Kendor sea-folk of Watalina
- **The Bloodlands**: Scarred buffer zone between Atriik and Naruaghin territory
- **Kunagi Hills**: Eastern transitional zone, gateway to the desert trade
