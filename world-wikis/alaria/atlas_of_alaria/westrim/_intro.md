# Westrim

## Geography

Westrim occupies the northwestern quadrant of Rimihuica, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert and ringed by mountains and deadly jungles. This is a land of extremes—scorching desert sands, impenetrable jungle, and the mountain fortresses of dwarven city-states.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eronia Range forms the northern boundary, separating Westrim from the Tarkhon Empire. This mountain range includes several smaller ranges home to dwarven city-states.
- **East**: Transitions into the Innerrim jungle basin
- **South**: The Ishnit Jungles wrap around the southern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi
- **Southwest**: The Agreben Sea and the Greenwater Isles
- **West**: The Western Isles lie offshore; the state of Mueras occupies the western coastal region

### Major Features

#### Dunes of Kunagi

The dominant feature of Westrim—a vast, kidney-shaped desert of golden sand stretching across the interior. Home to giant sand wurms reminiscent of *Dune*. The only reliable water source for hundreds of miles is Benshu's Promise, an oasis guarded by a deadly sphinx who demands riddles be answered before any may drink.

#### Ishnit Jungles

Covering the entire southern side of the Dunes of Kunagi, the Ishnit Jungles are among the most dangerous wilderness areas in Alaria. Home to the Naruaghin people and countless deadly monsters. Notable locations include:
- **Ekomorn**: A rift extending to the center of the material plane, feared by all
- **Demonwatch**: A darkstone palace on the southern cape, overrun by confined but immortal demons

#### Eronia Range

The northern mountain barrier, home to multiple dwarven city-states nestled among the peaks. These mountains catch moisture from the north, contributing to the rain shadow that creates the Dunes of Kunagi.

### Surrounding Seas

- **Agreben Sea**: Southwest of Westrim, south of Mueras, west of the Ishnit Jungles
- **Gulf of Norag**: South of the Ishnit Jungles
