Tags: state, nation

A state in Westrim, located on the western side of the Dunes of Kunagi. Kura lies south of the Righteous Peaks (the mountains on the southern border of Astrelle, part of Tarkhon). To its south is Atriik, and to its east are the Wyrm Teeth hills.

### Tul Azreitnok

In the southern hills and dunes region of Kura stands Tul Azreitnok—a fortress and specialized academy dedicated to the study of midnight fire, a rare and dangerous form of dark flame magic. The academy trains mages in the manipulation of fire that burns with darkness rather than light, flames that consume without illuminating.
