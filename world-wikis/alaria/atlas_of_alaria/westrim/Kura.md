## Kura

Tags: state, nation

A state in Westrim, occupying the western margins of the Dunes of Kunagi and the southeastern foothills of the mountains that separate Westrim from Tarkhon. Kura lies south of the Righteous Peaks, north of Atriik, and west of the Wyrm Teeth hills. The Ley Line of Fire bisects the nation from north to south, and the entire character of Kura—its government, its magic, its survival—is shaped by this elemental presence.

### The Ley Line of Fire

The great Ley Line of Fire runs north-south through the heart of Kura, a river of elemental power visible only to those with magical sight. Along this line, fire burns hotter and faster, fire magic comes more easily, and the desert sun beats down with merciless intensity.

The ley line explains much about Kura. The dual monarchy exists in part because controlling territory that straddles the line requires both fire attunement (to thrive near it) and water attunement (to survive away from it). The midnight fire academy at Tul Azreitnok was built where it is specifically to study the ley line's effects. And the glass trade that sustains Kura's economy relies on the intense, reliable heat the ley line provides.

Crossing the ley line unprotected during the day can cause severe burns. At night, when fire's power wanes, the crossing is safer—but the desert cold that replaces the heat can be equally deadly.

### Bani Bari

The capital of Kura sits at the heart of the nation, carefully positioned to straddle the Ley Line of Fire. The city is divided into two halves—the Sunward District to the east of the ley line, where fire-attuned Yngli predominate, and the Shadeward District to the west, home to most of the water-attuned Nuun.

The Twin Throne sits at the exact center, a palace of fused glass and sandstone built directly over the ley line. Here the blue-eyed Nuun king and the golden-born Yngli ruler hold court together, their combined attunements moderating the intense magical energies beneath them. The palace architecture channels ley line heat into the city's famous glass foundries while the water crown ensures drinking water flows in the central fountain.

**Population**: ~45,000

The city is famous for its glass—windows, vessels, lenses, and art pieces of extraordinary clarity and color. The foundries run day and night, drawing on the ley line's power. Glass caravans depart weekly for the coastal ports and the dwarven cities to the northwest.

### Shalif Mulak

A village of perhaps two thousand souls, located half a day's travel from Bani Bari on the western side of the ley line. Shalif Mulak serves as the agricultural heart of central Kura—its underground aquifers, maintained by Nuun water-shapers, support date palms, hardy grains, and goat herds that would otherwise be impossible in the deep desert.

The village is known for its hospitality to travelers. Anyone heading into the deep dunes stops here for supplies and the last reliable water before Benshu's Promise.

### Labakh

The northernmost city in Kura, Labakh sits in the foothills where the dunes give way to the mountains of the Eronia Range. The city serves as Kura's primary trading partner with the dwarven city-states of the First Brotherhood—Üod, Blvnird, and Melaia.

**Population**: ~12,000

Labakh is cooler than the rest of Kura, benefiting from mountain breezes and altitude. The city's markets trade Kuran glass and information for dwarven metalwork, tools, and the preserved foods that travel well across the desert. The architecture here shows dwarven influence—stone foundations, deeper cellars, and structures built to last centuries rather than generations.

A significant dwarven minority lives in Labakh, merchants and craftspeople who find the climate tolerable and the trade profitable. They maintain their own quarter with proper stone buildings and a small shrine to the First Brotherhood.

### Shad Usk

The largest and most treacherous dune formation in central Kura, Shad Usk rises nearly three hundred feet at its peak and stretches for miles in a crescent shape. The dune moves—slowly, but perceptibly over years—and has swallowed more than one unwary settlement that built too close to its base.

Shad Usk is considered sacred by some Kurans, who believe the dune is alive in some sense, or that something sleeps beneath it. The sand wurms that plague the Dunes of Kunagi avoid Shad Usk entirely, which some take as confirmation of this belief.

Local guides know the safe paths around Shad Usk, but crossing over it is considered both dangerous (the sand is unstable) and disrespectful.

### Fata M'darah

A trading post and waystation on the eastern edge of Kura, where the dunes begin to give way to the rocky terrain approaching the Wyrm Teeth. Fata M'darah marks the traditional boundary between Kura's settled territory and the wilder lands beyond.

The waystation is built around a natural rock formation that provides shade and shelter. A small permanent population maintains the wells and guesthouses, but most of those present at any time are travelers—merchants heading east toward the Mirrored Palace, scholars bound for the Wyrm Teeth ruins, or the occasional fool seeking fortune in the deep desert.

The name means "the daughter's rest" in old Kuran, though who the daughter was and why she rested here is lost to time.

### Tul Azreitnok

In the southern hills and dunes region of Kura stands Tul Azreitnok—a fortress and specialized academy dedicated to the study of midnight fire, a rare and dangerous form of dark flame magic. The academy trains mages in the manipulation of fire that burns with darkness rather than light, flames that consume without illuminating.

The academy was built where it is for two reasons: proximity to the Ley Line of Fire, which provides raw elemental power for experimentation, and distance from Bani Bari, because midnight fire experiments have a tendency to go catastrophically wrong.

Tul Azreitnok accepts students from across Alaria, though most come from fire-touched peoples—Neferati, Yngli, and the occasional dwarven runesmith. The curriculum is dangerous; roughly one in five students dies or is permanently maimed during their training. Graduates are among the most feared battle-mages in the world.
