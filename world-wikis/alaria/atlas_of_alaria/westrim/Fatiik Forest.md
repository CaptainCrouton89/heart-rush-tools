## Fatiik Forest

Tags: forest, geography

A transitional forest in central-southern Atriik, straddling the border between settled Kor lands and the contested Bloodlands to the south. The Sha Kariki flows through its center.

### Character

Fatiik is neither as ancient as Milras nor as managed as Sprenwood—it exists in a state of perpetual wildness because no one can hold it long enough to tame it. The forest is prime territory for Naruaghin raiding parties moving north, and Atriik hunting parties moving south, and the two groups meet with depressing regularity.

The trees are drought-adapted species suited to the drier climate near the Kunagi: thorny acacias, fever trees, and the distinctive baobab-like giants that store water in their swollen trunks. The canopy is open enough for mounted passage, which makes it excellent cavalry country—and terrible infantry ground when the enemy knows the terrain better than you do.

### Contested Territory

Fatiik is officially part of Atriik, claimed by both Wykakas and Byonowidi depending on which royal house you ask. In practice, control extends only as far as patrols can enforce it. The forest's southern half is effectively a no-man's-land where:

- Kor hunting parties take game and furs, always in armed groups
- Sharabha cavalry from Byonowidi conduct sweeps for Naruaghin scouts
- Naruaghin war parties probe north, testing the defenses
- Outlaws and deserters from all sides hide in the deeper groves

### The Sha Kariki

The central river provides the only reliable water in the forest during the dry season. Control of the Sha Kariki's crossing points is hotly contested—whoever holds the fords can project force across the forest. Several small fortified camps dot the riverbank, manned by Atriik militia during the raiding season and abandoned when the rains come.

### Notable Features

**The Raiding Trail**: An informal but well-worn path running north-south through the forest, used by Naruaghin parties approaching Atriik. Atriik forces patrol it; Naruaghin scouts know how to avoid them.

**Fever Tree Grove**: A distinctive stand of yellow-barked fever trees near the forest's heart, visible from miles away when the sun hits them right. The grove is considered neutral ground by some local traditions—a place where enemies might negotiate rather than fight.

**The Kariki Fords**: Three reliable crossing points on the Sha Kariki, each with a fortified camp nearby. During dry season, these are the most strategically valuable real estate in Atriik.
