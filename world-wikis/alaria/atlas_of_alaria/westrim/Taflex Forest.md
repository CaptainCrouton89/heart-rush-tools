## Taflex Forest

Tags: forest, geography

The great forest of eastern Mueras, stretching from the windswept edge of the Dustwind Plateau down to the fog-shrouded approaches of Grimreach. The Taflex is the shipyard of Mueras—its timber builds the fleets that make the merchant-kings wealthy. But the forest is older than the merchant-kings, older than Kasper, older than human memory, and the deeper reaches answer to no Mueran authority.

The forest divides roughly into three zones. The western edge, where plateau meets treeline, hosts the logging operations—camps, sawmills, and the town of Eddiwood where raw timber becomes ship-worthy lumber. The middle belt belongs to hunters, trappers, and the small settlements that serve them. The deep interior is Yngli territory, where the silent folk maintain communities invisible to those who don't know what to look for.

### The Logging Edge

House Vethros of Kelwin controls most logging rights in the Taflex, a monopoly nearly as valuable as their navigation privileges. The timber that builds Mueran ships must come from somewhere, and the Taflex provides. Logging camps dot the western forest edge, connected by rough tracks to Eddiwood and ultimately to the coast.

The work is hard and the camps are rough. Loggers come from the Mueras Highlands—poor folk willing to trade backbreaking labor for reliable pay. House Vethros treats them fairly by Mueran standards, which means they're fed, housed, and only occasionally cheated on their wages.

The camps push deeper into the forest each decade, following the valuable timber. This brings them closer to Yngli territory, and House Vethros has learned to be careful. Loggers who cut trees marked with Yngli symbols—three parallel scratches at eye height—tend to have accidents. Tools break, ropes fray, trees fall wrong. The Yngli can't speak, but they communicate clearly enough.

### Eddiwood

The largest settlement in the forest, where the Taflex meets the plateau. Eddiwood exists to process timber: logs arrive from the camps, are milled into lumber, and shipped out toward the coast. The town is practical, utilitarian, and entirely uninterested in merchant-king politics. They sell to whoever pays, maintain no house allegiances, and keep their own counsel.

Population hovers around 2,500, swelling during cutting season and shrinking in winter. The town has a rough democracy—decisions are made by whoever shows up to the town meeting, and enforcement is handled by whoever volunteers. This works better than it should, largely because everyone in Eddiwood depends on the same industry and has identical interests.

### The Hunting Belt

Beyond the logging edge, the middle forest supports a different economy. Hunters and trappers work these woods, taking furs, hides, and forest products. The game here is plentiful—deer, boar, various fowl—but the real prizes are the rarer creatures. Shadow-touched animals drift up from Grimreach; their pelts and organs command premium prices. Stranger things live deeper still, and hunters who venture too far sometimes don't return.

#### Hickton

A hunting town in the middle belt, smaller than Eddiwood but more established. Hickton has been here for generations, and its families know the forest intimately. The town maintains better relations with the Yngli than most Mueran settlements—partly necessity, partly genuine respect developed over decades of coexistence.

The Hickton hunters don't push into Yngli territory, and the Yngli occasionally trade with them: forest products, rare herbs, fungi with alchemical properties. The exchange is conducted in silence, through an elaborate system of gestures both communities have developed. Outsiders find it eerie; locals find it natural.

#### Sherly & Lieler

Barely more than camps, these small settlements serve as waypoints for those pushing deeper—toward Yngli communities, toward Grimreach, toward whatever lies beyond. Sherly caters to traders; Lieler to those whose business is better not discussed. Neither asks questions; neither expects answers.

### The Deep Taflex

No human settlements exist in the forest's interior. This is Yngli territory.

The Yngli of the Taflex are descendants of those who fled exploitation in the coastal cities—generations of the silent folk who preferred forest hardship to urban servitude. They've built communities here, invisible to casual observation: settlements in the canopy, warrens beneath root systems, camps that leave no trace when abandoned.

The deep Taflex Yngli maintain their own governance. Without speech, they've developed other forms of coordination—sign language, written communication, and something that might be telepathy among their elders. They trade with the outside world when necessary, but they don't depend on it. The forest provides.

House Vethros officially claims the entire Taflex, but they've learned not to push the claim. Logging operations that venture too deep suffer mishaps. Surveyors who mark Yngli trees for cutting disappear. The Yngli can't declare war, but they wage it effectively nonetheless.

### Forest Hazards

The Taflex is not safe. Beyond the normal dangers of wilderness—weather, terrain, wildlife—the forest holds stranger threats.

**Shadow Drift**: Creatures from the Darkened Coast occasionally wander up through Grimreach into the forest. These shadow-touched animals are dangerous and unpredictable, and their presence taints the local environment. Hunters prize them; wise hunters avoid them.

**The Old Growth**: In the deepest parts of the forest, trees grow to impossible size—trunks wider than houses, canopy blocking all sunlight. The Yngli revere these groves but don't explain why. Loggers who've seen them describe a sense of being watched, evaluated, and found wanting.

**Lost Camps**: Abandoned logging camps and hunting lodges dot the forest, some decades old, some centuries. Most are simply defunct; a few are haunted by whatever killed their inhabitants. The forest has a long memory.

### The Timber Trade

Wood from the Taflex builds Mueran ships—a fact that gives the forest strategic importance far beyond its apparent value. House Vethros controls most of the supply, but other houses maintain small operations, and smuggling raw timber around Vethros oversight is a constant low-level conflict.

The best ship timber comes from trees two hundred years old or more. The Taflex has such trees in abundance—but the best stands are deeper, closer to Yngli territory. As the accessible timber is exhausted, House Vethros faces a choice: push deeper and risk Yngli retaliation, or watch their monopoly erode as timber quality declines.

So far, they've chosen caution. But the calculation changes with each passing year.
