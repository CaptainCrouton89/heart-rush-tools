## East Naruaghin Tribes

Tags: state, nation

The East Naruaghin occupy the borderlands between the Ishnit Jungles and the Green Wilds of Enapay. Once the most prosperous of the three tribal confederations, they are now locked in an existential war with the Dwelyn—a conflict they were losing badly until Surrey Mahaila fell ill.

### Territory

The eastern tribes claim the jungle fringe where dense Ishnit growth gives way to the more open Green Wilds. This transitional zone offers the best hunting in all Naruaghin territory—game is plentiful, rivers are navigable, and the soil supports cultivation. It's also why the Dwelyn want it.

### Culture

The East Naruaghin have adapted more than their kin. Contact with Enapay—first through trade, then through war—has forced them to organize. Where other Naruaghin tribes fight in loose warbands, the East have developed something approaching military discipline.

**War Councils**: The eastern tribes coordinate through councils of war-leaders who meet regularly to plan strategy. This is unprecedented among Naruaghin, who traditionally settle disputes through individual combat.

**Fortified Settlements**: Eastern villages feature defensive earthworks, sharpened-stake perimeters, and elevated watchtowers. They've learned that the Dwelyn don't fight like Naruaghin—they fight like an army.

**Trophy Beads**: The East Naruaghin have adopted a version of the Dwelyn bead tradition, wearing strings of Dwelyn teeth and bone fragments to mark their kills. It began as mockery but has become genuine cultural practice.

### The Dwelyn War

The conflict began three generations ago when Dwelyn expansion pushed into traditional East Naruaghin hunting grounds. Initial skirmishes escalated into sustained warfare. For decades, the Dwelyn dominated—their queen's dragon, Surrey Mahaila, could devastate entire war-parties with a single pass.

Then Surrey Mahaila fell ill.

The dragon's sickness has transformed the war. Dwelyn raids have become cautious. Their queen no longer rides to battle. The East Naruaghin have pressed their advantage, reclaiming territory and launching counter-raids into the Green Wilds themselves.

But the tribes know this reprieve may be temporary. If the Dwelyn cure their dragon, the war returns to its former balance. If they don't, the East Naruaghin might finally drive their enemies from the jungle entirely—or the Dwelyn might grow desperate enough to attempt something drastic.

### Dragon Relations

The East Naruaghin occupy a narrow corridor between the territories of Pythalomos and Senwyn. Neither dragon hunts here regularly—they prefer the deeper jungle where prey can't escape. This relative safety from dragon predation is one reason the eastern tribes have grown strong enough to resist the Dwelyn.

The tribes maintain a wary respect for Surrey Mahaila, despite the war. The emerald dragon is ancient, and Naruaghin oral tradition speaks of her presence long before the Dwelyn arrived. Some shamans whisper that the dragon's sickness is a punishment—though for what, they cannot agree.

### Relations with Other Tribes

The other Naruaghin view the East with complicated feelings. The South raid them for resources and warriors; the North consider them corrupted by foreign contact. Yet when major threats emerge—dragon attacks, demon incursions—the East can call on tribal solidarity. Blood is blood.

The East Naruaghin increasingly see themselves as the Naruaghin future: organized, disciplined, capable of facing external threats. They pity their cousins, trapped fighting dragons and demons while the East builds something that might last.

### Notable Locations

**Ishtar Ford**: The main crossing point on the Ishtar River, and the de facto border between Naruaghin and Dwelyn territory. Both sides maintain camps here during truces; both sides have burned the other's camps during offensives.

**The Raid Camps**: Semi-permanent military encampments where eastern warriors gather before strikes into Dwelyn territory. Locations shift regularly to avoid retaliation.

**Bone Hill**: A prominent hill where the East Naruaghin display the skulls of slain Dwelyn warriors. It serves as both trophy display and territorial marker. The Dwelyn have burned it twice; the Naruaghin have rebuilt it three times.
