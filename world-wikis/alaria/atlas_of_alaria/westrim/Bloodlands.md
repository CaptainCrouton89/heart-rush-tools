## Bloodlands

Tags: region, geography

The scarred buffer zone between Atriik's southern reaches and the Ishnit Jungles, where generations of warfare between the Kor/Sharabha city-states and the Naruaghin tribes have stained the earth red—sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally.

### Character

The Bloodlands are not a single terrain type but a transition zone: the thinning southern edge of Fatiik Forest gives way to thornscrub, then to burned grassland, then to the jungle's northern fringe. The soil here is iron-rich and red-brown, which gives the region its name—though the blood that has been spilled across these lands over centuries hasn't hurt the reputation.

This is raiding country. Neither side holds it permanently. The Naruaghin push north when they sense weakness; Atriik forces push south when they need to make a point. The result is a landscape of abandoned fortifications, burned villages, and mass graves that the rain uncovers every wet season.

### Warfare Pattern

The conflict here isn't a war in any formal sense—there are no declarations, no treaties, no clear objectives beyond "raid what you can, hold what you must." The pattern repeats:

1. **Dry Season**: Naruaghin war parties move north through the Bloodlands, probing Atriik's defenses. Small raids for slaves, food, and prestige.

2. **Early Rains**: Raiding intensifies as both sides try to secure resources before the rivers flood. Major clashes are more common.

3. **Wet Season**: The Sha Sonisst floods, the jungle paths become impassable, and both sides retreat to defensible positions. Relative peace.

4. **Late Dry**: The cycle begins again.

### Notable Features

**The Bone Field**: A stretch of open ground where a particularly bloody battle occurred generations ago. The dead were never buried properly, and bones still surface after heavy rains. Both sides avoid camping here.

**Fort Wykakas-South**: The southernmost permanent Atriik fortification, a stone-and-timber structure overlooking a Sha Sonisst ford. Manned year-round by Wykakas militia, it marks the effective limit of Atriik control.

**The Burned Villages**: At least a dozen abandoned settlements dot the Bloodlands—places where Atriik settlers tried to push south or Naruaghin groups tried to establish permanent camps. All burned, all empty.

**The Jungle's Edge**: Where the Bloodlands meet the Ishnit proper, the transition is abrupt. One step you're in thornscrub; the next, the jungle canopy closes overhead. Naruaghin war parties emerge from this edge without warning and vanish back into it when pursued.

### Strategic Significance

The Bloodlands exist because neither side can conquer them. Atriik lacks the numbers and the unity to push into the Ishnit Jungles proper. The Naruaghin lack the organization and logistics to hold territory north of the jungle edge. The result is a permanent wound in the landscape—and a constant drain on Atriik's southern city-states.

Wykakas bears the brunt of this, which explains why that city-state is the most militarized and least courtly of the four. You don't develop elaborate greeting rituals when you're checking the southern perimeter for war parties.
