## Wyrm Teeth

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills in Westrim, east of Kura and north of the Milras Forest. The Wyrm Teeth earned their name from their jagged, tooth-like peaks and their historical connection to the wyrms that once roamed these lands.

### Urk Noulgas

On the southwest point of the Wyrm Teeth stands Urk Noulgas—a ruined fortress that was once home to the Keeper of the Wyrms. In ancient times, wyrms were controlled by powerful mages in the Dunes of Kunagi, and Urk Noulgas served as a command post for these wyrm-keepers. The fortress now lies in ruins, abandoned after the fall of the wyrm-keeping tradition, though some say the echoes of old power still linger in the stones.
