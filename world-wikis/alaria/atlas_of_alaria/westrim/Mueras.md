## Mueras

Tags: state, nation, coastal

The westernmost state of Rimihuica, Mueras occupies a stretch of brutally fragmented coastline where the land seems to have shattered against the sea. Cliff-walled islands, treacherous channels, and hidden harbors define this region—geography that created the merchant-king oligarchy as surely as any political theory. Those who know the waters control the trade. Those who control the trade rule Mueras.

The coast runs roughly 400 miles north to south, from the Mueras Highlands and Hammer Coast in the north to the Beak of Mueras peninsula in the south. Inland, the arid Dustwind Plateau separates the wealthy coastal cities from the darker eastern reaches—the Taflex Forest, Grimreach, and the shadow-haunted Darkened Coast. The Agreben Sea lies to the south and west; North Agreben island marks the southern extent of Mueran influence.

What outsiders remember about Mueras: the cities carved into living cliff-face, the notorious difficulty of navigation, the wealth that flows through despite everything, and the persistent wrongness that clings to certain stretches of coast. King Kasper's death-curse, when the old tyrant fell, didn't merely haunt Kaspion—it cracked something in the region's relationship with death itself.

### Labyrinth Sound

The defining feature of western Mueras: a maze of channels threading between cliff-walled islands, sea stacks, and submerged rock formations. Approximately sixty miles of coastline compressed into perhaps two hundred miles of navigable (barely) waterway. Strong tidal currents reverse twice daily, fog rolls in without warning, and the acoustic properties of the cliff walls make it impossible to judge distance by sound.

No captain unfamiliar with these waters attempts Labyrinth Sound without a licensed pilot. The pilot guilds are controlled by the merchant-kings—each house maintains pilots for their section of the Sound, and passage fees fund the oligarchy. Killing a rival's pilots is often more effective than killing the rival himself.

The major passages, from north to south:
- **Hammer Passage**: Northern entry, controlled by House Hammren from the twin fortress-ports
- **Kelwin Throat**: Central narrows, notoriously difficult, controlled from Kelwin
- **Hennipin Gate**: Southern passage into Corpse Bay, controlled from Hennipin

#### Cliff Beach

A rare stretch of accessible shoreline along the western edge of Labyrinth Sound—one of the few places small boats can land without a harbor. Used by smugglers, fishermen too poor for harbor fees, and occasionally by those fleeing merchant-king justice. The cliffs above are honeycombed with caves, some natural, some carved. Local legend claims the caves connect to older passages beneath the Mueras Highlands.

### Corpse Bay

South of Labyrinth Sound, Corpse Bay earned its name honestly. The currents of the region converge here, depositing whatever the sea claims—shipwreck debris, drowned sailors, and things less identifiable. Bodies wash up on the black sand beaches with disturbing regularity. Locals won't fish the bay proper, though the surrounding waters remain productive.

The bay's morbid nature predates King Kasper's curse, but has intensified since. Some scholars theorize the curse found purchase here because death already had a foothold. Others note that Kasper chose to build his capital overlooking these waters, and wonder if the causality runs the other direction.

The major ports of Corpse Bay maintain crematoriums that burn constantly, disposing of whatever washes ashore before it can rise again. This is presented as civic duty and public health. The actual frequency of the rising dead is not discussed in polite company.

### Walker Depths

The deep waters west of Labyrinth Sound, between Mueras and the Starfish Isles. Named for the "walkers"—drowned dead that sometimes walk the seabed rather than floating. On clear days, sailors in shallow-drafted vessels occasionally glimpse them through the water: humanoid figures trudging slowly across the sandy bottom, going somewhere.

No one knows where they're going. No one wants to find out. Ships avoid anchoring in Walker Depths; the walkers have been known to climb anchor chains.

### The Hammer Coast

The northern shore of Mueras, running from Cursius in the northwest to the Tarns in the northeast. Named for the twin fortress-ports of North Hammer Point and South Hammer Point, which control the sea approaches from the north. This is the most defensible and least cursed section of Mueras—the Hammer family has maintained it for six generations.

#### North Hammer Point & South Hammer Point

Twin fortresses on opposing headlands, their ballistae and fire-catapults creating a kill zone across the northern sea approach. House Hammren controls both, making them the only merchant-king family with a true chokepoint monopoly rather than mere pilot-guild control. The Hammrens are the closest thing Mueras has to old nobility—they predate the merchant-king system, having held these fortresses since before Kasper's rise.

The fortresses themselves are carved into the cliffsides in the characteristic Mueran style, with harbor facilities at water level and living quarters ascending through the rock. Each fortress maintains a permanent garrison of two hundred, plus the pilot-guild personnel who guide ships through the northern approaches.

#### Fulon

A fishing town of perhaps three thousand souls, nestled in a protected cove between the Hammer Points. Exists primarily to supply the fortresses with fresh food and to house the families of garrison soldiers. Notable for its complete lack of merchant-king politics—House Hammren rules here with something approaching benevolence, and the townsfolk are loyal in return.

#### Cursius

The northwestern corner of Mueras, where the coast turns south toward Labyrinth Sound. A small port town, less important than it once was. Cursius was a significant trading post before Kasper centralized power at Kaspion; now it serves mainly as a waypoint for ships avoiding the Sound entirely by sailing around the north.

### The Tarns

A region of highland lakes and pools in northeastern Mueras, fed by rainfall from the Mueras Highlands and streams descending from the Dustwind Plateau. The tarns provide the primary freshwater source for the northern settlements—a fact that has made them contested territory throughout Mueran history.

Currently, the tarns fall under the loose protection of House Hammren, though several smaller merchant families maintain estates here. The freshwater fisheries and the waterfowl hunting draw wealthy Muerans seeking respite from the salt air and political intrigue of the coast.

### Mueras Highlands

The elevated northwestern interior, separating the Hammer Coast from the approaches to Labyrinth Sound. Rocky, wind-scoured hills with thin soil and sparse vegetation. Yngli herding communities maintain small flocks of the hardy goats that can survive here, and a few mining operations extract iron and copper from shallow deposits.

The Highlands are sometimes called "the commons"—the one part of Mueras no merchant-king has bothered to claim. The herders and miners who live here owe allegiance to no house, pay no harbor fees, and are correspondingly poor. When the merchant-kings need expendable soldiers or raiders to harass rivals' overland caravans, they recruit from the Highlands.

### Dustwind Plateau

The arid interior of Mueras, a high tableland swept by constant winds that carry fine dust from the plateau's surface. The plateau separates the wealthy coast from the eastern reaches, serving as a buffer zone where few settlements survive. Caravans cross it to avoid the sea route around the Beak, but the journey is harsh—water sources are scarce, and the dust storms can strip flesh from bone.

The plateau's name comes from the wind, which rarely ceases. Locals claim the dust carries whispers from the dead of Kaspion, though scholars attribute the sounds to wind through rock formations. The two explanations are not mutually exclusive.

### The Haunted Zone

The stretch of coast from Kaspion south to Port Perith, where King Kasper's death-curse fell heaviest. This region is not abandoned—commerce demands too much—but it is approached with caution, and no one lingers longer than necessary.

#### Kaspion

The old capital of Mueras, built on a dramatic headland overlooking Corpse Bay. King Kasper ruled from here for thirty-two years, centralizing power, eliminating rival merchant families, and executing anyone he deemed treasonous at Cliffdrop. His tyranny ended when a coalition of surviving merchant houses funded a rebellion—but Kasper had prepared for this possibility.

When the rebels breached his palace, Kasper triggered a death-curse of extraordinary power. Every living person in Kaspion—rebel, loyalist, servant, child—died in an instant. Estimates suggest twelve thousand souls. The curse bound them to the city, and they remain.

Kaspion is not empty. The dead walk its streets, reenact fragments of their final day, and occasionally interact with the living in unpredictable ways. Some scavengers and treasure-hunters brave the ruins; a few necromancers have established operations here, treating the ghost-city as a resource. The merchant-kings officially prohibit entry, but enforcement is minimal. Anyone foolish enough to enter Kaspion has already accepted the consequences.

#### Cliffdrop

The execution cliffs adjacent to Kaspion, where Kasper's "traitors" were thrown to their deaths. The cliffs are honeycombed with the broken bodies of victims—bones wedged in crevices, skulls grinning from alcoves. The ghosts here are angrier than those in Kaspion proper, their deaths more violent and more conscious.

Paradoxically, Cliffdrop has become a pilgrimage site. Death-cults send adherents to commune with the concentrated spiritual energy. Grieving families come to speak with ancestors (any ancestors—the ghosts are not picky about who they answer). Necromancers treat it as a training ground. The merchant-kings maintain a small guard post at the cliff-top, officially to prevent entry, actually to collect informal fees from pilgrims.

#### Port Perith

The last "normal" port before the haunted zone—normal being relative in Mueras. Port Perith exists because someone has to service the ships that trade with the cursed coast, and the sailors who work those routes need somewhere to drink that isn't actively haunted.

The town is tense, well-armed, and superstitious. Every building has iron fixtures at the doors and windows. Salt lines are refreshed daily. The local temple to the death-gods does excellent business. Port Perith's residents are not friendly to outsiders, but they're professional—if you have coin, they'll trade.

### Bazz

The de facto capital of modern Mueras, built on a series of cliff-carved terraces overlooking the junction of Labyrinth Sound and Corpse Bay. Where Kaspion concentrated power in a single ruler, Bazz concentrates it in the Council—the assembly of merchant-kings who theoretically govern collectively.

The city holds perhaps forty thousand people, making it the largest settlement in Mueras by a significant margin. The waterfront terraces house the trading companies, warehouses, and pilot-guild headquarters. The middle terraces contain markets, craftsmen, and the homes of successful merchants. The upper terraces—carved deepest into the cliff—hold the estates of the merchant-king families and the Council chambers.

Bazz's architecture is vertical rather than horizontal. Streets are often stairs. Goods move by crane and pulley as often as by cart. The wealthy live highest, where sea-spray doesn't reach and the view encompasses the entire Sound. The poor cluster at water level, where flooding is regular and the damp never quite leaves the walls.

#### The Council Chambers

Carved into the highest point of Bazz's cliff-face, the Council Chambers are both meeting hall and fortress. Each of the seven major merchant-king families maintains a suite of rooms here, and the central chamber—a natural cavern expanded by generations of stonework—hosts the formal Council sessions.

Assassination within the Chambers is forbidden by ancient compact, enforced by mutually assured destruction: each family has deposited secrets and evidence that would destroy the others, to be released upon their own demise. This creates a peculiar peace. Merchant-kings who would happily poison each other in the city below sit across the Council table and negotiate like civilized beings.

### Kelwin

Controls the central passage through Labyrinth Sound—the Kelwin Throat, the most technically demanding stretch of navigation in the region. House Vethros has held Kelwin for four generations, and their pilots are considered the finest in Mueras. Ships that can afford the premium pay Vethros rates; ships that can't take their chances with the cheaper (and riskier) northern or southern routes.

Kelwin itself is smaller than Bazz but wealthier per capita. The city is built into a narrow canyon where the Sound pinches tight, with structures climbing both walls. Bridges span the gap at multiple levels, creating a three-dimensional urban space that visitors find disorienting.

### Hennipin

Controls the southern passage into Corpse Bay—the Hennipin Gate. House Marsova rules here, eternal rivals to House Vethros of Kelwin. The two families have competed for primacy for generations, their conflict playing out in price wars, pilot-guild disputes, and occasional outright sabotage.

Hennipin is built on a broader shelf than Kelwin, allowing for more conventional horizontal expansion. The city sprawls along the cliffside, with the characteristic Mueran carved-stone architecture but more breathing room between structures. House Marsova maintains extensive warehousing here, undercutting Bazz's storage monopoly by offering competitive rates to ships that pass through the Gate.

### The Beak of Mueras

The southern peninsula, curving southwest toward North Agreben island. The Beak is the poorest region of Mueras—fishing villages, small-scale farming on the rare patches of arable soil, and ferry services to the southern islands. No merchant-king family has claimed the Beak; the margins are too thin to support their lifestyle.

#### Port Echo

The largest settlement on the Beak, named for the acoustic phenomenon in its harbor. The surrounding cliffs create a natural amphitheater that amplifies and echoes sounds from the water—a whispered conversation in a boat can sometimes be heard clearly on the docks. This makes Port Echo useless for clandestine meetings but excellent for public announcements.

Port Echo serves as the primary embarkation point for North Agreben and the Greenwater Isles beyond. Ferries run regularly, weather permitting, and the town has developed a modest shipbuilding industry using timber floated down from the Taflex Forest.

#### Watchkeep Isles

A small archipelago off the western coast of the Beak, comprising three inhabited islands and numerous rocks and shoals. The islands—home to Indus, Freed, and Giorga—were historically watchtowers guarding the southern approaches to Labyrinth Sound. The old stone keeps still stand, though they now serve as administrative centers rather than military posts.

**Indus**: The largest of the Watchkeep Isles, home to perhaps two thousand people. The old watchtower has been converted into a lighthouse, and Indus serves as the pilot station for ships approaching from the south. House Marsova of Hennipin technically claims authority here, but exercises it lightly.

**Freed**: Named for the freed slaves who settled here after Kasper's fall—Kasper had maintained slave galleys, and the rebellion liberated their crews. The descendants maintain a fierce independence and a deep hatred of anything resembling centralized authority. They fish, they trade, they emphatically do not pay taxes to any merchant-king.

**Giorga**: The smallest inhabited island, little more than a fishing village clustered around a natural harbor. Notable mainly for its shrine to the sea-gods, which draws occasional pilgrims.

#### Blof Point

The southernmost settlement in Mueras, a windswept village on the tip of the Beak. Ferry services to North Agreben depart from here when weather permits. The village exists in a state of perpetual salt-spray dampness; nothing stays dry, nothing stays rust-free, and the locals have developed a resigned acceptance of entropy.

### Grimreach

The eastern frontier of Mueras, where the Taflex Forest gives way to the rocky, fog-shrouded coastline above the Darkened Coast. Grimreach is contested territory—nominally part of Mueras, but the merchant-kings' authority fades rapidly this far from the Sound. The settlements here deal with shadow-touched trade goods, monster parts, and dark magic components that the respectable ports won't handle openly.

#### Yorx

A frontier town at the edge of the Taflex Forest, serving as the gateway to Grimreach proper. Hunters, trappers, and monster-hunters use Yorx as a base of operations. The town maintains no permanent allegiance to any merchant-king, instead paying protection money to whichever house currently has forces in the area.

#### Saron

Deeper into Grimreach, Saron is the last settlement before the Darkened Coast. The town exists to process and trade the strange materials that come out of the shadow-touched regions: void-eel oil, shadow-ray leather, and darker things. Saron's merchants ask no questions about provenance and expect none about destination.

### The Darkened Coast

East of the Taflex Forest and south of Grimreach, along the northwest coast of the Agreben Sea, lies the Darkened Coast—a stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow. The effect is not meteorological; clouds and fog play no part. The light simply fails to reach full strength here, as if something is drinking it.

The waters teem with dark-attuned sea creatures: shadow rays that glide beneath the waves, void eels that drain light from their surroundings, and worse things that rise from the lightless depths during moonless nights. Sailors avoid this coast when possible, as ships that venture too close risk being pulled under by creatures that exist more in shadow than flesh.

The Darkened Coast's nature predates King Kasper's curse, but scholars note the shadow has deepened since. Whether the curse awakened something already present, or whether the concentrated death-energy fed it, remains debated.

### Brunas Inlet

An eastern inlet providing the main harbor access to Grimreach and the Darkened Coast trade. Ships that deal in shadow-touched goods anchor here rather than risking the Darkened Coast directly. A small trading post has grown up at the inlet's head—not quite a town, more a permanent camp of temporary residents who don't stay long enough to attract the attention of whatever lives in the deeper shadow.

### Sal'emri Bay

The northeastern bay where the coast curves toward the Tarns, fed by seasonal rivers descending from the highlands. A cluster of settlements with distinctly different character from the rest of Mueras lines these waterways. The names here—Al Khamilah, Al Muqlib, Sha'ra, Am Batr, Al Harajah, Sirm al Banna—speak to Tarkhon influence, and indeed these are trading enclaves established by Tarkhon merchants generations ago.

The Sal'emri settlements maintain careful neutrality in merchant-king politics. They pay nominal fees to House Hammren for protection but answer to no Mueran authority. Their value lies in being outside the system—when merchant-kings need neutral ground for negotiation, when goods need to change hands without pilot-guild fees, when information needs to pass without observation, Sal'emri Bay provides.

The rivers feeding Sal'emri Bay are seasonal—torrents in the wet season, trickles in the dry. But even at their lowest, they provide irrigation for the date palms and grain fields that make these settlements self-sufficient in ways the coast cannot manage.

#### Al Khamilah

The largest of the Sal'emri settlements, a proper town of perhaps five thousand. Al Khamilah maintains a Tarkhon-style covered market, mosque-like temples to Tarkhon's fire-gods, and architecture that would not look out of place in Nektuna. The town serves as the informal capital of the Tarkhon enclave zone, positioned where the largest river meets the bay.

#### Sha'ra

A port town specializing in overland caravan trade—the route across the Dustwind Plateau to the Taflex Forest and beyond passes through here. Sha'ra maintains caravanserais, stables, and the guides necessary to survive the plateau crossing. The harbor serves coastal trade, but the real money flows through the caravan yards.

#### Am Batr

A smaller port town on the bay's northern shore, Am Batr handles the fishing trade and serves as a waypoint for coastal traffic moving between the Tarns and the main Mueran ports. The town maintains a small shipyard that repairs rather than builds—good enough for fishing boats and coastal traders.

#### Al Muqlib

Upriver from Al Khamilah, Al Muqlib sits where the river narrows enough to bridge. The town controls the only reliable crossing point for miles, collecting tolls from caravans that might otherwise bypass the coastal settlements entirely. A small but prosperous place, fiercely independent.

#### Al Harajah

The furthest upriver of the Sal'emri settlements, Al Harajah clings to the river's edge where the foothills begin to rise. The town serves as the last supply point before the highland crossing toward Kura. Merchants bringing Kuran glass to the coast stop here; those carrying coastal goods toward the desert interior depart from here.

#### Sirm al Banna

A village on a tributary stream, Sirm al Banna is known for its date palms—the finest in the Sal'emri region. The village processes and exports preserved dates, date wine, and date syrup throughout the settlements. Small, wealthy, and deeply uninterested in politics beyond its orchards.

### Taflex Forest

The great forest of eastern Mueras, running from the Dustwind Plateau down to the approaches of Grimreach. The Taflex provides the timber that builds Mueran ships—a crucial resource in a nation that lives by maritime trade. Logging operations, mostly controlled by House Vethros of Kelwin, maintain camps throughout the accessible portions of the forest.

The deeper Taflex is Yngli territory. Silent communities of the one-eyed folk live here, descended from those who fled exploitation in the coastal cities. They maintain their own governance, communicate through an elaborate sign language, and trade forest products for goods they cannot make themselves. The logging companies have learned not to push too deep; the Yngli don't need to speak to make their displeasure clear.

#### Eddiwood

A lumber town at the forest's western edge, where the Taflex meets the plateau. Logs are processed here, then either floated down seasonal streams toward Port Echo or hauled overland to Bazz. The town is rough, practical, and absolutely uninterested in merchant-king politics—they sell to whoever pays.

#### Hickton

Deeper in the forest, Hickton serves the hunting and trapping trade. Furs, hides, and forest products flow through here. The town maintains better relations with the Yngli communities than most Mueran settlements, partly through necessity—Hickton cannot survive without forest access, and the Yngli control that access.

#### Sherly & Lieler

Small settlements deeper still, barely more than camps. These serve as waypoints for those trading with the Yngli communities or venturing toward Grimreach. Not places to linger.
