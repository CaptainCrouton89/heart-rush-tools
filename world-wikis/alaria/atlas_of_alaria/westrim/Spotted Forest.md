## Spotted Forest

Tags: forest, geography

Where the Dunes of Kunagi finally surrender to the savanna, the land doesn't transition cleanly. Instead, it fractures into a patchwork of oases—the Spotted Forest, a collection of verdant islands scattered across thinning sand and yellowing grass.

From above, it looks like green spots on a tan hide, a leopard's pelt stretched across the desert's edge. From the ground, it's a maze of life pockets separated by dry scrub, each centered on water that surfaces here and refuses to surface anywhere else.

### The Oasis Clusters

Underground water from the Plains of Chule flows northwest toward the desert, where it strikes an impermeable layer of ancient rock and rises to the surface in scattered springs. Each spring creates a microclimate: trees cluster around the water, their shade reduces evaporation, fallen leaves enrich the soil, and a pocket of fertility develops amid the surrounding dry.

These oases range from tiny pools surrounded by a few palms to small lakes with proper forest canopy. The largest clusters support several hundred trees and undergrowth thick enough to hide in. The smallest are barely visible until you stumble into them.

The gaps between oases vary too. Some clusters sit within shouting distance of each other; others are separated by miles of dry scrub and stunted grass. The pattern seems random but isn't—the underlying geology dictates where water can rise, creating a consistent if chaotic distribution.

### Ecology

The Spotted Forest hosts creatures adapted to island-hopping between wet and dry:

**Day-Travelers** — Many animals move between oases on a circuit, drinking at one pool, feeding in the scrub between, sleeping at another. Antelope, wild dogs, and small cats follow these routes. Predators learn the circuits and hunt the gaps.

**Oasis-Bound** — Some creatures never leave their home oasis: frogs, certain birds, insects dependent on specific plants. Each oasis develops its own micro-population, slightly different from its neighbors. Naturalists have identified dozens of subspecies found nowhere else.

**Opportunists** — Creatures from both the desert and the savanna venture into the Spotted Forest when conditions in their home range turn harsh. Desert foxes appear during droughts; savanna elephants wander in during dry season. This creates unpredictable encounters—animals that would never meet in their normal ranges cross paths here.

### The Spotted Ones

For generations, the Spotted Forest has served as a contact zone between the Husakas scorpion riders and the Chule herders of the savanna. Trade, negotiation, and inevitable romance have produced a mixed community: the Spotted Ones, who belong fully to neither culture.

They number perhaps two thousand, scattered across the larger oases in extended family groups. Their lifestyle blends both parent cultures:
- They raise small herds of savanna cattle adapted to oasis life
- They keep a few scorpions—not the giant mounts of the Husakas, but smaller species useful for hunting and guard duty
- They speak both languages plus a creole that drives purists from both sides to distraction
- They observe the Telling (memory-sharing) but have never needed the extreme measures of the true desert-dwellers

The Spotted Ones are tolerated by both parent cultures as useful intermediaries but fully accepted by neither. The Husakas consider them soft—too much water access, too little discipline. The Chule consider them contaminated by the cursed desert. The Spotted Ones have learned not to care.

### Trading Crossroads

The forest's primary value is its position: the last water before the desert, the first shade after the savanna, the meeting point between two worlds that would otherwise have no contact.

**Desert-to-Savanna Trade:**
- Fossil salt and coral stone from Gyerekas
- Scorpion venom (valuable for medicine and poison)
- Desert textiles and leatherwork
- Information about desert conditions and safe routes

**Savanna-to-Desert Trade:**
- Livestock (cattle don't survive the deep desert, but can be eaten at journey's start)
- Grain and preserved food
- Metal goods from southern smiths
- News from the jungles and coast

The largest oasis cluster, **Merkatta**, hosts a permanent trading post that swells during the cool season when travel is easiest. Merkatta's pool is large enough to water a small caravan, and the surrounding trees have been supplemented with planted gardens and semi-permanent structures.

### Tensions

Everyone wants the Spotted Forest; no one can hold it.

**Husakas claims** — The scorpion riders consider the forest the eastern edge of their territory. They've been watering here since before the Spotted Ones existed. Some clans demand tribute from the oasis-dwellers; others consider them useful enough to leave alone.

**Chule claims** — The savanna herders point out that the water comes from their lands—the springs are fed by Chule aquifers. They've been grazing cattle at the forest's edge for generations. Some chiefs have tried to establish permanent control; none have succeeded for long.

**Spotted Ones' position** — They pay lip service to whoever's currently demanding it, play both sides against each other when they can, and focus on making themselves too useful to eliminate. They're the translators, the guides, the marriage brokers, the neutral ground. Remove them, and trade gets much harder for everyone.

**Periodic violence** — Every few decades, someone decides to force the issue. A Husakas clan pushes too hard for tribute; a Chule chief brings warriors instead of cattle. The fighting never lasts long—the forest is too scattered to hold, the prizes too small to die for—but it disrupts trade and leaves grudges that fester for generations.

Currently, tensions are elevated. A new Chule chief named Ombaka has been making noises about "reclaiming" the forest, and two Husakas clans have responded by increasing their presence at the western oases. The Spotted Ones are doing what they always do: staying friendly with everyone, hiding their valuables, and preparing to flee if necessary.

### Notable Locations

#### Merkatta

The largest oasis cluster and primary trading hub. Features:
- A spring-fed pool covering nearly an acre
- The Trading Shade—a massive tree where deals are struck
- Semi-permanent structures including warehouses and a surprisingly good tavern
- A Spotted One elder named Kessemi who serves as informal arbitrator

#### The Painter's Pools

Three connected oases where mineral-rich water creates brilliant colors: rust-red, sulfur-yellow, and deep blue-green. Beautiful but undrinkable. Artists and dyers make pilgrimages here for the pigments that can be extracted from the pool edges.

#### Dry Sister

An oasis that failed. The spring dried up two generations ago, leaving dead trees and a haunted reputation. The Spotted Ones avoid it; they say the spirits of those who died when the water vanished still wait there, thirsty.

### Encountering the Spotted Forest

Travelers passing between desert and savanna almost always stop here. The forest offers:
- Reliable water (the springs aren't cursed—they're fed from beyond Husakas)
- Rest and resupply at Merkatta
- Guides familiar with both desert and savanna routes
- Translation services for dealing with Husakas or Chule
- A chance to negotiate with either culture on neutral ground

The Spotted Ones are welcoming to travelers who pay fairly and don't take sides in local disputes. They're suspicious of anyone who seems too interested in their political situation—the last thing they need is outsiders stirring up trouble with either of their powerful neighbors.
