## Lise

Tags: city, settlement

The capital of Enapay and seat of the Dragonbound Queen. Lise sprawls where the Ishtar River delta meets the Green Wilds, a city built to accommodate both its Dwelyn inhabitants and their ancient dragon protector.

### Character

Lise is not a city of stone walls and paved streets. It's a settlement woven into the jungle itself—platforms built into massive trees, rope bridges connecting neighborhoods, ground-level structures raised on stilts above the wet delta soil. The Dwelyn have not conquered their environment; they've negotiated with it.

The city has grown organically over centuries, expanding outward and upward as the population increased. There is no grid, no central planning. Instead, clan territories merge and overlap, connected by paths that make sense to those who know them and bewilder anyone else.

Above it all, visible from anywhere in the city, rises the Dragon's Roost—a colossal jungle tree whose crown has been shaped into Surrey Mahaila's lair. The emerald dragon's presence has always been Lise's defining feature. Now her absence—she rarely emerges from the Roost anymore—defines it equally.

### Districts

**The Canopy**: The oldest and most prestigious neighborhood, built into the highest branches of the ancient trees surrounding the Dragon's Roost. Clan chiefs and their households live here, their platforms connected by bridges decorated with the beads of generations. Status is measured in elevation—the higher you live, the more influential you are.

**River Market**: Where the Ishtar meets the delta, Dwelyn traders gather to exchange goods with the occasional merchant brave enough to travel upriver. The market operates on platforms just above the waterline, and during flood season, traders conduct business from boats. This is the only part of Lise that regularly sees outsiders.

**The Stilts**: Ground-level Lise, where common Dwelyn live in raised houses connected by boardwalks. The area floods regularly, and residents have adapted—everything of value stays above high-water mark. Warriors train here, children play in the shallows, and the business of daily life continues despite the mud.

**The Warrior's Rest**: A semi-permanent encampment on Lise's eastern edge, where warriors gather before departing for the front. Not technically part of the city, but always present. The camp grows and shrinks with the war's intensity.

### The Dragon's Roost

Surrey Mahaila's lair dominates Lise's skyline. The tree that houses it—locals call it simply "the Roost"—is over three hundred feet tall, with a trunk wide enough to hold chambers carved into its living wood. The dragon herself nests in the crown, in a platform of woven branches large enough to hold her serpentine bulk.

In healthier times, Surrey Mahaila would descend regularly—to consult with the queen, to accept offerings, to remind Lise's residents of her protection. Now she stays in the crown, too weak or too sick to make the journey down. Smoke from medicinal fires rises constantly from the Roost as Dwelyn shamans attempt treatments that have so far failed.

The tree itself seems to be affected. Its leaves are yellowing on the side nearest the dragon. Some say the Faesong poisoning is spreading through the wood itself.

### Governance

Queen Teyara Greenmantle rules from the Canopy, in a great hall built across three connected platforms. She holds court daily, mediating disputes between clans and directing the war effort. But her authority feels fragile—everyone knows it depends on the dragon bond, and the dragon is dying.

Clan chiefs increasingly make decisions without royal consultation. The queen's summons go unanswered. Some warriors openly wear more beads than their loyalty to the crown would traditionally allow. Lise is a city waiting to see what happens next.

### Economy

Lise's markets trade in jungle products: feathers from birds found nowhere else, medicines distilled from rare plants, ironwood harvested from the Ishnit, and Dwelyn craftsmanship. The city exports more than it imports—the Dwelyn need little from the outside world and prefer it that way.

Trade happens slowly. The Ishtar River is the only reliable route in or out, and the journey is long and dangerous. Merchants who make the trip can name their prices for goods heading in either direction.

### The Sickness in the Air

Visitors to Lise often report feeling... wrong. It's subtle—a sense of dissonance, of things being slightly off-key. Those sensitive to magical currents (druids, fae, bards) describe it as hearing a beautiful song with one persistent wrong note.

This is the poisoned Faesong that afflicts Surrey Mahaila. Whatever corrupted it affects the entire region, but Lise feels it most strongly—perhaps because the dragon concentrated Faesong here over centuries, and now that concentration has become a concentration of poison.

Some residents have begun experiencing symptoms: troubled sleep, inexplicable sadness, creative blocks for artisans. Nothing deadly, but the city's spirit has dimmed along with its dragon's.

### Getting There

**By River**: The Ishtar flows from the jungle interior to the Gulf of Norag. Most traders approach from upstream, following established routes from other Westrim settlements. The journey downstream from Lise leads to Naruaghin territory and the cursed coast—not recommended.

**By Land**: Jungle trails connect Lise to other Dwelyn settlements in the Green Wilds. These paths are maintained and relatively safe, but outsiders require guides. The trails leading east, toward Naruaghin territory, are watched by both sides and should be avoided.

**By Air**: Surrey Mahaila once welcomed visitors who arrived by flying mount or spell. Now she responds to aerial approach with territorial aggression—the sickness has made her paranoid. Approach by air at your own risk.
