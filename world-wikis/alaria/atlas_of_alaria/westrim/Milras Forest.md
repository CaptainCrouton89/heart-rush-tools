## Milras Forest

Tags: forest, geography

A dense old-growth forest in southwestern Westrim, forming the northern boundary of Atriik. The Milras stretches from the Wyrm Teeth hills in the northeast toward Shark Bay in the west, separating the Atriik city-states from Kura and the northern desert margins.

The forest is ancient and deep—not as supernaturally disorienting as its distant cousin Milrar in the Westwilds, but old enough to discourage casual exploration. The Sha Puniki river flows from its eastern edge past Lupuno, and the timber trade from the forest's margins supports much of northwestern Atriik's economy.

### Character

Milras is cooler and wetter than the savanna to the south, catching moisture from Shark Bay's sea breezes before it can reach the Kunagi. The canopy is thick but not impenetrable; game trails and old roads wind through the understory. Unlike Milrar, time flows normally here—the forest is merely old, not cursed.

The Kor of Lupuno maintain careful logging operations along the forest's southern edge, never cutting deeper than a day's walk from the treeline. The interior remains wild, home to megafauna that have vanished from the more settled lands: dire wolves, great cats, and the occasional rumors of something larger.

### Milreun Palace

In the forest's northeastern depths, where the trees grow thickest and the Wyrm Teeth begin their rise, stands Milreun Palace—a structure that should not exist this far from the Westwilds, yet does.

The palace appears to be a fragment or echo of its namesake in the Milrar Forest of Clueanda. The architecture is identical: doorways twenty feet tall, staircases at inhuman angles, proportions wrong in ways that unsettle without being overtly threatening. Some scholars theorize the two palaces are connected across the continents; others believe they were built by the same unknown civilization during an age when geography was more... fluid.

Unlike its Westwilds counterpart, this Milreun shows no time distortion effects. Explorers enter and exit normally, reporting nothing stranger than architecture that makes them uncomfortable and the persistent sense of being watched. The palace has been picked over by generations of treasure hunters, but its deepest chambers remain uncharted—the stairs simply descend farther than anyone has been willing to follow.

### Notable Features

**The Puniki Headwaters**: The Sha Puniki rises from springs at the forest's eastern edge, collecting smaller streams before emerging near Lupuno. The headwater region is sacred to Atriik's druidic tradition.

**The Timber Road**: A maintained track running from Lupuno into the forest's edge, used by logging operations. The road extends perhaps ten miles before becoming an unmaintained game trail.

**The Wyrm Teeth Border**: The northeastern forest gives way to rocky, thorn-scrub hills—the beginning of the Wyrm Teeth range. Urk Noulgas, the ruined wyrm-keeper fortress, stands visible on the hills above the treeline.
