## Green Wilds

Tags: forest, geography, jungle

The Green Wilds are what the Ishnit Jungles become when they thin enough to walk through—still dangerous, still wild, but no longer the impenetrable deathscape of the deep jungle. The Dwelyn of Enapay claim this territory, but claiming and controlling are different things. Beyond the Ishtar River corridor where Lise sits, the Green Wilds belong to no one.

### Character

The trees here still tower two hundred feet, but they stand far enough apart for a person to pass between them. Undergrowth chokes the forest floor—thick, tangled, but cuttable with effort. Rivers run clearer than in the Ishnit, and some game trails stay open long enough to follow. It's wilderness, not wasteland.

But it's empty wilderness. No villages. No roads. No patrols beyond the occasional Dwelyn hunting party that ventures in and—sometimes—ventures back out. The Green Wilds are the space between Enapay's claimed heartland and the Naruaghin territories to the east: a buffer zone that neither side truly holds.

Three rivers cut through the region: the Byzkus through the center, the Pino to the southwest, and the Morsuye marking the southern edge. Unlike the Ishtar—which flows past Lise and carries what little trade Enapay sees—these rivers run through territory no one has mapped and few have survived.

To the north, the forest thins into scrubland called the Royon, where jungle gives way to the Dunes of Kunagi. To the south, the canopy thickens until it becomes true Ishnit. East lies Naruaghin territory. West, eventually, the Ishtar and civilization.

### The Rivers

Three rivers drain the Green Wilds into the Gulf of Norag. None are safe.

#### Byzkus River

The Byzkus cuts through the heart of the Wilds, flowing south from somewhere near the Royon scrublands. It's the largest of the three—wide enough for canoes, fast enough to be dangerous, and long enough that no one knows its full course. Dwelyn hunters sometimes follow it inland. Most turn back before they learn what lives in the deeper stretches.

Since Surrey Mahaila's sickness began, the few hunters who venture along the Byzkus report strange things. Waters that glow wrong colors at night. Game that moves against the current. The sense that something is watching from just beneath the surface. Whether the river is connected to the Faesong poisoning, or merely reflects it, no one has stayed long enough to find out.

#### Pino River

The Pino drains the southwestern Wilds, smaller and slower than the Byzkus. It flows through territory the Dwelyn nominally claim but have never actually occupied—too far from Lise, too close to Naruaghin raiding routes. The river eventually reaches the coast somewhere near the Gulf of Norag's contested waters.

No one lives along the Pino. Occasionally a Dwelyn hunting party will follow it for a few days before turning back. The forest here is quieter than it should be—fewer birds, fewer insects, fewer of the usual jungle sounds. Hunters call it "dead water" and avoid it when they can.

#### Morsuye River

The Morsuye marks the southern edge of anything that could be called the Green Wilds. Beyond it, the forest thickens into true Ishnit—Naruaghin territory, or worse. The river itself flows toward the cursed waters near Demortik Bay, and nothing good comes from that direction.

No Dwelyn has mapped the Morsuye. No Dwelyn has reason to. It's a boundary, not a pathway—the line where Enapay's theoretical claims end and the jungle's reality begins.

### The Royon

Where the Green Wilds meet the Dunes of Kunagi, the forest thins into scrubland. The Royon stretches for perhaps thirty miles—trees growing shorter and sparser until they give way to thornbush, then to sand and heat shimmer.

Nothing lives here that doesn't have to. The scrub is too dry for jungle creatures, too vegetated for desert dwellers. Game animals pass through during seasonal migrations, and predators follow them. Otherwise, the Royon sits empty—a no-man's-land between two hostile ecosystems.

Scattered across the scrubland are stone foundations and toppled columns, remnants of some civilization that predated the Dwelyn. No one knows who built them or why. The ruins are picked clean of anything obviously valuable, but occasionally a sandstorm will uncover something new—a buried chamber, a sealed jar, a skeleton clutching something that glints.

### Melera Skeyad

Deep in the Green Wilds, where the Byzkus River curves around an ancient hill, stand the ruins of Melera Skeyad—"Melera's Rest" in the old tongue.

The city is old. Older than the Dwelyn, older than the Naruaghin, older than anyone living can say. Its stones are wrong—too smooth, too precisely fitted, made of materials that don't exist in the surrounding jungle. Vines have consumed most of the structures, but enough remains visible to show that this was once a place of importance: temples, plazas, towers that must have risen higher than the canopy.

The Faesong runs strong here. Melera's imprisoned song pools in Melera Skeyad like water in a depression, resonating through the ruins with an intensity that's audible even to those with no magical sensitivity. The air hums. The stones vibrate at frequencies felt in the teeth. Those who stay too long report hearing voices in languages they don't recognize.

Or that's how it was.

Since Surrey Mahaila's sickness began, the song has changed. The harmony that once filled the ruins now carries a discordant note—subtle at first, then impossible to ignore. The vibrations feel wrong. The voices sound hungry. Visitors report headaches, nausea, and a persistent sense that something is watching from the empty doorways.

The Dwelyn believe Melera Skeyad is the epicenter of whatever poisoned the local Faesong. Queen Teyara has sent shamans to investigate. None have returned with answers. Some haven't returned at all. The ruins seem to resist examination—paths loop back on themselves, distances change between measurements, and those who push too deep find themselves expelled at the forest's edge with no memory of how they escaped.

Whatever is happening at Melera Skeyad, it's getting worse. The corruption spreads outward, following the rivers, seeping through the soil. If it isn't stopped, it may eventually reach Lise—and the Dragon's Roost.

### Dangers

The Green Wilds are safer than the Ishnit Jungles, but that's a low bar. Everything here wants to eat you—the difference is that here you might see it coming.

**Fauna**: Blood Monkeys drop from the canopy onto exposed necks. Monkin set traps along game trails and wait. Great cats hunt at dawn and dusk, and some have learned that humans are easier prey than jungle deer. Serpents lurk in the undergrowth—most venomous, some large enough to crush a horse. The rivers hold things that grab from below and don't let go.

**Flora**: Singing Trees lure victims to sleep and implant their seeds. Certain vines strangle anything that brushes against them. Particular flowers poison by scent alone—you're dead before you realize you shouldn't have inhaled. The Dwelyn know which plants to avoid. Outsiders learn the hard way, if they learn at all.

**The Sickness**: Since the Faesong poisoning began, the Green Wilds have felt wrong. Animals behave strangely—predators that should flee from fire walk toward it instead. Plants grow in unsettling patterns, spiraling in directions that hurt to look at. Those who spend time in the deeper Wilds report troubled dreams, creative blocks, and a persistent sense that reality is slightly out of tune. Sensitive individuals—druids, bards, fae-touched—find the sensation nearly unbearable.

### Player Hooks

**The Corrupted Ruins**: Whatever poisoned Melera Skeyad is killing Surrey Mahaila and threatening all of Enapay. Queen Teyara would give almost anything for answers—and she has the authority to grant land, titles, and dragon-favors to whoever provides them.

**River Mysteries**: The Byzkus shows signs of corruption—glowing waters, wrong-moving game, watchers beneath the surface. Following the river to its source might reveal what's happening to the Faesong. Or it might reveal something that doesn't want to be found.

**The Old Ruins**: The Royon's pre-Dwelyn foundations occasionally yield artifacts. Most are worthless. Some are dangerous. A few might be valuable enough to retire on—if you survive getting them out.
