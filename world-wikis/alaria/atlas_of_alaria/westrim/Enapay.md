## Enapay

Tags: state, nation

The ancient Dwelyn monarchy occupying the Green Wilds at the edge of the Ishnit Jungles. Enapay has been the Dwelyn homeland since before written history, its queens bonded to the emerald dragon Surrey Mahaila through a ritual known only to the royal line.

### Territory

Enapay claims the entirety of the Green Wilds, though effective control extends only as far as Dwelyn settlements and patrol routes. The nation's heartland lies along the Ishtar River, with the capital Lise at its delta. Eastern territories—the Green Marches—remain contested with East Naruaghin tribes.

The nation has no coastline. The Gulf of Norag lies thirty miles south of Lise, but Naruaghin tribes and cursed waters prevent direct access. All trade flows overland or upriver.
