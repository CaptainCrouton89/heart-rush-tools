## Sprenwood

Tags: forest, geography

A coastal forest stretching along Shark Bay's eastern shore, providing Byonowidi and western Atriik with timber, game, and a buffer against the salt winds. The Sha Ulokoni flows through its heart.

### Character

Sprenwood is smaller and less ancient than Milras—more managed woodland than primeval forest. The trees here are hardwoods suited to the maritime climate: salt-tolerant species with dense grain prized for shipbuilding and furniture. The forest floor is relatively open, carpeted with ferns and low shrubs rather than the tangled undergrowth of deeper forests.

The Sharabha of Byonowidi have worked this forest for generations, developing a sustainable logging tradition that takes only what the forest can replace. This restraint is partly cultural, partly practical—the forest's health is Byonowidi's health, and the Sharabha monarchy cannot afford to exhaust its primary resource.

### Economy

Sprenwood exports include:
- **Shipbuilding timber**: Dense, salt-resistant hardwoods traded to Watalina's Kendor shipwrights
- **Furniture wood**: Finished lumber for the urban markets of Kura and beyond
- **Furs and game**: Hunting rights in Sprenwood are controlled by the Byonowidi crown
- **Medicinal herbs**: Forest-floor plants used in Atriik's healing traditions

### Notable Features

**The Ulokoni Mills**: Water-powered sawmills on the Sha Ulokoni, processing logs floated down from the interior. The mills are the industrial heart of Byonowidi's timber trade.

**The Salt Margin**: Where Sprenwood meets Shark Bay, the trees give way to salt marshes and tidal flats. This transitional zone supports a distinct ecology—wading birds, shellfish beds, and the occasional sea-going predator venturing inland.

**The Cavalry Grounds**: Open meadows in Sprenwood's southern reaches, used by Byonowidi's Sharabha cavalry for training. The combination of open ground, scattered trees, and varied terrain makes excellent practice for the mounted warfare the Sharabha are known for.
