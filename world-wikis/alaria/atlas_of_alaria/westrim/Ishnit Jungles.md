## Ishnit Jungles

Tags: forest, geography

Superduper fucking deadly unless your quite powerful. Lots of nasty monsters.

Home to Naruaghin.

### Ekomorn

Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The Naruaghin who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.

### Demonwatch

A large darkstone palace on the southern cape of the Ishnit Jungles, its towers now strangled by centuries of vine growth. What was once a wizard's sanctuary is now a prison—not for the wizard, but for what he summoned.

#### The Summoning

The wizard Veleth Korrandus built Demonwatch roughly three centuries ago, far from civilization and prying eyes. He was one of the few mortals who had acquired genuine Deoric knowledge—fragments of the god-language that can reshape reality when spoken with sufficient blood sacrifice.

Veleth's ambition was to summon servants from the Stalactites of Geth, the demon-haunted formations that hang from Malstaris down to the Wastes beneath the world. Deoric ritual magic can reach across planar boundaries—the same mechanism by which daemons grant miracles to their worshippers, reversed. With the right words and enough sacrifice, a sufficiently knowledgeable mage can call entities from nearly anywhere.

The blood sacrifice required was... substantial. The South Naruaghin still tell stories of entire villages that vanished during Veleth's years of preparation.

#### The Failure

The summoning worked. The binding did not.

Veleth called seven demons from the Stalactites—lesser lords by demon standards, but devastatingly powerful by any mortal measure. He intended to bind them as servants using Deoric commands inscribed in the palace's architecture. But demons are ancient, patient, and intimately familiar with the god-language. They found the flaws in his binding before he could correct them.

Veleth died badly. The demons, freed from his control, found themselves trapped by a different mechanism: the darkstone walls of the palace itself. Whether Veleth built this as a failsafe or whether the stone simply absorbed enough Deoric power during construction to become a prison, the demons cannot pass beyond the palace grounds. They have tried for three hundred years.

#### Current State

The seven demons remain confined within Demonwatch's walls. They are immortal—they cannot die of age, starvation, or boredom. They are powerful—each could devastate a small army. And they are patient—they have nothing but time.

The palace is decorated with stone gargoyles, leathery-winged figures with curling horns perched on every cornice and balcony. Sailors who pass the cape point to these and laugh nervously: "See? Just ugly statues. Nothing to fear." The gargoyles are indeed just statues. The demons within are not.

Occasionally, something wanders too close to Demonwatch. A Naruaghin hunting party that strays too far south. A shipwrecked sailor swimming toward what looks like shelter. A curious adventurer who doesn't believe the stories. None return. The demons cannot leave, but they can certainly receive visitors.

#### The Demortik Bay Connection

The waters of Demortik Bay, the inlet surrounding Demonwatch's cape, have been spiritually poisoned by three centuries of demonic presence. Fish avoid the bay. Ships that anchor there report nightmares and crew who walk into the water and don't return. Whether the demons can project some influence beyond their physical prison, or whether the corruption has simply seeped into the environment, the effect is real enough that no sane captain enters Demortik Bay after dark.
