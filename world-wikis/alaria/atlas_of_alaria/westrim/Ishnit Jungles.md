## Ishnit Jungles

Superduper fucking deadly unless your quite powerful. Lots of nasty monsters.

Home to Naruaghin.

### Ekomorn

Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The Naruaghin who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.

### Demonwatch

Large, darkstone palace on the southern cape of the Ishnit Jungles, vines growing up over all of it. Overrun when a demon-summoning wizard lost control over his subjects. The demons are confined to the tower, but they're quite powerful, and immortal. Decorated with large, leathery-winged gargoyles with curling horns perched on guard.

Sailors are incredibly superstitious of the place, won't go near it. Others make fun of them for it—"the stone gargoyles just look scary, they aren't real." They aren't, but the demons within are.
