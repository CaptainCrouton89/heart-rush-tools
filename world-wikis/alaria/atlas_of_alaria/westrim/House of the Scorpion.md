## House of the Scorpion

Tags: poi, landmark

Half-buried in the northern reaches of Husakas, where the dunes pile highest against some invisible barrier, stands a palace of black chitin and sun-bleached stone. The House of the Scorpion rises from the sand like the carapace of something impossibly large, its towers curving like raised tails, its gates shaped like open claws.

This is the origin of all scorpions in the world, or so the Husakas believe. Here dwells the Prince of Scorpions, who has maintained the desert's children since before human memory. Here the scorpion riders make their bicentennial pilgrimage, trading memories for the continued existence of their bonded partners.

The House is not evil. The Prince is not a monster. But neither are they safe.

### Exterior

The palace emerges from a massive dune that never shifts despite the endless desert winds. The structure is partially submerged—how much lies beneath the sand, no one knows. What's visible suggests something the size of a small fortress: three main towers, a central dome, connecting walls and passages that disappear into the dune at odd angles.

The architecture blends organic and constructed elements disturbingly well. Walls of fitted stone are reinforced with chitin plates. Pillars carved from rock are wrapped in what might be shed scorpion shells grown to impossible size. The black coloring comes from the chitin—the stone beneath is ordinary desert sandstone.

Scorpions are everywhere. They crawl across every surface: the walls, the sand, the rare visitors who approach. Most are ordinary-sized, but some are larger—dog-sized, pony-sized, one truly massive specimen that lies coiled around the main gate like a living portcullis. They don't attack unless provoked, but they watch. They always watch.

The entrance is through the great claw-gate, which opens only for those the Prince permits inside. Forcing entry is possible but unwise—the guardian scorpion is not merely large but ancient, and the walls themselves seem to crawl when threatened.

### Interior

Inside, the House is larger than the exterior suggests. Chambers extend in directions that don't quite correspond to the building's visible footprint. The Husakas say the House exists partially in the scorpions' world, wherever that is, and its true size cannot be measured by human standards.

**The Receiving Hall** — The first chamber past the gates: a high-ceilinged space where sand has drifted into dunes against the walls. Chitin pillars support a dome that lets in diffuse light through amber panels. Visitors wait here until the Prince summons them deeper.

**The Gallery of Shells** — A corridor lined with mounted scorpion shells of every size and species, from thumbnail-tiny to larger than horses. These are not trophies—they're memorials, the shed or death-shells of every scorpion the Prince considered significant. Thousands of them, spanning millennia.

**The Memory Pool** — A circular chamber at the House's heart, containing a shallow pool of water that glows faintly amber. This is where the pilgrimage gift is given: visitors drink from the pool after telling the Prince something worth remembering. The water is connected to Husakas's cursed streams—same source, same effect. The Prince chose this punishment and this gift simultaneously, long ago.

**The Throne Chamber** — Beyond the Memory Pool, accessible only to those the Prince truly wishes to speak with. A room of living walls—the "stone" here is packed scorpions, thousands of them forming floor and ceiling and walls, shifting slowly, breathing as one. At the center, a raised dais where the Prince receives visitors.

**The Depths** — No visitor has seen what lies below the main level. The Husakas say tunnels extend deep beneath the desert, connecting to every scorpion nest in Husakas, perhaps every nest in the world. The Prince can feel every scorpion through these connections. Every birth, every death, every molt and mating.

### The Prince of Scorpions

He was human once. The Husakas remember this, though they've forgotten his original name.

The Prince stands eight feet tall when he chooses to stand. His lower body is that of a giant scorpion—eight legs, heavy tail curving overhead, stinger dripping with venom that has never been tested on a willing subject. His upper body is humanoid but wrong: the skin has a chitinous sheen, the fingers end in hooked claws, and mandibles click beneath lips that still form human words.

His eyes are the worst part. He has too many—two large ones where human eyes should be, but also clusters of smaller eyes at his temples, on his forehead, along his jaw. They don't all focus on the same thing. When he looks at you, you're not sure which eyes are really looking.

**Speech** — The Prince speaks in riddles not because he enjoys them but because the transformation damaged his ability to communicate directly. Straightforward statements come out twisted, intentions inverted, meanings layered beneath meanings. He's been trying to say something clearly for longer than the Husakas have existed. He can't.

**Personality** — Beneath the monstrous form and broken speech, the Prince is lonely. He's been alone in the House for thousands of years, with only scorpions for company. Visitors are rare—the pilgrimage comes only twice a century. He wants to talk, to connect, to remember what it was like to be human. But everything he says comes out wrong, and most visitors are too terrified to try parsing his riddles.

He is not malicious. He does not enjoy fear or suffering. But he is deeply, fundamentally alien now, and his instincts don't always match human expectations. He might offer water to a guest without remembering what it does. He might ask a question that sounds like a threat. He might forget that humans need to sleep, or eat, or breathe.

**The Transformation** — The Prince doesn't remember becoming what he is. He remembers being human, then a long darkness, then waking as he is now with the knowledge that scorpions are his responsibility. He believes he chose this, but he can't remember why. Sometimes he wonders if he was tricked. Sometimes he wonders if he was always this way and the human memories are the lie.

### The Pilgrimage

Every two hundred years, representatives from all Husakas clans gather at the House of the Scorpion. The pilgrimage serves two purposes: to renew the pact that keeps the desert's scorpions alive, and to give the Prince something no one else in the world possesses.

**The Approach** — Pilgrims travel together from the Gathering Stones, a journey of several days through the heart of Husakas. No clan feuds are permitted during the pilgrimage; this is sacred time. The scorpion mounts become agitated as they near the House, sensing something that draws and frightens them equally.

**The Gift** — Each pilgrim brings a memory. Something precious, something that would be a genuine loss to forget. They tell the Prince this memory in the Receiving Hall—not the Memory Pool, not yet—speaking it aloud while he listens with all his eyes. Small memories (a favorite meal, a childhood game) are accepted but unremarkable. Significant memories (a first love, a parent's death, a moment of perfect joy or perfect horror) please the Prince visibly.

**The Forgetting** — After telling their memory, pilgrims drink from the Memory Pool. The cursed water takes what they just gave. Now the Prince alone knows this thing; the pilgrim has forgotten they ever knew it. The Memory Keepers who witness the pilgrimage record what was given, but the pilgrims themselves leave with gaps they can never fill.

**The Renewal** — Once all gifts are given, the Prince descends to the Depths and does... something. The Husakas don't know what. They feel it, though—every bonded scorpion in the desert convulses briefly, then settles. The bond is renewed. The scorpions will survive another two centuries.

### Why Killing the Prince Would Be Catastrophic

Outsiders sometimes hear about the House of the Scorpion and think: monster, lair, quest. Kill the half-scorpion abomination, free the desert from its curse, be heroes.

This would be a disaster.

The Prince is the keystone of every scorpion in the desert, possibly the world. His existence maintains theirs. If he dies, they die—all of them, everywhere, within days. The giant mounts would collapse. The ordinary scorpions would vanish. The ecosystem that depends on them would follow.

For the Husakas, this would be genocide. Their culture depends on the scorpion bond. Without the great scorpions, they cannot survive the desert. They would die or be forced to abandon their homeland entirely.

The curse on the water would likely end—the Prince seems to be its source—but the cost would be unimaginable.

The scorpion riders know this. They protect the House not out of worship but necessity. Anyone who threatens the Prince threatens their entire people, and they respond accordingly.

### Visiting the House

Few outsiders ever see the House of the Scorpion. It's deep in the desert, far from any trade route, in territory the scorpion riders don't encourage visitors to enter. But it's not impossible to reach, and the Prince does receive guests between pilgrimages.

**Getting There** — Requires either a Husakas guide (expensive, requires trust) or exceptional desert survival skills. The House is visible from miles away once you're close enough—the dune that never moves is distinctive.

**Getting In** — The guardian scorpion judges visitors by criteria no one fully understands. It seems to respond to intent: those who come to harm the Prince are denied; those who come seeking something else may be admitted. Or not. The scorpion's judgment is not always explicable.

**Inside** — Visitors who enter are not prisoners but are strongly encouraged not to wander. The House is larger than it looks, the deeper chambers are dangerous, and the Prince dislikes uninvited exploration. Stay in the Receiving Hall until summoned. Accept the Prince's hospitality if offered—he can provide food, water (safe water, from outside Husakas), and shelter. Do not drink from any pool or fountain without explicit confirmation that it's safe.

**Conversation** — Speaking with the Prince requires patience. His riddles aren't games; they're the only way he can communicate. Listen for the meaning beneath the words. Ask clarifying questions. Don't assume threat where none is intended. He's been alone a very long time, and he's starved for connection more than anything else.

**Leaving** — The Prince does not hold visitors against their will. Anyone may leave at any time. But those who've seen the interior of the House sometimes find the desert changed afterward—or find themselves changed. The Prince's attention lingers.

### Adventure Hooks

- **The Early Pilgrimage** — Something is wrong with the scorpions. They're dying, sickening, refusing to bond. The clans need to reach the House of the Scorpion immediately, but the pilgrimage isn't due for decades. Do they dare approach the Prince out of cycle? What will he demand in exchange for early renewal?

- **The Translation** — A scholar believes she can help the Prince communicate clearly, breaking the riddle-curse that traps his speech. She needs escorts to reach the House and protection while she works. But what if the Prince doesn't want to be "fixed"? What if the riddles hide something he can't bear to say directly?

- **The Pretender** — Someone is claiming to be the Prince of Scorpions' heir, demanding tribute from scorpion rider clans. The Prince has no heir. But the pretender can command scorpions in ways no ordinary person should be able to. What is their true connection to the House?

- **The Merciful Assassination** — A dying Twice-Born begs the party to kill the Prince—not out of hatred, but mercy. She remembers nothing of her former life, but she's had visions suggesting the Prince is in agony, trapped in a form he never truly chose, maintaining a pact he wants to escape. Is any of this true? Would ending his existence be kindness or catastrophe?
