## South Naruaghin Tribes

Tags: state, nation

The South Naruaghin control the western reaches of the Ishnit Jungles, including the cursed coastline around Demortik Bay. Hardened by proximity to Demonwatch and hunted by Senwyn the Agonizer, they have become the most aggressive and expansionist of the three tribal confederations.

### Territory

The southern tribes range from the jungle interior to the coast, claiming everything west of a rough line drawn from Ekomorn to Demortik Bay. Their territory includes some of the densest and most monster-infested jungle in the Ishnit, which they navigate with brutal expertise.

### Culture

The South Naruaghin have internalized a philosophy of preemptive violence. Surrounded by demons to the south, a dragon overhead, and hostile tribes on all sides, they've concluded that the only way to survive is to strike first and strike hard.

**Demon-Scarred Traditions**: Living near Demonwatch has left its mark. South Naruaghin warriors undergo ritual scarification meant to make them "unpalatable" to demons—patterns cut into the scales that supposedly confuse infernal senses. Whether this works is debatable, but the scarification certainly intimidates enemies.

**War-Chiefs**: The South Naruaghin are led by war-chiefs who earn their position through successful raids. A chief who stops raiding loses authority. This creates constant pressure for expansion and conflict.

**Venom Craft**: In grim irony, the South Naruaghin have become master poisoners, harvesting venoms from jungle creatures to coat their weapons. They fight Senwyn the Agonizer with the tools of venomous snakes—a defiance the dragon finds either amusing or enraging depending on its mood.

### Dragon Relations

Senwyn the Agonizer treats the South Naruaghin as prey and entertainment. The dragon doesn't just hunt them—it toys with them, poisoning water sources and watching villages die slowly, or striking hunting parties and leaving survivors to spread terror. The South Naruaghin hate Senwyn with burning intensity, and their shamans work constantly on poisons they hope might one day harm the dragon.

### The Demonwatch Problem

The South Naruaghin don't approach Demonwatch, but they can't ignore it either. The demons confined within the darkstone palace are immortal and powerful—contained but not defeated. Tribal lore holds that the demons occasionally escape briefly during moonless nights, and anyone caught near the palace is taken.

The cursed reputation of Demortik Bay actually benefits the tribes somewhat—it keeps foreign ships away from their coast.

### Relations with Other Tribes

The South Naruaghin are constantly raiding. They push against the East Naruaghin, compete with them for hunting grounds, and occasionally launch expeditions against the North (though the northern tribes' territory offers little worth taking). They view themselves as the true Naruaghin—the others have grown soft.

### Notable Locations

**Venom's Rest**: The largest South Naruaghin settlement, located deep in the interior where Senwyn rarely hunts. Built around a natural hot spring with medicinal properties.

**The Scarring Grounds**: A ritual site where young warriors receive their demon-ward scars. Located uncomfortably close to Demonwatch—surviving the journey is part of the initiation.

**Demortik Coast**: The haunted shoreline. South Naruaghin fishing parties work these waters quickly and never after dark.
