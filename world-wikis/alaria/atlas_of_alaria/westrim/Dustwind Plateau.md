## Dustwind Plateau

Tags: plains, geography, arid

The arid heart of Mueras, a high tableland swept by winds that never cease. The Dustwind Plateau separates the wealthy coastal cities from the eastern reaches—a buffer zone where few settlements survive and fewer prosper. Caravans cross it to avoid the longer sea route around the Beak, but the journey is harsh, and the plateau claims its share of the unprepared.

The plateau rises gradually from the coast, reaching its full height some forty miles inland. From there, it stretches east to the edge of the Taflex Forest, north to the Mueras Highlands, and south toward the approaches to Grimreach. The elevation creates the dryness—moisture from the sea rarely reaches this far—and the constant wind strips what little water remains.

### The Wind

The plateau's namesake wind blows from the northeast, funneled between the Mueras Highlands and the distant Eronia Range. It carries fine dust from the plateau surface—a reddish powder that gets into everything: clothes, food, lungs, eyes. Veteran plateau travelers wrap their faces and accept the grit as part of the journey.

The wind never stops. Even on calm days by coastal standards, the plateau wind persists. During storms, it can strip flesh from exposed skin, sandblast wood, and overturn laden carts. The storms are rare but deadly, and experienced guides watch the horizon constantly for the telltale red clouds.

Locals claim the dust carries whispers—fragments of voice from the dead of Kaspion, carried by the wind from the cursed city. Scholars attribute the sounds to wind through rock formations, the acoustic tricks of a landscape carved by erosion. Both explanations have merit. This is Mueras; the mundane and the supernatural coexist.

### Crossing the Plateau

Three main routes cross the Dustwind:

**The Northern Track**: From the Hammer Coast settlements to the Tarns, skirting the edge of the Mueras Highlands. The shortest crossing, but also the roughest—the track climbs through broken terrain where flash floods cut sudden gullies. House Hammren maintains way stations along this route.

**The Central Road**: From Bazz and the Labyrinth Sound ports to the Taflex Forest edge. The most-traveled route, used by timber merchants and those seeking the Yngli trade. Way stations are more frequent here, though still a day's travel apart.

**The Southern Passage**: From the Beak of Mueras toward Grimreach and the Darkened Coast trade. The least-traveled route, used mainly by those whose business involves shadow-touched goods. House Yoros maintains this road, such as it is.

All three routes require preparation. Water sources are rare and unreliable—springs that flow one season may be dry the next. Guides who know the current conditions are essential, and the merchant-kings charge for their services. The pilot-guild model extends even here: those who know the way control the passage.

### Way Stations

Scattered across the plateau, way stations provide the only shelter between settlements. Most are simple affairs: stone walls, a roof, a cistern to catch what rain falls, and pens for pack animals. Some are maintained by merchant-king houses as part of their caravan operations; others are independent, charging travelers for water, fodder, and protection from the elements.

The way stations have their own culture, distinct from either coast or forest. The people who run them are a tough, independent breed, willing to live in isolation for the freedom it provides. They answer to no merchant-king directly, though they maintain working relationships with whoever controls their route. A way station keeper who makes enemies of a major house won't stay in business long.

### The Highland Commons

Where the plateau meets the Mueras Highlands, the terrain rises into rocky hills with thin soil and sparse vegetation. This is "the commons"—the one part of Mueras no merchant-king has claimed. Yngli herding communities maintain small flocks of hardy goats here, and a few mining operations extract iron and copper from shallow deposits.

The commons folk are poor by coastal standards but free in ways the city-dwellers aren't. They owe no harbor fees, swear no pilot oaths, and answer to no house. When the merchant-kings need expendable muscle—raiders to harass rival caravans, soldiers for operations too dirty for house troops—they recruit from the commons. The pay is good; the survival rate is not.

### Plateau Wildlife

Life on the Dustwind is sparse but persistent. Hardy scrub vegetation clings to ravines where water occasionally collects. Reptiles dominate—lizards, snakes, and the occasional dust drake, a smaller cousin of true dragons that has adapted to the arid environment. Dust drakes are dangerous but valuable; their scales are used in alchemical preparations, and a live one can fetch a fortune in Bazz.

Larger predators are rare but present. Something hunts the plateau's edges—tracks suggest a large cat, but sightings are inconsistent. The locals call it the "dustwalker" and give offerings at certain rock formations to appease it. Whether it's a natural animal, something supernatural, or simply legend is unclear.

### The Dead Winds

Certain areas of the plateau are avoided even by experienced guides. These "dead wind" zones are places where the constant wind doesn't reach—sheltered valleys or canyon systems where the air sits still and heavy. The stillness is unsettling after the constant motion elsewhere, but that's not why they're avoided.

The dead wind zones are haunted. Not by ghosts in the Kaspion sense—the dead of the plateau don't walk. But the silence has weight, and travelers who camp in dead wind zones report nightmares, strange sounds, and the sense of being watched. Some don't wake at all.

Scholars theorize the dead wind zones are places where Kasper's curse settled most heavily—where the spiritual damage from his mass death collected like water in low ground. Others suggest older causes, pre-dating Kasper by centuries. The plateau has been harsh country for longer than humans have recorded history.

### The Dust Trade

One unlikely industry thrives on the plateau: dust collection. The reddish dust that coats everything has alchemical properties—used properly, it enhances fire magic and serves as a component in various preparations. House Velani maintains dust-collection operations at several points on the plateau, harvesting the wind's leavings and shipping them to markets across Alaria.

The collectors are an odd bunch, even by plateau standards. They work alone, tending collection screens and storage vessels, rarely seeing another person for weeks at a time. The isolation drives some mad. Others find peace in it. Either way, the dust keeps flowing to market, and House Velani keeps paying.
