## Atriik

Tags: region, state, nation

A confederation of four city-states in southwestern Westrim, wedged between the Milras Forest to the north, the Dunes of Kunagi to the east, the Bloodlands and Ishnit Jungles to the south, and Shark Bay to the west. Atriik is not a unified nation but a loose alliance of Kor and Sharabha monarchies bound by shared culture, mutual defense, and elaborate courtesy that masks constant low-grade political maneuvering.

The land here transitions from the deep forests of the north through savanna and scrubland into the contested Bloodlands bordering Naruaghin territory. Four major rivers—the Sha Puniki, Sha Ulokoni, Sha Kariki, and Sha Sonisst—drain from the forests toward the desert's edge, providing the water that makes settlement possible.

### Geography

**Northern Boundary**: The Milras Forest, a dense old-growth woodland extending to the Wyrm Teeth hills. The forest contains Milreun Palace, an ancient time-distorting ruin.

**Eastern Boundary**: The Kunagi Hills, a transitional zone of scrub-covered ridges that give way to the Dunes of Kunagi proper. This is desert-margin territory—dry but not yet lifeless.

**Southern Boundary**: The Bloodlands, a scarred buffer zone where Atriik's settled lands give way to Naruaghin raiding territory. Beyond lies the Ishnit Jungles.

**Western Boundary**: Shark Bay and the coastal forests (Sprenwood). The bay provides Atriik's only maritime access, though the Kendor sea-people of Watalina control the deeper waters.

**Central Terrain**: Savanna-woodland mosaic, with scattered trees and tall grasses between the major forests. Good hunting territory; the source of Atriik's fur trade.

### The City-States

#### Lupuno

The northwestern city-state, built where the Sha Puniki emerges from the Milras Forest. Lupuno controls the timber trade from the forest edge and the river traffic heading south. The Kor monarchy here has the closest ties to Kura and the northern states.

**Population**: ~18,000

#### Byonowidi

The western city-state and Atriik's only Sharabha monarchy. Located on the Sha Ulokoni near the edge of Sprenwood, Byonowidi is the confederation's fur-trading heart. Sharabha cavalry from Byonowidi are renowned across Westrim.

**Population**: ~20,000

The Sharabha royal family chafes at being the odd kingdom out—three Kor monarchies united by race against one Sharabha, despite identical cultural values. Political marriages between the houses have done little to ease this tension.

#### Shinii

The eastern city-state, positioned on the Kunagi Hills' western edge as the gateway to desert trade. Shinii handles the caravans coming west from the Dunes of Kunagi, exchanging Atriik's furs and timber for glass, spices, and goods from across the desert.

**Population**: ~15,000

#### Wykakas

The southernmost city-state, built on the Sha Sonisst as Atriik's first line of defense against Naruaghin incursions from the Bloodlands. Wykakas is more militarized than its sister cities—less courtly polish, more practical vigilance.

**Population**: ~12,000

### Mykala

At the center of Atriik stands Mykala—a ruined fortress built at the base of the largest tree in all of Alaria. The tree's canopy stretches thirty miles in diameter; its trunk measures two miles across. In its shade, the fortress was constructed in an age now forgotten.

Mykala is sacred to all four city-states. Pilgrimages here are common, and the site's neutrality is the one thing all four monarchies agree on. Currently, a druid maintains the grove and accepts pilgrims. An Elnor has arrived with intentions to claim the site, and the resulting standoff threatens the religious stability of the entire confederation.

### The Rivers

Atriik's four rivers all bear the prefix "Sha" (meaning "river" or "waters" in the local tongue):

- **Sha Puniki**: Flows from Milras Forest past Lupuno toward the eastern scrublands
- **Sha Ulokoni**: Flows through Sprenwood past Byonowidi
- **Sha Kariki**: Central river through Fatiik Forest
- **Sha Sonisst**: Southern river through Wykakas, reaching the Bloodlands

### Sandskull

East of the settled lands, where the Kunagi Hills meet the desert proper, stand the ruins of Sandskull—a fortress or temple of unknown origin, half-buried in drifting sand. The skull-shaped rock formation that gives it its name is visible for miles across the flat terrain.

Sandskull predates Atriik's founding. Local legends connect it to the wyrm-keepers who once controlled the giant sand wurms of the Kunagi, though the ruins show no obvious connection to Urk Noulgas in the Wyrm Teeth. Treasure hunters occasionally make the journey; fewer return than set out.

### Culture

The Kor and Sharabha of Atriik share a culture of elaborate courtesy, formal speech, and social hierarchy. Direct confrontation is avoided; indirect implication is the weapon of choice. Political disputes play out through carefully worded letters, deliberate scheduling of meetings, and the studied application of hospitality or its absence.

Outsiders find this exhausting. Atriik nobles consider directness barbaric.
