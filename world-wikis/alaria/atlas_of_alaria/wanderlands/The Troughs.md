## The Troughs

Tags: canyons, geography, tidal, dangerous, treasure

A network of deep gorges cutting through the western Wanderlands peninsula, connecting to the sea and flooding violently with each high tide.

### Tidal Gorges

The Troughs are narrow canyons—some barely twenty feet wide, others spanning a hundred—carved into the peninsula's rocky western edge. At low tide, they're explorable: winding stone corridors with exposed cave systems, tidal pools, and whatever the South Sea has deposited over centuries. At high tide, they become death traps. Walls of seawater rush through the narrow channels with enough force to pulverize anything caught inside.

The tide tables are life-or-death knowledge here. Experienced scavengers carry watermarked staffs showing safe depths, and they *never* venture deeper than a six-hour round trip allows. The unwary have roughly fifteen minutes between "water's rising" and "water's here."

### What the Sea Brings In

The Troughs act as a natural filter for everything the South Sea carries: shipwrecks break apart on the rocky approaches and their cargo washes into the gorges. Flotsam from a thousand vessels accumulates in the deeper chambers—trade goods, weapons, coin, and occasionally things better left on the ocean floor.

The most valuable finds come from the **bone caves**: chambers too deep for casual exploration, accessible only during the lowest tides of the year. These caves contain the compressed remains of everything the Troughs have swallowed over millennia. Treasure hunters who've braved them report finding artifacts from civilizations that predate current maps.

Of course, some things wash in alive. Or close enough.

### The Rhythm of Scavenging

A loose community of scavengers works the Troughs during safe seasons—mostly halflings comfortable with tight spaces and quick escapes, plus the occasional desperate fortune-seeker. They've developed informal rules:

- **Claim stakes** mark active salvage. Violating another's stake invites violence.
- **High chambers** (above the tide line) are communal territory for rest and trade.
- **Storm warnings** are shared freely. Even rivals want witnesses to their deaths.
- **The deep caves** are first-come, first-served. If you can reach them before the tide turns, whatever you find is yours—assuming you make it back.

### What It Looks Like

Wet stone in a hundred shades of gray and green, slick with algae below the tide line. The walls are carved smooth by millennia of rushing water, occasionally broken by sharp edges where recent storms have cracked new fissures. Pools collect in every depression, some shallow and warm, others deep and cold and home to things that don't surface. The air smells of salt, rot, and ozone. Sound carries strangely—a whisper at one end of a gorge might echo clearly a quarter mile away.

When the tide comes, you hear it before you see it: a building roar that reverberates through the stone, followed by a wind that tastes like the ocean's breath. Then the water.

### For Adventurers

The Troughs offer:

- **Treasure hunting** with genuine time pressure and environmental danger
- **Tidal mechanics** that reward preparation and punish overconfidence
- **Creatures** that wash in from the South Sea—or that have made the flooded caves their home
- **Access routes** to deeper cave systems that may connect to other underground locations
- **A scavenger community** with its own politics, rivalries, and information to trade
