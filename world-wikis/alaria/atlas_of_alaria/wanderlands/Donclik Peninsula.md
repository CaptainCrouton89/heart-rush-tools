## Donclik Peninsula

Tags: peninsula, geography, cursed, dangerous

A windswept finger of land extending north into Donclik Sound, notable primarily for being uninhabitable. The peninsula and surrounding waters are afflicted by Donclik's Curse—a supernatural compulsion that draws anyone who stays too long into the sea.

### Geography

The peninsula stretches roughly sixty miles from the mainland, narrowing from a broad base to a rocky point. The terrain is mostly moorland and low hills—the Argum Hills occupy the eastern bulge where the peninsula is widest. The coastline is rocky and treacherous, with few natural harbors.

Grendel Inlet separates the peninsula from the mainland to the east, cutting south from Donclik Sound into the heart of the Wanderlands. The inlet is shallow and choked with sandbars, useless for serious navigation.

### Donclik's Curse

Three centuries ago, the pirate queen Serisa ruled these waters through a bargain with a kraken-matriarch of the South Sea. When her heir broke that bargain, the dying creature cursed the entire peninsula.

**The Call:** After two or three days on the peninsula, you begin to hear the sea. Not the normal sound of waves—a voice, just below hearing, pulling at your attention. After a week, the pull becomes physical. You find yourself walking toward the water without deciding to. After a month, most people stop resisting. They walk into Donclik Sound and don't come back.

**The Mechanism:** The curse is carried in the water itself. The kraken-matriarch's dying essence seeped into Donclik Sound, and anything that drinks from it, eats fish from it, or simply breathes the salt air long enough becomes marked. The mark draws you toward the water. The sea wants what it was promised.

### What the Curse Means

- **Short visits are safe.** Treasure hunters and explorers can work the peninsula if they're disciplined about timing. Three days is the rule of thumb. Five days if you're lucky. A week is pushing it.
- **Permanent settlement is impossible.** Every attempt has ended the same way: a thriving community that slowly, inexorably walks into the sea. The ruins of fishing villages dot the coastline—structures perfectly intact, no signs of violence, just empty.
- **The curse can be resisted** with enough willpower, but it never stops. The few people who've lived on the peninsula for extended periods describe it as a constant pressure—like being thirsty and standing next to a well you can't drink from.

### Breaking the Curse

The original contract between Serisa and the kraken-matriarch still exists, somewhere in the flooded lower levels of Serisa's Palace on the northern islands. Scholars believe the bargain can be fulfilled, renegotiated, or formally nullified—but doing any of those requires reaching the palace, dealing with whatever still lives there, and reading a language no living person understands.

### What It Looks Like

Empty moorland under gray skies. The grass is coarse and salt-resistant, bending constantly in the wind off Donclik Sound. Rocky outcrops break the monotony, worn smooth by centuries of weather. The coastline is all cliffs and jagged rocks—no beaches, no gentle approaches, just stone meeting water in a constant collision of spray.

The abandoned villages are the worst part. Houses still standing, doors still on hinges, possessions still inside. Meals left half-eaten on tables. Children's toys in yards. Everything waiting for people who walked into the sea and never came back.

The air tastes like salt. Always. Even miles inland, you can taste the sea.

### For Adventurers

Donclik Peninsula offers:

- **A ticking clock** on every expedition—stay too long and you join the drowned
- **Abandoned settlements** with whatever their inhabitants left behind
- **The Troughs** on the western edge, where tidal gorges offer treasure and danger
- **Serisa's Palace** on the northern islands, if you're brave or foolish enough
- **A curse to break**, if you can find the contract and figure out how to use it
