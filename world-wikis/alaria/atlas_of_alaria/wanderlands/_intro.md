### Geography

The Wanderlands is a diverse region characterized by rolling plains, scattered forests, and rugged hill country. The area encompasses the mystical Dragonsong region with its ancient forests, the pastoral meadows of Grendenheim, the windswept Donclik Peninsula, and various hill ranges and moorlands. The Troughs cut deep canyons through the landscape, while marshes like Krinea Mikea dot the lowlands.
