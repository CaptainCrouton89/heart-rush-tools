## Gray Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A low range of hills in central Grendenheim, marking the transition between the open meadowlands and the Dragonsong forest to the east.

### Geography

The Gray Hills rise gradually from the Grendenheim plains, reaching modest heights before descending toward the Kelfretes Lake basin. They're not particularly tall or dramatic—more a rumpled rise in the landscape than true mountains. The hills get their name from the exposed granite that breaks through the thin soil on the higher slopes.

### Character

Unlike the cursed Donclik Peninsula or the dragon-haunted Dragonsong, the Gray Hills are simply... empty. The soil is poor, the wind constant, and there's nothing here worth settling for. The Wispen halflings who wander Grendenheim occasionally pass through, but they don't linger.

The hills offer good sightlines in all directions—useful for spotting trouble before it spots you. From the higher ridges, you can see the dark line of Dragonsong to the east, the glint of Kelfretes Lake to the northeast, and the open sweep of Grendenheim to the west and south.

### What It Looks Like

Rounded hills covered in coarse grass, broken by gray granite outcrops. Wind-twisted shrubs grow in the sheltered spots between rocks. The soil is thin and rocky—not the kind of land anyone would farm even if settlement were possible here. In spring, wildflowers briefly color the slopes. The rest of the year, everything is gray and green and the brown of dead grass.
