## Serisa's Palace

Tags: ruins, dungeon, cursed, naval, kraken

The crumbling fortress of a pirate queen who made a bargain with the deep—and whose heir broke it.

### The Pirate Queen

Serisa was a naval warlord who controlled Donclik Sound three centuries ago. Her fleet dominated the waters between Aboyinzu and the South Sea, extracting tribute from every ship that passed. She built her palace on the northern islands to watch the sea lanes and to be close to the source of her power.

That source wasn't her ships. It was something in the deep water.

### The Bargain

Serisa made a deal with a **kraken-matriarch**—one of the great cephalopods that rule the abyssal trenches of the South Sea. The creature's spawn would wreck any ship Serisa marked for destruction, and in exchange, Serisa would deliver a tithe: one in ten of every crew her fleet captured, thrown living into the deep.

For decades, this arrangement made her untouchable. Rivals who challenged her found their fleets dragged under by things they couldn't fight. Serisa grew wealthy, powerful, and feared across the southern seas.

### The Breaking

Serisa grew old and her heir refused to continue the tithe. When Serisa died, her daughter Mariselle tried to renegotiate—offering gold, offering ships, offering anything but living flesh. The kraken-matriarch didn't negotiate.

It pulled the palace into the sea, killing everyone inside, and laid a curse on the entire peninsula: anyone who stays too long will belong to the deep. This curse—Donclik's Curse—still affects the region today.

### The Ruins

The palace didn't sink completely. The upper levels remain above water on the largest of the northern islands: crumbling towers, collapsed halls, and chambers open to the sky where roofs have fallen in. The architecture is maritime in style—built from sea-weathered stone with motifs of waves, ships, and tentacles worked into every surface.

The lower levels are flooded. Seawater fills the basements, vaults, and dungeons, accessible only to those willing to dive. The kraken-matriarch is long dead—they don't live forever—but her spawn still nest in the submerged chambers. They remember the bargain. They're still waiting for payment.

### What Remains

Serisa's treasury was never recovered:

- **Navigation charts** of the South Sea, including routes to islands that don't appear on modern maps
- **Weapons** designed specifically to fight sea monsters—harpoons, poisons, and stranger things
- **The original contract**—a stone tablet carved in a language that predates human writing, which scholars believe might be the key to breaking Donclik's Curse
- **Mariselle's body**, somewhere in the flooded lower levels, still wearing the crown she inherited and never got to use

### What It Looks Like

The islands are gray stone and black rock, permanently wet from spray and rain. Seabirds nest in every crevice, and their cries echo off the ruins constantly. The palace walls are thick with barnacles below the waterline and streaked with salt above it. Collapsed sections reveal the bones of the structure—massive stone blocks fitted together without mortar, still holding after centuries.

The flooded levels are dark, cold, and silent except for the occasional shift of something large in the water. Bioluminescent algae provides faint light in some chambers. The walls are covered in carvings that become increasingly alien the deeper you go—Serisa's work above, something else's work below.

The air smells like salt, rotting kelp, and something else: a faint musk that experienced sailors recognize as kraken-scent.

### For Adventurers

Serisa's Palace offers:

- **A flooded dungeon** with both above-water and underwater sections
- **Kraken spawn** as guardians—not the matriarch herself, but her children and grandchildren
- **The contract** that might break Donclik's Curse, if anyone can read it
- **Treasure** worth dying for, assuming you can reach it and escape
- **A time limit**—the curse means you can't spend long on the peninsula, so every expedition is a race against the clock
