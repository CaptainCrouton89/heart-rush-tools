## Dragon's Gate

Tags: poi, landmark, dragon, portal

A massive natural stone arch rising from the Sonagrev hills in eastern Dragonsong. The arch spans nearly two hundred feet at its apex and hums with a low, subsonic resonance audible from miles away—the same tone that gives the Dragonsong region its name.

### The Sealed Passage

Local legends claim the first dragon arrived through Dragon's Gate, stepping from somewhere else entirely. The stone itself vibrates at a frequency that sets teeth on edge and makes campfires gutter. Scholars who've studied it from safe distances believe the arch is a dormant portal—a doorway to somewhere that has been sealed for millennia.

Whatever passage it once offered is closed. But it still hums. Still waits.

### Ziru's Vigil

The dragon Ziru considers Dragon's Gate sacred and destroys anyone who approaches without her explicit permission. The Sonagrev hills surrounding the arch are littered with the bones of the curious—hence the name, which translates loosely to "song-graves" in Old Aboyinzan.

But Ziru doesn't guard the arch to protect it. She guards it to prevent anything from coming *through*.

Those few who've spoken with Ziru and survived report that she never explains what she's watching for. She simply says the arch "remembers how to open" and leaves the implication hanging.

### What It Looks Like

The arch is weathered gray stone shot through with veins of something darker—not quite obsidian, not quite void. At certain angles, the dark veins seem to shift, forming patterns that almost resolve into meaning before slipping away. The ground beneath the arch is bare stone, scoured clean of vegetation in a perfect circle. Nothing grows there. Nothing rots there. Bones left within the circle remain pristine for centuries.

The hum is constant but not quite rhythmic—it shifts in pitch and intensity seemingly at random, though some scholars insist it follows patterns too long for mortal observation. Standing beneath the arch for extended periods causes headaches, nosebleeds, and a persistent sensation of being watched from behind.

### For Adventurers

Dragon's Gate offers:

- **A mystery** at the heart of draconic presence in the region
- **Ziru as gatekeeper**—she can be negotiated with, but the price is always steep
- **The question** that haunts the brave: what is on the other side, and why does it want to come through?
- **Potential planar connections** for campaigns dealing with portals, other realms, or dragon origins
