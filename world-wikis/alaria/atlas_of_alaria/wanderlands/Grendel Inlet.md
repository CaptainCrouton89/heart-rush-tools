## Grendel Inlet

Tags: inlet, geography, water

A shallow inlet extending south from Donclik Sound, separating the Donclik Peninsula from the Wanderlands mainland. Unlike the strategic straits found elsewhere in Alaria, Grendel Inlet is a dead-end waterway of little practical use.

### Geography

The inlet cuts roughly thirty miles south from Donclik Sound before tapering into marshy shallows near Krinea Mikea. It's flanked by the Donclik Peninsula to the west (with its Argum Hills) and the mainland to the east (where the Karik Hills rise from the coast).

The water is shallow throughout—rarely more than twenty feet deep, and often less. Sandbars shift with the tides, making navigation hazardous for anything larger than a rowboat. The bottom is silty and treacherous, prone to trapping anchors and hulls alike.

### Why It Doesn't Matter

In theory, an inlet connecting the sound to the interior could be valuable. In practice, Grendel Inlet offers nothing:

- **No through-passage.** It's a dead end, not a strait. Ships that enter must turn around and leave the same way.
- **No deep water.** The shallows prevent any serious maritime traffic.
- **Cursed waters.** Like the rest of Donclik Sound, the inlet carries the curse. Extended exposure marks you.
- **Nothing at the far end.** The inlet terminates in the marshes of Krinea Mikea—no ports, no settlements, no reason to go there.

Occasionally, ships fleeing storms or pursuit duck into the inlet seeking shelter. Most regret it. The shallow water offers poor anchorage, and every hour spent waiting is an hour closer to hearing the call.

### What It Looks Like

Murky water between low, treeless shores. The coastline is a mix of rocky outcrops and mudflats, depending on the tide. Reeds and salt-grass grow along the waterline. The Karik Hills rise to the east, bare and wind-scoured. The Argum Hills are visible to the west across the water, equally bleak.

The inlet is quiet. No fishing boats work these waters. No settlements dot the shore. Just empty coastline and the constant sound of wind and waves.
