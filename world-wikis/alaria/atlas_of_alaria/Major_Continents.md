## Major Continents of Alaria

Tags: geography, overview

Alaria comprises several major landmasses, each with distinct regions, cultures, and challenges.

### Ve

The isolated eastern continent, separated from the rest of Alaria by the vast Alrock Ocean. Ve divides into a drier northern half of savannah, plains, and desert, and a heavily jungled southern half. The Widebarrow Mountains run diagonally from southwest to northeast, bisecting the continent. Major states include Japan-inspired Shyona in the northeast, Chimea controlling the Suki Jungle in the southwest, and the grassland kingdom of Avalon in the west. The southern jungles—the Krell Lands and Dygon Beast Lands—remain largely wild.

**Regions:**
- [Ve](ve/_intro.md) — The main continental landmass
- [Alrock Ocean](alrock_ocean/_intro.md) — The vast western ocean with underwater civilizations

### Upoceax

A vast continent spanning from frozen polar wastes in the south to scorching desert at the northern coast. Upoceax is defined by extremes: the icy cliffs of Venalthier in the southwest, the colossal forests of Wycendeula across the south, the hilly Giant Lands in the center, and the massive Sand Reach desert stretching across the entire northern portion. The Sand Reach Mountains divide the desert from the southern regions, while the Kelder Mountains run north-south along the western interior. The Farlands occupy the western coast with three ancient Elven Kingdoms, and the Seacleft Coast marks the northwestern edge.

**Regions:**
- [Venalthier](venalthier/_intro.md) — Frozen polar region in the extreme southwest
- [Wycendeula](wycendeula/_intro.md) — Vast southern forests, plains, and tundra
- [Giant Lands](giant_lands/_intro.md) — Hilly central region inhabited by giants
- [Farlands](farlands/_intro.md) — Western coastal forests and the three Elven Kingdoms
- [Sandreach](sandreach/_intro.md) — Massive northern desert (Mendari and Luquihn)
- [Sandreach Mountains](sandreach_mountains/_intro.md) — Central mountain range south of the desert
- [Seacleft Coast](seacleft_coast/_intro.md) — Northwestern coastal states
- [Free Isles](free_isles/_intro.md) — Trading archipelago east of Sand Reach

### Aboyinzu

The great southwestern continent, shaped like a curved hook or tail extending from the main landmass. Aboyinzu stretches from the temperate states of Terrenia in the northwest down through vast savannas and jungles to the cold, misty Dragon's Spine mountains in the far south. The continent is defined by several major mountain ranges: the Crystal Mountains running SW-NE across the center, the Morygun Mountains connecting them to Dragon's Spine, and the Dalizi Highlands in the east. The inner sea of Deadloop cuts into the continental interior, while the South Sea separates Aboyinzu from the Shacklands to the east.

**Regions:**
- [Terrenia](terrenia/_intro.md) — Northwestern states including Aal Salma, Windor, and Chaal Nazaerox
- [Central Aboyinzu](central_aboyinzu/_intro.md) — Interior savanna and the Deadloop inner sea
- [Wanderlands](wanderlands/_intro.md) — The long southern peninsula reaching into the South Sea
- [Elder Wilds](elder_wilds/_intro.md) — Eastern peninsula of ancient rainforest and rivers
- [Dalizi](dalizi/_intro.md) — Confederation of states west/northwest of Lake Tonactlet Chitle
- [Dalizi Highlands](dalizi/_intro.md) — Mountainous region north/northeast of the lake
- [Dragon's Spine Coast](dragons_spine_coast/_intro.md) — Cold, misty southern mountains extending into the Pindolin Islands
- [Crimson Coast](crimson_coast/_intro.md) — Haunted coastal region south of Dragon's Spine

### Clueanda

The frozen crown of the northwest. Clueanda stretches from the permanent ice of the Nysanna Range in the extreme north down to the temperate shores of the Middle Sea. Two great mountain ranges define its character: the east-west Nysanna Range at the top of the world, and the diagonal Kharvorn Mountains that run from the center-north down to the southeast, meeting at roughly a 120-degree angle. Between them lie the frozen Northlands and the windswept Celedrim Plains. South of the Kharvorn range, the climate warms to support the great trading nations of the Middle Sea coast.

**Regions:**
- [Northlands](northlands/_intro.md) — Arctic tundra south of the Nysanna Range
- [Celedrim Plains](celedrim_plains/_intro.md) — Frozen steppe north of the Kharvorn Mountains
- [Kharvorn Mountains](kharvorn_mountains/_intro.md) — Diagonal range dividing frozen north from temperate south
- [Middle Sea](middle_sea/_intro.md) — Temperate coastal region surrounding the great inland sea
- [Westwilds](westwilds/_intro.md) — Arid scrublands on the southern coast, west of Tarkhon
- [Frostmarch Peninsula](frostmarch_peninsula/_intro.md) — Eastern peninsula linking to the Northern Isles
- [Northern Isles](northern_isles/_intro.md) — Arctic archipelago in the Ocean of Azeros

### Rimihuica

The great central continent, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert in the northwest and vast jungle basins in the interior. Rimihuica stretches from the Tarkhon-controlled strait in the north down through diverse landscapes—arid deserts, deadly jungles, and lawless frontiers—to the slave-trading Shacklands in the south. The Eronia Range separates the northern Tarkhon Empire from the Westrim deserts, while the Cloud Mountains and the Green/Seawatch/Tambrielle range divide the interior Innerrim basin from the coastal Emerald Coast. The Thunder Plains form a central gap between the western Ishnit Jungles and the southeastern territories.

**Regions:**
- [Westrim](westrim/_intro.md) — Arid northwest: Dunes of Kunagi desert and Ishnit Jungles
- [Innerrim](innerrim/_intro.md) — Central jungle basin with multiple competing states
- [Emerald Coast](emerald_coast/_intro.md) — Eastern coastal jungles north of the dividing mountains
- [Shacklands](shacklands/_intro.md) — Southern territories united by the slave trade

### Greenwater Isles

A tropical archipelago lying between Upoceax and Rimihuica, dominated by the great island of Urok at its center. Urok features rainforests in the north, the Pearly Mountains across its middle, and the state of Xoth in the south. Surrounding waters include the Agreben Sea (north, with island states Pelaria, Glador, Flurin, and Crab Island), the Bejeweled Sea (west), the Sea of Spiders (southeast), and the Gulf of Xoth (south). The halfling state of Roule lies south of Urok, while the Dream Jungle-covered island of Movasi sits to the southeast.

### Western Isles

A vast archipelago occupying the waters between Clueanda and Rimihuica, centered on the treacherous Shattered Sea—a chaotic maze of hundreds of tiny islands, atolls, and shoals. The region is bounded by the Stratlan Sea to the west (the edge of the known world), the Iron Sea to the north, and the Sea of Merchants to the east where it meets the Tarkhon Empire. Notable features include the Siren Islands, the volcanic Ember Isles, and independent states like Knova and the Bynu Island Tribes.
