## Bzulakar's Keep

Tags: lair

Atop a tower that stretches 2 miles into the sky stands Bzulakar's Keep—an enormous fortress of permanently frozen ice. And within the tower lives the ancient lich Bzulakar. Ascending the spire is treacherous, due to high winds, extreme temperatures, and sheer cliff. At the base of the spire lives Strolzaq, Bzulakar's pet dragon.
