## Elderran

Tags: city, ruins, magical-disaster, old-tolaria

The ruined capital of Old Tolaria, and the epicenter of one of the most catastrophic magical disasters in Alarian history. What remains is not merely a ruin—it is an ongoing unraveling of reality itself, where time, elements, and the fundamental nature of magic have been torn apart and left bleeding.

### The Apparatus of Severance

The Tolarian mage-kings believed that magic was too entangled. Elemental forces bled into arcane formulae. Divine power contaminated leylines. The Faesong echoed through everything, impossible to isolate or control. They envisioned a world where each magical tradition could be harnessed in its pure form—separated, controlled, perfected.

They built the Apparatus of Severance: a city-spanning machine of crystalline towers, leyline conduits, and planar anchors designed to:

- **Sever the elemental planes** from the Prime, creating stable portals instead of chaotic bleed-through
- **Isolate divine power** from arcane magic, ending what they saw as "contamination" from the gods
- **Cage the Faesong** into specific geographic regions where it could be controlled and harvested
- **Anchor time itself** as a manipulable dimension rather than an immutable constant

The Apparatus required decades to construct and the concentrated magical knowledge of seven generations of mage-kings. When they finally activated it, everything went wrong simultaneously.

### The Unraveling

The Apparatus partially succeeded—which was far worse than total failure.

The elemental planes were partially severed, creating permanent rifts and instabilities across Old Tolaria. The Faesong, compressed and caged, exploded outward from Elderran—where it landed, the Faewoods grew in minutes, ancient and twisted and wrong. Divine channels crossed and tangled, leaving clerics praying to something almost-but-not-quite their gods. And time itself fractured, creating pockets where past, present, and future bleed together.

At the center of it all, the Apparatus continues to run. The mage-kings designed it to be self-sustaining, and now it cannot be turned off without potentially making everything worse. For centuries, it has been slowly, incrementally completing the severance it was built to perform. The magical instability spreading across Alaria may be traced, in part, to Elderran's endless operation.

### Velorax the Unfinished

A young dragon—barely a century old at the time—flew into Elderran at the moment of activation. Velorax was drawn by the magical chaos like a moth to flame. Dragons are inherently tied to multiple magical traditions (elemental, arcane, sometimes divine), and she felt the Apparatus pulling at her very essence.

She is frozen mid-transformation above the central spire. The Apparatus tried to separate her component magics and partially succeeded—distinct bands of elemental fire, arcane formulae, and raw temporal energy spiral around her body, each trying to fly in different directions. She has been like this for centuries, conscious, experiencing every moment of her own unraveling in slow motion.

### Approaching Elderran

The temporal distortions intensify as one approaches the city center:

**At 5 miles**: The ruins appear frozen. Silent. Birds hang motionless in the air. Leaves suspended mid-fall. An oppressive stillness that feels wrong.

**At 1 mile**: Time begins to crawl. Your heartbeat sounds like drums. Each step takes effort. You can watch dust motes drift with glacial slowness.

**At 500 feet**: Time accelerates around you while you move through molasses. Velorax moves. Fire spreads from her jaws. Towers crack and reform. The catastrophe plays out at normal speed while you struggle to take a single step.

**At the center**: Decades pass in seconds. Anyone who reaches the Apparatus experiences the full collapse of Elderran compressed into moments—centuries of destruction, reconstruction by magical automatons, further destruction, reality tearing and healing, all in a cacophony of sensory overload. Those who survive (few do) emerge to find only minutes have passed outside.

### The Regional Fallout

The Unraveling did not stay contained within Elderran's walls:

**The Faewoods**: Created instantly when the caged Faesong exploded outward. These forests are not natural—they are concentrated Faesong given physical form, still humming with magic that doesn't quite fit the world. The trees grow too fast, the animals behave strangely, and the boundaries between the material and fae realms are paper-thin.

**Elemental Rifts**: Scattered across Old Tolaria. Pockets where fire burns without fuel, water flows upward, stone breathes. Some are stable and valuable to those who know how to harvest them. Most are deadly.

**Divine Static**: Clerics within 50 miles of Elderran report their prayers going sideways. Not unanswered, but answered by something almost-but-not-quite their god. The divine channels are crossed, tangled. Some priests have gone mad from the wrongness of it.

**Time Fractures**: Beyond the main distortion zone, smaller fractures exist throughout the region—a grove where it's always twilight, a ruin where yesterday's rain is still falling, a road where travelers sometimes meet themselves coming the other way.

### What Remains

Despite the catastrophe, Elderran was not empty when the Apparatus activated. Thousands lived in the capital. Some died instantly. Some are still dying, trapped in temporal loops. And some—transformed by the magical chaos—have become something else entirely.

Automatons built by the mage-kings still patrol the outer districts, following maintenance routines designed for a city that no longer exists. Elemental creatures, drawn through the rifts, have made the ruins their home. And deep in the time-dilated center, the mage-kings themselves may still be alive—frozen at the moment of their greatest triumph and greatest failure, waiting for someone to either save them or end them.

### Adventure Hooks

- **The Apparatus Must Be Stopped**: Someone has calculated that in another century, the Apparatus will complete its work—and the results will be catastrophic for all of Alaria. But shutting it down requires reaching the center, and reaching the center requires surviving the time dilation.

- **Free Velorax**: The dragon has been conscious for centuries, watching her own destruction in slow motion. She may be grateful to be freed. She may be insane. She may complete her transformation into something terrible. Someone wants to find out.

- **The Mage-Kings' Notes**: The Tolarians understood what they were doing. Their research notes, if recovered, could explain how to undo the damage—or how to replicate the Apparatus elsewhere.

- **Lost in Time**: Someone's ancestor walked into Elderran fifty years ago and never came out. They might still be alive in there, experiencing an endless afternoon. A family wants them back—or at least wants to know what happened.

- **Harvest the Rifts**: The elemental rifts contain pure planar essence, invaluable to certain crafters and mages. The job sounds simple: go in, collect samples, come out. The job is never simple.
