## Casa Eleo

Tags: forest, geography

A forest in the Cloud Mountains, south of Eoga. Casa Eleo occupies a sheltered valley where the harsh mountain climate gives way to unexpected lushness. The forest is known for its unusual stillness—travelers report an eerie quiet, as if the normal sounds of wildlife are muted or absent entirely.
