## Faewoods

Tags: forest, magical, faesong, old-tolaria

A forest in Old Tolaria that should not exist. The Faewoods were not grown—they were created in an instant when the Apparatus of Severance at Elderran attempted to cage the Faesong, and the Faesong exploded outward instead.

### Origin

When the Tolarian mage-kings activated their Apparatus, one of its functions was to compress and contain the Faesong—the ambient magical resonance that connects the material world to the fae realms. They intended to cage it, control it, harvest it at will.

The Faesong did not cooperate.

The compressed energy exploded outward from Elderran in a wave of raw creative force. Where it landed with greatest intensity, forests erupted from bare ground in minutes. Trees that should take centuries to mature burst fully-formed from the soil. Underbrush tangled into being. Animals—or things that looked like animals—appeared from nothing.

The Faewoods are not natural growth. They are concentrated Faesong given physical form, frozen at the moment of creation but still humming with the magic that made them.

### Nature

Walking in the Faewoods is disorienting. The forest feels too dense, too alive, too present. Colors are slightly wrong—greens too vivid, shadows too deep. Sounds echo strangely. The air tastes of lightning and honey.

The trees grow too fast. Cut one down, and saplings will sprout from the stump within hours. Clear a path, and it will be overgrown by morning. The forest actively resists being tamed, not through malevolence but through sheer fecundity—it simply grows faster than anything can be removed.

The boundary between the material world and the fae realms is paper-thin here. Travelers sometimes glimpse things that shouldn't be visible—fae creatures watching from just beyond perception, paths that lead to places that don't exist on any map, clearings that weren't there yesterday and won't be there tomorrow. Some who enter the Faewoods emerge somewhere else entirely. Some don't emerge at all.

### Inhabitants

The Faewoods have attracted beings drawn to concentrated Faesong:

**Fae creatures** of all types consider the woods neutral territory—a place where the rules of their realm bleed into the material world. They are more visible here, more active, more willing to interact with mortals (for good or ill).

**Refugees** from Elderran's fall fled into the growing forest and never left. Their descendants have adapted to the Faewoods, becoming strange and fae-touched themselves. They do not welcome outsiders.

**Hermits, madmen, and seekers** come to the Faewoods looking for fae bargains, magical power, or escape from the world. Most find only death. A few find what they're looking for, which is often worse.

### Sakatia

The ruined village of Sakatia lies somewhere in the Faewoods—a settlement of Old Tolaria that was swallowed when the forest erupted. Its people died or fled, but the buildings remain, slowly being consumed by growth that should not be possible.

### Adventure Hooks

- **Fae Bargain**: Someone made a deal in the Faewoods and now regrets it. Breaking fae contracts is possible but dangerous—and the fae who made the deal won't appreciate interference.

- **The Growing**: The Faewoods have begun expanding again for the first time in centuries. Something has changed—perhaps connected to Elderran, perhaps something else entirely. Villages on the forest's edge are being swallowed.

- **Lost Tolarian Knowledge**: The mage-kings maintained research outposts throughout their territory. One was in the Faewoods, containing notes on the Apparatus's design. Finding it means navigating a forest that doesn't want to be navigated.

- **Harvest Season**: The concentrated Faesong in the woods can be harvested—with the right tools, the right knowledge, and complete disregard for safety. Someone's paying well for Faewoods essence, no questions asked.
