## Nashua

Tags: region, marshland, lizardfolk

Two hundred miles of toxic marshland, tangled jungle, and patient death. Nashua is where invading armies go to disappear. The Ix'Vasyla who rule here have refined defensive warfare into something approaching art—a doctrine of poison, patience, and attrition that has held off both the Gorathi legions and the Strømgodden war-hosts for generations. Every stream hides an ambush. Every clearing is a killing ground. Every step deeper into Nashua is a step closer to a death you won't see coming.

The land itself fights for its people. Toxic fumes rise from stagnant pools. Venomous creatures infest every shadow. The water is undrinkable without treatment. Gorathi soldiers call it "the Poison Country" and speak of comrades who vanished without a trace, entire patrols swallowed by the marshes with nothing left but empty boots. The Ix'Vasyla call it home.

### Overview

Nashua occupies the eastern Inner Rim, a roughly triangular territory bounded by:
- **West**: The Dreske Gemalis range, whose peaks mark the border with the Cloud Mountains
- **Northeast**: The Thunderdark Peaks and Trømgar, home of the Strømgodden dwarves
- **Southwest**: The Deserted Hills and contested borderlands with Gorath
- **East**: A long coastline opening to the eastern seas

The terrain divides into three zones:
1. **The Toxic Marshes**: Central and western Nashua, the heartland—flooded lowlands, mangrove forests, and the ancestral territory of the Ix'Vasyla
2. **The River Corridor**: Eastern Nashua, where the Jiji River and its tributaries support the major settlements
3. **The Southern Scrublands**: Drier, sparser terrain toward the coast—the most vulnerable to Gorathi incursion

At roughly 200 by 300 miles, Nashua is far smaller than its sprawling southern neighbor. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in lethality per square mile.

### The Toxic Marshes

The heart of Nashua is poison.

The central marshlands formed over millennia as mineral-rich waters from the Dreske Gemalis mixed with organic decay in the lowland basins. The result is an ecosystem saturated with natural toxins: arsenic compounds in the soil, sulfurous gases bubbling from stagnant pools, and a food chain where nearly everything has evolved to be venomous, poisonous, or both.

The Ix'Vasyla didn't just adapt to this environment—they weaponized it. Their scales resist toxins that would kill most warm-blooded creatures within hours. They know which pools are merely unpleasant and which will dissolve flesh. They've cultivated the deadliest plants and bred the most venomous serpents. To invade the marshes is to fight not just the Ix'Vasyla but the land itself.

The marshes are navigable only by those who know them. Channels wind between islands of semi-solid ground, but the routes change with seasons and floods. The Ix'Vasyla travel by shallow-draft boats, by vine-rope bridges hidden in the canopy, or simply by swimming through waters that would poison their enemies. Outsiders who try to follow find their boats dissolving, their guides dead, and the way back vanished.

### The River Corridor

Along the eastern edge of Nashua, where the toxic marshes give way to cleaner watershed, settlements cluster along the rivers. This is the closest thing Nashua has to civilized territory—"civilized" meaning "only moderately lethal to outsiders."

The **Jiji River** is the primary artery, flowing south from the highlands before curving east toward the coast. Major settlements line its banks, each positioned to control river traffic and defend against incursion. The **Torin Creek** branches west, providing access to the deeper marsh territories.

The river towns are where Nashua interfaces with the outside world. Trade happens here—carefully controlled, closely watched. Foreign merchants are permitted in designated areas of certain towns, never deeper. Those who try to venture beyond the permitted zones discover why Nashua's borders are so effectively closed.

### The Southern Scrublands

South of the marshes and river settlements, the terrain transitions to drier scrubland and sparse forest. This is Nashua's most vulnerable flank—the terrain that Gorath could actually fight in, if they could reach it.

The scrublands are contested ground. Gorathi patrols probe north; Ix'Vasyla raiders strike south. Neither side holds territory permanently. The few settlements here are fortified positions rather than true towns, their populations as much garrison as civilian.

The coastline offers little refuge. Rocky shores, treacherous currents, and the Ix'Vasyla's small but vicious navy make amphibious assault impractical. The offshore islands—visible from the coast but rarely visited by outsiders—reportedly serve as Ix'Vasyla naval bases, though no foreign ship has confirmed this and returned.

### Major Settlements

Nashua's population concentrates in the river corridor, with settlements positioned for defense, trade, and control of water routes.

#### Tirexonos

The capital, such as it is. Tirexonos sprawls across a cluster of islands where the Jiji River splits into multiple channels, its buildings raised on stilts above the floodwaters. This is the seat of whatever passes for central government in Nashua—the Council of Fang and Scale, where clan leaders gather to coordinate the endless war.

The city's architecture is distinctive: curving walls that echo serpentine movement, buildings that seem to grow organically from the terrain, and a maze-like layout that would trap invaders in killing zones. The central island holds the Temple of the Hunt, where the greatest Ix'Vasyla warriors are honored and where prisoners of particular importance are... processed.

Foreign visitors are rare but not unknown. Tirexonos maintains a small quarter for diplomats and merchants, heavily watched and easily isolated. The message is clear: you are here on sufferance.

#### Vosx

The second city, positioned where the Jiji River approaches the coast. Vosx handles most of Nashua's limited foreign trade—the exports of marsh-harvested alchemical ingredients, rare venoms, and the occasional ransom negotiation for captured enemies.

Vosx is also the center of the **Arcane Consortium of Nashua**, a scholarly institution that has somehow maintained academic pursuits despite the constant warfare. The Consortium studies the marshes' unique properties, develops new applications for local toxins, and maintains the only significant library in the region. They once placed a 50,000 gold bounty on information about Yegnoth—a planar anomaly in Gorathi territory—that remains unclaimed after two hundred years.

#### The River Towns

Between Tirexonos and Vosx, smaller settlements dot the Jiji and its tributaries:

**Hyobinii**: Northern town, positioned where highland streams join the main river. Guards the approaches from Trømgar.

**Sipokno**: A fortified position controlling a narrow point in the river. Any force moving by water must pass under Sipokno's watchful eyes—and its poison-dart batteries.

**Dolno Jelovce**: Market town serving the surrounding marsh territories. The largest concentration of Sylthik in Nashua, who maintain their own quarter and temple.

**Nikolici**: Fishing and river-transport hub. The boats built here are designed specifically for marsh navigation—shallow draft, easily hidden, and treated with compounds that resist the toxic waters.

**Poyux**: Southern river town, the last major settlement before the scrublands. Heavily militarized; this is where forces gather for raids into Gorath.

**Kisava, Lukshax**: Twin towns bracketing a river junction. Function as a defensive pair, each covering the other's approaches.

**Sviniste**: Western outpost at the edge of the deep marshes. The last "civilized" settlement before the true toxic heartland. Serves as staging point for clan warriors heading to the interior.

### The Peoples

#### Ix'Vasyla (Dominant)

The black-scaled assassin-hunters rule Nashua. Their society has been shaped by generations of constant warfare into something lean, deadly, and deeply paranoid.

Ix'Vasyla culture values patience, cunning, and the kill. Their leaders are chosen not for strength but for tactical brilliance—the ability to outmaneuver enemies, to turn disadvantages into ambushes, to make every Gorathi advance cost more than it gains. The most respected warriors are not those with the most kills but those with the best efficiency: enemies eliminated per warrior lost.

Their venomous bite defines their military doctrine. Strike from hiding, deliver the poison, retreat. Let the venom work. Return to finish what's left. No glory in single combat, no honor in fair fights—only results. Gorathi soldiers have learned to fear any wound, however minor, knowing the Ix'Vasyla venom brings days of agony before death.

The Ix'Vasyla organize into clans, each controlling territory within the marshes. Clan loyalty is paramount, but the clans unite against external threats with surprising cohesion. The endless war has taught them that internal conflict is a luxury they cannot afford.

#### Sylthik (Minority)

The serpent-folk maintain a presence in Nashua, primarily in Dolno Jelovce and scattered settlements near the coast. Their relationship with the Ix'Vasyla is complicated—both peoples are scaled, both worship entities connected to serpents, and both share an instinctive understanding that the warm-blooded races are fundamentally different from themselves.

But the Sylthik's religious supremacism sits uneasily alongside Ix'Vasyla pragmatism. The Ix'Vasyla value results; the Sylthik value doctrine. The Ix'Vasyla respect cunning enemies; the Sylthik consider all non-Sylthik to be inferior vermin. Tensions exist beneath the surface cooperation.

The Sylthik primarily occupy religious and scholarly roles—their connection to serpents makes them valuable in certain rituals, and their literacy tradition has contributed to institutions like the Arcane Consortium. They are tolerated, even valued, but they will never rule in Nashua.

#### Humans (Integrated)

The Slavic-influenced names of many settlements reveal Nashua's history: before the Ix'Vasyla consolidated control, human communities dotted the river corridor. Some were destroyed. Some fled. But many were... absorbed.

Humans in Nashua occupy a subordinate but not enslaved position. They serve as craftspeople, traders, translators, and occasionally soldiers in auxiliary roles. They've developed their own traditions for surviving among the lizardfolk—knowing when to show throat, understanding the subtle cues of Ix'Vasyla body language, and never, ever making eye contact with a hunting party.

These river-humans have their own identity, distinct from both their warm-blooded kin elsewhere and their scaled overlords. They speak a creole mixing human tongues with Ix'Vasyla hisses. They've adopted some lizardfolk customs while maintaining others of their own. They're survivors, pragmatic about their circumstances, and often more useful to the Ix'Vasyla alive than dead.

### Rivers and Waterways

#### Jiji River

The lifeline of Nashua. The Jiji rises in the Dreske Gemalis foothills, gathers tributaries from the marshlands, and flows southeast to the coast. It's navigable for most of its length, though hazards abound—rapids in the upper reaches, toxic side-channels in the middle stretch, and heavily defended checkpoints throughout.

Control of the Jiji means control of Nashua. Every major settlement sits on its banks or those of its tributaries. Every military campaign involves river access. The Ix'Vasyla maintain a fleet of war-boats—fast, shallow-draft vessels crewed by warriors who can fight on water or dive beneath it.

#### Torin Creek

A major tributary entering the Jiji from the west, Torin Creek provides access to the deep marsh territories. The upper reaches are navigable only by small craft and only by those who know the channels. This is where the most toxic, most dangerous, most Ix'Vasyla-controlled territory lies.

Invaders who push up Torin Creek don't come back. The marshes simply swallow them.

### The Wars

Nashua fights on two fronts, and has for generations.

#### The Gorath Front (Southwest)

The Deserted Hills mark the contested border between Nashua and Gorath. Gorathi legions have tried repeatedly to push through, and repeatedly failed. Not through lack of trying—Gorath has committed significant forces to the Nashua campaign. But the terrain shifts from Gorathi jungle to Nashuan marsh, and the Ix'Vasyla's defensive doctrine is perfectly suited to attrition warfare.

Gorathi soldiers die to poison, to ambush, to disease, to the marshes themselves. Supply lines stretch impossibly thin. Reinforcements arrive sick and demoralized. The Ix'Vasyla never give battle when they can give plague. The front has barely moved in decades.

The Gorathi call it a "bleeding wound." The Ix'Vasyla call it victory.

#### The Trømgar Front (Northeast)

The Strømgodden dwarves of Trømgar are a different problem. They don't invade the marshes—they can't, really, given their physiological unsuitability for waterlogged terrain. Instead, they raid the highland approaches, strike at Nashua's northern settlements, and maintain constant pressure along the mountain passes.

The Ix'Vasyla respond with their own raids into Trømgar territory. Neither side can deliver a decisive blow. The dwarves are too fortified in their mountains; the lizardfolk too entrenched in their marshes. The conflict has become almost ritualized—seasonal campaigns, predictable targets, casualties that both sides consider acceptable.

Some in both nations have suggested peace. Neither side's culture permits it.

### For Adventurers

Nashua offers grim opportunities:

**Against Gorath**: Anyone willing to fight the slave-empire will find allies here, though the Ix'Vasyla's definition of "ally" may differ from expectations. They'll use you; the question is whether you can use them back.

**The Arcane Consortium**: Scholars interested in toxicology, planar phenomena, or unusual magical applications may find patrons in Vosx. The Consortium pays well for information and specimens—and asks few questions about how they were obtained.

**The Marshes**: The toxic heartland contains ruins older than the Ix'Vasyla, remnants of civilizations that flourished and died in the poison country. What they left behind is unknown, because almost no one has reached those ruins and returned.

**Escape Routes**: Nashua's hostility to Gorath makes it a theoretical refuge for escaped slaves. In practice, surviving the crossing from Gorathi territory to Nashuan protection is nearly impossible—but "nearly" isn't "completely."

The Ix'Vasyla don't trust outsiders. They've learned, through centuries of war, that trust is a vulnerability. But they're pragmatic enough to use tools that present themselves. Whether you can remain a tool rather than becoming a victim is up to you.
