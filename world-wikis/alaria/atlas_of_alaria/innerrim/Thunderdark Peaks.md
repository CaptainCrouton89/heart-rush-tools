## Thunderdark Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography

A rugged mountain range in the eastern Inner Rim, home to the Strømgodden dwarves of Trømgar. The peaks are named for the violent thunderstorms that gather around them with eerie regularity—lightning flashes illuminate the dark granite ridges, and thunder echoes through the valleys like the war-drums of ancient gods.

### Character

The Thunderdark Peaks are not Alaria's highest mountains, but they're among the most defensible. Sharp granite ridges, narrow passes, and deep gorges create natural chokepoints that channel any invading force into killing grounds. The Strømgodden have fortified these positions over generations, making the range essentially impregnable.

The peaks are rich in iron, copper, and the rare alloys that the Strømgodden use in their famous spiked armor. Mining operations have honeycombed the mountains, creating an extensive tunnel network that connects the fortress-cities underground and provides alternate routes when surface travel is blocked.

### The Storms

The storms that give the range its name are both natural and something more. The peaks' elevation and position create atmospheric conditions that generate thunderstorms with unusual frequency—but the Strømgodden believe the gods of war send these storms as blessing and test.

Lightning strikes are common. The dwarves have learned to work with this, positioning metal structures to attract strikes toward defensive positions and away from settlements. Some Strømgodden warriors, called Storm-Riders, specifically train to fight during thunderstorms, using the chaos and lightning as tactical advantages.

### Major Features

**Central Spine**: The highest peaks, running roughly north-south through the heart of the range. Levke, the capital, is carved into these mountains.

**Southern Foothills**: Where the peaks descend toward the Nashua marshlands. Kavnendal guards this approach; beyond lies contested territory.

**Eastern Slopes**: Descending toward the Duskwood Forest and eventually the coast. The terrain transitions from bare rock to forested hills before meeting the Croaking Briars.

**Northern Highlands**: Rising toward colder regions, with Traut as the northernmost settlement.

### The Tunnel Network

Beneath the surface, the Thunderdark Peaks contain hundreds of miles of tunnels—mines, passages connecting fortress-cities, defensive positions, and older excavations whose origins predate Strømgodden settlement.

The dwarves maintain and patrol the upper tunnels, but the deepest levels are sealed. Something lives down there, in passages that connect to places no map shows. The Strømgodden have lost expeditions to those depths and learned to leave certain doors closed.

### Wildlife

Mountain goats, snow bears, cliff-nesting raptors, and hardy mountain predators inhabit the peaks. Most avoid the fortress-cities; those that don't become training targets for young warriors.

The upper peaks host creatures found nowhere else—things adapted to the thin air, the lightning, and the cold. The Strømgodden hunt these beasts as tests of courage, and their pelts and bones are valued craft materials.
