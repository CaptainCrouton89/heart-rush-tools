## Zetl Heski Voth

"The Lake of First Breath" in the giant tongue. A geothermally-heated lake in the eastern basin of Giants Cradle where giant tradition holds the first of their kind emerged from the earth.

### Geography

Zetl Heski Voth is fed by geothermal springs that keep its waters warm year-round, steaming in the cold mountain air of Giants Cradle. The lake is roughly oval, perhaps three miles across at its widest point, with a depth that varies significantly—shallow near the shores but dropping sharply toward the center where the thermal vents lie.

The water is clear but tinged slightly mineral-blue from dissolved minerals. It smells faintly of sulfur, though not unpleasantly so. The lake bottom is visible in the shallows, revealing smooth stones and the occasional glint of offerings left by pilgrims.

The shores are lined with smooth, heat-polished stones and low-growing vegetation that thrives in the warmth. Steam rises constantly from the surface, creating a perpetual mist that clings to the valley floor on cold mornings.

### Significance

Giant creation myths hold that the first giant—called various names in different traditions, but most commonly "the Firstborn"—emerged from this lake in the earliest days of the world. The hot springs were the world's labor pains, and the Firstborn climbed from the mineral waters fully formed, the first of a race born from stone and heat.

Giants who can make the journey travel to Zetl Heski Voth to give birth, believing that children born in these waters carry a blessing: longer life, greater wisdom, and a connection to the ancestral spirits that other giants lack. The warm water also makes labor easier, which may be the tradition's practical origin.

Not all giant children are born here—the journey is long and difficult, especially for pregnant giants—but those who are carry a mark of distinction throughout their lives. They are called "Vothborn" and are often expected to become leaders, shamans, or guardians.

### The Birthing Rites

When a pregnant giant arrives at the Cradle, she is received by the guardian giants and led to prepared shelters near the lake's shore. The final weeks of pregnancy are spent in meditation and preparation, attended by guardian midwives who have assisted hundreds of births.

Labor takes place in the shallows of the lake itself, surrounded by guardian giants who chant the old songs—hymns to the Firstborn, to the earth, to the continuity of giantkind. The child is delivered into the warm water and raised above the surface for their first breath, an echo of the Firstborn's emergence.

The afterbirth is offered to the lake. The mother rests in the warm shallows. The child is presented to the Voice of the Cradle, who speaks their name for the first time—a name chosen by the guardians based on signs and omens observed during the birth.

### Current State

Zetl Heski Voth remains active and sacred. Giants still make the pilgrimage, though in smaller numbers than in ancient times. The guardian giants maintain the birthing shelters and perform the old rites with careful precision.

The lake itself shows no signs of diminishing—the geothermal activity that feeds it has continued unabated for as long as giants have recorded history. Some scholars suggest the thermal system extends deep into the earth, possibly connecting to volcanic activity far below. The guardians consider such speculation irrelevant; the lake is sacred regardless of its geology.
