## Old Tolaria

Tags: region, geography, fallen-state

The ruins of what was once one of the most magically advanced civilizations in Alaria. Old Tolaria fell in a single catastrophic moment when its mage-kings attempted to unweave the fundamental nature of magic itself. What remains is a blighted landscape of magical instability, haunted forests, and the slowly-decaying remnants of a once-great nation.

### The Fall

Old Tolaria's mage-kings pursued magical knowledge without restraint. They believed magic was too entangled—elemental, arcane, divine, and fae energies all bleeding into each other, impossible to isolate or perfect. They built the Apparatus of Severance in their capital of Elderran to separate these magical traditions into pure, controllable forms.

The activation of the Apparatus was the end of Old Tolaria as a functioning nation. The magical backlash created the Faewoods in an instant, tore holes in reality across the region, and left Elderran itself trapped in a temporal catastrophe that continues to this day. The mage-kings who survived scattered. The population fled or died. Within a generation, Old Tolaria existed only in memory and ruin.

### Elderran

The former capital, now a frozen apocalypse. Time itself was shattered by the Apparatus, creating a zone of temporal distortion where the catastrophe is eternally ongoing. A young dragon named Velorax hangs frozen above the central spire, caught in the moment of her own unmaking. The Apparatus continues to run, slowly completing the work the mage-kings began.

### Gnarwood Forest

A forest in the northern reaches of Old Tolaria, one of the few regions relatively unaffected by the Apparatus's backlash. The Gnarwood's trees are ancient and twisted, growing in strange spirals that some scholars attribute to mild magical contamination predating the fall. Small communities of woodcutters and hunters eke out a living here, carefully avoiding the more unstable areas to the south.

### Lodrian Hills

Rolling hills in the western portion of Old Tolaria, now largely depopulated. The hills are dotted with the ruins of estate houses and small fortifications—the country retreats of Tolarian nobility, abandoned when their owners died or fled. Treasure hunters pick through these ruins regularly, though the most valuable finds were claimed generations ago.

### Grailwood Forest

A smaller forest south of the Gnarwood, notable for the quality of its timber before the fall. Now the Grailwood is strange—trees grow in geometric patterns, undergrowth arranges itself in spirals, and animals behave with uncanny coordination. Scholars believe the Apparatus's effects created some form of collective consciousness in the forest, though whether this makes the Grailwood dangerous or merely unsettling is debated.

### Elaphant Groves

Once famous orchards that supplied fruit to the Tolarian elite. The groves still produce—the trees still flower, still bear fruit—but eating the produce is unwise. Those who do report strange dreams, prophetic visions, and in some cases permanent alterations to their perception of time. The fruit fetches high prices among certain mages and mystics despite (or because of) these effects.

### Faewoods

The most dramatic result of the Apparatus's activation. When the mage-kings attempted to cage the Faesong, it exploded outward and created a forest in minutes. The Faewoods are concentrated fae energy given physical form—beautiful, deadly, and utterly unnatural. The boundary between the material world and the fae realms is dangerously thin throughout the forest.

#### Sakatia

A village of Old Tolaria swallowed by the Faewoods when they erupted. The ruins remain, slowly being consumed by impossible growth. Some of the villagers were absorbed into the forest itself, their faces visible in bark, their hands reaching from root systems.

### Mount Tolaria

The peak that gave Old Tolaria its name, visible from most of the region on clear days. Mount Tolaria was sacred to the nation's founders, believed to be the site where the first Tolarian mages received their gifts. The mountain itself is relatively stable magically, protected by ancient wards that predate the mage-kings' hubris. A few hermits and refugees live in caves on its slopes, avoiding the chaos below.

### Fylereün

A secondary peak in the Mount Tolaria range, once home to an astronomical observatory operated by the mage-kings. The observatory was studying the relationship between celestial movements and magical flows when the Apparatus activated. The building still stands, its instruments still aligned, but the astronomers are long dead and their notes are written in ciphers no one has cracked.

### Ekadriel

A fortified monastery built into a cliff face on Mount Tolaria's eastern slope. The monks who lived here practiced a form of magical meditation designed to harmonize different magical traditions—the opposite of what the mage-kings attempted. When the Apparatus activated, Ekadriel was protected by its wards and its philosophy. The monastery still stands, still inhabited by the descendants of its original monks, who maintain their practice and occasionally offer shelter to travelers who can find them.
