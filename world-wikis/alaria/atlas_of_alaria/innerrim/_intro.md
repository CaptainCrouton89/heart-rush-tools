# Innerrim

## Geography

The Innerrim is the vast jungle basin at the heart of Rimihuica—a dark green sea of dense forest filling the continental interior. This is the "Godahi basin," a lowland region surrounded by mountains on multiple sides, where competing states carve out territory amid the endless canopy.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Middle Sea region and Ofrenia; Swampdeep (a saltwater swamp/bayou) lies to the northeast
- **East**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form an east-west barrier separating Innerrim from the Emerald Coast
- **South**: The Cloud Mountains run from southeast to northwest, separating the basin from the Shacklands (particularly Gorath)
- **West**: Transitions into Westrim; the Ishnit Jungles and Thunder Plains mark the western and southwestern edges

### The Thunder Plains

A significant geographic feature—the open plains that form the gap between the Ishnit Jungles to the west and the main Innerrim jungle mass. South of the Thunder Plains lies the Sea of Selegos.

### States of the Innerrim (Clockwise from West)

The basin is divided among several competing powers:

- **Qet Yemani** (West): Home to the Ulvsjael, wolf-people who have adapted to the jungle depths
- **Da Trang** (North): Territory of the Ix'Tyrann, ferocious lizard-people and deadly killers
- **New Chimea** (East): A colonial state extending from the old empire of Chimea. Unusually, it spans across the eastern mountain range, holding territory in both the Innerrim jungles and on the Emerald Coast
- **Vystrilik** (Southeast): Another state that crosses the mountain divide, with lands in both the jungle basin and coastal regions
- **Eoga** (South): The southernmost Innerrim state, bordering the Cloud Mountains

### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: South of the Thunder Plains, separating mainland Rimihuica from Pesalolo island (Tamadrez)
