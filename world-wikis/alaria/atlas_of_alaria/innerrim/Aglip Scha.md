## Aglip Scha

Tags: ruins, plague, pilgrimage, religion

A village abandoned during a plague called the Weeping Rot, now a pilgrimage site for death-cultists, plague-doctors, and those who seek to understand mortality. The dead remain where they fell, and the faithful come to sit among them.

### History

Three centuries ago, Aglip Scha was an unremarkable village on the edge of the Plains of Chule—a few hundred souls who farmed the thin soil and traded with passing caravans. Then the Weeping Rot came.

The plague killed quickly and horribly. Victims wept blood as their organs liquefied, dying within days of the first symptoms. By the time the survivors realized what was happening, over half the village was dead. The remainder sealed the village—barricading doors, collapsing the well, burning what they could—and fled into the plains.

They never returned. No one did. The village sat empty, preserved by dry air and the fear of contagion, for decades. Then the pilgrims came.

### The Pilgrimage

No one knows who first made the journey to Aglip Scha as an act of devotion rather than morbid curiosity. But word spread among certain religious communities—followers of death gods, scholars of entropy, those who believe that understanding mortality is the key to transcending it.

The pilgrims do not worship disease. They worship inevitability. The Weeping Rot is not sacred to them—the village is sacred because it is a perfect memorial to ending. Here, death came and was not cleaned up, not sanitized, not explained away. The bodies remain where they fell. The meals remain on tables, petrified. The doors remain barred from the inside, as if the dead are still trying to keep something out.

The pilgrims come to meditate on this. To sit among the dead and contemplate their own mortality. To collect soil they believe has spiritual properties. To perform rites of acceptance—acknowledging that they too will end, that all things end, and finding peace in that knowledge.

### The Village Today

Aglip Scha is frozen in the moment of its death. The pilgrims maintain this deliberately, preserving the village as they found it:

- Skeletons lie in beds, at tables, in doorways. Some still clutch objects—a cup, a child's toy, a prayer written on rotting parchment. The pilgrims do not move them.
- Buildings stand exactly as they were, aside from natural decay. Roofs have collapsed in places. Walls have crumbled. But no one repairs them, and no one tears them down.
- The well remains collapsed, filled with rubble and sealed with ritual stones placed by generations of pilgrims.
- A perimeter of small shrines marks the village boundary. Pilgrims camp outside this line, living in tents that they erect and dismantle with each visit. No one sleeps within the village itself.

The site has an eerie stillness. Even birds rarely land here, and insects seem fewer than they should be. Whether this is lingering contamination, spiritual weight, or simply the pilgrims' careful maintenance is unclear.

### The Pilgrims

Most who come to Aglip Scha are harmless. Priests of death gods seeking to understand their deity's domain. Philosophers grappling with mortality. The terminally ill looking for acceptance. Plague-doctors and scholars studying historical epidemics from a safe distance.

They are quiet, respectful, and welcoming to those who approach with genuine interest. Many stay for days or weeks, meditating among the dead. Some stay for years, becoming unofficial caretakers of the site. A few have died here—of natural causes—and their bodies have been added to the village with the same reverence given to the original victims.

The pilgrims follow simple rules:
- Nothing may be taken from the village (except soil from outside the perimeter)
- Nothing may be moved within the village
- No one may sleep within the village boundary
- No fire may be lit within the village (the dead must not be disturbed by smoke or heat)

### The Danger

The Weeping Rot is not gone. It is dormant.

Something in the village still carries the plague—perhaps in the bones of the dead, perhaps in the soil, perhaps in the sealed well where victims were thrown in the plague's final days. The dry climate and the pilgrims' careful avoidance of the village interior have prevented reactivation. But occasionally, a pilgrim gets too curious. They enter a building they shouldn't. They touch something they shouldn't.

In the past century, there have been three minor outbreaks traced back to Aglip Scha. Each was contained—barely—through quarantine and fire. Each time, the pilgrims debated whether to finally burn the village and end the risk. Each time, they decided the site was too sacred to destroy.

The contamination's exact location remains unknown. Finding it would mean ending the danger forever—but also potentially releasing it.

### Adventure Hooks

- **The Curious Pilgrim**: A pilgrim has entered the village interior and contracted something. The cult wants help finding a cure without destroying the shrine—and without the infected pilgrim leaving and spreading the plague.

- **Recovery Mission**: Something valuable is inside the village—a family heirloom, a historical document, an artifact buried with one of the dead. The pilgrims will not permit entry, but the party's patron doesn't care about permission.

- **The Source**: A plague-doctor believes they can identify and neutralize the Weeping Rot's source, ending the danger forever. They need protection while they work, and they need someone willing to enter the village with them.

- **Deliberate Release**: A faction within the pilgrim community has decided that the Weeping Rot is sacred—not just the village, but the plague itself. They intend to release it deliberately, as a "gift" to the world. They must be stopped, but violence within sight of the village is considered ultimate desecration.

- **The Sealed Well**: Something is moving in the collapsed well. The pilgrims insist it's just settling rubble. The sounds suggest otherwise.
