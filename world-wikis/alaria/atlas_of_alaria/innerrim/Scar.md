## Scar

Tags: dragon, creature

A brownish dragon laired in the Myjornis Mountains. Scar is named for the distinctive marking across its flank—whether from an old wound or natural coloration, none can say. The dragon is territorial but not particularly aggressive by draconic standards, content to extract tribute from travelers crossing the mountain passes rather than hunting them outright.

Scar's presence has shaped travel patterns through the Myjornis range for generations. Caravans factor "dragon tax" into their costs, and experienced guides know which routes are within Scar's claimed territory.
