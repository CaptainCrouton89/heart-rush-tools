## Giants Cradle

Tags: valley, sacred-site, giants, geography

A bowl-shaped valley nestled between the Koilos and Myjornis mountain ranges, containing two sacred lakes central to giant spiritual tradition. This is where giants believe their race was born, and where they come to die.

### Geography

Giants Cradle is a natural amphitheater carved by ancient glaciers, approximately fifteen miles across at its widest point. The valley floor sits several thousand feet below the surrounding peaks, creating a sheltered microclimate significantly warmer than the surrounding mountains.

Two lakes dominate the valley:

**Zetl Heski Voth** ("Lake of First Breath") occupies the valley's eastern basin. Fed by geothermal springs, its waters remain warm year-round, steaming in the cold mountain air. Giant legends claim this is where the first giant emerged from the earth, pulled from the hot stone by the world's own labor pains.

**Zetl Hesk Rou** ("Lake of Last Breath") fills the western basin. Cold, still, and impossibly deep—no one has ever found its bottom. Its surface rarely ripples, even in strong winds. Giants come here to die, walking into the water and never emerging. The lake accepts them without a sound.

Between the two lakes, a ridge of ancient stone rises from the valley floor, carved with petroglyphs so old that even the giants have forgotten their meaning. This is the Spine of Sleeping Giants, and the guardian community makes its home along its length.

### The Guardian Giants

The giants who dwell in the Cradle are not like their Thunder Plains cousins. They are older, quieter, more contemplative. They do not herd mammoths or raid settlements. They tend the valley, maintain the ancient stone circles, and perform death-rites for giants who make the pilgrimage.

The guardians live simply, in stone shelters built into the Spine. They eat what the valley provides—fish from the warm lake, game from the surrounding slopes, roots and tubers that grow in the geothermal soil. They want nothing from the outside world except to be left alone with their sacred duty.

Their leader bears the title **Voice of the Cradle**—currently an ancient giantess named Morveth who has tended the valley for over three centuries. She speaks rarely, but when she does, even the most belligerent Thunder Plains giant falls silent.

### The Pilgrimage

Giants from across Alaria make the journey to the Cradle at two points in their lives: birth and death.

**Birth**: Pregnant giants who can make the journey travel to Zetl Heski Voth to deliver their children. It is believed that giants born in the warm waters carry a blessing—longer life, greater wisdom, a connection to the ancestral spirits. Not all can make the journey, and giants born elsewhere are not considered lesser, but those born in the Cradle are marked as special.

**Death**: When a giant feels their end approaching, tradition demands they walk to Zetl Hesk Rou. The journey itself is considered part of the dying—the final act of will, the last demonstration of giant strength. Those who make it enter the cold water and are never seen again. The guardians believe they return to the stone from which the first giant emerged, completing the cycle.

Giants who die elsewhere—in battle, by accident, far from the Cradle—are mourned differently. Their spirits are considered "wandering," unable to complete the cycle. Some giants believe these spirits become the winds that howl through mountain passes. Others believe they simply cease to be.

### The Schism

The Thunder Plains giants consider the Cradle their ancestral home, but they have forgotten the old ways. They see the guardian giants as weak, passive, wasting their strength on tending graves instead of claiming territory.

A growing faction among the Thunder Plains giants wants to "reclaim" the Cradle. They envision it not as a temple but as a stronghold—a fortress from which to project giant power across the region. They speak of "restoring" the Cradle to what they imagine it once was: a seat of giant dominion, not a place of quiet death.

The guardian giants will not fight to defend the valley. Violence is forbidden in the Cradle—this is perhaps the oldest and most sacred of giant laws. But they will not leave, either. If the Thunder Plains giants come with violence, the guardians will simply... stop. Stop eating. Stop performing the rites. Stop maintaining the sacred spaces. They will let themselves die in the valley they have tended for millennia, and curse the defilers with their last breaths.

This is not a bluff. The guardians have done it before, generations ago, when another faction tried to claim the Cradle. The curse that followed haunted those giants for seven generations.

### Adventure Hooks

- **The Dying Giant**: A giant hires the party to escort them to the Cradle. They are dying and wish to complete the pilgrimage, but enemies—or family who don't want them to go—stand in the way.

- **Something Wrong in the Deep**: Giants who enter Zetl Hesk Rou have started coming back out. Changed. Wrong. They don't speak, don't respond to their names, and their eyes are empty. The guardians need help discovering what has corrupted the Lake of Last Breath without themselves entering its waters.

- **Preventing a War**: The Thunder Plains warband is coming. The guardians refuse to fight. Someone needs to stop the conflict without bloodshed—because if giant blood is spilled in the Cradle, the consequences will be felt across Alaria.

- **The First Giant's Bones**: A scholar believes the petroglyphs on the Spine of Sleeping Giants are a map—directions to the actual remains of the first giant, buried somewhere in the valley. The remains would be priceless to collectors, mages, or giant traditionalists. The guardians will not permit excavation. The scholar doesn't intend to ask permission.

- **A Birth in Danger**: A pregnant giant has made the pilgrimage to the Cradle, but complications have arisen. Giant midwifery is beyond the party's expertise, but the guardian giants need supplies, protection from something hunting the valley, or help reaching a healer who can assist.
