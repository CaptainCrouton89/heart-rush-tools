## Raric Bay

Tags: bay, water, geography

A large crescent bay along the southern Innerrim coast where the fish are already dead when you catch them.

### The Dead Catch

Fishermen learned centuries ago not to work Raric Bay. Nets come up full—the waters are abundant—but every fish is already dead. Not killed by the net, not suffocated on the way up. Dead before capture. The flesh is fresh, unspoiled, perfectly edible. But the eyes are clouded, the gills still, the hearts stopped. Dissection shows no cause of death.

Fish swimming into the bay are alive. Fish caught in the bay are dead. The transition happens somewhere between, at a depth of roughly sixty feet. Divers who've crossed that threshold report nothing unusual—no temperature change, no pressure difference, no visible boundary. But everything below that line is corpse.

The dead fish still swim. Their bodies move with the currents, fins adjusting, maintaining depth and direction. Schools of dead fish circle the bay in patterns that would suggest intention if they weren't, by every measurable standard, deceased. Fishermen call them "the swimmers" and won't eat anything caught here regardless of the coin offered.

### The Depth

Below sixty feet, Raric Bay becomes something else.

The seafloor at the bay's center—roughly ninety feet down—is covered in bones. Not fish bones. The bones of everything that has ever died in or near the bay: fish, birds, seals, dolphins, the occasional whale. And human bones. Thousands of human skeletons, accumulated over millennia, all facing the same direction. Southwest. Toward something beyond the bay's mouth that no chart has ever shown.

The bones don't decay. A skeleton from the bay's first recorded drowning, over two thousand years ago, was recovered last century by a mage using telekinesis. The bones were pristine, white as fresh-cleaned ivory, with no sign of age or degradation.

Three ships have sunk in Raric Bay throughout recorded history. The wrecks are visible from the surface on clear days. The crews are still aboard—skeletons at their posts, hands on tillers and lines, jaws open in expressions that might be screams or might be something else. They face southwest, like everything else.

### The Settlement Attempts

Twelve attempts have been made to establish permanent settlements on Raric Bay's shores. The chronicle is consistent:

**Year one**: Settlers report unease, bad dreams, a persistent sense of being watched from the water. Attributed to superstition.

**Year two**: Livestock begin dying. No disease, no predation—animals simply stop living. Found in the morning, eyes open, bodies unmarked. Always facing southwest.

**Year three**: The children stop speaking. Not traumatized, not ill—they simply have nothing to say. They spend hours staring at the bay. When asked what they see, they smile.

**Year four**: Settlers leave. Those who remain past year four do not leave. Their bones join the others on the seafloor.

The Shacklands Trading Company attempted the most recent settlement in 423 AR. They lasted three years and two months. The company's records from that period are sealed in Gorath's archives, classified by order of the Warlord himself. The clerk who catalogued them was found dead in his office, facing southwest, with no cause of death the healers could determine.

### Tugon's Castle

A partially-submerged fortress stands at the bay's center, directly above the deepest concentration of bones. It is the only structure to survive in Raric Bay for more than four years.

### What Lies Beyond

Southwest of Raric Bay, past the mouth, the open sea continues for three hundred miles to the Shacklands coast. Charts show nothing unusual. Ships cross that water regularly without incident.

But ships that sail directly southwest from the bay's center—following the line the bones are facing—report their compasses spinning, their navigators becoming confused, their crews developing sudden and irrational fear. Most turn back. Those that don't find nothing. They return, eventually, and they don't speak of what they saw.

One captain, dying of unrelated causes decades later, described it in his final letter: "There's a place out there that isn't on any map. I saw its shadow on the water. The fish in Raric Bay are swimming toward it. They're waiting for it to open."

### The Unfallen

Approximately forty miles southwest of Raric Bay's mouth, buried beneath three hundred feet of water and sixty feet of sediment, lies the body of something that died before death worked the way it does now.

When Lyzaria died 235 million years ago—the first death in creation—her passing established the system: soul to Astraeva, shadow to Malstaris, spirit fading in Celestia. Every death since has followed that template. But the Unfallen predates Lyzaria. It comes from the primordial era, before Azus built the Planar Stack, before the titans were born, before positive and negative energy had names. When it ended, there was no Astraeva to receive a soul, no Malstaris to receive a shadow, no Celestia to hold a spirit. There was only Ezz—undifferentiated chaos—and Ezz does not recognize endings.

The entity has no name in any living language. Scholars who have pieced together fragments from pre-titan texts call it the Unfallen—not because it cannot fall, but because it fell before the concept of "fallen" had been established. Its death created a *template* that doesn't match the current system. Soul, shadow, and spirit never separated. They remain fused in a state the planar machinery cannot process—not alive, not properly dead, simply *persisting* in primordial stasis.

The Unfallen's body is vast—estimates based on the spread of its influence suggest a mass comparable to a small mountain range. It resembles nothing living: a tangle of geometric shapes that don't quite connect properly, angles that hurt to perceive, surfaces that reflect things that aren't there. Divers who have seen fragments of it protruding from the sediment describe it as "a skeleton of mathematics" or "frozen screaming" or simply refuse to describe it at all.

### The Mechanism

The current death system requires separation: soul goes one way, shadow another, spirit fades. The Unfallen's influence *prevents* that separation. Everything within its range dies, but the components remain fused—soul, shadow, and spirit locked together in the primordial configuration, unable to move on because there's nowhere for an undivided being to go.

The sixty-foot threshold marks where this influence becomes strong enough to override normal planar mechanics. Above that line, Astraeva and Malstaris can still claim their due. Below it, the Unfallen's template takes precedence. Creatures that cross the threshold die instantly—heart stops, brain ceases—but with nowhere for their components to separate to, the body continues. The soul can't leave for the Astral because it's still bound to the shadow. The shadow can't sink to Malstaris because it's still bound to the soul. The spirit can't fade because it's still anchored to both.

The result: dead things that don't stop moving. Not undead in the necromantic sense—no trapped soul, no bound shadow. Something older. Something the system wasn't built to handle.

The bones face southwest because they are being *called*. The Unfallen has no consciousness—it ended before consciousness meant anything—but it has a kind of gravity, a pull that draws similarly-stuck beings toward it. The fused soul-shadow-spirits of the bay's dead recognize kinship in the Unfallen's mass. Given enough time, every bone in Raric Bay would migrate across the seafloor to join it. The process is slow, measurable in inches per century, but it is inexorable.

The fish swim in patterns because their fused components are trying to *solve* themselves. The geometric precision mirrors the Unfallen's structure—primordial mathematics from before Azus imposed order on chaos. The dead creatures unconsciously arrange themselves according to that structure, forming diagrams of something the current planar system has no category for.

### Tugon's Role

Tugon var Seleth did not discover the Unfallen. The Unfallen discovered him.

His journals, in the restricted sections, describe dreams that began after his first voyage into the bay—dreams of shapes that taught him things, geometries that whispered instructions, a voice that wasn't a voice explaining what needed to be built and why. Tugon believed he was receiving divine revelation. He was receiving something, but "divine" isn't the right word.

The specifications for Tugon's Castle came from the Unfallen—transmitted through Tugon's dead hand, filtered through a mind that had crossed the sixty-foot threshold and returned changed. The castle is built to the Unfallen's geometry, using the Unfallen's stone (vothrakalin is not native to the Myjornis Mountains; it is a fragment of the Unfallen's body, surfaced through geological pressure millennia ago).

Whether the castle is meant to contain the Unfallen or awaken it is a matter of interpretation. The Nashua scholars believe it's a lock—that the Unfallen itself, in some pre-conscious way, recognized the danger it posed and guided Tugon to build a barrier. The more pessimistic view is that the castle is a beacon, a focusing lens, a way for the Unfallen to concentrate its influence until it can finally complete the death it started before death existed.

The final line of the specifications—"When it wakes, this will not be enough. Build more."—suggests that whoever or whatever wrote them expected the Unfallen to eventually overcome a single castle. No one has built more. No one knows where they would build them, or what shape they would take.

### What Happens If It Spreads

The Unfallen cannot wake in the conventional sense. It has no consciousness to activate, no awareness to achieve. But it can *expand*.

Currently, the Unfallen's influence is contained to Raric Bay and a cone of ocean extending southwest. The sixty-foot threshold represents equilibrium—the point where its primordial death-template and Lyzaria's death-template reach equal strength. But that equilibrium isn't static. Every creature that dies in the bay adds mass to the Unfallen's pattern. Every fused soul-shadow-spirit that migrates toward its body strengthens its claim.

If the influence expands—if the castle fails, or if the castle was always meant to help it expand—the sixty-foot line would rise. Forty feet. Twenty feet. The surface. Then the shore. Eventually, the Unfallen's template would override Lyzaria's entirely. Astraeva would receive no more souls. Malstaris would receive no more shadows. Celestia would hold no more spirits. Everything that died would simply... continue. Fused. Unprocessed. Moving through existence without the release that death is supposed to provide.

The Vyko elves of Vykus have a prophecy about this. They call it the Stillness—a time when the planar machinery grinds to a halt, when Aurus and Nydus receive nothing, when the cycle of souls stops turning. They believe the Unfallen is a remnant of primordial Ezz that survived Azus's ordering of creation—a fragment of chaos that never accepted the rules the Planar Stack imposed. Its "death" wasn't death. It was *refusal*. And that refusal is slowly teaching reality that the current system is optional.

Yegnoth, they say, is another such wound. The black stone—vothrakalin—is the same substance: primordial matter that predates the separation of positive and negative energy. The Vyko have watched both sites for three thousand years. The patterns match. The math is identical. If they're right, Raric Bay and Yegnoth are not isolated problems. They're pressure points where Ezz is still pushing against the walls Azus built, trying to dissolve the order that makes death—and life—function the way they're supposed to.
