## Cloud Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A mountain range forming the southern boundary of Eoga and the northern edge of the Innerrim highlands. The Cloud Mountains connect to the Myjornis Mountains in the west and the Tombrielle Mountains in the east, creating a continuous barrier between the Jungles of Godahi and the lands to the south.

The range is named for the perpetual cloud cover that blankets its peaks—moisture from the jungle below condenses as it rises, creating an environment of constant rain and fog. The passes through the Cloud Mountains are high, cold, and treacherous.
