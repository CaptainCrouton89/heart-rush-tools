## Zetl Hesk Rou

Tags: lake, giants-cradle, sacred-site, geography

"The Lake of Last Breath" in the giant tongue. A cold, impossibly deep lake in the western basin of Giants Cradle where giants come to die, walking into the dark water and never emerging.

### Geography

Zetl Hesk Rou is the opposite of its sister lake in nearly every way. Where Zetl Heski Voth steams with geothermal warmth, Hesk Rou is cold—not freezing, but a deep, penetrating chill that seems to reach past flesh into bone. Where Voth is mineral-blue and clear, Hesk Rou is dark, its depths swallowing light.

The lake is roughly circular, perhaps two miles across, with shores of grey stone that slope steeply into the water. There are no shallows—the lake drops immediately to depth. No one has ever found the bottom. Weighted lines have been lowered for hundreds of feet without touching anything. Some divers have tried to explore; none have returned.

The surface is eerily still. Even strong winds rarely raise more than a gentle ripple. Sounds seem muted near the water—voices don't carry, footsteps are absorbed, even the wind sounds distant. Giants say the lake is always listening.

### Significance

Giant tradition holds that the spirits of the dead return to the earth through Zetl Hesk Rou, completing the cycle that began when the Firstborn emerged from its sister lake. To walk into the Lake of Last Breath is to rejoin the stone from which giantkind was born.

Giants who feel death approaching make the pilgrimage to the Cradle. The journey itself is considered part of the dying—a final act of will, a last demonstration of giant strength. Those too weak to walk are sometimes carried by younger kin, but this is considered less honorable. To crawl the final miles on one's belly is preferable to being carried.

Upon arrival, the dying giant is received by the guardians, who prepare them for the final walk. There are rites, songs, and time for farewells if family has accompanied them. Then, at a moment of their choosing, the giant walks into the lake. They do not stop. They do not look back. They walk until the water closes over their head, and they do not emerge.

### What Lies Below

No one knows what happens to giants who enter Zetl Hesk Rou. The bodies are never recovered—not floating, not washed ashore, not found by any means. The guardians believe the dead return to stone, their physical forms transformed back into the earth-stuff that made the Firstborn.

Scholars have proposed other explanations: underwater caves, chemical dissolution, magical transport to another plane. Some have suggested the lake is a mouth—that something below consumes the dead. The guardians find such speculation offensive and refuse to discuss it.

What is certain is that the lake accepts only the willing dead. On several occasions throughout history, murderers have tried to dispose of bodies in Hesk Rou. In each case, the bodies were found the next morning, lying on the shore, unmarked but very clearly rejected. The guardians consider this proof of the lake's sacred nature.

### The Disturbance

Recently, something has changed.

Giants who enter Zetl Hesk Rou have begun coming back out.

They emerge from the water hours or days after they entered—walking out of the lake exactly as they walked in, but changed. They don't speak. They don't respond to their names or recognize their families. Their eyes are empty, fixed on something no one else can see. They move purposefully, walking away from the lake toward destinations only they know, and they do not stop for anything.

The guardians are deeply troubled. They have contained the returned dead within the Cradle so far, preventing them from leaving the valley, but they do not know what is causing this or how to stop it. They fear the lake itself has been corrupted—or that something has gotten into it.

They need help, but they are reluctant to involve outsiders in sacred giant matters. The situation grows worse with each giant who enters the lake, and the guardians are running out of options.
