## Dreske Gemalis

Tags: mountains, river, geography

A rugged mountain range marking the western border of Nashua, where the Inner Rim transitions from the highland territories to the toxic lowlands. The name applies both to the peaks themselves and to the cold, mineral-rich river that flows from them into Nashuan territory.

### The Mountains

The Dreske Gemalis range forms a natural barrier between Nashua's marshlands and the broader Cloud Mountains system to the west. The peaks are not the tallest in the region—that distinction belongs to the Thunderdark Peaks to the north—but they're steep, heavily forested on the lower slopes, and largely impassable except through a handful of known passes.

The mountains shelter Nashua's western flank, funneling any overland approach from that direction into predictable routes. The Ix'Vasyla have made good use of this geography, fortifying the passes and maintaining watch posts along the ridgelines. No army has successfully crossed the Dreske Gemalis into Nashua; the terrain is simply too hostile, and the defenders know every approach.

The upper slopes are home to creatures rarely seen in the lowlands—highland predators, cliff-nesting birds, and things that prefer cold stone to warm marsh. The Ix'Vasyla send occasional hunting parties into the heights, but the mountains are not truly their territory.

### The River

The Dreske Gemalis River rises from highland lakes fed by snowmelt, gathering strength as it descends the eastern slopes before entering Nashua's watershed. The water is notably cold and carries heavy mineral content—the name may derive from an old tongue meaning "dragon's tears" or "cold stream," though local stories vary.

Where the river enters the lowlands, its mineral-laden waters mix with organic decay to create the distinctive chemistry of Nashua's toxic marshlands. Scholars believe this confluence of highland minerals and lowland biology is responsible for the extraordinary toxicity of the central marshes—the Dreske Gemalis essentially seeds the poison that makes Nashua what it is.

The upper river is navigable only by small craft, and even then only by those who know the rapids and seasonal variations. It serves primarily as a water source and territorial marker rather than a trade route.

### Strategic Importance

Control of the Dreske Gemalis passes would theoretically allow an enemy to bypass Nashua's marsh defenses entirely, striking directly at the river corridor from the highlands. Both Gorath and Trømgar have considered this approach; both have abandoned it as impractical.

The passes are few, narrow, and easily defended. The terrain favors ambush. And any force that successfully crossed would find itself deep in hostile territory with extended supply lines and enemies on all sides. The mountains defend Nashua as effectively as the marshes—just by different means.
