## Trømgar

Tags: region, mountains, dwarves

Stone, steel, and blood. Trømgar rises from the Thunderdark Peaks like a clenched fist—a nation of fortress-cities carved into mountainsides, inhabited by dwarves who have made warfare itself into religion. The Strømgodden do not merely fight; they worship through combat, offering every battle as sacrifice to their war-gods and measuring a life's worth by the glory of its ending.

Every settlement here is a fortress. Every citizen is a warrior. Every piece of armor bristles with spikes designed to turn the wearer's body into a weapon. The Strømgodden have held these mountains against lizardfolk from the south and whatever lurks in the briars to the east for generations, and they will hold them until the mountains themselves crumble—or until they die gloriously trying.

### Overview

Trømgar occupies the Thunderdark Peaks in the eastern Inner Rim, a compact but fiercely defended territory roughly 200 miles across. The borders are defined by:
- **Southwest**: Nashua and the toxic marshlands of the Ix'Vasyla
- **East**: The Croaking Briars, a living thorn-barrier separating Trømgar from Phirexes
- **Southeast**: The Duskwood Forest and Whispering Mangroves, edge territories claimed but lightly held
- **North**: Highland wilderness stretching toward colder regions

The terrain is predominantly mountainous—steep peaks, deep valleys, and the carved fortress-settlements that make Trømgar nearly impossible to conquer. The eastern slopes descend into forested foothills before meeting the supernatural barriers of the Croaking Briars.

### The Thunderdark Peaks

The mountain range that gives Trømgar its spine. The Thunderdark Peaks are not the highest mountains in Alaria, but they're among the most rugged—sharp granite ridges, narrow passes, and deep gorges that channel any invading force into killing grounds.

The name comes from the storms that gather around the peaks, thunder echoing through the valleys with such regularity that the Strømgodden consider it the war-drums of their gods. Lightning strikes are common; the dwarves have learned to use this, positioning metal structures to attract strikes away from settlements and toward defensive positions.

The mountains are rich in iron, copper, and the rare ores needed for Strømgodden armor-smithing. Mining operations honeycomb the peaks, providing both resources and an extensive tunnel network that connects the fortress-cities underground. An enemy who takes a surface position has accomplished nothing—the dwarves simply retreat into the tunnels and counterattack from unexpected directions.

### Major Settlements

Every Strømgodden settlement is a fortress first and a city second. Architecture prioritizes defense: thick walls, multiple fallback positions, and integration with the tunnel network beneath.

#### Levke

The capital, carved into the heart of the central Thunderdark range. Levke is less a city than a mountain made habitable—halls cut deep into living rock, forges burning perpetually in the depths, and defensive positions that have never been breached.

The **Hall of Glorious Ends** dominates Levke's center, a vast chamber where the names and deeds of honored dead are carved into the walls. Every Strømgodden aspires to have their death recorded here—not their life, their *death*, because how one dies defines one's worth. The most spectacular, most sacrificial, most glorious endings receive the most elaborate carvings.

The **High Forge** of Levke produces the finest spiked armor in Trømgar, crafted by master smiths who have spent decades perfecting the art. A suit of Levke armor is a status symbol, a sacred object, and a lethal weapon all in one.

The ruling **Warcouncil** meets in Levke's deepest chambers, where decisions affecting all Trømgar are made by the most battle-proven leaders.

#### Andvik

South of Levke, Andvik guards the approaches from Nashua. This fortress-city has seen more combat than any other Strømgodden settlement, its walls scarred by generations of skirmishes with Ix'Vasyla raiders.

Andvik's warriors specialize in anti-lizardfolk tactics—fighting in the mountain passes where the cold-blooded Ix'Vasyla are at disadvantage, striking at dawn when the lizardfolk are sluggish, and maintaining the vigilance that has kept Nashua's forces from ever reaching Levke.

The city's **Venom-Scarred** regiment consists entirely of warriors who have survived Ix'Vasyla bites—a badge of honor that marks them as tested against Trømgar's most persistent enemy.

#### Kavnendal

The southernmost major settlement, positioned where the mountains give way to foothills. Kavnendal serves as Trømgar's forward operating base for offensive operations into Nashua territory—the staging point for raids that have been conducted, with ritualistic regularity, for generations.

Unlike the other fortress-cities, Kavnendal has significant surface construction—barracks, training grounds, and the facilities needed to support expeditionary forces. It's the most "normal" Strømgodden city, and also the most frequently attacked.

#### Traut

The northern outpost, positioned near the Croaking Briars. Traut watches the living thorn-barrier that separates Trømgar from Phirexes, though "watches" may be optimistic—the briars are effectively impassable, and no significant threat has emerged from that direction.

Traut's warriors have attempted to breach the Croaking Briars repeatedly, seeking glory in being first through. None have succeeded. The briars regenerate overnight, growing faster where blood is spilled, and the Strømgodden have learned that some obstacles cannot be overcome through fury alone.

The settlement maintains a wary relationship with the few traders who know safe passages through the briars—paths that change weekly and are never shared freely.

### The Eastern Territories

Beyond the mountain core, Trømgar claims territory extending to the coast—though "claims" and "controls" are different things.

#### Duskwood Forest

A dense forest with permanent twilight beneath its canopy, technically within Trømgar's borders but practically ungoverned. The Strømgodden send occasional patrols but have little interest in forest territory. Their culture is stone and steel, not wood and shadow.

The Duskwood's valuable resources—bioluminescent fungi, medicinal mosses, rare flowers—are harvested by others, including Phirexan subjects operating under their queen's authority. This jurisdictional ambiguity has never quite risen to conflict, partly because the Strømgodden don't care enough about forest products to fight for them.

#### Whispering Mangroves

The coastal mangroves mark Trømgar's theoretical southeastern extent, though no Strømgodden settlement exists there. The mangroves are unsuitable for dwarven habitation—wet, confusing, and haunted by whispers that the superstitious find unsettling.

Smugglers and refugees use the mangroves as transit routes, moving between Phirexes and the open sea. The Strømgodden are vaguely aware of this traffic but consider it beneath their concern. Chasing humans through swamps is not how glory is won.

### Rivers

Several rivers flow from the Thunderdark Peaks, fed by snowmelt and mountain springs. The largest flows east toward the coast, providing water for the lower settlements and eventually losing itself in the Duskwood and mangroves.

The rivers are not navigable in the mountain reaches—too many rapids, waterfalls, and narrow gorges. They serve primarily as water sources and, occasionally, as defensive obstacles.

### The Croaking Briars

The living thorn-barrier separating Trømgar from Phirexes deserves special mention. This is not natural vegetation—the briars are responsive, aggressive, and seemingly intelligent. They grow toward warmth and blood, their hooked thorns designed to catch and hold.

The Strømgodden have attacked the briars many times, seeking passage to whatever lies beyond. Each assault fails. The briars regenerate overnight, growing thicker and more tangled where blood has been spilled. Older dwarves speak of a time before the briars existed, when traffic between the regions was possible, but that time is generations past.

Safe passages through the briars exist, but they shift weekly and are known only to those with local knowledge—traders, smugglers, and people who have made accommodations the Strømgodden consider dishonorable.

### Climate and Conditions

The Thunderdark Peaks experience harsh mountain weather: cold winters, brief summers, and storms that roll through with little warning. The Strømgodden have adapted completely—their fortress-cities are designed to withstand any weather, their forges burn year-round for warmth, and they consider the harsh conditions part of what makes their people strong.

The lower elevations toward the coast are warmer and wetter, transitioning from mountain climate to the subtropical conditions of the Duskwood and mangroves. Few Strømgodden venture into these lowlands by choice.

### For Adventurers

Trømgar offers opportunities for those who can earn Strømgodden respect—which means proving themselves in combat.

**The Nashua Front**: The endless war with the Ix'Vasyla always needs warriors. Outsiders who fight well against the lizardfolk earn grudging acceptance; those who die gloriously earn honor.

**The Briars**: Anyone who could find a reliable path through the Croaking Briars would become valuable indeed. The Strømgodden's failed attempts suggest that brute force won't work—but perhaps cunning might.

**The Tunnels**: The tunnel network beneath the Thunderdark Peaks extends further than any map shows. Old passages lead to old places—abandoned mines, forgotten holds, and things that have lived in darkness for a very long time.

**The Drasnian Question**: Trømgar's cold war with Gorath over the enslavement of Drasnian dwarves is heating up. Anyone willing to strike at Gorathi interests would find sympathetic ears in Levke—and the Strømgodden definition of "strike" tends toward the spectacular.

The Strømgodden don't trust outsiders easily. But they respect courage, honor combat prowess, and remember those who fight beside them. Prove yourself in battle, and doors open. Fail, and you're simply another soft lowlander who couldn't handle the mountains.
