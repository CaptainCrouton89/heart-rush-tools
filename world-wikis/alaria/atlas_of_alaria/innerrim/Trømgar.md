## Trømgar

Tags: state, nation

A dwarven state in the Thunderdark Peaks, home to the Strømgodden—battle dwarves who view each conflict as a sacred offering to the gods of war. Their society celebrates those who achieve the most spectacular and dangerous victories.

Trømgar's settlements are built like fortresses, constantly ready for the next glorious battle. The creation of spiked armor is a rite of passage, with young Strømgodden spending years learning the specialized smithing techniques required.

The state is locked in an endless war against the Ix'Vasyla lizardfolk of the surrounding regions and the forces of Gorath.
