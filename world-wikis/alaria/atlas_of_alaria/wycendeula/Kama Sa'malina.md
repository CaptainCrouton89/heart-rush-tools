## Kama Sa'malina

Tags: lake, geography, dangerous, monsters, wycendeula

The lake district of southern Wycendeula—hundreds of bodies of water scattered across roughly three thousand square miles of boggy forest and scrubland, pressing against the northern edge of the Pale Death. From above, it looks like shattered glass. From the ground, it's a labyrinth of cold water, unstable terrain, and things that hunt.

Kama Sa'malina has no permanent settlements. No roads cross it. The few who enter do so because they're lost, desperate, or stupid. The region's reputation is earned: this is where the continent's isolation and the Pale Death's hostility combine to create a predator's paradise.

### Geography

Kama Sa'malina occupies the southeastern corner of Wycendeula's habitable zone, beginning where the Eberri Ygonzi forest thins and extending south until the ground becomes permafrost. The lakes vary from ponds to bodies several miles across, connected by streams, marshes, and waterlogged terrain that makes overland travel brutal.

The ground is unreliable. What looks solid may be floating vegetation over deep water. What looks shallow may drop suddenly into cold darkness. The lakes themselves are glacial remnants, carved by ice sheets that retreated tens of thousands of years ago, but the terrain has continued shifting—new lakes appear, old ones drain, and the maps that exist are never quite accurate.

The southern edge blurs into the Pale Death's frozen wastes. In winter, the distinction vanishes entirely. In summer, things come north from the glaciers.

### Why It's Dangerous

Kama Sa'malina's danger is not supernatural. It's ecological. The region is too remote for systematic hunting, too harsh for permanent settlement, and perfectly suited for predators that would be exterminated anywhere civilization could reach them.

**The Gilthrain**

The lakes' apex predators. Gilthrain resemble eels grown to horrifying size—twelve to twenty feet long, thick as a man's torso, with circular mouths ringed by backward-curving teeth. They hunt by vibration, sensing movement on the water's surface or the shore. A single gilthrain is dangerous. A colony is unsurvivable.

Gilthrain can survive out of water for hours, dragging themselves across land between lakes. They hunt cooperatively, driving prey toward ambush points. They're intelligent enough to learn from failed attacks. Colonies communicate through low-frequency sounds that travel through both water and ground—if you feel a deep humming in your chest near a lake, you're already being tracked.

They don't hunt for food alone. Gilthrain are territorial, and they seem to kill anything that enters their domain whether hungry or not. Bodies are sometimes found untouched except for the wounds that killed them.

**The Pallid**

Things that come down from the Pale Death when winter deepens. Humanoid, bone-white, moving with a stuttering gait that looks wrong even at a distance. The Pallid don't speak, don't react to calls, don't stop. They follow prey for days, never running, never resting, closing distance through relentless endurance.

What the Pallid are is unclear. They're not undead—they bleed when cut, die when killed. They're not constructs—their bodies are organic, though the anatomy is subtly wrong. Some scholars believe they're humans transformed by the Pale Death, adapted to the cold until nothing human remains. Others believe they're something that was never human at all.

The Pallid don't seem to eat what they kill. Bodies are found frozen, undisturbed except by scavengers. This has led to theories that the Pallid kill for reasons unrelated to sustenance—territorial behavior, or something stranger. No one has successfully captured a Pallid for study. The attempts that came close ended badly.

**Other Threats**

The gilthrain and Pallid are the worst, but hardly the only dangers:

- **Bristle-wolves**: Pack hunters adapted to the lake terrain. Partially webbed paws, oily fur that sheds water, and the patience to wait in ambush for days. They don't attack large groups, but anyone who falls behind or separates becomes prey.
- **Lake-lurkers**: Ambush predators that resemble floating logs or vegetation until something gets close enough. Not as dangerous as gilthrain, but more numerous and less predictable.
- **The cold itself**: Kama Sa'malina's lakes are glacial—cold enough to kill through shock, cold enough to make swimming impossible even in summer. Falling in is often fatal even without predators.

### The Deeper Lakes

The southern lakes—closest to the Pale Death—are different. Deeper, colder, with water so clear you can see the bottom fifty feet down. Nothing lives in them. No fish, no plants, no gilthrain. Just cold, empty water.

This should make them safer. Instead, people avoid them more than the predator-filled northern lakes. The emptiness is wrong. Water that cold and clean should support life. It doesn't. Something about those lakes is inimical to living things in ways no one has explained.

Local theory holds that the deep lakes are connected to whatever makes the Pale Death what it is. The water may carry the same property that makes the glacial interior lifeless. Drinking from the deep lakes is forbidden not because anyone has tested what happens, but because no one wants to find out.

### Travel Through Kama Sa'malina

**Don't.**

The region has no value that justifies the risk. No rare resources, no ruins worth looting, no paths that save meaningful time over going around. The only reasons to enter are desperation or ignorance.

For those who must:

- **Travel in winter**: Counterintuitive, but the frozen lakes are safer than the liquid ones. Gilthrain become sluggish in deep cold. The Pallid are more active, but they can be outrun on solid ground.
- **Stay off the ice in shoulder seasons**: The freeze and thaw periods are when the ice is unpredictable and the gilthrain are hungriest.
- **Move fast**: The longer you stay, the more likely something finds you. Plan routes that minimize time in the region, not distance.
- **Avoid the shores**: Gilthrain hunt the edges. If you must approach water, do it quickly and loudly—they prefer ambush to direct confrontation.
- **Never travel alone**: A group can watch in multiple directions, rotate rest, and potentially fight off smaller threats. Alone, you're prey.
- **If you hear humming, run**: That's gilthrain coordination. They've spotted you and they're positioning.

### The Few Who Enter

Hunters occasionally work the northern fringes, where gilthrain colonies are smaller and bristle-wolf pelts fetch good prices. They never go deep, never stay long, and lose people regularly despite their experience.

Criminals sometimes flee into Kama Sa'malina when pursuit is close enough that death in the lakes seems preferable to capture. Most are never seen again. A few emerge on the other side, changed in ways that go beyond physical trauma.

Scholars have mounted expeditions to study the deep lakes, the Pallid, the ecosystem that produces such efficient predators. The expeditions that return bring back observations. The ones that don't become observations themselves.

### Hooks

- **Something came out.** A gilthrain colony has established itself in a lake system north of their usual range—close enough to threaten trade routes. Someone needs to drive them back or kill them, and the locals are offering significant payment.

- **A Pallid was captured.** A trapper in the northern fringes claims to have one alive, bound in a root cellar. He's asking for a fortune to let scholars study it. The opportunity is unprecedented. The risk is obvious.

- **The deep lakes are changing.** Travelers report that one of the lifeless southern lakes now has things in it—shapes moving under the surface, too deep to identify. If the deep lakes are becoming habitable, the question is: habitable for what?

- **Someone survived.** A prisoner sentenced to death was given the traditional alternative: walk into Kama Sa'malina. She was expected to die. Instead, she emerged three months later from the southern edge, having crossed the entire region. She won't say how. She won't say what she saw. But she's carrying something wrapped in oilcloth that she won't let anyone touch.
