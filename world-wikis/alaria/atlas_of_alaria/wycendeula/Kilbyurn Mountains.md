## Kilbyurn Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A massive mountain range forming the western boundary of Wycendeula, separating the plains from the Farlands beyond. The Kilbyurn range is taller and more rugged than the Grognil to the northeast, with jagged peaks that remain snow-capped year-round and valleys choked with ancient forests.

### The Empty Mountains

No one lives in the Kilbyurn Mountains. Not hermits, not bandits, not even the satyrs who have claimed every other corner of Wycendeula. The dwarves of Balduahr know better than to try. The range is home to things that make settlement impossible—and make crossing it a last resort.

The Kilbyurns lack leyline activity, which rules out magical corruption. What they have instead is a concentration of apex predators and territorial megafauna that has never been successfully culled. Expeditions from Balduahr in centuries past attempted to establish mining outposts; none survived longer than a season.

### Known Hazards

**Granite Wyrms**: Serpentine creatures that burrow through solid rock, drawn to vibration. Mining operations attract them. A full-grown specimen can collapse a tunnel system in hours.

**Cloudwalkers**: Enormous, silent predators that drift between peaks on thermals. They resemble tattered sheets of pale leather until they fold around prey. Settlements attract attention; isolated travelers are safer.

**The Thornback Swarms**: Insectoid creatures the size of dogs that hunt in coordinated packs of hundreds. They nest in the forested valleys and strip large animals to bone in minutes. Fire deters them temporarily.

**Mountain Drakes**: Not true dragons, but close enough. Territorial, aggressive, and numerous enough that the skies over the Kilbyurns are contested airspace. The drakes hunt anything that moves in the open.

### Rivers and Headwaters

The Kilbyurn range is the source of several major waterways:

- **Buzagi Wempu**: A fast, cold river originating in the northern Kilbyurns. It flows northeast, eventually feeding into the Shizander.
- **Tyerferniin**: A southern river draining toward the Eceraen foothills.
- **Mydruli River**: The largest river system in eastern Wycendeula originates in the central Kilbyurns, fed by glacial melt.

### Crossing the Kilbyurns

Three passes are theoretically traversable, though none are safe:

**The Shriek Pass** (northern): Named for the constant wind that howls through the gap. Fastest crossing, but fully exposed—cloudwalkers hunt freely here.

**Thornback Gap** (central): Lower elevation, but the route passes through swarm territory. Only viable in deep winter when the swarms hibernate.

**Frozen Way** (southern): A glacial route that adds weeks to the journey but avoids the worst predator zones. Still dangerous; the ice shifts unpredictably.

### The Giant Question

Balduahr's historical records describe giants in the mountains west of their territory, and expeditions have occasionally reported enormous humanoid figures moving on distant ridgelines. Whether these are true giants, an unknown species, or something else entirely remains unconfirmed—no expedition has gotten close enough to verify and returned.

What is confirmed: something very large occasionally descends from the high peaks to drink at the mountain lakes. The tracks are unmistakable.
