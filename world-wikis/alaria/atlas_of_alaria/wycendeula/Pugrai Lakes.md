## The Pugrai Lakes

Tags: lakes, geography, leyline

Three coastal lakes along Wycendeula's eastern shore where the White Wastes meet God's Bathtub. The lakes—Pugrai D'had, Pugrai Shisk, and Pugrai Naihim—share a common characteristic that has puzzled scholars: their waters are unnaturally still.

### The Stillwater Phenomenon

The Pugrai lakes barely ripple. Wind that should churn the surface produces only faint tremors. Objects dropped into the water sink with dreamlike slowness. Swimming is possible but exhausting—the water resists movement in all directions.

This effect intensifies closer to the lakes' centers. Boats attempting to cross report that oars become nearly useless; poling from the shallows is the only reliable propulsion. At the deepest points, the water becomes so resistant that escape requires tremendous effort. Several bodies have been recovered floating motionless in the central zones, preserved by the cold and the strange medium.

### The Leyline Connection

The force leyline passes through this region, and most scholars attribute the stillwater phenomenon to its influence. The leyline—associated with kinetic manipulation and motion arrest—appears to bleed into the water table. The effect is strongest in Pugrai Naihim, the largest lake, and weakest in Pugrai Shisk.

The fire leyline also crosses nearby (both converge at Nabledron to the north), but fire's influence is less apparent. Water temperature in the lakes is slightly elevated year-round, preventing full freezing even in winter.

### Pugrai D'had

The northernmost lake, where the Krelfassa river meets the coast. D'had is the shallowest of the three and the stillwater effect is relatively mild—boats can cross with effort. The river mouth creates a mixing zone where normal water meets stillwater, producing strange currents that curl back on themselves.

Local legend claims D'had was once a harbor in ancient times, before the leylines shifted. No archaeological evidence supports this, though the lakebed is littered with debris too deep to recover easily.

### Pugrai Shisk

The smallest lake, positioned between D'had and Naihim. Shisk is notable for its clarity—the stillwater effect means sediment never rises, and visibility extends to the bottom in most areas. Fish exist here but move in slow, languid patterns. They're easy to catch but taste faintly metallic.

Rumors persist of shapes visible in Shisk's depths—regular geometric forms that don't match natural formations. No one has successfully dived deep enough to investigate; the water's resistance makes descent exhausting and ascent terrifying.

### Pugrai Naihim

The largest and most dangerous lake, fed by the Elmynfrosk river from the north. Naihim's center is effectively impassable—the stillwater effect is so pronounced that even objects thrown in arc slowly rather than splash. Local satyr tribes consider the lake sacred or cursed (the distinction is unclear) and avoid its shores entirely.

What makes Naihim unique is the sound. On still nights, those near the shore report a low, constant vibration—not quite a hum, more a pressure in the ears. The sound comes from the water itself, as if something vast is holding very, very still at the bottom.

### The Pugrai Name

"Pugrai" appears in no known language spoken in modern Wycendeula. The satyr adopted the name from whoever came before them. Some scholars connect it to ancient human tongues from before the plains fell; others suggest it predates human settlement entirely.

The word's meaning is unknown, though its consistent application to stillwater features suggests it was descriptive rather than commemorative.
