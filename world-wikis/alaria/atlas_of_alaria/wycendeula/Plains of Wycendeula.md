## Plains of Wycendeula

Tags: plains

The plains are completely overrun with satyrs. Random camps are everywhere, dotted with buffalo hide tents. The plains are quite fertile, but the satyr can't organize well enough to begin farming.

Despite having no government, rumors of a self-proclaimed king of the satyr have begun to spread. A satyr of dark and mysterious origins, with ambitions to unite all of the Satyr. These rumors terrify Balduahr, the much smaller dwarven kingdom in the southwest, which would have no hopes of defending itself if all of the satyr accross Wycenduala united.
