## Deadman's Lake

Tags: lake, geography, poi

A cold mountain lake nestled in the northern Kilbyurn foothills, where the forest begins to thin and the terrain rises toward the high peaks. The lake's waters are clear and deep, fed by snowmelt and underground springs, with a surface that reflects the surrounding mountains with mirror-like clarity.

The name comes from what floats in it.

### Geography

Deadman's Lake occupies a natural bowl carved by ancient glaciers, roughly three miles long and a mile wide at its broadest point. The water is exceptionally deep—over 400 feet in the central basin—and cold enough to numb exposed skin within minutes. The lakebed drops steeply from the shore, offering no shallow wading areas.

The surrounding terrain is transition zone between forest and mountain. The western shore is forested, though the trees are smaller and more widely spaced than in the lowland Fylvrae Sylvrym. The eastern shore rises into bare rock and scree slopes, climbing toward the Kilbyurn peaks. Several small streams feed the lake from the mountains; a single outlet flows west toward the forest interior.

The lake has no fish. The water is too cold, too deep, and something about its mineral content discourages aquatic life. Birds occasionally land on the surface but don't linger. The stillness is pronounced.

### The Dead

Bodies surface in Deadman's Lake with disturbing regularity.

Some are recent—travelers who fell through ice, climbers who slipped from the surrounding cliffs, victims of ulvsjael attacks who crawled to the water before dying. These are easily explained. The lake is remote and dangerous; people die here.

But other bodies are old. Very old. Preserved by the cold water, they drift up from the depths in states of remarkable preservation—skin intact, features recognizable, clothing from centuries past. Some wear armor styles that haven't been forged in a thousand years. Some have wounds that suggest violence. Some show no cause of death at all.

The lake seems to collect the dead. Locals claim that bodies from miles around somehow find their way to the water—that streams carry them, or that the dying are drawn here by some compulsion, or that the lake simply takes what it wants. None of these explanations are satisfying. All of them might be true.

### The Salt Tomb

On the lake's eastern shore, where the rocks rise sheer from the water, a cave mouth opens into the mountainside. The entrance is marked by white mineral deposits that give the appearance of salt encrustation—hence the name. Inside, the cave extends deep into the mountain, its walls lined with the same crystalline residue.

The Salt Tomb is not a natural formation. The cave was carved, widened, and reinforced in a style that predates any known civilization in this region. The walls bear carvings that have been obscured by centuries of mineral buildup but are clearly deliberate. The passage descends at a gentle angle, spiraling into the mountain.

What lies at the bottom is unknown. Every expedition that has gone deep has either returned empty-handed—claiming the passage became impassable—or not returned at all. The survivors describe increasing disorientation as they descended, difficulty breathing despite adequate airflow, and the persistent feeling that something was following them back up.

The Salt Tomb's relationship to the lake is unclear. The cave doesn't connect to the water at any mapped point, but the mineral deposits suggest they share a source. Some scholars theorize that the tomb was built as a repository—a place to store something that needed to remain cold, isolated, and watched. Others think it was a prison.

The ulvsjael don't enter the Salt Tomb. They don't go near Deadman's Lake at all. This is the only place in the northern forest where their absence is guaranteed. Whatever they sense here, they want no part of it.

### For Travelers

Deadman's Lake offers one of the few reliable safe zones in the northern Fylvrae Sylvrym. The ulvsjael avoid the area entirely, creating a bubble of relative safety perhaps five miles in diameter centered on the lake.

The operative word is "relative." The lake itself is dangerous—the cold water, the sheer drop-offs, the unsettling presence of preserved corpses. The Salt Tomb is worse. And while the ulvsjael don't come here, other predators do. The mountain slopes host their own dangers, and the forest edge isn't truly safe just because the wolves avoid it.

Still, for those fleeing through ulvsjael territory, the lake represents a chance to rest. The western shore offers camping sites with clear sight lines. Water is plentiful, though drinking from a lake full of corpses takes some adjustment. The outlet stream is safer—the water has been filtered through several miles of rocky terrain by the time it's drinkable.

Do not enter the Salt Tomb without significant preparation and the expectation that you may not return. Do not swim in the lake. Do not investigate the bodies—they've been dead long enough that disturbing them serves no purpose, and some of them... move in the current more than they should.
