## The Cobbled Coast

Tags: coast, geography

A rugged peninsula on Wycendeula's southeastern shore, where the Plains of Wycendeula meet God's Bathtub. The coastline earned its name from the distinctive stone-strewn beaches—not natural formations, but the debris of countless wrecked ships accumulated over millennia.

### Geography

The Cobbled Coast juts eastward into God's Bathtub, creating a navigation hazard for ships traveling the eastern sea routes. The peninsula's terrain is rough—rocky outcrops, steep cliffs, and sparse vegetation. Inland, the Hills of Sharp Talons rise in jagged formation; seaward, the coastline offers few safe anchorages.

The beaches are the peninsula's most distinctive feature. Centuries of shipwrecks have deposited wood, metal, and cargo across the shores. Storms periodically churn the debris, revealing new artifacts while burying others. The effect is a jumbled pavement of ship timbers, anchor chains, hull fragments, and unidentifiable wreckage.

### The Wreck Legacy

Why so many ships have foundered here is debated. The obvious factors—treacherous currents, underwater rocks, sudden storms—account for many losses. But sailors who've survived the passage report other hazards:

**The Calling Rocks**: Certain stone formations along the coast produce sounds when wind passes through them—whistles, moans, and occasionally what sounds like voices. Some navigators claim the sounds have lured ships toward the rocks. Others dismiss this as superstition masking poor seamanship.

**Unpredictable Currents**: The waters around the Cobbled Coast behave strangely, possibly influenced by the force leyline that passes nearby before reaching the Pugrai lakes. Currents reverse without warning; ships find themselves pushed toward shore despite favorable winds.

**The Harpy Colonies**: The Hills of Sharp Talons are home to aggressive harpy populations that have learned to prey on distressed vessels. When storms drive ships close to shore, the harpies swarm.

In ancient times, before the satyr conquest, the coast was apparently well-charted and navigable. The current hazards may have developed since—or the knowledge of how to avoid them may simply have been lost.

### The Hills of Sharp Talons

A low mountain range running along the peninsula's spine, named for the distinctive limestone formations that crown its peaks—spires and blades of pale stone that resemble enormous talons clutching at the sky.

The formations are natural, carved by wind and rain over eons, but they create perfect nesting habitat for the peninsula's apex predators.

**Harpy Territories**: Multiple harpy colonies occupy the hills, each claiming a section of the ridge. The colonies are mutually hostile but unite against external threats. Their hunting range extends miles in every direction, covering the coast and extending over the water.

The harpies have adapted to coastal life. They dive for fish, scavenge shipwrecks, and attack anything that ventures onto the peninsula without adequate defense. They're intelligent enough to recognize armed groups and generally avoid direct confrontation—but they're patient, and they watch for vulnerability.

**Stone Nests**: The harpies build their nests in the talon formations themselves, wedging materials into crevices and hollows in the limestone. From a distance, the hills appear uninhabited; only closer inspection reveals the colonies. The nests often contain salvage from shipwrecks—metal, glass, anything shiny.

**The Talon Shrine**: Deep in the hills, where the largest formations cluster, there's evidence of pre-satyr construction—cut stone foundations, carved pillars, and what might be an altar. The harpies nest around it but don't seem to use it. Scholars speculate this was a sacred site for the humans who once occupied Wycendeula, possibly connected to wind worship or the sky.

### Crossing the Peninsula

Overland travel across the Cobbled Coast is possible but dangerous. The terrain is difficult, water sources are scarce, and the harpies are ever-present. Most who attempt it travel in armed groups, moving at night when the harpies are less active.

The peninsula sees occasional traffic despite the hazards. Treasure hunters come seeking shipwreck salvage; the accumulated debris represents centuries of cargo. Scholars come to study the ancient ruins. A few hardy souls attempt to harvest harpy feathers, which command premium prices for certain magical applications.

None of these visitors stay long. The Cobbled Coast tolerates intrusion poorly.

### Connection to Ancient Wycendeula

The peninsula shows more evidence of pre-satyr habitation than most of the plains. Besides the Talon Shrine, there are foundation stones along the coast that suggest a harbor or watchtower, and the beach debris occasionally yields artifacts far older than the shipwrecks—worked stone, corroded bronze, fragments of pottery with unfamiliar designs.

Whatever civilization once thrived here, they built on the Cobbled Coast. Whether they fell to the same forces that ended human occupation of the plains, or abandoned the peninsula earlier, remains unknown.
