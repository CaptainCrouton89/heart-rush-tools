## Tormlek Lake

Tags: lake, geography

A shallow, mist-shrouded lake on the western edge of Fylvrae Sylvrym, where the forest gives way to coastal scrubland south of the Bay of Wolves. The lake sits in a natural depression that floods seasonally, expanding and contracting with the rains.

### Geography

Tormlek Lake is broad but shallow—perhaps six miles across at its widest, but rarely more than fifteen feet deep even in the central basin. The bottom is soft mud accumulated over millennia, treacherous for wading and impossible for anchoring. Reeds and marsh grasses ring the shores, extending far into the water in shallower sections.

The lake is fed by several small streams draining the surrounding forest and by direct rainfall. A single outlet flows southwest toward the coast, though in dry seasons the lake can become entirely landlocked when evaporation exceeds inflow.

Morning mist rises from the lake's surface nearly year-round, obscuring visibility across the water. The mist typically burns off by midday in summer but can persist all day in autumn and winter. This creates a landscape of shifting gray obscurity, where sounds carry strangely and distances become difficult to judge.

### Character

Tormlek Lake exists in a transitional zone between deep forest and coastal scrub. The ulvsjael don't claim it as core territory—the open terrain and shallow water don't suit their hunting tactics—but they do patrol its edges. The lake is safer than the forest interior but not safe.

The shallowness and soft bottom make the lake useless for boats of any size. The mud is thick enough to trap waders who venture too far from shore. The mist makes navigation difficult even for those staying on land. Tormlek Lake is less actively dangerous than other features in this region, but it's not welcoming.

Wildlife is more abundant here than in the deep forest. Waterfowl nest in the reeds; fish are plentiful in the clearer channels; frogs and turtles populate the shallows. For travelers who need food, the lake offers options—assuming they can harvest quickly and move on before attracting attention.

### For Travelers

Tormlek Lake offers a potential stopover for those traveling the coastal route around Fylvrae Sylvrym. The southern shore, where the forest thins into scrubland, is the safest approach. Don't attempt to cross the lake directly—the soft bottom will trap you, and the mist will disorient you.

Fresh water is readily available but should be filtered; the shallow lake accumulates sediment and organic matter. Game is plentiful along the shores. Stay out of the mist if possible—ulvsjael can navigate by scent, and you can't.

The outlet stream provides a landmark for navigation. Follow it southwest to reach the coast south of the Bay of Wolves.
