## Lean D'Riin

Tags: forest, geography, riin, eyendra

The central and most ancient section of the Eyendra forest. The name means "Forest of the Riin" in the language of the civilization that once flourished here—a people who merged with the land two thousand years ago and now exist only as a diffuse presence throughout the forest.

Lean D'Riin is the heart of ancient Riin civilization and the most dangerous part of Eyendra. The Riin built (grew) their largest settlements here, and here the merger between people and land was most complete. The trees are impossibly old—some predate the Riin civilization itself—and the canopy is so thick that the forest floor exists in permanent twilight.

No one lives in Lean D'Riin. No one should go there unless they have business with the dragon Ezra Olkanis or wish to disappear.

See the main **Eyendra** entry for full details on the forest, the Riin, and the dangers of the interior.
