## Mirror Lakes

Tags: lake, geography, wycendeula

A cluster of small lakes in southwestern Wycendeula, tucked into the hills where the Neurian range meets the northwestern edge of Eberri Ygonzi. Unlike the predator-infested waters of Kama Sa'malina or the psychological horror of Trauma Lake, the Mirror Lakes are merely... strange.

### Geography

The Mirror Lakes comprise roughly a dozen bodies of water ranging from small ponds to lakes covering a few hundred acres. They occupy a series of natural basins in the foothills, connected by streams and seepage. The surrounding terrain is mixed—rocky slopes above, boggy lowlands below, with stands of conifers providing cover from the wind.

The lakes sit at the northwestern corner of the dangerous southern region, which makes them the first water many travelers encounter when crossing from the Neurian Hills toward the interior. This has given them an outsized reputation as a waypoint, despite offering no services or settlements.

### The Stillness

The Mirror Lakes are unnaturally calm. Even in strong wind, even during storms, the water barely ripples. The surface reflects with near-perfect clarity—sky, trees, and approaching figures reproduced so precisely that travelers sometimes mistake the reflection for a second group of people.

This stillness is not magical in any detectable sense. Scholars have tested the water, the local wind patterns, the basin geography. Nothing explains why these particular lakes should be calmer than any others. They simply are.

The stillness creates practical problems. Without ripples to break the reflection, judging the water's edge becomes difficult. The transition from shore to lake is invisible in certain light. People have walked into the Mirror Lakes without realizing they'd left solid ground—awkward and cold, but rarely dangerous since the lakes are shallow.

More disturbing: the reflections are *too* accurate. Details that shouldn't be visible at a distance appear clearly in the water. Travelers have seen their own faces reflected from fifty feet away, expression perfectly legible. Some report seeing details in the reflection that they couldn't see directly—movement in the treeline behind them, figures on the far shore, things that may or may not have been there when they turned to check.

### What Lives Here

The Mirror Lakes support normal wildlife—fish, waterfowl, the small mammals that live around any freshwater source. Nothing unusual, nothing threatening. The lakes' proximity to Eberri Ygonzi keeps major predators away; coilwights don't venture this far from dense forest, and the open terrain discourages bristle-wolves.

This makes the Mirror Lakes one of the few relatively safe water sources in the region. Travelers crossing the southern wilds often stop here specifically because it's not trying to kill them.

### Local Use

Hunters and trappers working the edges of Eberri Ygonzi use the Mirror Lakes as a staging area. It's close enough to the forest to make day-trips viable, far enough to sleep safely. Informal camps get established during peak hunting season, though no one stays permanently.

The locals have developed superstitions about the lakes:
- Don't look at your reflection for too long (you might see something you shouldn't)
- Don't camp directly on the shore (the stillness affects sleep)
- Don't fish after dark (the water sees better in darkness than you do)

Whether these superstitions have basis in actual experience or are simply the accumulation of unease is unclear. The Mirror Lakes aren't *dangerous*, exactly. They're just... watched. That's how people describe it. Not malevolently. Just attention, from something that shouldn't be paying attention.

### Hooks

- **The reflection moved.** A hunter swears his reflection waved at him—a gesture he didn't make. He fled and hasn't returned, but his gear is still at the lake camp. Someone needs to retrieve it. Someone willing to look at the water.

- **The perfect map.** A cartographer theorizes that the Mirror Lakes' reflections could map areas the cartographer can't reach directly—showing, perhaps, what lies on the other side of hills, or deeper into Eberri Ygonzi than anyone has safely traveled. He's looking for assistants willing to help him test this theory.

- **Something's in the water.** A body has been found floating in one of the Mirror Lakes—the first death ever recorded here. The body is face-down, seemingly drowned, but no one can explain how an experienced woodsman would drown in four feet of still water. More disturbing: his reflection is still visible in the lake, even though the body has been removed.
