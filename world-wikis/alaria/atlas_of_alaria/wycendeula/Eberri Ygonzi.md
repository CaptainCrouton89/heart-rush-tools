## Eberri Ygonzi

Tags: forest, geography, dangerous, monsters, wycendeula

The great forest of southwestern Wycendeula—a dense expanse of ancient conifers and tangled undergrowth stretching from the Neurian Hills to the edge of Kama Sa'malina. Where Eyendra in the northeast is haunted by old magic, Eberri Ygonzi is simply, brutally wild. This is old growth that has never been logged, never been settled, never been tamed. The things that live here have had thousands of years to become very good at killing.

The name is archaic—no one remembers what language it comes from or what it originally meant. Locals sometimes call it the Ygonzi or just "the deep forest." Whatever you call it, the message is the same: don't go in.

### Geography

Eberri Ygonzi covers roughly eight thousand square miles of dense boreal forest, bounded by the Neurian Hills to the northwest, the Endari Hills to the northeast, and Kama Sa'malina's lake country to the southeast. The southern edge fades into scrubland as the terrain rises toward the East Whitewall mountains and the Pale Death beyond.

The forest floor is a maze of fallen timber, thick undergrowth, and terrain that defeats easy movement. Ravines cut through unexpectedly. Streams appear and vanish. The canopy blocks enough light that navigation by sun is unreliable. People who enter without experience get lost within hours. People who enter with experience still get lost—they're just better at surviving it.

The interior contains The Nox—a region of hills where the forest grows differently and worse things live. Locals treat The Nox as a separate place entirely, though no clear boundary marks where Eberri Ygonzi ends and The Nox begins.

### What Lives Here

**Coilwights**

The forest's signature horror. Coilwights are serpentine predators fifteen to thirty feet long, as thick as a man's thigh, covered in scales that shift color to match their surroundings. They hunt from the trees, dropping onto prey from above, and they kill through constriction—but not the way normal constrictors do.

A coilwight doesn't just squeeze. It *inverts*. The pressure it applies forces the victim's body to compress in ways anatomy doesn't support. Bones break inward. Organs rupture. The process takes minutes and the victim is conscious for most of it. Coilwights seem to prefer this—they'll release prey that dies too quickly and find something else.

Worse: coilwights collect skins. Not to wear, but to... line things with. Their lairs are hollows draped in preserved hides, arranged in patterns that suggest purpose without revealing what that purpose is. Scholars who've studied coilwight lairs (from a safe distance, after the occupant was confirmed dead) report that the skin arrangements seem deliberate, even ritualistic. No one knows why. No one wants to know badly enough to study them closer.

Coilwights are solitary and territorial. This is the only reason Eberri Ygonzi is survivable—if they cooperated like gilthrain, nothing would leave the forest alive.

**Thornbacks**

Boar-like creatures the size of horses, covered in quills that they can launch with surprising accuracy. Thornbacks are aggressive, territorial, and ill-tempered even by the standards of animals that will charge anything that moves. They're also one of the few things in Eberri Ygonzi that coilwights avoid—the quills make them difficult to constrict, and thornbacks travel in groups.

Ironically, thornbacks are the closest thing the forest has to safe company. If you can track a thornback herd without getting close enough to provoke them, you know coilwights aren't nearby. Experienced hunters use this, following at a distance and trusting the thornbacks to clear the path.

**Other Threats**

- **Drop-spiders**: Fist-sized arachnids that nest in the canopy and drop weighted silk lines onto prey below. The silk is adhesive and strong enough that a full coating can immobilize a grown man. The spiders themselves aren't venomous—they don't need to be. They just wait until the prey exhausts itself.
- **Corpse-lilies**: Plants that smell exactly like rotting meat to attract scavengers, then release spores that cause hallucinations and disorientation. Not directly lethal, but being lost and hallucinating in coilwight territory amounts to the same thing.
- **The usual predators**: Wolves, bears, great cats—all present, all larger and more aggressive than their counterparts elsewhere. The forest selects for size and violence.

### The Nox

The hills at Eberri Ygonzi's center, where the forest changes character and the dangers multiply. See the separate entry for The Nox—it warrants its own documentation.

The boundary between Eberri Ygonzi proper and The Nox isn't marked, but experienced woodsmen claim they can feel when they've crossed it. The light dims. The sounds change. The forest, already hostile, becomes actively malevolent.

### No Settlements

Eberri Ygonzi has never supported permanent habitation. Several attempts have been made over the centuries—logging camps, hunting lodges, even a small fortress meant to project power into the interior. All failed. The camps were abandoned after unacceptable losses. The fortress lasted three years before the garrison walked out and refused to return, offering no explanation beyond "we can't stay there."

The forest edge supports seasonal activity. Hunters work the perimeter when pelts are valuable enough to justify the risk. Herbalists gather plants found nowhere else. But everyone leaves before nightfall, and no one goes deep.

### Travel Through Eberri Ygonzi

Sometimes unavoidable. The forest lies between the Neurian Hills and Kama Sa'malina, and certain routes through Wycendeula require crossing one or the other. Given the choice, most people prefer the forest. At least coilwights can be avoided with care; gilthrain colonies cannot.

Survival guidelines:

- **Move during dawn and dusk**: Coilwights are most active at night and midday. The shoulder hours offer better odds.
- **Watch the canopy**: Coilwights attack from above. If you can't see clear sky through the branches, assume something is watching you.
- **Follow water**: Streams create breaks in the canopy and coilwights avoid getting wet. River routes are safer, though not safe.
- **Make noise**: Counter-intuitive, but silence draws attention. Steady noise—talking, singing, anything consistent—tells the forest's predators that you're alert. They prefer unaware prey.
- **Avoid The Nox**: There is no reason to enter The Nox. If your route would take you through, find another route.
- **Don't camp alone**: Take watches. Sleep in trees if possible. Never, ever sleep on the forest floor.

### Hooks

- **The abandoned fortress**: Grymhold, the fortress that was abandoned without explanation, still stands in the eastern Ygonzi. Treasure hunters occasionally brave the journey to loot it. Most don't return. Those who do report that the fortress isn't empty—something lives there now, something that isn't wildlife. What happened to the garrison, and what's claimed their stronghold?

- **Coilwight behavior is changing**: A hunter reports that a coilwight approached her without attacking, watched her for several minutes, and then withdrew. This is unprecedented—coilwights don't observe, they kill. Something has changed, and the implications are unclear.

- **The herbalist's map**: A dying herbalist offers a map to a grove deep in Eberri Ygonzi where a plant grows that can cure a specific rare disease. The map is genuine. The grove exists. Getting there and back is the problem.

- **Thornback stampede**: Something spooked a thornback herd badly enough to drive them out of the forest entirely—they've been rampaging through farmland for days. Whatever scared them is presumably still in the forest. The locals want the stampede stopped, but the larger question is what could frighten thornbacks badly enough to make them flee.
