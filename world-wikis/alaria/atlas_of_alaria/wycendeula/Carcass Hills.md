## Carcass Hills

Tags: hills, ruins, geography

A range of low, bleached hills rising from the southern Fylvrae Sylvrym, where the forest thins before meeting the Kilbyurn foothills. The hills take their name from what lies beneath them—and from their appearance at the right angle.

### Geography

The Carcass Hills stretch roughly 40 miles east to west and 20 miles north to south, rising perhaps 500 feet above the surrounding forest floor at their highest point. The terrain is rolling rather than rugged, with gentle slopes and broad, flat-topped ridges.

The soil here is thin and alkalite, supporting only sparse grass and scrub brush. The underlying stone is a pale limestone shot through with ancient fossite deposits—the compressed remains of creatures from an era before recorded history. Rain and wind have carved the exposed rock into strange shapes: arches, pillars, and formations that resemble skeletal remains at the right angle.

Several rivers drain through the hills, their channels cutting shallow valleys between the ridges. The Voules River is the largest, flowing south toward the Eceraen foothills. The water runs clear here, filtered through the limestone, though it carries a slightly mineral taste.

### Why "Carcass" Hills

The name has three sources, and all are accurate:

**The Appearance**: The pale limestone formations, eroded by wind and rain, resemble nothing so much as enormous ribcages and spines protruding from the earth. From certain angles, the whole range looks like a graveyard of titans—or the picked-clean remains of something even larger.

**The Fossils**: The rock is dense with fossilized remains. Bones of unfamiliar creatures protrude from cliffsides and erode out of hillsides after heavy rains. Some are recognizable—giant elk, massive bears, creatures that still exist in smaller forms. Others are not. Collectors prize the fossils, though reaching them requires passing through ulvsjael territory.

**The Dead**: Something terrible happened here, long ago. The hills are layered with mass graves—not natural accumulations, but deliberate burials. Whoever they were, they numbered in the tens of thousands. The bones are human, or close to it, and they've been there for millennia.

### The Ulvsjael and the Hills

Unusually, the Carcass Hills are not prime ulvsjael territory. The packs hunt here occasionally, but no pack claims the hills as core territory. The terrain is poor for their tactics—too open, too exposed, with inadequate cover for coordinated ambushes.

This makes the Carcass Hills one of the few places in western Wycendeula where careful travelers might pass without immediate confrontation. The operative word is "might." Packs still patrol the surrounding forest, and the hills offer no protection once you're noticed. But the hills themselves are as close to neutral ground as exists in this region.

Local satyr have a different theory about why the ulvsjael avoid the hills. They claim the place is cursed—that the spirits of whoever died here still linger, and that the wolves can sense them. The ulvsjael, predictably, don't explain their behavior.

### The Citadel

At the heart of the Carcass Hills stands the ruin of an ancient city-state, known simply as The Citadel. The original name—if it had one—has been lost.

The Citadel was built on and into the largest hill, its walls and towers constructed from the same white limestone as the surrounding terrain. From a distance, the ruins blend into the hillside; only on approach do the worked stones become distinguishable from natural formations.

The city was substantial. Outer walls enclose perhaps two square miles; interior structures suggest a population of 20,000 or more at its height. The architecture is unfamiliar—geometric, angular, with an emphasis on vertical structures that seems designed for beings who could fly or didn't mind climbing. Windows are placed too high for convenient access. Doorways are narrow. Staircases spiral upward with steps uncomfortably tall for human legs.

The Citadel has been abandoned for at least 3,000 years, possibly much longer. The walls still stand in many sections, testament to the quality of the original construction, but roofs have collapsed and interior chambers have filled with debris. What remains above ground has been picked clean by centuries of cautious treasure seekers.

#### Below Ground

The surface structures are the least interesting part of The Citadel. The city extends downward into the limestone, with passages and chambers carved deep into the hill. The upper levels have been explored—barracks, storerooms, cisterns, the expected infrastructure of any fortified city. Below that, exploration becomes dangerous and maps become unreliable.

The deep levels contain architecture that doesn't match the surface city. The geometric precision gives way to organic curves; corridors narrow and branch unpredictably; chambers open onto vertical shafts of unknown depth. Some explorers report finding carvings that depicted scenes of worship or sacrifice. Others report nothing but empty stone.

What everyone reports is the feeling of being watched. The deep Citadel doesn't want visitors.

#### The Mass Graves

The correlation between The Citadel and the mass graves in the surrounding hills is obvious but unexplained. Were these the city's inhabitants, killed in some catastrophe? Enemies, slain in a great battle? Sacrifices, offered to whatever the city's rulers worshipped?

The bones offer few clues. They're too old for any remaining tissue, too jumbled for determining cause of death. They were buried deliberately—in some cases arranged in patterns—but the patterns' meaning is lost.

One popular theory holds that The Citadel was a center for some form of necromancy, and that the dead in the hills were raised to serve as laborers or soldiers. The steep, narrow architecture would make sense for a population of undead servitors who didn't need comfortable access. The mass graves would be the storage areas, waiting for reanimation.

This theory has no evidence beyond architectural speculation. But no better theory exists.

### Current State

The Citadel is empty but not safe.

The surface ruins attract occasional explorers, scholars, and treasure hunters who are willing to risk ulvsjael territory for a chance at ancient artifacts. Most find little of value—the easy pickings were taken centuries ago. Some find passage to the lower levels and don't return.

The ulvsjael packs avoid The Citadel itself even more thoroughly than they avoid the surrounding hills. They don't enter the ruins, don't hunt on the central hill, and become visibly agitated if pursued toward it. Whatever keeps them from the Carcass Hills generally keeps them from The Citadel absolutely.

This makes The Citadel a potential refuge for those fleeing through the forest—if you can reach it. The surrounding hills still require crossing ulvsjael patrol routes. But once inside the ruins, the wolves won't follow.

Why they won't follow is another question no one can answer.

### For Explorers

The Carcass Hills offer the best passage route through southern Fylvrae Sylvrym. Stay on the ridgelines where visibility is good. Move during daylight when the pale stone makes approaching threats visible. The Citadel provides emergency shelter if needed.

Don't descend into the lower levels without significant preparation. The upper ruins are safe enough—abandoned and picked clean. Below the second subterranean level, the architecture changes and the sense of wrongness intensifies. Several well-equipped expeditions have gone deeper. None have returned intact.

The fossils embedded in the limestone might be valuable, but extracting them takes time you may not have. Better to note locations and return with proper support than to spend an hour chipping at rock while wolves circle.
