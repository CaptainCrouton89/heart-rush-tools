### Geography

Wycendeula is a harsh northern region dominated by the White Wastes desert, frozen tundras, and rugged mountain ranges. The Kilburn and Srendar Mountains frame vast plains, while the Tundra Oblivio stretches across the frozen interior. Scattered forests like Fylvrae Sylvrym and Lean D'Riin provide shelter amidst the desolation. Multiple lakes including Tormluk, Trauma Lake, and the Mirror Lakes dot the landscape, while the dragon Ezra Olkanis claims dominion over part of this territory.
