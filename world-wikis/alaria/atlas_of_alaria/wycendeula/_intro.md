# Wycendeula

## Geography

Wycendeula encompasses the entire southern portion of Upoceax—a vast region stretching from the Eceraen Mountains in the far south (above Venalthier) northward to the Sand Reach Mountains. This is a land of colossal forests, frozen tundra, expansive plains, and scattered lakes.

### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach Mountains and Giant Lands
- **East**: The Sea of Daggers and Frozen Sea; God's Bathtub separates Upoceax from Aboyinzu
- **South**: The Eceraen Mountains and Venalthier beyond
- **West**: The Farlands and Kelder Mountains

### Major Features

#### Filvrae Sylvrym

The colossal forested region that dominates central Wycendeula—one of the largest continuous forests in Alaria. Home to the largest concentration of Ulvsjael (werewolves) on the continent.

#### Eyendra

The vast boreal forest of southeastern Wycendeula, stretching from the Eceraen Mountains northward to the Neurian Hills. Unlike Filvrae Sylvrym's wild vitality, Eyendra is haunted—the remnant of an ancient civilization called the Riin who merged with the land two thousand years ago. The forest remembers, and what it remembers makes it dangerous.

The only settlement in Eyendra is Zor, a city-state on Moornik Bay that survives through a pact with the ancient dragon Ezra Olkanis. The forest's interior, particularly the lake district called Kama Sa'malina, is forbidden territory.

#### The White Wastes

A desert region along the eastern coast, distinct from the tropical deserts elsewhere.

#### Plains of Wycendeula

Vast open plains stretching across the eastern portion of the region, roamed by satyr herds.

#### Eceraen Mountains

An east-west mountain range forming the southern boundary, separating Wycendeula from the frozen Venalthier.

### Other Features

- **Kilbyurn and Srendar Mountains**: Frame portions of the vast plains
- **Lakes**: Tormluk, Trauma Lake, Mirror Lakes scattered throughout the plains; Kama Sa'malina (the "dreaming waters") in Eyendra's interior
- **Dragon Territories**: Ezra Olkanis claims the Eyendra forest; other dragons may hold territory in the western mountains

### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Daggers / Frozen Sea**: Eastern waters
- **God's Bathtub**: The sea separating Upoceax from Aboyinzu to the northeast
