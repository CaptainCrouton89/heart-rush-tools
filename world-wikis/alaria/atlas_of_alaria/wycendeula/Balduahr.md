## Balduahr

Tags: state, nation

The last dwarven kingdom in Wycendeula—a mountainous holdout wedged between the satyr-occupied plains to the east and the monster-haunted Kilbyurn range to the west. Balduahr's gray-stone dwarves have survived by being too difficult to conquer and too poor to bother with, though both conditions are changing.

### Geography and Position

Balduahr occupies a section of the mountains where the Kilbyurns descend toward the plains. The kingdom controls three defensible valleys connected by tunnels and fortified passes. Beyond these valleys, the mountains become Kilbyurn territory proper—and the dwarves don't go there.

The Shivyll River originates in Balduahr's territory, providing water, power, and a transportation route. The river also provides the kingdom's greatest vulnerability: it flows east, directly into satyr lands.

### The Cities

#### Graystone

The capital and oldest settlement, carved into a massive granite cliff face in the western valley. Graystone's architecture is defensive to the point of paranoia—the city has no ground-level entrances, only elevated gates accessible by retractable bridges.

The royal halls extend deep into the mountain, with the oldest chambers dating back millennia. The gray-stone dwarves take their name from the particular granite here, which has an unusual blue-gray tint. Mining continues in deep shafts below the city, though yields have declined over centuries.

Graystone's population is perhaps 8,000, down from historical peaks of 20,000 or more. The city can hold more, and the empty districts are maintained for a siege that hasn't come yet.

#### Ironforge

The industrial heart of the kingdom, positioned in the central valley where ore deposits are richest. Ironforge is built around a natural cavern system that provides ventilation for the foundries. The forges run continuously, producing weapons, tools, and trade goods.

Ironforge is more exposed than Graystone—the valley opens eastward, and the city's fortifications are less comprehensive. In the event of serious attack, the plan is evacuation to Graystone rather than defense in place.

The city specializes in practical metalwork rather than artisan pieces. Balduahr steel is serviceable but unremarkable; the kingdom lacks the exotic ores that produce legendary weapons. What they have is volume and reliability.

#### Plainwatch

The frontier outpost, built on a ridge where the mountains give way to the plains. Plainwatch is less a city than a fortified observation post with a permanent garrison. Its towers provide sight lines across dozens of miles of satyr territory.

Plainwatch exists to provide early warning. If the satyr ever unite—if the rumored king consolidates power—the signal fires from Plainwatch will give Graystone and Ironforge time to seal their defenses. The garrison rotates frequently; posting to Plainwatch is considered both honorable and deeply tedious.

The city has perhaps 2,000 permanent residents, mostly military families and support personnel. Civilian population fluctuates with threat assessment.

### Strategic Concerns

Balduahr faces threats from multiple directions:

**The Satyr Question**: The plains hold perhaps a hundred thousand satyrs in scattered, disorganized camps. Individually or in small groups, they're manageable. United under a single leader, they would overwhelm Balduahr through sheer numbers. The kingdom's foreign policy consists largely of ensuring that unification never happens.

**The Kilbyurn Problem**: The western mountains are impassable, not because of terrain but because of what lives there. Granite wyrms, cloudwalkers, mountain drakes—the Kilbyurns are a bestiary of apex predators. Balduahr's western flank is secure only because nothing that enters the deep mountains survives. This also means the kingdom is trapped. There's no escape route west.

**Economic Decline**: The mines are depleting. Trade is difficult—the only viable routes run through satyr territory or across the dangerous White Wastes. Balduahr produces what it needs but has little surplus. The forges run on stockpiled ore that won't last forever.

### Trade and Relations

Balduahr trades minimally with the outside world. Occasional caravans risk the northern route toward Caffas territory, exchanging metalwork for food and supplies. The journey is dangerous and the margins are thin.

Internal trade between the three cities is the economic backbone. Graystone provides governance and deep-mine ore; Ironforge provides finished goods; Plainwatch provides security. The system is self-sustaining but not prosperous.

Diplomatic contact with other nations is rare. Balduahr is too isolated and too poor to matter to continental politics. This is, in its way, a form of protection.
