## Trauma Lake

Tags: lake, geography, dangerous, wycendeula

A large lake on the eastern edge of Eberri Ygonzi, where the forest gives way to the approaches of Kama Sa'malina. Trauma Lake is not part of the greater lake district—it's older, deeper, and wrong in ways that Kama Sa'malina's gilthrain-infested waters are not.

The name is a warning.

### Geography

Trauma Lake covers roughly twelve square miles, making it one of the largest single bodies of water in the region. The shores are rocky on the west (where the lake meets the forest edge) and marshy on the east (where it bleeds into Kama Sa'malina's wetlands). The water is dark—not murky, but deep enough that light disappears a few feet below the surface.

The lake has no visible inlet or outlet. Water levels remain constant regardless of season or rainfall. This should be impossible—evaporation alone should shrink it over time—but Trauma Lake doesn't follow the rules that govern normal hydrology.

### What Happens Here

People who spend time near Trauma Lake experience their worst memories.

Not hallucinations. Not visions. The actual memories, forced to the surface with perfect clarity—every detail preserved, every emotion fresh. Childhood terrors. Losses. Betrayals. The things you've spent years learning to live with come back as if they happened yesterday.

Proximity to the water intensifies the effect. Standing on the shore produces discomfort—intrusive thoughts, unwanted recollections. Touching the water triggers full immersion in a specific traumatic memory. Swimming in it—rare, given the lake's reputation—causes victims to relive trauma after trauma until they drown or are pulled out.

The effect isn't magical in any conventional sense. Divination reveals nothing unusual about the water. Wards against mental intrusion don't help. Whatever Trauma Lake does, it operates outside the frameworks scholars use to understand supernatural phenomena.

### The Lake's Nature

Theories about Trauma Lake:

**The Sponge**: The lake absorbs traumatic experiences from those nearby, then radiates them back. It's accumulated centuries of suffering and now broadcasts it constantly.

**The Mirror**: The lake doesn't create the experiences—it reflects what's already in the victim. Everyone carries trauma; the lake simply removes the defenses that keep it buried.

**The Predator**: Something lives in the lake (or is the lake) and feeds on psychological pain. The memory-forcing is hunting behavior, tenderizing prey before consumption.

**The Wound**: Trauma Lake is damage to reality itself—a place where something broke, and the breaking radiates outward through the people who come near it.

No theory has been proven. The lake resists investigation because investigators can rarely function well enough to study it.

### Documented Effects

**Proximity (within sight of water)**
- Intrusive thoughts
- General unease
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mild depressive symptoms

**Shore contact (within a few feet)**
- Vivid recollection of specific negative experiences
- Emotional dysregulation
- Paranoia
- Compulsion to approach the water

**Water contact**
- Full immersion in traumatic memory
- Loss of awareness of present surroundings
- Physical responses matching the remembered trauma (elevated heart rate, sweating, trembling)
- Drowning risk if contact continues

**Prolonged exposure**
- Permanent psychological damage
- Inability to distinguish past from present
- In extreme cases, catatonia

Recovery from mild exposure takes hours. Recovery from water contact can take weeks. Some people never fully recover—they remain trapped in loops of memory that no treatment has broken.

### The Thing in the Water

Some survivors report seeing something in the lake. Not clearly—Trauma Lake's darkness obscures details—but shapes moving in the depths. Large shapes. Slow-moving. Watching.

Whether this is real or an artifact of the lake's psychological effects is debated. The fact that multiple survivors describe similar shapes (elongated, sinuous, roughly humanoid) suggests either a genuine entity or a shared hallucination the lake induces.

If something lives in Trauma Lake, no one has successfully identified it. Fishing produces nothing—no fish survive in the water. Attempts to sound the lake's depth have produced inconsistent results, with some measurements suggesting the bottom is hundreds of feet down and others suggesting it's much, much farther.

### Why Anyone Goes Near

They don't, if they can avoid it. Trauma Lake sits in a region people already avoid for other reasons. The few who encounter it are usually lost travelers, and they learn quickly to leave.

Some seek the lake intentionally. Scholars, obviously—Trauma Lake represents a genuine mystery, and certain researchers consider psychological damage an acceptable cost for understanding. More disturbing: some people come to the lake deliberately, seeking their worst memories. Guilt-ridden, grieving, or simply self-destructive, they use the lake to punish themselves in ways no other method can match.

The lake has been used for torture. Victims forced to the water's edge, held there until the memories break them. It's more effective than physical pain and leaves no marks. The practice is outlawed everywhere civilized, but Wycendeula isn't civilized.

### Hooks

- **The researcher's offer.** A scholar is mounting an expedition to Trauma Lake with experimental protections—mental wards, memory-dampening potions, carefully planned time limits. She needs guards who can function near the water. Payment is excellent. The survival rate for previous expeditions is not mentioned.

- **The survivor's request.** Someone emerged from Trauma Lake after extended exposure—unusual enough to warrant attention. They're functional, mostly, but they claim they saw something at the bottom. Something that spoke to them. They want to go back, and they want company.

- **The murderer's justice.** A criminal has escaped conventional punishment by fleeing into the wilderness. The victims' families are offering a bounty, but they want the criminal brought to Trauma Lake, not to a court. They want justice the lake's way. Is this acceptable? Is it even justice?

- **The lake is growing.** Reports suggest Trauma Lake's eastern shore is expanding into Kama Sa'malina's territory. If true, the lake is now doing something it has never done in recorded history. What changed, and what happens when two dangerous regions begin to overlap?
