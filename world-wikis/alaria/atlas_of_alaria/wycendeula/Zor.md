## Zor

Tags: city, state, nation, wycendeula, eyendra

Zor is the only permanent settlement in the Eyendra forest—a city-state of roughly 15,000 souls perched on the western shore of Moornik Bay, facing outward toward the sea and deliberately turning its back on the forest that surrounds it on three sides.

The city exists because a dragon permits it. Eight centuries of survival have taught Zor's people that some bargains, however strange, are worth keeping.

### Geography and Position

Zor occupies a rocky promontory jutting into Moornik Bay, with the Eyendra forest pressing close on all landward sides. The position is defensible—cliffs to the east, walls to the west—but defense against conventional enemies has never been Zor's concern. The walls face the forest.

The harbor is modest but well-protected, capable of handling deep-water vessels that make the journey from Wycendeula's other coastal settlements. Most visitors arrive by sea. The land approaches are technically possible but require crossing the coastal fringe of Eyendra, and few outsiders are willing to do so.

The city itself is compact, built primarily of stone quarried from the coastal cliffs rather than timber from the forest. Early Zor learned that lesson—buildings made from Eyendra wood sometimes *moved*, their beams shifting in ways that structural stress couldn't explain. Now wood is imported or taken only from the permitted extraction zones, and builders treat it with salt and iron to be safe.

### The Dragon Pact

Zor's existence is predicated on an agreement with Ezra Olkanis, the ancient dragon who dwells in the Eyendra interior. The pact predates the current city—the original agreement was made with a fishing village that grew into Zor over eight centuries.

**The terms:**

**Zor must not disturb the interior.** The dragon's primary demand. Certain ruins are forbidden. Certain lakes—particularly in the Wer Azenzi region—must never be approached. Certain paths must not be walked. The boundaries shift over decades; the dragon occasionally sends word through means the council does not discuss publicly. Zor obeys without question.

**Zor must report what it observes.** Changes in the forest. Unusual activity. Strangers asking questions about the interior. The dragon wants to know what happens at her borders. Zor's Watchers maintain constant observation and send reports through channels established centuries ago.

**Zor may take from the forest's edge.** The coastal fringe, roughly twenty miles deep, is open for extraction. Timber, herbs, game, freshwater—all permitted. Beyond that invisible boundary, permission ends.

**The dragon may demand service.** Rarely invoked, but part of the pact: when the dragon requires something, Zor provides it. This has meant guides, supplies, specific artifacts, and occasionally people with particular skills. Those summoned to the interior usually return. Usually.

**In exchange, Zor survives.** Whether the dragon actively protects the city or merely refrains from destroying it is a theological debate in Zor. Pragmatists note the distinction is academic—eight centuries of survival speak for themselves.

Every generation, the ruling council formally reaffirms the pact. The dragon has not appeared in person for over two centuries, but no one assumes this means she has forgotten.

### The Telling

The Telling is Zor's central civic ritual—a public recitation of what the city knows about the Riin, the forest, and why both must be respected. The dragon did not demand this; Zor developed it on their own, a way of ensuring that every citizen understands the dangers that surround them.

The Telling occurs on specific calendar days throughout the year, with the largest at midsummer lasting three full days. Children learn the stories before they learn to fish. Participation is expected, though not legally mandatory—social pressure handles enforcement.

The Telling includes:
- **The Warnings**: What happens to those who cross the boundaries. Specific cases, specific fates. This is the most important part.
- **The Signs**: How to recognize when the forest is responding to your presence. What to do if it does.
- **The Riin Stories**: What little is known about the civilization that became the forest—fragments from the Archive, theories from scholars, guesses that have hardened into tradition.
- **The Pact**: How Zor came to exist under the dragon's eye, and what the arrangement requires.

The Telling serves a practical purpose: survival education disguised as civic ritual. But over eight centuries, it has become something more—the core of Zor's identity, the thing that makes them different from every other city in Wycendeula. They live beside a forest that was once people, under the eye of an ancient dragon, and they've built a culture around not forgetting that fact.

### The Archive

Zor maintains an Archive of Riin materials—documents, artifacts, and records recovered over centuries from the coastal fringe. The collection exists partly from scholarly interest, partly from practical necessity: understanding the Riin might help Zor survive them.

The Archive is housed in a fortified building near the council hall, maintained by a small order of scholars. They've pieced together fragments over generations—a rough vocabulary, some grammatical structures, guesses at historical events—but the full meaning of most documents remains opaque. The Riin language died with the Riin, and what remains are puzzles without solutions.

Some materials are restricted. Not because the council fears dangerous knowledge, but because certain artifacts have demonstrated... effects. Documents that induce headaches when read too long. Objects that feel warm in ways that have nothing to do with temperature. The Archive learned caution through experience.

Outside scholars occasionally pay significant sums to access the collection. The Archive permits this selectively—knowledge about the Riin is one of Zor's few valuable exports.

### Governance

Zor is ruled by a hereditary council—five families whose ancestors negotiated the original pact with Ezra Olkanis. Power rotates among the families on a complex schedule, with one family holding the Speakership (primary executive authority) for fifteen years before passing it to the next.

The system is stable but rigid. The pact families derive legitimacy from their role in maintaining the dragon bargain; challenging them means challenging the arrangement that keeps Zor alive. Reform movements exist but rarely gain traction—most citizens are pragmatic enough to prefer a functioning tyranny to an exciting collapse.

The current Speaker is **Maera Theln**, third of her name, a practical woman in her sixties who has held the position for eleven years. She is known for cautious competence rather than vision—exactly what Zor values.

Below the council, governance is handled by guilds: the Foresters' Guild (managing extraction rights), the Fishers' Guild (controlling the harbor), the Shipwrights' Guild, the Archive scholars, and various lesser organizations. The guilds have significant autonomy in their domains but defer to the council on anything touching the pact.

### Economy

Zor's economy is maritime and extractive. The city produces little that requires land beyond the coastal fringe, and imports heavily from other Wycendeula settlements.

**Exports:**
- **Eyendra timber**: The trees of the coastal fringe grow dense and straight, prized for shipbuilding. Zor's foresters harvest carefully within pact boundaries and sell to shipyards across Wycendeula.
- **Herbs and medicinals**: The forest's edge produces plants found nowhere else—some enhanced by proximity to whatever the forest has become. Zor's herbalists process and sell these, though they don't advertise the source.
- **Preserved fish**: Moornik Bay is rich in cold-water species. Zor's fisheries are productive, and salted or smoked fish travels well.
- **Knowledge**: Scholars occasionally pay significant sums to access the Archive or consult with Zor's experts on Riin history.

**Imports:**
- Grain (the coastal fringe doesn't support agriculture)
- Metal goods (no mining within pact boundaries)
- Luxury items (Zor's isolation limits local craft)
- Lumber from outside Eyendra (for buildings where Eyendra wood might be... unreliable)

Trade happens by sea. Overland routes through the forest are theoretically possible but rarely used—the journey is uncomfortable even within the coastal fringe, and the risk of accidentally crossing boundaries deters most merchants.

### Culture

Zor's people are practical, superstitious, and acutely aware of their precarious position. Optimism is considered naive; fatalism is closer to the norm. The city has survived eight centuries through caution and compliance, and its culture reflects that.

**Relationship with the forest**: Complex. Zor depends on the coastal fringe for timber, herbs, and game, but no one forgets what lies deeper. Children are raised on Riin stories not as entertainment but as warnings. The forest is respected the way one respects a sleeping predator—you move quietly and hope it doesn't wake.

**Relationship with the dragon**: Even more complex. Ezra Olkanis is not worshipped, exactly, but she is acknowledged in ways that blur the line. Prayers before entering the forest invoke her patience. Oaths are sworn on her name. When something goes well, people say the dragon permitted it; when something goes wrong, people check whether anyone broke the pact.

**Outsiders**: Welcomed cautiously. Zor trades with the outside world and values contact, but visitors who ask too many questions about the interior make people nervous. The council maintains a quiet list of foreigners who have expressed interest in reaching the dragon or exploring the ruins—such people tend to find their supplies running short and their ship departures suddenly available.

### Notable Locations

#### The Council Hall
The heart of Zor's government, a stone building older than the current city walls. The original pact was supposedly affirmed here, though the building has been rebuilt twice. The Hall contains the formal archive of pact records, the speaker's chambers, and the Recitation Court where major Tellings are conducted.

#### The Archive
A fortified structure housing Riin documents and artifacts. Access is restricted; casual visitors are turned away. Serious scholars can petition for limited access, but the council is selective about who gets to study the materials.

#### The Forester's Gate
The only official exit from the city into the forest, controlled by the Foresters' Guild. All extraction expeditions depart and return through the Gate, where they're logged, inspected, and (quietly) checked for signs of corruption or unauthorized contact.

#### The Watchmount
A tower on the city's western wall, the highest point in Zor. The Watchers—a small civic order—maintain continuous observation of the forest edge. They're looking for signs of change: paths that weren't there yesterday, trees that have moved, the subtle wrongness that precedes forest attention. When they see something, the Forester's Guild adjusts boundaries accordingly.

#### The Harbormeet
The commercial district along the waterfront, where trade happens and foreigners are permitted. Inns, taverns, chandlers, and fish markets cluster here. The Harbormeet is the most "normal" part of Zor—the place where the city's isolation is least apparent and the dragon is rarely mentioned.

### Threats and Tensions

**The Rationalists**: A faction within Zor's merchant class that believes the dragon is dead, gone, or exaggerated. They advocate exploring the interior, exploiting the forest more aggressively, and ending the Telling as superstition. They have never held power, but their numbers grow when trade is poor.

**The Interior Dreams**: People in Zor sometimes dream of the forest—of walking paths they've never seen, of faces that feel familiar but aren't. Most recover. Some don't. The Archive scholars track these incidents, looking for patterns. They haven't found any yet, but the frequency seems to be increasing.

**Resource Pressure**: Zor's population has grown, but the extraction zones haven't. Demand for timber and herbs is outpacing what the coastal fringe can sustainably provide. Eventually, someone will cross a boundary, deliberately or not. What happens then is unclear.

**The Archive's Secrets**: The restricted sections of the Archive may contain knowledge that shouldn't be recovered—Riin techniques, reasons for their choice, possibly even methods to reverse the merger or communicate with what they became. Some scholars believe this knowledge should be destroyed. Others believe it's why the dragon wants it preserved.
