### River Yuforhi

River of euphoria-inducing substance, most intense during the hottest part of the year. Runs through the White Wastes, so impossible to have long term settlement. However, people will meet at Ay'Nbhad to celebrate for a week straight once every year.

The substance also makes pain feel good if you have enough of it, which can result in horrible deaths.

### Gino's Crypt

A lone crypt in a large wasteland of rot and death. This is where Gino the Terrible is chained. His curse spreads to all the surrounding land, located in the White Wastes north of the plains of wycendeula and south of the Caffas Mountains.
