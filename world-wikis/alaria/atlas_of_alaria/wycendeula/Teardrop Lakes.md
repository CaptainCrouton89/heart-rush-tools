## Teardrop Lakes

Tags: lake, geography, eyendra, riin

A cluster of small lakes in eastern Eyendra, marking the northern edge of the Kama Sa'malina lake district. The Teardrop Lakes share some characteristics with their southern neighbors—occasional visual anomalies, a sense of being watched—but the effects are milder here, suggesting the Riin presence is less concentrated.

The name is descriptive: from above, the lakes form a rough teardrop pattern, tapering toward the southeast where they merge into Kama Sa'malina proper. Whether this shape is natural or was intentionally created by the Riin is debated.

The dragon pact does not explicitly forbid approaching the Teardrop Lakes, but Zor's people avoid them anyway. Close enough to Kama Sa'malina to share its reputation, far enough from the coast to offer no practical benefit—the risk exceeds the reward.

See **Kama Sa'malina** for details on the main lake district and **Eyendra** for the forest as a whole.
