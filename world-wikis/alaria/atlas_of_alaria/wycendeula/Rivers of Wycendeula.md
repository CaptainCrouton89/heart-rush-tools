## Rivers of Wycendeula

Tags: rivers, geography

Wycendeula's river systems drain the Kilbyurn Mountains and surrounding highlands, flowing east across the plains toward God's Bathtub. Each river has developed its own character, shaped by the terrain it crosses and—in some cases—the leylines it intersects.

### Major River Systems

#### The Twilight River

The largest river in western Wycendeula, the Twilight River drains the heart of Fylvrae Sylvrym before emptying into the Bay of Wolves. The river originates somewhere in the central forest—its exact headwaters are unknown, as they lie deep in ulvsjael territory—and flows generally westward for over 200 miles.

The Twilight River takes its name from the permanent gloom along its banks. The forest canopy closes over the water for most of its course, creating a tunnel of shadow broken only by occasional gaps where massive trees have fallen. Even at midday, the light along the Twilight River resembles early evening elsewhere.

The river is navigable by small craft for much of its length, though the slow current provides little help. More significantly, the riverbanks serve as the primary hunting corridors for ulvsjael packs. The wolves know that prey must drink, and they patrol the water's edge constantly. Travelers who follow the river move faster than those pushing through undergrowth, but they're far more likely to encounter hunters.

Near its mouth, the Twilight River broadens and slows, spreading into the Octavus Marsh before reaching the bay. This final stretch is the safest portion—the marsh terrain discourages pack tactics—but it's still ulvsjael territory.

#### The Lilsau

A smaller river draining the southern reaches of Fylvrae Sylvrym, flowing southwest toward the Eceraen foothills. The Lilsau originates in the hills near the Carcass Hills and runs roughly parallel to the Wolfmaw peninsula before reaching the coast south of the bay.

The Lilsau is narrow and fast-moving, fed by numerous small tributaries from the surrounding forest. Its waters are clearer than the Twilight River's—the limestone of the Carcass Hills filters the sediment—and support populations of trout-like fish that are one of the few reliable food sources in this area.

The river's course takes it through less densely forested terrain than most of western Wycendeula. The Carcass Hills create gaps in the canopy, and the foothills to the south are rockier and more open. This makes the Lilsau corridor one of the relatively safer routes through the region, though "safer" still means ulvsjael patrols rather than guaranteed confrontation.

#### The Voules

A tributary of the Lilsau, flowing south through the Carcass Hills. The Voules is small—barely twenty feet wide at its broadest—but significant as one of the few water sources in the otherwise dry hills.

The river runs clear and cold, filtered through the limestone that gives the Carcass Hills their character. The taste is slightly mineral, not unpleasant but distinctive. The Voules passes within a mile of The Citadel ruins, providing water access for anyone attempting to explore the ancient city-state.

#### The Davred

A forest river in the northern portion of Fylvrae Sylvrym, flowing generally south before joining the Twilight River system. The Davred is notable primarily for the large satyr camps that once existed along its banks—now abandoned after the ulvsjael expanded their territory centuries ago.

The river passes through some of the densest old-growth forest in Wycendeula. The trees along its banks are enormous, their root systems intertwined with the river itself. In places, the channel flows through natural tunnels formed by root masses, creating enclosed passages that are excellent ambush points.

#### The Cyatri

A smaller tributary in the eastern forest, flowing south from the Kilbyurn foothills. The Cyatri marks the rough boundary between deep ulvsjael territory and the transition zone approaching Balduahr's patrols.

The river is fast and rocky, descending from the mountains through a series of rapids and small waterfalls. The noise of the water can mask approaching threats—or mask your own movement, depending on perspective. Ulvsjael packs hunt along the Cyatri less frequently than along the interior rivers, as the terrain suits their tactics less well.

#### The Syla Mur

A mountain-fed river on the eastern edge of the forest, draining the western Kilbyurn slopes before joining the Shivyll system in Balduahr territory. The Syla Mur is technically outside the main Fylvrae Sylvrym forest, running through the transition zone where trees give way to mountain terrain.

Balduahr patrols occasionally follow the Syla Mur upstream, using it as a scouting route into the forest edge. The dwarves don't enter the deep forest, but they monitor the boundary. The ulvsjael, for their part, rarely push this far east—the open mountain terrain doesn't suit their tactics, and they have no interest in the dwarves' rocky territories.

#### The Mydruli

The largest river in eastern Wycendeula, originating in the central Kilbyurn Mountains. The Mydruli flows east-southeast across the Plains of Wycendeula, eventually reaching the coast south of the Cobbled Coast peninsula.

The Mydruli is fed by glacial melt and runs cold year-round. Its waters are clean and support abundant fish populations—one of the few reliable food sources on the plains besides the buffalo herds. Satyr camps cluster along its banks more densely than elsewhere, though even here settlement is temporary.

Ancient bridge foundations span the Mydruli at several points, remnants of the human civilization that once occupied these plains. The satyr ignore them, but treasure hunters occasionally attempt to excavate the riverbanks.

#### The Shivyll

Balduahr's primary river, flowing southeast from the mountains into the plains. The Shivyll originates near Ironforge, passes east of Graystone through a defended gorge, and emerges onto the lowlands near Plainwatch.

For Balduahr, the Shivyll is both lifeline and vulnerability. The river provides water, hydropower for the forges, and a transportation route for ore. It also provides an invasion path. The gorge section is heavily fortified, but the lower Shivyll is difficult to defend. Balduahr patrols the river extensively and maintains watchtowers along its length.

Beyond Balduahr's control, the Shivyll becomes satyr territory. The river eventually joins the Lygrone before reaching the coast.

#### The Lygrone

A slower, wider river in southeastern Wycendeula, fed by the Shivyll and several minor tributaries. The Lygrone meanders across flat terrain, creating marshland in its lower reaches before emptying into God's Bathtub.

The Lygrone valley shows more signs of ancient habitation than anywhere else on the plains—foundation stones, buried roads, and occasional surface ruins are common. The satyr seem to avoid the area more than geography would explain. Whether this is superstition or something they know that outsiders don't is unclear.

#### The Ilyu

A western tributary system flowing from the lower Kilbyurn range. The Ilyu is smaller than the Mydruli but significant as the primary water source for the western plains.

The river crosses terrain that the satyr claim is haunted—camps along the Ilyu report more disturbances than elsewhere, and several tributaries are avoided entirely. The satyr won't explain why. Whatever the cause, the western plains near the Ilyu are less densely occupied than the eastern regions.

### White Wastes Rivers

#### The Yuforhi

The infamous River Yuforhi flows through the heart of the White Wastes, carrying waters that induce euphoria in those who drink or bathe in them. The effect intensifies during the hottest season, making long-term settlement impossible. See *The White Wastes* entry for full details.

#### The Krelfassa

Flowing east from the Caffas Mountains toward the coast, the Krelfassa passes through the northern White Wastes before emptying into Pugrai D'had. Unlike the Yuforhi, Krelfassa's waters are safe—cold mountain runoff that hasn't absorbed whatever contaminant gives Yuforhi its properties.

The Krelfassa marks an informal boundary between the White Wastes proper and the coastal lowlands. North of the river, survival is possible; south of it, the Wastes begin in earnest.

#### The Elmynfrosk

A southeastern drainage from the Caffas range, the Elmynfrosk flows through the eastern White Wastes before reaching Pugrai Naihim. The river's character changes as it approaches the coast—the stillwater effect from the Pugrai lakes extends upstream, slowing the current to an eerie crawl for the final miles.

Orc and goblin tribes use the upper Elmynfrosk as a water source but avoid the lower reaches. They claim the slow water is a trap—that things wait in the sluggish current for prey to wade in.

#### The Shizander

Originating in the northeastern Kilbyurn Mountains at the Buzagi Wempu headwaters, the Shizander flows east through the northern plains before curving south toward the White Wastes. The river eventually dissipates into the desert sands, though during wet seasons its lower reaches can extend considerably.

The Shizander is notable for temperature fluctuations—the water runs warm in some sections and cold in others, with no consistent pattern. Local theory suggests underground thermal vents, but no one has investigated thoroughly.

### The Tyerferniin

A southern river draining the lower Kilbyurns toward the Eceraen foothills. The Tyerferniin falls outside the main Wycendeula drainage and eventually joins systems flowing into Venalthier.

### The Buzagi Wempu

More a mountain torrent than a proper river, the Buzagi Wempu crashes down from the northern Kilbyurns before calming into the Shizander. The name is satyr in origin, meaning roughly "screaming white"—a reference to the rapids that dominate its upper course.
