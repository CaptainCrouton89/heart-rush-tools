## The Nox

Tags: hills, forest, geography, dangerous, supernatural, wycendeula

The hills at the heart of Eberri Ygonzi, where the forest grows wrong and light goes to die. The Nox is not simply more dangerous than the surrounding wilderness—it is categorically different. Eberri Ygonzi will kill you with teeth and venom and cold. The Nox will kill you with darkness itself.

No one knows how The Nox came to be. It isn't a leyline effect—scholars have checked. It isn't planar bleeding—the usual markers are absent. Whatever makes The Nox what it is predates human presence in Wycendeula and has resisted every attempt at explanation.

### The Darkness

The Nox is dark. Not dim, not shadowed—*dark*. The canopy doesn't explain it; other forests have equally thick canopy and still admit light. In The Nox, light sources fail. Torches burn but don't illuminate. Magical light flickers and dies. Even in clearings where sky should be visible, the darkness presses in.

The darkness isn't empty. It moves. It pools in places like water, flows around obstacles, rises and falls with a rhythm no one has mapped to any cycle. Travelers who've survived The Nox report that the darkness seemed to follow them—thickening when they tried to move quickly, thinning when they stood still, always pressing at the edges of whatever light they could maintain.

The darkness consumes.

People who stay in The Nox too long begin to fade. Not metaphorically—literally. Their edges blur. Their colors drain. They become harder to see, harder to hear, harder to remember. If they stay long enough, they vanish entirely, leaving no body and no trace except a space where someone should be.

### What Hunts Here

The creatures of Eberri Ygonzi avoid The Nox. Coilwights don't enter. Thornbacks flee from its borders. Even wolves and bears give the hills wide berth. The darkness has its own predators, things that have adapted to hunt in conditions where sight is meaningless.

**Hollow Hounds**

Eyeless, earless, covered in skin so black it absorbs what little light penetrates The Nox. Hollow hounds hunt by sensing body heat and vibration, tracking prey through the absolute darkness with terrible precision. They're pack hunters—where one appears, others are circling.

The name comes from their bodies. Hollow hounds seem partially empty, their flesh loose on their frames, their movements suggesting internal cavities where organs should be. When killed, their bodies collapse into something like deflated skins. What animates them isn't muscle and bone in any normal sense.

Hollow hounds don't eat prey. They drag victims into the deepest dark and leave them there. Whether this serves some purpose or is simply behavior without function, no one knows.

**The Stalking**

Not a creature—an event. Those who enter The Nox alone sometimes become aware that something is following them. Not a hollow hound, not any visible predator—just presence. Footsteps that echo their own. Breathing that doesn't match theirs. The certainty that if they turn around, something will be there.

The Stalking never attacks. It doesn't need to. Victims fleeing The Stalking stumble into hollow hounds, fall from ravines, or simply run until the darkness takes them. The Stalking is patient. It can follow for days. No one has survived long enough to discover what happens if you stop running.

**The Fade**

People who vanish in The Nox don't always stay gone. Sometimes, years later, they reappear—but changed. The Fade are human-shaped absences, silhouettes where light refuses to go. They don't speak, don't respond to their names, don't seem to recognize the people they once knew. They simply walk, following paths that lead back into The Nox.

The Fade aren't aggressive. They can be touched—their surface feels like cold air, like the moment before a void—but they don't react. If blocked from their path, they'll wait indefinitely. If released, they continue walking.

Following a Fade into The Nox has been tried exactly once. No one returned.

### Why The Nox Exists

Unknown.

The Nox doesn't correspond to any planar boundary, leyline intersection, or magical event in recorded history. It isn't growing—surveys a century apart showed no expansion. It isn't shrinking. It simply *is*, as if darkness itself decided to pool in one place and stay.

Theories exist:
- A god died here, and The Nox is the shadow it left behind
- The Nox is a wound in reality, a place where Malstaris bleeds through
- An ancient ritual went wrong, anchoring darkness to the land permanently
- The Nox is alive—a single massive entity pretending to be geography

None of these theories have supporting evidence. The Nox resists investigation more effectively than any military fortification.

### Entry and Exit

The Nox has no fixed boundary. The hills rise gradually from Eberri Ygonzi's forest floor, and the darkness thickens in the same way—incrementally, imperceptibly, until suddenly you're in it. Woodsmen claim they can feel the transition, a pressure in the chest, a dampening of sound, but by the time the feeling is distinct, you've already crossed.

Exit is harder. The Nox doesn't keep people in through physical barriers—it keeps them in through disorientation. In the darkness, all directions feel the same. People walk in circles without knowing it. They walk deeper when trying to walk out.

The only reliable exit method: maintain continuous physical contact with a fixed marker and follow it backward. Rope anchored outside The Nox works. A line of stones works. Memory does not work—the darkness interferes with spatial reasoning in ways that defeat even experienced navigators.

### Those Who Enter

No one enters The Nox intentionally. Those who end up there arrived by accident—lost in Eberri Ygonzi, fleeing something worse, or simply unlucky enough to miss the signs.

A few have survived to describe it:
- A hunter who tied herself to a tree and waited for dawn (dawn doesn't come inside The Nox, but it comes outside, and she was near enough the edge to feel the difference)
- A scholar's expedition that entered as fifteen and exited as three, with none able to explain what happened to the rest
- A criminal who emerged two years after entering, unable to account for the time and showing signs of the Fade that eventually stabilized

Their reports agree on the key points: the darkness is absolute, it moves with intention, and staying too long has consequences beyond death. They disagree on details—one describes the darkness as warm, another as freezing, a third as having no temperature at all. The Nox may affect different people differently, or their experiences may have been too traumatic to remember accurately.

### No Reason to Go

The Nox contains nothing worth retrieving. No valuable resources grow there. No ruins hide ancient treasures. No mysteries warrant the risk of investigation. The Nox exists to be avoided, full stop.

If you find yourself approaching The Nox—if the light begins to fail without explanation, if sound begins to dampen, if the forest feels suddenly heavier—turn back. Don't investigate. Don't push forward to see how far it extends. Just leave.

The darkness doesn't negotiate. It doesn't give second chances. It simply takes.

### Hooks

- **A Fade is walking.** Someone recognized as a woodsman who vanished in The Nox seven years ago has been spotted walking through farmland, heading steadily toward the forest. His family wants to stop him, talk to him, understand what happened. But he won't stop walking, and if they can't reach him before he enters the forest, they want to follow. They're hiring.

- **Something came out.** A hollow hound has been found dead outside The Nox—the first time one has ever been seen beyond its borders. Scholars are offering significant sums for the carcass, but getting it to them means transporting a hollow hound corpse through Eberri Ygonzi. And the question remains: what drove it out?

- **The expedition's survivor.** The scholar's expedition that lost twelve people had one member who kept a journal. The journal was recovered; the scholar wasn't. The journal describes something in The Nox—not the darkness or the hounds, but something else, something at the center. Something that was watching. The scholar's estate wants the journal interpreted, and if possible, they want to know if the scholar could still be alive.

- **The light that worked.** A dying priest claims that holy light from Celestia penetrates The Nox where other light fails. No one has tested this claim. No one wants to test it. But if it's true, it would be the first vulnerability The Nox has ever shown—and the implications for what The Nox actually is would be significant.
