## Eceraen Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, border

A rugged east-west mountain range forming the southern boundary of Wycendeula, separating the forested lowlands from the frozen wastes of Venalthier beyond. The Eceraen range stretches hundreds of miles from the western coast to the Kilbyurn junction, creating an effective barrier between the two regions.

### Geography

The Eceraen Mountains rise abruptly from the southern edge of Fylvrae Sylvrym, climbing from forested foothills to snow-capped peaks within twenty miles. The highest summits reach perhaps 14,000 feet, perpetually glaciated and frequently obscured by cloud.

The range is relatively young geologically, with sharp peaks and deep valleys rather than the rounded forms of older mountains. Cliff faces are common; exposed rock is dark volcanic basalt shot through with lighter granite intrusions. The terrain is rugged throughout, offering few easy passages.

The northern slopes—facing Wycendeula—receive less precipitation than the southern face and support patchy forest up to about 8,000 feet elevation. Above the treeline, alpine meadows give way to bare rock and permanent snowfields. The southern slopes are substantially harsher, catching the full force of cold winds from Venalthier.

### As a Barrier

The Eceraen Mountains effectively seal southern Wycendeula from the frozen continent beyond. This is both geographic and practical:

**Geographic**: No passes cross the range at useful elevations. The lowest points are still above 9,000 feet, choked with snow for most of the year and requiring technical climbing even in summer. The range is simply impassable for caravans, armies, or casual travelers.

**Practical**: Even if passages existed, Venalthier offers nothing worth reaching. The frozen wastes beyond the mountains are lifeless tundra extending to the polar ice cap. No civilization exists there; no resources justify the crossing. The mountains don't guard anything—they simply mark the edge of habitable land.

This makes the Eceraen range more a boundary than a barrier in the strategic sense. No one defends it because no one attacks from the south. The mountains simply are, and everything beyond them is nothing.

### Wildlife and Hazards

The Eceraen foothills support similar wildlife to the Fylvrae Sylvrym lowlands, though the forest thins quickly with elevation. Above the treeline, the fauna shifts to alpine specialists: mountain goats, marmots, raptors. Large predators are present but less common than in the lowland forest—the ulvsjael don't climb this high, and the terrain doesn't support pack hunting.

The mountains themselves pose the primary hazards:

**Avalanches** are common on the steeper slopes, particularly in spring when accumulated snow becomes unstable. The dark rock absorbs heat unevenly, creating fracture points in the snowpack.

**Rockfall** occurs regularly along cliff faces, where freeze-thaw cycles loosen stone. The sound can echo for miles, sometimes triggering additional slides.

**Weather** changes rapidly at elevation. Clear mornings become whiteout blizzards within hours. Summer temperatures that allow comfortable hiking can drop below freezing by nightfall.

**Navigation** is difficult above the treeline, where landmarks become obscured by snow and distance. The mountains look similar from peak to peak; disorientation is common even for experienced climbers.

### Azkirk

In the western Eceraen foothills, where the mountains meet the coast, stands a lone marker that appears on some maps as Azkirk. The name is old—possibly pre-satyr—and its meaning is lost.

What Azkirk marks is unclear. Some maps show it as a settlement, others as a point of interest, still others as a warning. The location corresponds to a rocky headland where the mountain slopes plunge directly into the sea, creating a natural landmark visible from ships offshore.

Those who've investigated report finding nothing but stone—no structures, no artifacts, no obvious significance. Yet the name persists across centuries of cartography, copied from map to map by scribes who know only that something important once happened there, or will happen, or is happening still.

Local satyr avoid the area, claiming the ground is "marked." They don't explain what this means. The ulvsjael don't come this far south regardless. Whatever Azkirk represents, it remains a minor mystery in a region full of greater ones.

### For Travelers

The Eceraen Mountains are not a destination. They mark the southern limit of habitable Wycendeula. Travel into the range is possible for experienced mountaineers with proper equipment, but there's nothing to find beyond challenge and scenery.

The foothills offer easier terrain than the forest lowlands. The ulvsjael hunt here less frequently, and the rocky ground provides better defensive positions. Following the mountain base is a viable route for those traveling east-west through southern Wycendeula—slower than direct passage but significantly safer.

Don't attempt to cross the range. Whatever lies beyond isn't worth dying to reach.
