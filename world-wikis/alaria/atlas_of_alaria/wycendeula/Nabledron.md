## Nabledron

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi, leyline

A ruined fortress on Wycendeula's eastern coast, built at the intersection of the force and fire leylines where they cross into God's Bathtub. Once the ambitious project of a Free Isles noble, now a shattered monument to the dangers of leyline experimentation.

### History

Roysann of the Free Isles was wealthy, brilliant, and convinced he could revolutionize warfare. His plan was elegant in theory: use force magic to compress fire into stable spheres of glass, creating weapons of devastating power that could be manufactured and stockpiled. The leyline crossing at Nabledron provided the raw magical energy; all he needed was to harness it.

For three years, the project showed promise. Roysann's artificers produced dozens of successful prototypes—fist-sized glass orbs containing compressed flames that burned with unusual intensity when shattered. The fortress grew as funding poured in from interested parties across Alaria.

The catastrophe occurred during an attempt to scale up production. A batch of larger orbs—intended as siege weapons—proved unstable. One cracked. The chain reaction that followed destroyed the central workshops, killed Roysann and his senior artificers, and scattered burning glass across a mile radius. The fortress's outer walls survived; everything inside did not.

### The Ruins Today

Nabledron's stone walls still stand, blackened and partially collapsed but recognizable as military architecture. The interior is a maze of fused stone, twisted metal, and glass—some of it still dangerously hot centuries later. The leylines continue to pulse through the site, feeding residual fires that burn without fuel in the deepest chambers.

The ruins are not uninhabited. Creatures drawn to elemental energy have claimed various sections:

**Glass Spawn**: Semi-molten entities that formed from the original catastrophe, animated by the leyline crossing. They resemble humanoid figures made of flowing glass and liquid fire. They don't leave the ruins but will attack anything that enters.

**Fire Elementals**: The sustained leyline exposure has created a thin point to Yolus, allowing minor fire elementals to slip through. They're drawn to the glass spawn but will attack other intruders.

**Scavengers**: Despite the dangers, treasure hunters periodically attempt the ruins. Some seek Roysann's notes; others hunt for intact fire orbs, which command extraordinary prices. Most don't return. Those who do rarely go back.

### The Surviving Orbs

Not all of Roysann's creations were destroyed. An unknown number of fire orbs survived the catastrophe—some scattered across the surrounding terrain, others buried in the ruins. They remain stable until cracked, at which point they release their compressed contents explosively.

Finding an intact orb is worth a fortune. The Free Isles, various military powers, and private collectors all pay premium prices. The catch is extraction: the orbs are scattered through glass spawn territory, often half-buried in fused debris, and the ruins themselves are actively hostile.

Several confirmed orbs have reached the market over the centuries. At least one was used in an assassination. Others sit in private collections, their owners gambling that stability will hold.

### The Leyline Crossing

The force and fire leylines intersect directly beneath the central ruins, creating a zone of amplified and unpredictable magical effects. This is what made Roysann's project possible—and what made his failure so catastrophic.

Effects near the crossing include:
- Flames that burn in unusual colors and resist extinguishing
- Objects that become difficult to move or stop once in motion
- Sudden temperature spikes or drops
- Glass that forms spontaneously from superheated sand and dust

The leylines continue into God's Bathtub from here, their effects dissipating over the water. Sailors report occasional thermal plumes and strange currents offshore.

### Approaching Nabledron

The ruins are visible from considerable distance—the blackened walls stand out against the pale coastal terrain. No roads lead here anymore; the land route requires crossing either the White Wastes or the coastal scrublands, both difficult terrain.

Approach by sea is theoretically possible but complicated by the leyline effects on coastal waters. Ships report unpredictable currents and occasional steam vents. The Pugrai lakes to the south create navigation hazards of their own.

Most expeditions approach overland from the north, following the coast from Caffas territory. The journey takes several days and requires careful provisioning—there's nothing between Nabledron and the mountains but empty wasteland.
