## Echea

Tags: state, nation

A tiny gnomish magocracy on a mountainous peninsula at the tip of the Watar peninsula, jutting into the Middle Sea. Echea is essentially two enormous mountains—the Iri Mountains—covered in universities, research facilities, and the workshops that produce some of the finest magitech in Alaria.

Vetoed from the Aldriktch Trade Alliance by Camaran. The Echi don't seem to care much—they're too busy with scholarship to worry about trade politics.

### Adi Assabehta

The capital city, built into and around the larger of the two Iri peaks. A vertical city of towers, bridges, and carved chambers, home to the greatest universities in Alaria. Paragon-attuned elementalists teach here in every discipline. Students come from across the world to study, and work on magical artifacts part-time to fund their education.

**The Secret:** A mad scholar opened a portal to Zylogmus Eternus, binding the entire city to the flipside of the Material Plane. People are mysteriously dying—slowly, inexplicably. The scholar was the first to die. No one knows about the portal. Most residents don't believe the deaths are connected, attributing them to various causes. Over the coming years, the capital will slowly empty as people flee what they don't understand.

### Adal

The second city, on the smaller Iri peak. More focused on practical applications of magic—forges, workshops, and the production facilities where university artifacts are manufactured for export.

### The Iri Mountains

The two massive peaks that make up almost all of Echea's territory. Once, the Echi gnomes and Coghead goblins worked these mountains together—gnomes providing magic, goblins providing machinery. That partnership ended in massacre two centuries ago, and another genocide fifty years ago finished what remained. The Echi don't talk about it.

The mountains are riddled with old tunnels, abandoned Coghead workshops, and sealed chambers that the universities prefer to forget exist.

### The Universities

Echea's universities are its heart. They function as schools, research institutions, artifact factories, and military academies all at once. Every student learns elemental magic, combat tactics, and practical crafting. The result is a population of highly educated elemental war casters who rarely fight—but when they do, they're terrifying.

The universities compete fiercely for prestige, funding, and the best students. Academic politics in Echea can be as vicious as any court intrigue.

### Coastal Settlements

Small fishing villages cling to the rocky coastline below the mountains. These communities exist mostly to feed the cities above and provide port access for visiting scholars and trade ships.
