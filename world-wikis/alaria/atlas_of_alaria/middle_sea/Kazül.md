## Kazül

Tags: state, nation

A desert kingdom on the southern Middle Sea coast, ruled by King Salomor and his legendary summoning ring. Famous for producing the finest glass in Alaria. A rigid caste system keeps the nobility wealthy and the laborers trapped.

South of Glorin, southwest of Zintacas. The interior is the Jahazai Desert—harsh, ancient, and full of buried ruins.

### Urzahd

The capital, in the northwest where the river from Glorin provides life. Seat of King Salomor's court and home to the finest glass workshops in the world. The nobility live in elegant estates; laborers crowd the outer districts.

### The River Settlements

Most of Kazül's population lives along the river that flows from Glorin. Settlements stretch up the river valley almost to Glorin's border: Sigiel, Duhkmayas, Shohas, Malki, and others. Without the river, the interior would be uninhabitable.

### Gulf of Kazül

The western coastline, where fishing villages and small ports connect Kazül to sea trade.

### Peecked Hills

Western hills between the coast and the desert interior.

### Jahazai Desert

The vast interior desert. Harsh, beautiful, deadly. Ancient ruins lie buried beneath the sands—remnants of civilizations that existed before the desert claimed the land. Treasure hunters venture in; many don't return.

### Towers of Ederhi

Ancient spires of fused glass rising from the Jahazai sands. No one knows who built them. The glass is unlike anything modern artisans can produce—harder, clearer, faintly luminescent at night. No entrance has ever been found. The towers remain a mystery.

### Bhutag

A town in the eastern desert near the coast, built atop millennia-old catacombs. The locals avoid the deeper tunnels. Artifacts occasionally emerge from the depths, sold to collectors who don't ask questions about what else might be down there.

### Boxwatch

A settlement in the western hills, overlooking the Gulf of Kazül.

### Dygalva & Seneka

Northern settlements along the river, closer to Glorin.

### Buffalo Islands

An archipelago offshore to the south, in the waters between Kazül and Okesha's Passage.

### Okesha's Passage

The waterway on the northwest side of Erpeus Island, connecting different parts of the Middle Sea.

### Pavik's Cave

A coastal cave system on the western shore, near the Gulf of Kazül. Local legends speak of something living in the depths.

### Porizzon Island

An island offshore to the southwest.
