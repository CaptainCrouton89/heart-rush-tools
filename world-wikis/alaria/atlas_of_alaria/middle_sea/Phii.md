## Pii

Tags: island, geography

Pii is a volcanic island in the Forgotten Sea, east of the Ofrenia Passage and well away from the political chaos of the three kingdoms. The island is dominated by Mount Kajiit, an active volcano whose caldera houses the Verucan capital of Mereiki. Smoke rises perpetually from the peak, and at night the glow of lava reflects off the clouds—a beacon visible for miles.

The Verucan fire dwarves have made Pii their home, building a civilization within and around the volcano. They're famous for their weapons, their tempers, and their determination to stay out of other people's wars while profiting from them.

### Phiora

The Verucan nation that occupies Pii. See the full state entry for political details.

### Mount Kajiit

The dominant volcano that defines Pii's geography and Verucan culture. Mount Kajiit is active—lava flows regularly, geothermal vents steam constantly, and the mountain occasionally reminds everyone that it could destroy the island whenever it chooses.

The Verucan have built their forges into the volcano's flanks, using the geothermal heat to achieve temperatures impossible elsewhere. The deepest forges, where the finest weapons are made, tap directly into magma chambers. Working there is dangerous—and produces results that justify the risk.

Mount Kajiit's history includes a catastrophic eruption in ancient times, triggered deliberately by a follower of Dyos to end the daemon wars. The resulting volcanic winter lasted millennia and killed millions across Alaria. The Verucan arrived long after, but they live with the knowledge that their home is built on the site of one of history's greatest disasters.

### Mereiki

The capital city, built within Mount Kajiit's caldera. Mereiki is unlike any other city in Alaria—structures carved from volcanic rock, streets lit by lava channels, and a permanent sulfurous smell that visitors find overwhelming but residents barely notice.

The city is organized around the great forges, which form the economic and cultural heart of Verucan society. The ruling siblings maintain their courts here, competing for influence in the shadow of the volcano that could bury them all.

Access to Mereiki requires climbing the mountain's flanks through switchback paths carved into the rock. The journey is arduous, deliberately so—the Verucan don't make it easy for visitors to reach their home.

### Kedari Emnath

A region on Mount Kajiit's slopes where obsidian flows have created fields of volcanic glass. The Verucan harvest this obsidian for blades, ritual objects, and trade goods. Walking through Kedari Emnath is treacherous—the glass is sharp, the footing uncertain, and new flows can appear without warning.

The name translates roughly to "the black tears" in the Verucan tongue, referring to legends about the volcano weeping for those who died in the ancient eruption.

### Doga

The only coastal settlement of any size, positioned on Pii's western shore. Doga handles what little maritime trade Phiora conducts—the Verucan dislike the sea, but someone has to receive the food shipments and dispatch the weapon crates.

The village has a mixed population: Verucan who've overcome their aversion to water (or who lost the argument about who had to live at sea level), and a scattering of other races who serve as intermediaries between Phiora and the outside world.

### Eir

A small rocky island north of Pii, uninhabited except for seabirds and the occasional hermit. Eir has no fresh water, no harbor, and no value except as a navigation landmark.

Local legend claims Eir was once part of Pii, blown off during the ancient Kajiit eruption. Whether true or not, the island's basalt composition matches the volcano's output. The Verucan consider Eir ill-omened—a reminder of what the mountain can do—and avoid it.

Shipwrecked sailors occasionally wash up on Eir's shores. Most don't survive long enough for rescue. The few who do report hearing strange sounds from the rocks at night, though this is usually attributed to wind, waves, and dehydration.

### The Forgotten Sea

The waters surrounding Pii are called the Forgotten Sea, though no one quite remembers why. The name appears on charts dating back centuries, and various explanations have been proposed—none convincing.

The sea is calm most of the year, with predictable currents that make navigation relatively easy. Storms are rare but violent when they come, often accompanied by increased volcanic activity from Mount Kajiit. Whether the volcano responds to weather or causes it, the Verucan aren't sure.

Trade routes connect Pii to the Ofrenia Passage, the Middle Sea proper, and points south. Most merchants stop at Doga, conduct their business quickly, and leave. The Verucan prefer it that way.
