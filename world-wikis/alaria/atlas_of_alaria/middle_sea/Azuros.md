## Azuros

Tags: state, nation

Azuros clings to the highest peaks of northern Erpeus, a collection of stone villages surrounding the ancient Shogi Monastery. The wind here never stops—it scours the rocks, howls through the passes, and shapes everything about life on the mountain. The monks who live here have learned to work with that wind, developing air magic techniques that produce results other practitioners consider impossible.

Reaching Azuros requires climbing through Lier's Murder Hills and then ascending paths that would challenge mountain goats. Most people never try. Those who do arrive in a place that feels untouched by time—the same stone buildings, the same rituals, the same silence that has defined the monastery for centuries.

### The Shogi Monastery

The heart of Azuros, a complex of stone buildings that have grown organically over centuries. The architecture is simple, functional, and ancient—nothing decorative, nothing wasted. The monastery houses training halls, meditation chambers, libraries of wind-worn texts, and the quarters of the monks who've dedicated their lives to the order.

The Council of the Silent Elders governs from here, each member a head monk of one of the monastery's subsects. They meet rarely and speak less—most governance happens through tradition and mutual understanding rather than explicit decision.

Above even the Council is the Rhea monk, the mysterious figure who teaches the most advanced practitioners. The Rhea monk's quarters lie at the monastery's highest point, accessible only to those summoned. What happens there, no one discusses.

### Azur

The largest village, positioned along the primary path to the monastery. Pilgrims and the rare traders stop here before the final ascent. The residents are laypeople—families who support the monastery through farming and crafts but haven't taken full vows. Life is simple, governed by the monastery's rhythms.

### Pul

A smaller settlement higher up the mountain, home to monks in the middle stages of their training. The buildings here are even more austere than Azur's—stone boxes with minimal furnishings, designed to minimize distraction from practice.

### The Peaks

Above the settlements, the mountains rise into regions where only the most advanced monks venture. The wind here is constant and violent, the air thin enough to challenge unprepared climbers. Monks who've mastered air attunement walk these heights as easily as lowlanders walk meadows—floating on currents, drawing breath from wind that would suffocate others.

The highest peaks are sacred spaces where the most powerful monks meditate, sometimes for weeks at a time. What they seek or find there, they don't share with outsiders.

### The Path to Azuros

Reaching the monastery requires traversing Lier's Murder Hills—a journey dangerous enough that many pilgrims never arrive. The monks don't acknowledge this problem. Violence is forbidden, even in self-defense, and they won't escort travelers or clear the roads.

Some pilgrims hire guards in Hessam. Others travel in groups for safety. Many turn back. Those who make it through arrive at Azuros exhausted, robbed, sometimes wounded—and find no sympathy. The journey is considered the first test of devotion.

### Air Magic Tradition

The Shogi Monastery has developed air magic techniques found nowhere else on Alaria. Students begin by learning to feel the wind—not just as weather but as a presence, a partner, eventually an extension of themselves.

Advanced practitioners achieve remarkable abilities:
- **Wind-walking**: Moving across air as if it were solid ground
- **Storm-speaking**: Communicating with or through weather phenomena
- **Lightning-calling**: Drawing electrical discharge from the clouds
- **Flight**: True flight, not just gliding or jumping—sustained movement through the air

The greatest monks are said to become one with the wind itself, their physical forms optional. Whether this is truth or legend, no outsider has confirmed.

### Relations with the World

Azuros doesn't have relations with the world—it has an absence of them. The monastery trades nothing, fights no one, and participates in no politics. Lier's merchants have tried repeatedly to establish commerce; they always fail. The gnomes of Mkinti don't bother trying.

Occasionally, a trained monk leaves the monastery to serve elsewhere—as a teacher, advisor, or guardian. These departures are never purchased or requested. The monk simply knows they're called to go. Their abilities make them valuable, but they serve on their own terms and leave when they choose.

The outside world views Azuros with a mixture of awe and frustration. The monks possess powers that could change the course of wars, and they refuse to use them. They hold knowledge that scholars would kill for, and they share nothing. They're admired and resented in equal measure—and they don't seem to notice either.
