## Camaran

Tags: state, nation

A human republic south of the Kharvorn Mountains, known for its manufacturing economy, anti-magic laws, and rigid bureaucracy. Camaran produces non-magical goods for export across the Middle Sea—tools, textiles, clockwork, precision instruments. The population is industrious, educated, and deeply suspicious of Deoric magic.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though increasingly isolationist. Vetoed Echea's membership. The alliance is strained by Camaran's inward turn.

### Rathscar

The capital city, seat of the High Camarik Council. A city of orderly streets, imposing civic buildings, and endless paperwork. This is where mages must register for licenses if they wish to practice elemental magic legally. The bureaucracy is legendary—inspectors, forms, annual renewals, restricted zones.

Manufacturing district produces goods shipped across the Middle Sea. The wealthy live in townhouses near the council halls; workers crowd tenements near the factories.

### Breidlheiss Basin

The giant-inhabited basin east of Camaran, between Camaran and Adron. Camaran runs mining operations in the foothills, encroaching on giant territory while insisting the giants have no legitimate land claims. When giants retaliate, Camaran launches "defensive" expeditions and claims more land as security buffer.

The situation is morally grey: Camaran portrays giants as savage aggressors, but the aggression is largely retaliatory. Some Camarans who've dealt with the Ngül Mountain communities know giants can coexist peacefully with smaller folk—but admitting this would threaten mining interests.

### Ngül Mountains

Northern mountains home to Güli mountain giants and thousands of Kimril who live peacefully alongside them. This community proves giants aren't inherently hostile—an inconvenient truth for Camaran's official position on the Breidlheiss situation.

### Foothills and Farmland

Most of Camaran is temperate farmland and rolling hills, fed by rivers flowing down from the Kharvorn. Small towns dot the countryside, supplying food and raw materials to the manufacturing centers. The climate is continental—cold winters, warm summers, reliable rain.
