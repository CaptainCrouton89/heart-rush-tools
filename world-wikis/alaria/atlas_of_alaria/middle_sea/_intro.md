# Middle Sea

## Geography

The Middle Sea is a large body of water lying south of the Kharvorn Mountains, in the temperate heart of Clueanda. It occupies the space between Clueanda to the north and the great peninsula extending from Rimihuica to the south, forming a distinctive upside-down U shape of coastline that creates an enormous amount of valuable coastal real estate.

### Shape and Position

The sea forms where land from both Clueanda and Rimihuica curves to create an enclosed basin:
- **Northern shore**: The Clueanda coast curves in a broad arc, hosting the major trading states
- **Southern shore**: A large peninsula or island extends northward from Rimihuica
- **Western passage**: The wide waters narrow to a much straighter, narrower strait that runs due-west, eventually connecting all the way to the Western Isles—this chokepoint is controlled by Tarkhon

### Coastal States (Clueanda Shore)

Traveling counterclockwise from the eastern end of the Middle Sea, the northern shore hosts these states, forming a curved "roof" around the Rimihuican peninsula:

- **Adron** (easternmost, where the Kharvorn Mountains end)
- **Camaran**
- **Ubrik**
- **Bestacia**
- **Erasnus**
- **Watar**
- **Echea**
- **Ta'minn**
- **Thespia**
- **Stipen**
- **Zintacas**
- **Kazül** (near where Tarkhon begins)

### Connection to Tarkhon

West of Kazül, the Middle Sea region transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. The broad upside-down U of the Middle Sea narrows dramatically into the Tarkhon Strait—a due-west passage that serves as the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the open ocean beyond the Western Isles.

### Coastal States (Rimihuica Shore)

The southern shore of the Middle Sea belongs to Rimihuica, dominated by:

#### Ofrenia

A large island (technically separated from the mainland by Swampdeep) that extends northward into the Middle Sea, creating the distinctive upside-down U shape. Ofrenia is divided among three independent states ruled by warring siblings—a political powder keg at the heart of Middle Sea commerce. The island is absolutely central to the region's military and economic affairs.

#### Swampdeep

A saltwater swamp and bayou region that technically separates Ofrenia from the Rimihuican mainland. Located south of Ofrenia, appearing as a cloudy white band between the Gray Sea and the Oblivion storm to the east.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Gray Sea**: The waters north of Swampdeep, between Ofrenia and the mainland
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm east of the Middle Sea proper—anyone who enters forgets everything and sails out in confusion

### Fantasy Lakes

Home to many rusalka and dwarven skeletons. Lots of loot at the bottom of the lakes.
