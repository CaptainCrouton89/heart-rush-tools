# Middle Sea

## Geography

The Middle Sea is a large body of water lying south of the Kharvorn Mountains, in the temperate heart of Clueanda. It occupies the space between Clueanda to the north and the great peninsula extending from Rimihuica to the south, forming a distinctive upside-down U shape of coastline that creates an enormous amount of valuable coastal real estate.

### Shape and Position

The sea forms where land from both Clueanda and Rimihuica curves to create an enclosed basin:
- **Northern shore**: The Clueanda coast curves in a broad arc, hosting the major trading states
- **Southern shore**: A large peninsula or island extends northward from Rimihuica
- **Western passage**: The wide waters narrow to a much straighter, narrower strait that runs due-west, eventually connecting all the way to the Western Isles—this chokepoint is controlled by Tarkhon

### Coastal States (Clueanda Shore)

Traveling counterclockwise from the eastern end of the Middle Sea, the northern shore hosts these states, forming a curved "roof" around the Rimihuican peninsula:

- **Adron** (easternmost, where the Kharvorn Mountains end)
- **Camaran**
- **Ubrik**
- **Bestacia**
- **Erasnus**
- **Watar**
- **Echea**
- **Ta'minn**
- **Thespia**
- **Stipen**
- **Zintacas**
- **Kazül** (near where Tarkhon begins)

### Connection to Tarkhon

West of Kazül, the Middle Sea region transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. The broad upside-down U of the Middle Sea narrows dramatically into the Tarkhon Strait—a due-west passage that serves as the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the open ocean beyond the Western Isles.

### Coastal States (Rimihuica Shore)

The southern shore of the Middle Sea belongs to Rimihuica, dominated by:

#### Ofrenia

A large island (technically separated from the mainland by Swampdeep) that extends northward into the Middle Sea, creating the distinctive upside-down U shape. Ofrenia is divided among three independent states ruled by warring siblings—a political powder keg at the heart of Middle Sea commerce. The island is absolutely central to the region's military and economic affairs.

#### Swampdeep

A saltwater swamp and bayou region that technically separates Ofrenia from the Rimihuican mainland. Located south of Ofrenia, appearing as a cloudy white band between the Gray Sea and the Oblivion storm to the east.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Gray Sea**: The waters north of Swampdeep, between Ofrenia and the mainland
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm east of the Middle Sea proper and south of Adron—a hundred-mile-wide fog bank that causes complete memory loss. Those who enter forget everything and sail out in confusion, with no recollection of what lies within. At the center of Oblivion lies the Maw of Chao, a volcanic island that serves as the hatching ground for thousands of dragons. The memory fog protects this sacred place, where Damasaki Edara (daughter of the great dragon Nagatayora) raises dragon eggs before setting the young dragons free. In ancient times, the dragon riders of Adrus (now Adron) would brave the fog to reach the Maw of Chao and receive Damasaki Edara's blessing, earning the right to raise and ride with dragons

## Notable Locations

### Fantasy Lakes

Home to many rusalka and dwarven skeletons. Lots of loot at the bottom of the lakes.

### Ofrenia - Tornia

Tornia is the northernmost state within Ofrenia, one of the three kingdoms controlled by feuding siblings on the strategically vital island at the heart of the Middle Sea.

#### Catalina

The capital city of Tornia, located on a river delta.

##### Besnoumeru

Besnoumeru is an extremely wealthy city within Catalina, where merchants have made fortunes by predicting changes in supply and demand with uncanny accuracy. Rent is impossibly expensive—very few options exist for those on a budget. The gorgeous city architecture reflects centuries of wealth accumulation, and its position on the river delta makes it a crucial trade hub.

However, Besnoumeru's prosperity comes with a dark edge: the city is secretly controlled by time-gangs, criminal organizations that use temporal manipulation to maintain their iron grip on commerce and politics.

#### Glowbud Forest

A forest in Tornia, now overrun by feral jaguars that escaped captivity from the royal menagerie in Catalina. The king once kept these great cats as exotic pets, but they broke free and established themselves in Glowbud Forest. The jaguars have grown bold and dangerous, actively hunting people who enter the woods. What was once a peaceful woodland is now deadly hunting ground, and travelers avoid the forest whenever possible.

### Lier - Erpeus Island

Lier is a coastal state within the Middle Sea region, home to the main port settlement of Hessam on Erpeus Island.

#### Bay of Whispers

Outside Hessam lies the Bay of Whispers, a place where secrets of long-lost time travel across the winds. Here, you can hear secrets you aren't supposed to know—everything spoken on the wind is captured forever, across all time. The bay acts as a temporal repository of whispered words, preserving conversations from the past, present, and even glimpses of the future. Those who listen carefully might learn things they were never meant to hear.

## Denrik Sea

The Denrik Sea lies east of Adron's coast and south of the Frostmarch Peninsula, forming the cold waters between the Middle Sea proper and the northern polar regions. These frigid waters are treacherous, with shifting ice and violent storms.

### Kyorda

A small state on the southern coast of the Frostmarch Peninsula, clinging to the harsh shoreline where the peninsula meets the Denrik Sea.

### Darkstone Caves

Located approximately one hundred miles south of Kyorda, deep beneath the Denrik Sea at the intersection of earth and dark leylines, lies an extensive underwater cave system known only as the Darkstone Caves. This is the sole known source of darkstone in all of Alaria—a rare mineral that emanates a natural aura of darkness and resists all geomantic manipulation unless the wielder is paragon-attuned to darkness itself.

The caves are perpetually shrouded in supernatural shadow that cannot be dispelled by normal light sources. The leyline convergence creates zones of absolute darkness where even magical sight fails. Currents within the underwater tunnels are unpredictable and deadly, formed by the interaction between earth magic stabilizing the cave structure and dark magic warping space within.

Mining darkstone requires specialized diving equipment, dark-attuned mages to navigate the lightless depths, and extraordinary courage. Most who attempt the descent never return—claimed by the crushing pressure, the disorienting darkness, or the strange creatures that have adapted to live in a realm of eternal shadow beneath the waves.

## Western Middle Sea

### Kazül

A desert state in the western Middle Sea, positioned near where the sea transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. Kazül's arid climate and strategic position make it a crucial waypoint for trade.

#### Buffalo Islands

A small archipelago just south of Kazül, named for the massive sea buffalo that once migrated through these waters. The islands are remote and avoided by most sailors.

##### Pavik's Cave

On one of the Buffalo Islands lives Pavik, a flesh-eating cyclops with unmatched crafting abilities. Unlike most cyclopes who trade honestly, Pavik demands human flesh as payment for his work. He will craft weapons, armor, or tools of extraordinary quality, but only in exchange for a whole person—no less will suffice.

Pavik swallows his victims whole, alive, in a horrifying display that has traumatized those who witnessed it. Despite the grotesque nature of his business, desperate individuals still seek him out when they need craftsmanship that no one else can provide. The surrounding islands are littered with the bones of those who tried to negotiate or cheat him.
