## Tornia

Tags: state, nation

Tornia occupies the northern portion of Ofrenia, the strategic island at the heart of the Middle Sea. Once the seat of a united island kingdom, it's now occupied territory—conquered by Queen Alisandra of Sylke in a swift, humiliating war. The landscape is gentle—temperate forests, rolling farmland, and a dramatically broken coastline of peninsulas, bays, and sheltered harbors. Time and darkness ley lines cross the territory, and their influence bleeds into everything from the architecture to the local crime.

King Aldric, the former ruler, either fled or was captured when Sylke's armies swept through. The countryside now seethes with resistance against the occupation.

### Catalina

The capital city, built on a river delta where it empties into Gem Crest Bay. Catalina sprawls across multiple islands and riverbanks connected by bridges—some ancient stone, others newer wood that sags and creaks. The old city shows its age in towering spires and weathered temples; the new city is all gambling houses and racing pavilions.

The Gem Crest Races continue under occupation—Alisandra recognizes their value as distraction. On race days, the bay fills with spectator boats, and the city's population doubles with visitors. Sylke soldiers patrol the waterfront, and the atmosphere is carnival, rot, and simmering resentment in equal measure.

#### Besnoumeru

The merchant district of Catalina, technically a city-within-a-city. The architecture here is gorgeous—centuries of accumulated wealth expressed in carved facades, gilded domes, and private gardens visible through wrought-iron gates. Rent is impossibly expensive. The traders who operate here predict market shifts with uncanny accuracy.

Beneath the beauty, time-gangs rule. These criminal organizations use temporal manipulation to maintain iron control over commerce and politics. They emerged from the pre-human ruins beneath the district—tunnels and chambers that predate any known civilization, where temporal magic pools in strange eddies. The gangs have barely scratched the surface of what those ruins contain.

The occupation has barely touched Besnoumeru. The time-gangs play both sides—selling intelligence to Sylke authorities while quietly supporting rebels who can pay. They're positioning themselves to emerge from the chaos as the real power in Tornia, whoever nominally rules.

### Gem Crest Bay

The bay south of Catalina, site of the famous (and infamous) Gem Crest Races. The water is deep, the currents complex, and the racing course winds through natural obstacles and artificial markers. On race days, water-attuned mages secretly propel favored vessels while betting houses collect fortunes from rigged outcomes.

The bay earned its name from the way sunlight catches mineral deposits in the cliffs—a glittering display at dawn and dusk that looks almost magical.

### Mithras

A secondary city on the southern peninsula, overlooking the Passage. More honest than Catalina—Mithras still functions as a working port rather than a gambling den. Shipwrights here build vessels for merchants who'd rather avoid the capital's corruption.

The occupation presence is lighter here, and resistance networks operate more openly. Refugees heading to Joswik often depart from Mithras rather than risk Catalina's checkpoints.

### Northern Coast

The northern reaches of Tornia are wilder and less developed than the south. Occupation forces are thin on the ground here, and the locals largely ignore their nominal rulers—old habit, whether the ruler is Aldric or Alisandra.

#### Northpoint

The northernmost settlement, a fishing town on a rocky promontory. Cold winds off the Middle Sea make winters harsh. The locals are practical folk who viewed King Aldric's southern decadence with contempt and view Alisandra's occupation with the same.

#### Highwater & Lowwater

Twin towns on opposite banks of a tidal estuary. Highwater sits on the bluffs; Lowwater floods at king tides and has adapted accordingly—buildings on stilts, boats tied to second-floor balconies. The rivalry between them is generations old and mostly friendly.

#### Port Edott

A western harbor town, primary departure point for ships heading to the mainland. More traffic passes through here than the town's size would suggest. Sylke maintains a garrison to monitor shipping; the locals resent it but comply.

#### Gerstown Rapids

An inland town where a river tumbles through rocky narrows. Mills and workshops cluster along the rapids, using the water power.

### Central Settlements

#### Ryerton & Bexley

Market towns in the agricultural heart of Tornia. The farmland here is rich, and these towns serve as collection points for grain and produce—now requisitioned by occupation authorities at "fair" prices that aren't.

#### Ylidor

An eastern town near the broken coastline. Known for its smoked fish and quiet contempt for whoever rules in Catalina.

### Southern Region

#### Oakheart

A town near Blue Lake, surrounded by old-growth forest. Timber from here once built Ofrenia's united fleet.

#### Blue Lake

A large freshwater lake in southern Tornia, fed by streams from the interior. The water is startlingly clear—you can see the bottom even at considerable depth. Old stories claim things move in the deep water that shouldn't be there.

#### Meadowlea, Goodlawn, Tall Woods

A cluster of towns that were on the Sylke border—now in the interior of occupied territory. These communities saw the invasion firsthand and harbor deep resentments. Resistance cells are active here, drawing on local knowledge of the terrain.

#### Blank Point, Thenbury, Minos

Southern settlements near the Passage. Refugees fleeing to Joswik often pass through here, and the locals have developed a quiet trade in smuggling people past occupation checkpoints.

### Forests

#### Glowbud Forest

Once a peaceful woodland north of Catalina, now a death trap. Jaguars from the royal menagerie escaped captivity years ago and established themselves here. The great cats have grown bold and dangerous, actively hunting humans who enter. The forest earned its name from bioluminescent fungi that glow faintly at night—a beautiful sight, if you survive long enough to see it.

Occupation forces avoid Glowbud Forest. Rebels sometimes use its edges as refuge, accepting the risk of jaguars over the certainty of Sylke patrols.

#### Shadewood Forest

A darker, older forest in the interior. The tree canopy is dense enough to block most sunlight, leaving the forest floor in perpetual twilight. Local legend claims the darkness ley line surfaces here, and shadow-touched creatures roam the deeper woods.

### The Western Border

What was once the border with Sylke is now just territory. Stannac Gate and Watertown, formerly fortified crossing points, now serve as administrative centers for the occupation. Sylke troops move freely between the kingdoms, and the border exists only in memory and resentment.
