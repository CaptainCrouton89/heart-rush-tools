## Elephant Groves

Tags: forest, sacred, region

The Elephant Groves are the largest forest in the region—a vast, ancient woodland that serves as the birthplace and spiritual homeland of the loxodon race. The forest is sacred ground, protected by an ancient elephant spirit that does not welcome uninvited visitors.

### Sacred to Loxodon

This is where the loxodon emerged as a people. The first of their kind awakened here, blessed by forces that predate recorded history, and the forest has been central to loxodon identity ever since. Every loxodon knows the Elephant Groves exist, even if they've never visited; it's woven into their cultural memory.

Loxodon pilgrims journey here to connect with their origins, to seek wisdom at the Pool of Knowledge, and to walk among the ancient trees where their ancestors first drew breath. For them, the forest is welcoming—paths open, the spirit watches benevolently, and the Groves feel like home.

### The Guardian Spirit

An ancient elephant spirit protects the Groves. This isn't a metaphor or a legend—the spirit is real, present, and active. It manifests when needed, sometimes as a massive spectral elephant, sometimes as a pressure in the air, sometimes as the forest itself responding to threats.

The spirit actively repels intruders. Those who enter the Groves without welcome find themselves turned around, walking in circles, suddenly convinced they should leave. Those who persist face more direct intervention—fallen trees blocking paths, sudden floods, the ground itself becoming treacherous. Those who still don't take the hint encounter the spirit directly, and that rarely ends well.

The goblins of the Jinxz Plains have learned through generations of loss that the Elephant Groves are not to be entered. They raid the forest edges for resources—fallen wood, herbs growing at the boundary—but they never go deep. Something in there doesn't like them, and goblins who venture too far don't return.

### The Pool of Knowledge

Deep within the Groves lies the Pool of Knowledge—a sacred body of water with remarkable properties. Those who drink from the Pool gain wisdom beyond their natural capacity. The transformation is permanent; a drinker's mind expands, their insight deepens, and they understand things they couldn't grasp before.

In game terms, the Pool grants Wisdom 20 to those who drink from it. If a drinker already has Wisdom 20, it increases to 22.

The Pool isn't easy to reach. The forest protects it, the spirit guards it, and only those deemed worthy can find the path. Loxodon pilgrims sometimes spend years proving themselves before the forest allows them through. Non-loxodon rarely even learn the Pool exists, let alone locate it.

### The Forest Itself

The Elephant Groves are enormous—the largest continuous forest in the region by a significant margin. Ancient trees tower hundreds of feet, their canopy so thick that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight. The undergrowth is dense but traversable for those who know the way.

The wildlife is abundant and, within the forest, peaceful. Elephants roam freely—not the spirit, but ordinary elephants who've made the Groves their home. Other animals show unusual calm, as if the spirit's protection extends to everything within the forest boundaries.

The air smells of growing things, water, and something else—something old and patient that defies description. First-time visitors often report feeling watched, which they are.

### Surrounding Regions

The Elephant Groves border the goblin plains to the north, the Cacklehills to the east, and wilder territories to the south. The forest serves as a stabilizing presence—the spirit's protection prevents the chaos of surrounding regions from spreading, and the Groves themselves are a constant in a landscape defined by conflict.

The United Free Nations to the southeast maintain respectful distance. They've learned that the forest doesn't want contact and that attempting to exploit its resources ends badly. Trade with the loxodon, when it happens, occurs outside the forest proper.

### For Players

The Elephant Groves offer several potential hooks:

- **Loxodon pilgrimage**: A loxodon character seeking the Pool of Knowledge
- **The spirit's bargain**: Non-loxodon might be allowed in if the spirit needs something done
- **Border defense**: Helping the Eloweir or United Free Nations deal with something that emerged from the Groves
- **The goblin problem**: The spirit tolerated a goblin incursion for mysterious reasons—what are they after, and why did the Groves allow it?
- **Lost history**: Talarian ruins might exist somewhere in the Groves, predating even the loxodon—but finding them means convincing the spirit to cooperate
