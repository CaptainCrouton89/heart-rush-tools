## Sylke

Tags: state, nation

Sylke occupies western Ofrenia, a land of dense forests, swift rivers, and a population that has learned to keep its head down. The Gilded Pass ley line runs through the territory—ironic, given how little gilding reaches the common folk. The landscape is beautiful in a dark, brooding way: ancient trees blocking the sun, mist rising from river valleys, and roads that are well-maintained but rarely traveled by choice.

Queen Alisandra rules from Helmsbridge with absolute authority. The forests that once made Sylke the poorest of Ofrenia's three kingdoms now fuel an economy of lumber, ships, and darker exports. Since conquering Tornia, Alisandra controls two-thirds of the island—and the remaining third watches in terror.

### Helmsbridge

The capital city, built where a major river crosses from the interior to the western coast. The bridge that gives the city its name is ancient—pre-dating the current kingdom by centuries—and wide enough for four wagons abreast. The royal palace sits on a bluff overlooking the bridge, positioned to watch everything that crosses.

The city is orderly, clean, and oppressively quiet. Citizens go about their business efficiently and speak to strangers only when necessary. The informant network that keeps Alisandra in power is headquartered here, though no building bears that label.

### Scarnett

The second city, a logging hub in the southern forests near the Joswik border. Massive timber operations feed sawmills that run day and night. The workers here are rough, practical folk—they care about getting the job done and avoiding the queen's attention.

Since the conquest of Tornia, Scarnett has also become a staging ground for military operations. Troops rotate through on their way to occupation duty in the east.

### Northern Settlements

#### Shimmercreek Falls

A town built around a dramatic waterfall where a river tumbles off the northern highlands. The falls are genuinely beautiful—one of the few places in Sylke where people might visit for pleasure rather than business. Mills powered by the falls produce flour and lumber.

#### Seavault

A northern coastal town with a natural harbor protected by rocky headlands. The name comes from sea caves in the cliffs where, according to legend, pirates once hid treasure. Whether any treasure remains is anyone's guess.

#### Cat Fell

A highland settlement in the northwestern hills, named for the wildcats that roam the surrounding moors. The population is small and insular, more concerned with their sheep than with politics in distant Helmsbridge.

### Western Coast

#### Fool's Keep

A crumbling fortress on the western coast, now serving as a minor garrison and watchtower. The name supposedly comes from a lord who tried to hold it against the old king generations ago—a fool's errand that ended predictably.

#### Exralhorn

A coastal town where fishing and shipping combine. Small vessels carry lumber down the coast to larger ports; fishing boats bring in catches that feed the interior towns.

### Interior & Southern Regions

#### Mapleburg

An interior town surrounded by managed forests, particularly maple groves tapped for syrup. The town has a sweetness to it—literally—that feels incongruous with Sylke's general grimness. The locals take quiet pride in their product.

#### Bridgeton

A town at the junction of Sylke, Tornia, and Joswik—strategically vital and heavily garrisoned even before the current war. Now it serves as the command post for occupation forces moving into Tornia. The civilian population has largely fled or been conscripted into support roles.

### The Forests

Sylke's interior is dominated by ancient forest—dense canopy, limited undergrowth, and trees that have grown for centuries under careful management. The lumber is Sylke's primary export, and the forestry operations are ruthlessly efficient.

Deeper in the woods, things get stranger. The Gilded Pass ley line creates pockets where reality behaves oddly—time moves differently, directions shift, and travelers find themselves somewhere they didn't intend. The foresters know which areas to avoid. Outsiders learn the hard way.

### The Tykon Channel

The waters west of Sylke, separating Ofrenia from the mainland. Sylke's growing navy patrols these waters, and Alisandra has ambitions to control all shipping through the channel. For now, she lacks the vessels—but with Tornia's captured fleet, that's changing.
