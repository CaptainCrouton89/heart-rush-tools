## Erasnus

Tags: state, nation

A Belenstrope halfling nation in the central Middle Sea region, defined by trade, diplomacy, and a complete inability to fight. Erasnus sits at the crossroads of everything—bordered by Camaran, Ubrik, Myorna, the Hephake mountains, Anarak, and Griselia. They've made fortunes by trading with everyone and fighting no one.

Member and key proponent of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. The alliance is most profitable for Erasnus, and they are desperately trying to hold it together as tensions between member states escalate.

### Erdene

The capital city, seat of both the House of Nobles and the House of Commerce. A sprawling trade hub where deals are struck in every tavern, market, and noble house. The architecture reflects centuries of accumulated wealth—ornate but practical, designed to impress clients.

### Minoz

Major city in the east, near the Camaran border. Hub for overland trade routes heading toward the eastern Middle Sea states.

### Adnar

Major city in the south, positioned for trade with Ubrik and the southeastern routes. Currently dealing with refugee overflow from the silvertongue crisis.

### Traduci

Major city in the west, gateway to the Crags of Geth and trade with the Griselian goblin city-states. Site of the most theatrical diplomatic incidents with goblin delegations.

### Simonsor

Major city in the north, near the Hephake mountain passes. Trade routes through the Kharvorn run through here.

### Novglim Forest

Northeastern forest, just south of Myorna. Native gnome tribes once lived here; most have been displaced by logging and settlement expansion. The situation is an open wound that Erasnun society prefers not to discuss.

### The Crags of Geth

Mountain range along the western border, separating Erasnus from Griselia and the goblin city-states beyond. The passes are well-traveled despite (or because of) the goblins' constant theatrical threats of invasion.

### Trade Roads

Erasnus is crisscrossed with maintained trade roads connecting every major city to its neighbors. The roads are the nation's true infrastructure—better maintained than any military fortification, because trade is what matters.
