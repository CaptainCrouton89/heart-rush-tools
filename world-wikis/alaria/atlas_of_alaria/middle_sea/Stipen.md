## Stipen

Tags: state, nation

An Ezuri (Tree Gnome) gerontocracy in the forests along the Chedwin Strait. The entire country is ancient woodland where gnomes live in tree-settlements and can survive for 500 years—so long as they never leave.

East of Thespia, north of Zintacas, with coastline along the Chedwin Strait.

### Atra

The capital, such as it is—the largest tree-settlement in Stipen. Home to the council of elders who govern the forest realm. Built into and around massive ancient trees, with bridges and platforms connecting homes high above the forest floor.

### Teleriwood

The western forest, bordering Thespia. Older, denser, with the most ancient trees. This is where the deepest parts of Stipen lie—and where the controversial psychedelic flora grows.

### Schousterwood

The eastern forest, closer to the coast. Slightly younger growth, more connected to the outside world through coastal trade (what little exists).

### Shamwet

A tree-settlement in the northern part of Stipen, near the Chedwin Strait coast.

### Kestrel

Another tree-settlement, positioned between the two forests.

### The Lizard's Back

A geographic feature along the southern border with Zintacas—a ridge or rocky formation marking the edge of Stipen's forests.

### The Living Forest

The forest itself is Stipen's greatest defense. The Ezuri are so integrated with the trees that the woodland fights for them—roots trip invaders, branches strike, paths shift and confuse. No army has ever successfully invaded Stipen. Most don't try.
