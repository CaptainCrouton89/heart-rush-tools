## Myastor

Tags: state, nation

Myastor occupies Paluva Amati, a scrubby island in the Ofrenia Passage between Ofrenia proper and the Middle Sea beyond. The landscape is uninspiring—rocky coasts, thinning forests, and scrubland that never quite becomes grassland. The island exists because ships need somewhere to stop, and Myastor has grudgingly filled that role for generations.

Under Queen Alisandra's rule, Myastor has become Sylke's dumping ground. Political prisoners, failed courtiers, and anyone the queen wants forgotten end up here. The population has made the best of it, building a grim economy around human misery and passing trade.

### Shipton

The capital—if a town of a few thousand can claim that title. Shipton clusters around the best natural harbor on the island, a sheltered bay on the western coast facing Ofrenia. The waterfront is busy with transient ships; the inland streets are quiet and suspicious.

The governor's residence is the largest building in town, a weathered stone structure that once served as a warehouse. Governors come and go—Alisandra rotates them frequently, ensuring no one builds a power base—but the bureaucracy grinds on regardless.

The prison complex sprawls along the northern edge of town, repurposed warehouses surrounded by walls that look impressive but wouldn't stop a determined escape. The prisoners don't try because there's nowhere to go. Swimming to Ofrenia is suicide; stowing away on a ship requires bribing sailors who'd rather collect the reward for turning you in.

### Telara

A secondary port on the eastern coast, smaller and rougher than Shipton. Ships that want to avoid attention—smugglers, pirates looking to fence goods, merchants carrying questionable cargo—often prefer Telara's lack of oversight. The town's unofficial motto is "we don't ask."

### Partsmouth

An interior settlement surrounded by what remains of the island's forests. Logging operations here supply timber for ships and construction, though the trees are thinning and no one invests in replanting. The workers are mostly transported criminals serving out sentences; the overseers are mostly locals who've concluded that guarding lumberjacks beats guarding prisoners.

### Pasterton

A fishing village on the southern coast, as far from Shipton as you can get without swimming. The residents here are the closest thing Myastor has to old families—people whose ancestors settled the island before it became a penal colony. They keep to themselves, sell fish to whoever's buying, and pretend the rest of the island doesn't exist.

### The Interior

Scrubland and second-growth forest, crisscrossed by rough paths connecting the settlements. Nothing of value grows here naturally; nothing planted survives the poor soil and irregular rainfall. The interior is used for grazing goats, hiding from authority, and burying things that shouldn't be found.

Escaped prisoners occasionally flee into the interior. They're rarely pursued—the island is small enough that they'll emerge eventually, hungry and desperate. The locals have learned to report sightings rather than risk confrontation.

### The Ofrenia Passage

The strait between Paluva Amati and Ofrenia, connecting the Gulf of Joswik to the open Middle Sea. Control of the Passage has always been contested—now that Alisandra holds both Sylke and Tornia, she effectively controls both ends. Joswik's few ships and the island's fishing boats are the only traffic she doesn't command.

The Passage is dangerous in storms; ships shelter in Shipton's harbor until weather clears. This forced hospitality is Myastor's primary source of legitimate income—provisioning, repairs, and entertainment for bored sailors waiting out bad seas.
