## Ubrik

Tags: state, nation

A Uline dwarf nation in the mountains of the Middle Sea coast, between Camaran and Bestacia. Once a prosperous mining state, now a nightmare. The silvertongue outbreak has turned half the population into mercury-mouthed cannibals, and the infection is spreading.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though the alliance is buckling under the crisis. Refugees flood neighboring states. Silvertongues raid across borders. No cure exists.

### Grothak

The capital, built into a mountainside. Partially evacuated—the wealthy fled south with their gold, leaving the poor to fend for themselves. The lower districts are dangerous; silvertongue incursions happen weekly. What remains of the government operates from fortified upper levels.

### The Northern Mines

Where the outbreak began. Dozens of mining settlements, now silent or overrun. This is where Slick Silver was first discovered—a shimmering, mercury-like mineral in the deepest tunnels. The mines are considered lost. Anyone who enters doesn't come back.

The silvertongues nest here in growing numbers, emerging to raid the surface when hungry.

### The Southern Mines

Still operational, barely. Refugees and remaining miners have fortified these settlements, hoping the infection hasn't spread this far. Paranoia is extreme—anyone showing signs of silver in their mouth is killed immediately. Some innocent dwarves have been murdered over dental fillings.

### Slick Silver

A corrupted mineral, liquid-metallic and shimmering. Those who see it feel compelled to touch it. Those who touch it feel compelled to taste it. Those who taste it transform.

The silver coats the mouth first—teeth and tongue gleaming metallic. Then it spreads through the blood. Veins turn silver beneath the skin. The eyes go mirror-bright. Reason dissolves into hunger.

Silvertongues are cunning hunters. They ambush, overwhelm, and force Slick Silver down their victims' throats to spread the infection. They retain enough intelligence to use tools and set traps.

No cure is known. The infected cannot be reasoned with. Fire works, but silvertongues are fast and travel in packs.

### The Refugee Camps

Along Ubrik's southern and western borders, desperate camps have formed. Thousands of dwarves with nothing, waiting to be allowed into Bestacia or Camaran. Conditions are terrible. Disease (normal disease, not silvertongue) spreads easily. Some refugees have been stuck in camps for months.

Host countries are hostile. Rumors that any Ubrik dwarf might be secretly infected have led to violence and discrimination.

### The Border Crisis

Silvertongues don't respect borders. Raiding parties have struck into Bestacia and eastern Camaran. Both countries are fortifying their borders and demanding Ubrik "contain" the problem—but Ubrik's government barely exists anymore. The alliance is fracturing over who bears responsibility and who should commit troops.
