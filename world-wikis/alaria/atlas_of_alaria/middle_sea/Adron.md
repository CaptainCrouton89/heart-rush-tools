### Gozwin Mountains

A mountain range on the eastern coast of Adron, along the Denrik Sea.

#### Waterdark

Hidden within the Gozwin Mountains lies Waterdark, the fortress where those who overthrew the dragons once lived. The residents were masters of water and darkness magic—secretive, hated, and deadly, but undeniably competent. A secret order still resides in Waterdark, but the fortress appears completely empty unless you know what to look for. The order continues its dark work in the shadows, manipulating water and darkness to pursue goals known only to themselves.

Dragonborn homeland. Sacred basin in Adron. Entire area is a holy land.

### Stillwater

North of the Ámas Kiori region in the central basin, west of the Majesty Mountains, lies Stillwater—a sacred pool that forms in a river, watched over by Naga priests. The pool exhibits extraordinary temporal properties: in the eddies surrounding the still center, time passes very quickly, while in the perfectly motionless water at the pool's heart, time does not pass at all.

The Naga guard this sacred site with reverence, understanding that Stillwater is a place where the normal flow of time bends and breaks. Those who enter the still center may emerge to find decades have passed in the outside world, while those caught in the swift eddies age in moments.
