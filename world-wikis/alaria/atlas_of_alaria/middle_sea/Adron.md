## Adron

Tags: state, nation

Adron is the easternmost state on the Middle Sea, a proud Naga kingdom nestled between dramatic mountain ranges. Once the land of dragon riders, it now trades on banking, shipbuilding, and the legendary red gold mined from its peaks. The climate is Mediterranean—warm coastlines, temperate forests in the valleys, and snow-capped mountains framing the horizon.

Three major ley lines cross Adron: water (through the capital), time (southwest to northeast across the north), and dark (through the center). The intersections produce an unusually high number of elementally attuned Naga.

### Adrak

The capital city, seat of the monarchy, and home to the Royal Adrak Bank. Sits on or near the water ley line. The nobility here keep domesticated dragons as pets—impressive creatures, but shadows of the war-beasts their ancestors once rode. The city exudes old wealth and older pride.

### Tenori River

The economic spine of Adron. Flows from the highlands northeast of Adrak, runs south along the Drakespine Mountains, and empties into the sea at Shipmarsh. Most internal trade moves along this river.

### Shipmarsh

The largest city in Adron after Adrak, built where the Tenori River meets the sea. Massive shipyards produce vessels for the Middle Sea trade. A working city—less refined than Adrak, more prosperous than anywhere else.

### Greyport

A southern port that suffers from the dragon Chavux's raids on nearby shipping. Merchants here would pay well to have the dragon problem "solved," though killing a dragon remains sacrilege in Adron.

### The Blades

A collection of islands off the southwest coast. Chavux, a green dragon, lairs on one of the northern islands and terrorizes ships passing through the strait.

### Ámas Kiori

The sacred basin north of Adrak, holy land to all dragonborn. The entire region is considered sacred ground.

### Stillwater

Within Ámas Kiori, north of Adrak in the central basin. A sacred pool guarded by Naga priests where time bends—eddies where time races, and a still center where it stops entirely. Located near the intersection of the water and time ley lines.

### The Salt Moors

Salt marshes in the lowlands, source of preserving salt for the fishing industry.

### Mountain Ranges

**Gozwin Mountains**: Eastern coast along the Denrik Sea. Source of red gold and home to Waterdark.

**Majesty Mountains**: Northeastern range. Rich in red gold. The self-styled Dwarf King lurks here, claiming ancestral rights and robbing travelers.

**Shrieking Peaks**: Southern range, named for the wind that howls through the passes.

**Drakespine Mountains**: Central range running north-south, dividing eastern and western Adron. Named for the dragon riders who once patrolled its peaks.

### Waterdark

Hidden within the Gozwin Mountains. The fortress of the secret order that severed the dragon-bonds four centuries ago. Masters of water and darkness magic. The fortress appears empty unless you know what to look for. The order continues its work in shadow, pursuing goals known only to themselves.

### Western Lakes

Several towns dot the shores of lakes in western Adron. Beneath the waters lie drowned Triton ruins—remnants of the civilization that inhabited this land before fleeing to the Alrock Ocean eons ago.

### Stillstone

A fortress in the mountains, exact purpose unclear.

### Gemecas

A point of interest in eastern Adron, near the Gozwin Mountains.
