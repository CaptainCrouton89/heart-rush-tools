## Jinxz Plains

Tags: plains, region

The Jinxz Plains occupy the southern stretch of the central grasslands, named (according to the goblins) for the bad luck that follows anyone who crosses them wrong. Like the Shiverplains to the north, this is Scalawag goblin territory—chaotic, dangerous, and perpetually at war with itself.

### The Southern Broods

The Jinxz Plains broods consider themselves distinct from their Shiverplains cousins, though outsiders can't tell the difference. The same impulsive, mischievous Scalawag nature. The same brood-based social structure. The same constant low-grade warfare over territory, resources, and bragging rights.

The southern broods claim to be better at causing misfortune to their enemies—hence the name "Jinxz." Whether they're actually more cursed or just better at taking credit for coincidental disasters is debatable.

### The Border Wars

The line between Jinxz Plains and Shiverplains isn't a border so much as a perpetual battlefield. Broods from both regions raid across it constantly, sometimes winning territory, sometimes losing it, never settling anything permanently. The fighting has been going on so long that it's less a conflict and more a tradition.

Neither side remembers what started it. Neither side cares. The fighting continues because fighting is what goblins do.

### Surrounding Regions

To the west lies Old Talaria and the Glass Forest—even the goblins avoid that direction. Things come out of the forest sometimes, strange things that don't follow normal rules. The broods nearest the Glass Forest have learned to recognize the warning signs and flee rather than fight.

To the east is Azawahasi, the Sharabha homeland. The lion-folk tolerate goblin raids the way a lion tolerates flies—annoying but not worth serious attention. Occasionally a brood gets too ambitious and learns why Sharabha are apex predators.

To the south are the Elephant Groves, sacred to the loxodon. The goblins raid the forest edges for resources but never go deep. Something in there doesn't like them, and goblins who venture too far don't return.

### Witchbreath Bay

The southern edge of the Jinxz Plains meets Witchbreath Bay, an unsettling body of water with a dire reputation. Strange fogs roll off the water without warning, thick and disorienting. Ships that anchor in the bay report disturbing dreams—visions of drowned things, voices from beneath the waves.

Even the goblins avoid Witchbreath Bay. That's saying something—Scalawags will raid nearly anything, go nearly anywhere. But the bay feels wrong in a way that penetrates even goblin recklessness. Broods that camp too close to the water's edge report members wandering off in the night, walking into the fog, never returning.

Elders in surrounding regions tell stories of something sleeping in the deep water, something that dreams, something that shouldn't be awakened. Whether this is truth or legend, the bay remains avoided by anyone with sense.

### The Chaos Theory

Some scholars theorize that the goblin plains serve an ecological function—they're a buffer zone of chaos that prevents any single power from dominating the region. The Eloweir don't expand south because of the goblins. The Sharabha don't expand west. Old Talaria's strangeness doesn't spread freely. The United Free Nations stay contained.

The goblins, of course, don't think about it that way. They're just living their lives—raiding, fighting, celebrating, dying, and starting over the next generation. The chaos is the point.
