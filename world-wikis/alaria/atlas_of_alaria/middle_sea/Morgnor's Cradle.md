## Morgnor's Cradle

Tags: state, nation

The domain of Morgnor, an ancient earth-attuned dragon who rules over Etherweaver goblins in the mountains northwest of Thespia. The goblins mine precious metals and enchant them for the dragon's ever-growing hoard.

Very rich. Very greedy. Very dangerous.

### Morgnor

The dragon's lair and the central settlement that shares his name. Built into the mountainside, the lair contains Morgnor's legendary hoard—generations of mined gold and enchanted items. The goblins live in warrens surrounding the lair, always within call of their master.

### Morgnor's Cradle

The central mountain region where the dragon makes his home. The peaks here are rich with precious metals, and Morgnor can sense every grain of gold in his domain.

### Hills of Red Gold

The southern slopes, where most mining occurs. Rich veins of gold give the hills their name—and their value. Etherweaver goblins work the mines constantly, extracting wealth for the dragon's hoard.

### Mt. Kazlos

A major peak in the eastern part of the domain.

### Mt. Thryke

A peak in the southwestern part of the domain.

### Goblin Settlements

Mining and crafting towns scattered through the mountains: Lagunas, Shegaat, Dir, Addis, Norwun, Scuilli, Telleni, Goldir. Each serves the dragon, mining or enchanting as their skills dictate.

### The Etherweaver Crafters

The goblins here are Etherweavers—born with attunements to time, void, force, light, or dark. They use these abilities to enchant the metals they mine, creating items of considerable power. All of it goes to Morgnor's hoard.
