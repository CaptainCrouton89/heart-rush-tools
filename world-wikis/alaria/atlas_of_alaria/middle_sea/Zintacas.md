## Zintacas

Tags: state, nation

A tribal Gozi (Goshwen) nation in the canyon country south of Stipen. Red rock gorges, towering stone spires, mesas, and endless sky. Utah/Arizona vibes—harsh, beautiful, and deadly to outsiders who don't know the terrain.

The Gozi fly on great raptors that hunt the canyons. Tribal society, no central government, deeply isolated, and they like it that way.

### The Sighing Canyons

The central canyon system that gives Zintacas its character. Deep gorges carved by ancient rivers, now home to raptor nests and Gozi villages built into cliff faces. The wind through the canyons creates an eerie sighing sound—hence the name.

### The Lizard's Back

A ridge formation along the northern border with Stipen, marking the transition from forest to canyon country.

### Clay Hills

Rolling hills in the eastern part of Zintacas, less dramatic than the canyons but still harsh terrain.

### Tootby Hills

Northwestern hills near the border with Thespia.

### Dzobi Lands

Southwestern territory, bordering Kazül. The most remote part of Zintacas.

### Rompur Liko

The site of the annual winter bazaar—a small island cliff connected to the surrounding canyon walls by rope bridges. Once a year, all tribes gather here to trade, celebrate, and renew bonds. Then they scatter back to their territories.

### Villages

Scattered through the canyons: Nod, Tilik, Pil, Kilam, Shraz, Fimli, Hechaw, Shyat, and others. Most are built into cliff faces or perched on mesa tops—accessible primarily by raptor.

### The Raptors

Great hunting birds, large enough to carry a gnome rider. Sacred to the Gozi, who breed and train them as partners rather than mounts. The raptors hunt the gorges for prey, and the Gozi hunt with them. To harm a raptor is to declare war on all tribes.

### The Canyon Defense

Outsiders who enter Zintacas without invitation rarely survive. The terrain is lethal without local knowledge, and the Gozi on their raptors can strike from anywhere. No army has ever successfully invaded the canyon country. Most don't try.
