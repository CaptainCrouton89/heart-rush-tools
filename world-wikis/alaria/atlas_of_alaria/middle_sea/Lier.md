## Lier

Tags: state, nation

Lier occupies the central portion of Erpeus Island, sandwiched between the gnomish mountains of Mkinti to the south and the monastic peaks of Azuros to the north. It's the human heartland of Erpeus—rolling hills, fertile valleys, and a pragmatic population that's learned to profit from its position as middleman between the secretive gnomes and the outside world.

### Hessam

The capital and only true city, built around the best natural harbor on Erpeus's eastern coast. Hessam is where everything happens—trade, politics, the occasional assassination, and the steady flow of seekers heading to the Bay of Whispers.

The city has the practical architecture of a place built for commerce rather than beauty. Warehouses crowd the waterfront. Merchant houses rise behind them, each family's compound trying to outdo the neighbors without appearing ostentatious. The council chambers occupy a central position, deliberately positioned to remind everyone that money governs here.

The population is cosmopolitan by Erpeus standards—humans mostly, but with enough visitors from across the Middle Sea to make diversity unremarkable. The docks especially attract a mixed crowd: sailors, traders, mercenaries, scholars bound for the Bay of Whispers, and occasionally Ohblex gnomes who've ventured out of their mountains for reasons they don't explain.

### The Bay of Whispers

The supernatural bay outside Hessam, where the wind carries secrets across time. Everything spoken within the bay is captured forever—words from the past drift across the water, and listeners can hear things they weren't meant to know.

The phenomenon is real and terrifying. A visitor might hear their own voice speaking words they haven't said yet. They might catch fragments of conversations from centuries ago. They might learn secrets that powerful people have killed to protect.

The bay attracts seekers—scholars researching lost knowledge, mystics pursuing temporal communion, the desperate hoping to learn something that might save them or damn their enemies. Hessam's merchants have built an industry around them: lodging, supplies, guides who know the safe approaches (if any approach is truly safe), and discrete disposal services for those who learn things they shouldn't.

The council regulates access but doesn't restrict it. The revenue is too valuable, and besides—trying to control the Bay of Whispers seems like the kind of hubris that ends badly.

### Hills of Soromun

Gentle hills in central Lier, the agricultural heartland. Grain, olives, and vineyards cover the slopes, feeding Lier and providing surplus for export. The villages here are quiet, prosperous places where nothing much happens—which suits the residents fine.

### Murder Hills

The highlands in northern Lier, along the border with Azuros. The name is earned. Bandits shelter in the rocky terrain, preying on travelers heading to or from the monastery. Worse things than bandits lurk in the deeper valleys—creatures that avoid sunlight, fugitives who've gone feral, and occasionally something that wanders down from Azuros's heights.

The council sends military expeditions every few years to clean out the Murder Hills. They kill some bandits, declare victory, and return home. Within months, the hills are dangerous again. Some council members have suggested more permanent solutions; others point out that as long as the hills are lawless, they're also a convenient place to dispose of problems.

### Devil's Crest

A dramatic mountain formation in western Lier, marking the transition toward Mkinti territory. The peaks here are jagged, volcanic in origin, and largely uninhabited. Local legend claims something lives in Devil's Crest—something old, something that the gnomes know about and won't discuss.

Whether the legends are true or just stories to keep children away from dangerous cliffs, most travelers avoid Devil's Crest. The passes around it add days to any journey, but days are cheaper than whatever might be waiting in those peaks.

### Interior Settlements

#### Lucsha

A market town in the Hills of Soromun, the largest inland settlement after Hessam. Agricultural products flow through here on their way to the coast, and Lucsha's weekly market draws farmers from across the region.

#### Dozna

A town on the road toward Mkinti, positioned at the last comfortable stopping point before the gnomish mountains. Traders preparing for the difficult journey into Ohblex territory stock up here, hire guides, and make final arrangements.

#### Coyzevan

A settlement in the southern hills, known for its vineyards and the distinctive wine they produce. Coyzevan red fetches premium prices in Hessam's taverns.

#### Tothpa & Oychka

Towns in northern Lier, in the shadow of the Murder Hills. The residents here are hardy, suspicious of strangers, and well-armed. They've learned that help from Hessam arrives slowly if at all.

#### Gam

A small town on the coast south of Hessam, primarily a fishing community. The waters off Gam are good for certain catches that don't school near Hessam's busy harbor.

### Relations with Neighbors

Lier's relationship with Mkinti is symbiotic and tense. The gnomes need Lier's merchants to reach the outside world; Lier's economy depends on the gnomish trade. Neither trusts the other, and both know they're stuck together.

Azuros to the north is mostly ignored. The monks don't trade, don't fight, don't participate in the world in ways Lier understands. Occasionally a merchant tries to establish commerce with the monastery; they always return frustrated and empty-handed.
