## Ta Minn

Tags: state, nation

An Oznak horse theocracy on the western Middle Sea coast—vast grassy steppes ruled by the Kazigh, the chief horse shaman. The Ta Minn are proud cavalry warriors who once expanded freely across the plains before running into neighboring civilizations.

West of the Crags of Geth (Griselia), south of the Browthiel Hills, with a jagged coastline along the Middle Sea to the south.

### Büüli Umén

The capital, located in the central plains. Site of the great temple where the Kazigh rules, attended by servants selected through horse ritual and killed at age 30. The spiritual and political heart of Ta Minn.

### Ta Akikis

Western city, closer to the coast and the border with Thespia.

### Toh Hural

Northern city, positioned near the contested border with Anarak. A military staging ground for the ongoing skirmishes over the northern plains.

### Avar Sonnon

Eastern city, near the Crags of Geth and Griselia. Deals with occasional goblin incursions (theatrical or otherwise).

### Limoste

Southwestern coastal city on the Chedwin Strait. Ta Minn's main port and connection to sea trade.

### Kanüli Daha Plains

The northern plains—flat, fertile, windswept, and contested. A river flows from Anarak through a gap between the Kharvorn and Griselia mountains, providing a route for Anarak forces. This is where the two nations fight.

### Cercesa Plains

The southeastern plains, between Büüli Umén and the coast. Less contested than the north, more pastoral.

### The Chedwin Strait

The strait along Ta Minn's southwestern coast, separating the mainland from islands and connecting to the broader Middle Sea.

### The Wind-Touched Plains

The entire steppe is slightly magical. Wind attunement seeps into the land, the horses, and the people. Products made here carry faint enchantments of speed and air. The Ta Minn cavalry seem to ride faster than physics should allow.
