## Thespia

Tags: state, nation

A human agricultural kingdom in chaos. Recently seized by Queen Akta, a mad mercenary sorceress from the south. The kingdom lives in the shadow of Morgnor, King of the Mountains, whose dragon territory lies to the northwest.

East of Morgnor's mountains, north of Glorin, west of Stipen, southwest of Ta Minn.

### Geordon

The capital, in the center of Thespia. Currently under Akta's erratic rule. The royal palace has become her seat of power—and reportedly a site of strange magical experiments.

### The Salty Hills

A range of hills running north-south through the center of Thespia, dividing the western farmlands from the eastern settlements closer to Stipen.

### Western Settlements

Waterrun, Amerstad, Telford, Yunbery, and Cricklade lie in the western part of Thespia, closer to the dragon mountains. These towns live in Morgnor's shadow and have historically been the most cautious about provoking him.

### Northern Settlements

Dadleigh and Syozlus in the north, near the border with Ta Minn.

### Eastern Settlements

Tutton and Embrulton in the east, closer to Stipen and the coast. More connected to outside trade.

### Southern Settlements

Ronnymede, Wediton, Everdein, Camerdon, Lewes, and Fellsay in the south, bordering Glorin.

### The Dragon Shadow

Northwest of Thespia lies Morgnor's Cradle—the mountain territory of Morgnor, King of the Mountains. The Hills of Red Gold and Mt. Kazlos mark the edge of his domain. Thespia has always paid tribute and kept a small army to avoid his wrath.

Queen Akta has not continued the tribute. The dragon has not yet responded.
