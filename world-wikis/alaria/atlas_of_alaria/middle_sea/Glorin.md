## Glorin

Tags: state, nation

A secretive Glorindian dwarf nation in the Whistle-Stone Mountains, between Thespia and Kazül. On the surface, a modest mining operation. Below ground, one of the richest gold deposits in Alaria and a civilization that prefers the world doesn't know about it.

The Glorindians can sense gold through solid stone. They've used this gift to carve vast underground chasms full of wealth—and they've learned to keep very, very quiet about it.

### Gamgara

The capital, a surface settlement above the main mine complex. Modest buildings, unremarkable streets, nothing to suggest the staggering wealth below. The clan elders meet here to coordinate when necessary.

### Matabono

A town in the eastern part of Glorin, with its own mine entrances and clan territory.

### Zubaydah

A settlement in the west, closer to the coast and the main trade routes to Kazül.

### Taufig

Southern town, near the border with Kazül. Handles most of the (deliberately modest) gold exports.

### The Whistle-Stone Mountains

The mountain range that defines Glorin. Natural caverns and tunnels create an eerie whistling when wind passes through—unsettling to outsiders, sacred to the Glorindians who call it the voice of the mountains.

### The Underground

The true Glorin lies below. Vast mine shafts, tunnel networks, and underground chasms where generations of Glorindians have extracted gold. Some chambers are enormous—large enough to have their own weather patterns. The deepest workings are clan secrets.

The wealth is staggering. The Glorindians have mined tons of gold over centuries, and their auric sight keeps finding more. They deliberately hide the scale of it.

### The Dragon Threat

Morgnor, King of the Mountains to the northwest, has noticed Glorin. He knows about the gold. He hasn't acted yet, but dragons are patient. The Glorindians know he's watching and have no good answers for what happens when he decides to take what he wants.
