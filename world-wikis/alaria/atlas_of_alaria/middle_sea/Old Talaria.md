## Old Talaria

Tags: region, ruins, dangerous

Old Talaria is what remains after the greatest magical catastrophe in recorded history—a land where wizards reached too far and shattered the boundary between the material world and Ezz itself. The empire that once stood here was the magical heart of Alaria, home to the most powerful practitioners of every arcane tradition. Now it's a haunted wilderness where Faesong bleeds into reality unchecked, and nothing is quite what it seems.

The cataclysm happened centuries ago. The details vary by who tells the story, but the outcome is consistent: the wizards attempted something impossible—some say they tried to permanently merge Ezz with the material plane, others claim they sought to free Melera from her prison, still others insist they were trying to become gods themselves. Whatever they intended, they succeeded enough to kill everything that lived here and failed enough that the result was chaos rather than power.

Ezz poured through the breach. Melera's imprisoned song, always present as a whisper in Faesong magic, became a scream. The magic didn't just kill the wizards—it transformed everything. Trees woke up. Animals gained cunning they shouldn't have. Fae creatures materialized from nothing, born from the intersection of wild magic and Melera's eternal music. The land itself became strange.

### The Glass Forest

The western edge of Old Talaria, where the first wave of wild magic washed over living forest and transformed it. The trees here aren't glass—they're something worse. They look normal from a distance, but up close you see the light doesn't reflect right, the bark feels wrong, and at night they glow faintly with trapped starlight.

The Glass Forest is where Faesong magic is strongest. Fae creatures of every kind wander its depths—some curious, some playful, some hungry. The trees themselves are semi-aware, capable of moving their branches to block paths or reveal them, growing new roots overnight to trip travelers. Deeper in, where the magic pools thickest, trees walk.

Animals that drink from the forest's streams gain intelligence they weren't meant to have. Deer that speak in riddles. Wolves that bargain. Squirrels that lie.

The Eloweir of Eloesi maintain a cautious border watch along the Glass Forest's edge. Things wander out occasionally—usually confused, sometimes dangerous. The elves have learned when to fight, when to run, and when to simply let the strange thing pass.

### The Interior Ruins

Beyond the Glass Forest, the ruins of Old Talaria proper stretch across a landscape that defies normal geography. Cities stand where cities shouldn't—some intact but empty, others half-swallowed by vegetation that grows nowhere else, still others frozen in the moment of destruction, eternally burning or collapsing or transforming.

No reliable maps exist of the interior. The land shifts. Not constantly—sometimes paths remain stable for years—but no one can predict when a road that existed yesterday will lead somewhere entirely different tomorrow. Expeditions that enter with careful records return (if they return) with maps that contradict each other.

The magic here isn't just Faesong—it's everything. Leylines that once powered Talarian spellwork still pulse with energy, but they're corrupted, wild, unpredictable. Elemental magic discharges randomly. Time flows strangely in some areas. The Psywinds carry thoughts that aren't human and never were.

### The Talarian Legacy

Before its fall, Talaria was the center of magical learning in Alaria. Every tradition was studied here—Kethic elementalism, Deoric binding, Psy manipulation, Faesong harmonics. The greatest libraries, the most powerful artifacts, the deepest secrets—all were collected in Talarian vaults.

Those vaults still exist, somewhere in the ruins. Treasure hunters and scholars have sought them for centuries. A few have found fragments—spellbooks, enchanted items, records of rituals that should never be attempted. Most find only death, or worse, transformation.

The Talarian wizards themselves are gone—or at least, the people they were are gone. Some say echoes of their consciousness persist, trapped in the wild magic they unleashed. Others claim the most powerful became something else entirely, merged with the Faesong and the fae. Occasionally, travelers report meeting beings that speak of the old days with firsthand knowledge, but whether these are wizards-transformed or fae wearing stolen memories, none can say.

### The Breach

Somewhere in the heart of Old Talaria, the original breach persists—the wound in reality where Ezz first flooded through. No one who's found it has returned to report its location, but its effects radiate outward. The closer you get to the center, the stranger things become.

Near the breach, the rules break down entirely. Gravity forgets which way is down. Objects remember being other things and shift between forms. Thoughts manifest physically. The boundary between self and world dissolves.

This is where Melera's song is loudest—not her distant, muted presence felt in normal Faesong, but something close to her actual voice, filtered through whatever the breach has become. Those who hear it too long stop being entirely themselves.

### What Lives Here Now

The fae population of Old Talaria defies census. Creatures of every type have emerged from the wild magic—sprites, pixies, dryads, beings with no names in any language. Some are recognizable from folklore; others are new, born from the specific combination of energies that created this place.

The awakened trees are their own category. They range from barely-conscious (responding to stimuli but not truly thinking) to fully sapient (capable of conversation, memory, goals). The oldest have been aware since the cataclysm and have their own agendas.

Other things live here too—not fae, not awakened, just changed. Animals that ate magic-saturated food and became something else. Plants that learned to hunt. Stones that watch.

And then there are the things that came through from Ezz itself, drawn by the breach like moths to flame. No one knows what these truly are, and those who've encountered them describe them in contradictory ways. Perhaps they look different to each observer. Perhaps they don't have fixed forms at all.

### Approaching Old Talaria

The borders are semi-porous. The Glass Forest can be entered, carefully, and some do—herbalists seeking magical plants, scholars gathering fragments of knowledge, fools seeking treasure. The key is knowing when to leave and having the will to do it.

The interior is another matter. Every generation produces adventurers confident they can navigate the chaos, recover Talarian secrets, maybe even close the breach. They enter prepared, armed, warded against every danger they can imagine.

Most don't come back. Those who do are often changed—sometimes visibly, sometimes in ways that only emerge later. And their stories never quite match up, even when they traveled together.

Old Talaria remains, after all these centuries, a wound in the world that refuses to heal.
