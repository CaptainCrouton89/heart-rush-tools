## Iylovia

Tags: state, nation, region

The forests of lies. That's what outsiders call Iylovia, and they're not wrong. Every tree casts shadows. Every shadow hides a Gyv. And every Gyv is working an angle you haven't figured out yet.

Iylovia is beautiful—dense woodland stretching from the contested western border to the eastern coastal ports, cut by silver rivers and dotted with settlements that range from fortress-towns to quiet trading villages. The forests are ancient, the timber valuable, the textiles exquisite. Travelers come for trade and leave with excellent goods and the nagging feeling that they've been cheated somehow.

They probably have. They just can't prove it.

But beneath the surface scheming, Iylovia is dying. The Silzar push from the west. The Gyv can't unite to stop them. The forests that once sheltered a sprawling civilization now shelter refugees, desperate fighters, and people who've started measuring their future in seasons rather than generations.

### Geography & Borders

**West — Silwyn**: The war front. Gwyrdyr Forest runs along the border, a killing ground where Silzar raiders clash with Gyv ambushers. Every few miles, another burned village. Every few days, another skirmish. The border isn't a line—it's a wound.

**North — Eros**: The haunted forest. The Gyv avoid it as thoroughly as the Silzar do. The Nemo cannot be manipulated, and that terrifies the Gyv more than any physical threat. Some desperate voices whisper about reaching out to Eros, using the Nemo against the Silzar. Most think this is insane. Some are considering it anyway.

**East — The Coast**: Open water. The Gray Isles lie offshore. Trade ships come and go. This is Iylovia's lifeline—and increasingly, its escape route.

**South — Howlwood and Beyond**: The forests thin into the Graymist region, eventually giving way to other territories. Less contested than the west, but also less developed. Scattered settlements, ancient woods, things that prefer not to be disturbed.

### The Rivers

**River Sorrow**: Flows through the northwestern war zone. Named for obvious reasons. Its banks are lined with settlements that have seen too much death.

**Gwyrdyr River**: The main waterway of western Iylovia, emerging at Malesi. Trade and troops move along this river—when the Silzar aren't raiding it.

**Skleidyon River**: Cuts through the heart of Iylovia, passing through the capital at Theochori. The safest trade route, the spine of what remains of Gyv civilization.

**Odrigi River**: Flows through the eastern regions toward the coast. Eastern Gyv control this water, and eastern Gyv control the trade it enables.

**Savarin River**: Southeastern waterway, connecting interior settlements to coastal ports. Growing in importance as the west collapses.

**Torpastros River**: Far southeastern river, at the edge of Gyv territory. Quiet. Removed from the war. Some Gyv are buying land here, just in case.

### The Forests

Each of Iylovia's forests has its own character—shaped by geography, history, and the Gyv who've lived among them.

#### Gwyrdyr Forest

The war forest. This woodland has seen more blood than any other place in the region. Silzar raids push in from the plains; Gyv ambushes strike back from the trees. The villages here are fortified, their people hard-eyed and suspicious even by Gyv standards.

Gwyrdyr has become a killing ground. The Gyv have learned to use every advantage the terrain offers—dense undergrowth for hiding, narrow paths for ambush, acoustic tricks that make sounds echo from wrong directions. Silzar who push too deep tend not to return.

But the forest is shrinking. The Silzar burn what they can't hold. Every year, the treeline retreats a little further.

#### Leering Wood

Northern forest with an unsettling reputation. Travelers report feeling watched. Trees seem to lean inward. Sounds carry strangely—footsteps from the wrong direction, voices where no one stands.

Some say the forest is haunted. Others say it's just Gyv being Gyv, playing psychological games on visitors. The truth is probably both: the Gyv have cultivated Leering Wood's unsettling atmosphere, but something in these woods was strange long before the Gyv arrived.

#### Astrella Forest

The beautiful forest. Ancient trees with silver-gray bark. Clearings filled with flowers that bloom in moonlight. The Gyv consider Astrella sacred—or as sacred as a culture of manipulators can consider anything.

Important rituals happen here. Coming-of-age ceremonies. Marriages between powerful families. The creation of Tested Bonds between Gyv who want genuine relationships. Astrella is one of the few places where Gyv try to be honest with each other.

Try.

#### Bittermarsh

Swampland where the forest meets standing water. Difficult terrain, unpleasant conditions, and fiercely independent communities who've chosen isolation over involvement in Gyv politics.

The Bittermarsh Gyv are considered strange by their own people—more direct, less concerned with elaborate manipulation. Some say the swamp breeds honesty because there's no one worth manipulating. Others say they're playing a longer game than anyone realizes.

#### Spinefir Forest

The central forest, vast and ancient. Named for the distinctive spine-like ridges on the fir trees that dominate the region. Spinefir is the heart of what remains of Gyv civilization—far enough from the war to be safe, connected enough by river to matter.

Theochori sits on Spinefir's southern edge, where the Skleidyon River emerges from the trees. The forest provides the capital's security: any army marching on Theochori would have to pass through miles of ambush-ready woodland first.

#### Terror Grove

Something went wrong in Terror Grove.

The forest between Spinefir and Hagwood was once ordinary woodland. Now it's avoided. The trees grow twisted. Animals don't enter. Gyv who venture in report unease that escalates to panic, whispers they can't quite hear, the absolute certainty that something is watching.

The Gyv don't talk about what happened in Terror Grove. Whatever it was, it was recent—within living memory—and important enough to suppress. Some say an experiment in mass manipulation went wrong. Others say something was summoned. Others say it's simply where the Gyv disposed of problems they didn't want found.

No one goes to Terror Grove unless they have to. Those who do come back changed—or don't come back at all.

#### Hagwood

Working forest. This is where Iylovia's timber industry is centered—carefully managed logging that provides wood for construction, export, and the endless repair of war-damaged settlements.

Hagwood is practical, populated by practical Gyv. Less scheming here, more focus on getting work done. The lumber camps operate on written contracts, clear schedules, and as much honesty as Gyv ever manage. This is where you come to get things, not to play games.

#### Howlwood

Southern forest named for the sounds that echo through it at night. Not wolves—the Gyv claim there are no wolves in Howlwood. Then what howls? The Gyv don't answer directly.

Howlwood is remote, sparsely settled, and home to Gyv who want to be left alone. The communities here have little contact with the war in the west or the trade in the east. They watch their own borders and keep their own secrets.

Something lives in Howlwood. The Gyv have some arrangement with it. Outsiders are not invited to learn the details.

#### Graymist Forest

The southeastern forest, wrapped in fog more often than not. The mist rolls in from Graymist Lake and settles among the trees, creating an atmosphere of soft gray silence.

Graymist is where things go to be hidden. Exiles settle here. Treasures are buried here. Secrets that even the Gyv want forgotten end up in Graymist. The communities are small and keep to themselves, and they're very good at not seeing things that pass through.

### Major Settlements

**Theochori**: The capital. A city of whispers built where the Skleidyon River emerges from Spinefir Forest. The Council of Silence meets here in a chamber where speaking is forbidden. Debates happen in writing, passed back and forth over days. It's agonizingly slow, but it's the only way the Gyv can govern without manipulating each other.

In theory.

**Krania**: Northern fortress-city anchoring the Gwyrdyr defense. Krania has held against Silzar pressure for decades, its walls thick and its garrison paranoid. The city is organized around written communication and strict protocols—more militarized than anywhere else in Iylovia, more willing to trust because they have to.

**Balastafika**: Central city on the edge of Astrella Forest. Administrative center, market town, and refuge for Gyv fleeing the western war. Balastafika is crowded, tense, and full of newcomers who've lost everything. Crime is high. Trust is low. Even by Gyv standards.

**Malesi**: Where the Gwyrdyr River reaches navigable water. Trading town, transit point, and target. Malesi has been raided multiple times but rebuilt each time—too valuable to abandon, too exposed to truly secure.

### Notable Locations

#### Cheykiov

Fortress ruins in the hills southwest of Spinefir Forest.

Cheykiov was supposed to hold. Thick walls, strong garrison, excellent position. It fell anyway—not to Silzar assault but to betrayal. Someone opened the gates. Someone manipulated the defenders. The details are disputed; every faction blames every other faction.

Now it's ruins. The Silzar stripped what they wanted and moved on. The Gyv haven't rebuilt because no one can agree who should control it, and no one trusts anyone else's garrison.

Some say treasure lies buried in the collapse. Others say something worse than treasure was sealed away when the fortress fell. The ruins are avoided, but not forgotten.

#### Graymist Lake

Large lake in the southern forest, source of the fog that gives Graymist Forest its name. Beautiful and eerie. The water is dark, the shores muddy, the silence absolute.

Things live in Graymist Lake. The local Gyv know better than to fish certain depths or swim at certain times. They've made arrangements. Outsiders who ignore warnings occasionally vanish.

### Traveling in Iylovia

The forests are safe in the sense that bandits rarely operate here—the Gyv have other ways of taking from travelers. The forests are dangerous in the sense that everyone you meet is probably manipulating you.

**Rules for outsiders**:

- Speak as little as possible. Writing is safer.
- Assume every deal has hidden terms.
- Never accept hospitality without understanding what you're agreeing to.
- The helpful stranger is working an angle. So is the unfriendly one.
- If a Gyv seems trustworthy, they're very good at their job.

The eastern trade routes are most accessible to outsiders. Merchants come and go; the Gyv need their goods too much to make trade impossible. The west is war zone—outsiders are suspected of being spies, and both sides might be right. The central forests are Gyv territory in the purest sense, where the games are played by Gyv rules and outsiders are pieces to be used.

Welcome to Iylovia. Watch your words.
