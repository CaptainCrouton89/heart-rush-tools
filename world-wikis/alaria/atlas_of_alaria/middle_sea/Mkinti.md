## Mkinti

Tags: state, nation

Mkinti occupies the southwestern portion of Erpeus Island, a land of glittering mountains and labyrinthine underground cities. This is Ohblex territory—gem gnomes who were born from the precious stones themselves and who guard the secret of clockwork jealously. The surface is all jagged peaks and treacherous passes; the real civilization lies beneath, in tunnels that sparkle with embedded gems and hum with mechanical precision.

### The Gemstone Peaks

The mountain range that defines Mkinti, named for the gems that riddle its stone. Every color of precious stone can be found here—rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and stranger things without names. The Ohblex have mined these peaks for generations, not just for trade but for sustenance—they consume gems instead of food.

The surface settlements cling to the mountainsides, but they're mostly facades. The real cities lie underground, connected by tunnels that twist, branch, and trap. Outsiders who enter without guides don't come back.

### Wizzik

The current capital, seat of House Wizzik and now the center of Mkinti's government. Before the succession crisis, Wizzik was just one of five house seats; now it's everything.

The city descends through multiple underground levels, each more elaborate than the last. The deepest levels house the most sensitive workshops—where clockwork secrets are kept, where the finest gems are processed, where House Wizzik's inner circle schemes and plots.

The city is trapped. Every corridor, every doorway, every staircase has mechanisms that can seal, collapse, or kill. The gnomes navigate by memory and subtle markers; visitors navigate by luck and gnomish patience.

### Zunuki

The second city, traditionally controlled by one of the now-headless houses. Zunuki specialized in jewelry—combining Ohblex gem expertise with artistic design that fetched premium prices across the Middle Sea.

The city is in turmoil. House Wizzik has claimed control, but the local craftsmen are loyal to their dead masters. Production has slowed, quality has suffered, and everyone is waiting to see what happens next.

### Other Settlements

#### Uzikni

A mountain town at one of the few reliable passes through the Gemstone Peaks. Most trade enters Mkinti through Uzikni, which means the town has more contact with outsiders than most Ohblex settlements. The gnomes here are marginally more tolerant of non-gnomish company—emphasis on marginally.

#### Elfekin

A mining settlement deep in the peaks, named for a vein of pale green gems that the original settlers thought looked like elf eyes. The comparison was not meant as a compliment.

#### Tiknurtir

A southern town near the Bejeweled Palace, positioned to watch the cursed structure without getting too close. The residents have accumulated generations of lore about the palace's dangers—and occasionally sell that information to treasure hunters foolish enough to try their luck.

### The Bejeweled Palace

The cursed palace of an ancient Mkinti king, abandoned for centuries. The structure is visible from Tiknurtir on clear days—a gleaming edifice that catches sunlight in ways that hurt to look at.

The palace treasury is legendary. The old king accumulated wealth beyond counting, gems of sizes that shouldn't exist, clockwork marvels that no modern gnome can replicate. He died there, along with his entire court, in circumstances the Ohblex don't discuss. The palace has been avoided ever since.

Something lives in the palace now. Or something remains. Or something waits. The gnomes have stories, each more terrifying than the last, and none of them agree. What everyone agrees on: those who enter don't return. Those who camp too close have nightmares. Those who take souvenirs from the outer grounds regret it.

### Underground Mkinti

The surface settlements are the visible fraction of Mkinti. Below ground, the gnome cities spread through natural caverns and carved tunnels, lit by phosphorescent fungi and gem-light, connected by passages that only residents can navigate.

The underground cities contain:
- **Workshops**: Where clockwork is crafted, in secrecy that borders on paranoid
- **Gem halls**: Where the Ohblex consume their sustenance and assess new finds
- **Trap galleries**: Where the mechanisms that protect each city are maintained
- **House vaults**: Where each family stores its wealth, guarded by devices that would make siege engineers weep

The tunnels between cities are even more dangerous than the cities themselves. Wrong turns lead to dead ends—or just dead.

### Relations with Neighbors

Mkinti shares Erpeus with Lier to the north and Azuros to the far north. The Ohblex view both with condescension. Lier's humans are too direct, too honest, too easy to manipulate. Azuros's monks are fascinating in their alien simplicity but ultimately irrelevant.

Trade flows through Lier—Mkinti's clockwork and gems for Lier's agricultural products and access to broader markets. The relationship is profitable and mutually suspicious, as the Ohblex prefer.
