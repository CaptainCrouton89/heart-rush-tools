## Swampdeep

Tags: swamp

Home to swamp goblins—adapted to the poisons and venoms a d toxic swamp gasses of the swamp.

Also has witches, which prey upon the goblins. Entire swamp fills with toxic gas, totally poisonous, causes your lungs to begin to bleed and you drown in your own blood in a minute.

Infested with massive leeches, deathfog, and misery-sprites.

Water is quite deep—easy to drown. Saltwater

### Origin: The Drowning of the Emerald Coast

Swampdeep is not a natural swamp—it is a monument to catastrophe. Fifty million years ago, a Deluge Titan—a living tsunami the size of a mountain—emerged from a Pelus leyline intersection off the western coast in what became known as the largest Pelus breach in recorded history. The creature rolled inland for three hundred miles before dispersing, leaving the land beneath it permanently waterlogged. Where once a thriving civilization stood, only waterlogged ruin remains. The land will never dry. The waters will never recede.

The civilization that existed before the Drowning left no survivors and few traces. Most architectural remnants were obliterated by the deluge, scattered and sunken beyond recovery. What few structures survived remain buried under poisoned waters—monuments to a world that drowned.

### Omegra's Hut: A Window into the Before

Omegra's Hut is the only known pre-Drowning structure still accessible. This mostly sunken dungeon contains architecture from the civilization the Deluge Titan erased—the only physical evidence of who lived here before the waters came. Its presence suggests a sophisticated society was lost to the Drowning, their knowledge and culture dissolved into saltwater and toxic gas.

### Tide Walkers: The Eternal Guardians

The catastrophe that created Swampdeep did not end with the Drowning itself. Manifestations of Pelus water elementals—beings known as Tide Walkers—still patrol the swamp's depths. These confused guardians, born from the raw elemental chaos of the breached leyline, remain bound to the flooded lands. They defend depths of a nation that no longer exists, fulfilling purposes perhaps only they remember. Whether they serve as protectors, wardens, or prisoners of their own creation remains unknown.

## Bygone Hills

Just south of the eastern edge of Swampdeep lie the Bygone Hills, a region of rolling terrain marked by ancient ruins and forgotten city-states.

### Eidlesandres

A city-state in the Bygone Hills, maintaining its independence through careful neutrality and strategic positioning.

### Shystani Forest

A small forest east of Eidlesandres, notable for its sacred sites and ancient power.

#### God's Court

A massive open-air arena encircled by towering stone statues—the pantheon of a vanished people, each deity frozen in stone, staring in eternal judgment at those who stand at the center. The weight of those divine gazes creates a powerful zone of truth magic.

At the center of the arena stands an ancient altar. Anyone who swears to tell the truth upon this altar becomes magically bound to speak only truth—lies become impossible, evasions fail, and the full truth spills forth regardless of consequence. The Shystani forest has grown around this place, but locals still use God's Court to settle disputes, verify oaths, and force confessions from the accused. Those who enter the arena feel the stone gods' eyes boring into their souls.
