### Omegra's Hut

Mostly sunken dungeon in Swampdeep.

## Bygone Hills

Just south of the eastern edge of Swampdeep lie the Bygone Hills, a region of rolling terrain marked by ancient ruins and forgotten city-states.

### Eidlesandres

A city-state in the Bygone Hills, maintaining its independence through careful neutrality and strategic positioning.

### Shystani Forest

A small forest east of Eidlesandres, notable for its sacred sites and ancient power.

#### God's Court

A massive open-air arena encircled by towering stone statues—the pantheon of a vanished people, each deity frozen in stone, staring in eternal judgment at those who stand at the center. The weight of those divine gazes creates a powerful zone of truth magic.

At the center of the arena stands an ancient altar. Anyone who swears to tell the truth upon this altar becomes magically bound to speak only truth—lies become impossible, evasions fail, and the full truth spills forth regardless of consequence. The Shystani forest has grown around this place, but locals still use God's Court to settle disputes, verify oaths, and force confessions from the accused. Those who enter the arena feel the stone gods' eyes boring into their souls.
