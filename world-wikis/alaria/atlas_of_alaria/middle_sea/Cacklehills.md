## Cacklehills

Tags: hills, region

The Cacklehills rise east of the Elephant Groves, a stretch of broken, rocky terrain that got its name from the hyenas that infest the area. At night, their laughter echoes off the stones—a sound that carries for miles and makes sleep difficult for anyone not used to it.

### The Hyena Problem

The hills are home to an unusually large hyena population—packs that have grown bold over generations, learning that the terrain favors them and that most travelers would rather flee than fight. They're not magical, not cursed, just extremely successful predators who've claimed this territory as their own.

The hyenas hunt in coordinated packs, using the rocky terrain to funnel prey into ambushes. They're smart enough to avoid the Elephant Groves (the spirit there doesn't tolerate them) and smart enough to recognize when a target is too dangerous. But anything that looks weak, slow, or alone is fair game.

### Geography

The Cacklehills are rugged but not high—more broken ground than true mountains. Rocky outcroppings, steep gullies, scattered caves, and scrubby vegetation that provides just enough cover for predators. The terrain is difficult to traverse and easy to get lost in.

Water is scarce. The few springs and seasonal streams are fiercely contested by both wildlife and any travelers foolish enough to need them. Smart travelers carry their own water and cross the hills as quickly as possible.

### Strategic Position

The Cacklehills sit between the Elephant Groves and the United Free Nations to the southeast. Anyone traveling overland between these regions must either cross the hills, circle around through goblin territory, or find another route entirely.

This has made the Cacklehills a natural barrier—not quite impassable, but dangerous enough that casual travel is discouraged. The United Free Nations uses this to their advantage; the hills provide a buffer against whatever might come from the west.

### Who Uses the Hills

Aside from the hyenas, the Cacklehills see occasional use by:

**Smugglers**: The terrain is excellent for avoiding detection. Those who know the hidden paths can move goods between regions without passing through watched territories.

**Outlaws**: Anyone fleeing authority from any direction might hide in the Cacklehills. It's miserable living, but better than capture.

**Hunters**: Some specialized hunters track the hyenas for sport, bounty, or because someone paid them to reduce the population. This last category rarely succeeds; the hyenas breed faster than they can be killed.

### The Laughter

The cackling that gives the hills their name is unsettling even when you know its source. The hyenas call to each other constantly—coordinating hunts, establishing territory, apparently just enjoying the sound of their own voices. At night, in unfamiliar terrain, surrounded by echoing laughter from every direction, even hardened travelers have been known to panic.

Local legend claims the hyenas are laughing at something specific—a cosmic joke, a shared memory, the foolishness of anyone who enters their territory. The hyenas, of course, aren't saying.
