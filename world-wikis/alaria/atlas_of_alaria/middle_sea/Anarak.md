## Anarak

Tags: state, nation

A basin nation ruled by the black dragon Tepheranos, squeezed between the Crags of Geth to the south and Argysis in the Kharvorn Mountains to the north. The population has been brainwashed over a century to see their dragon overlord as a savior rather than a tyrant.

Anarak is militaristic, isolated, and hungry for expansion—but locked in a standoff with Argysis, where Tepheranos's treacherous brother Rothogomos rules.

### Tephrakus

The capital city, built at the base of the Black Hills near Tepheranos's lair. A grim, orderly city where loyalty to the dragon is mandatory and dissent is dangerous. Heavy taxation funds the military while most citizens live in poverty.

### Nidzhoni

The other major city, located in the center of the basin. More agricultural than Tephrakus, serving as the breadbasket that feeds the military machine.

### The Black Hills

A range of dark hills in the northern part of the basin, where Tepheranos makes his lair. The hills are considered the heart of Anarak's power—and its oppression.

### The Basin

The great basin that forms Anarak's territory—grassland and farmland stretching between the mountains. Good agricultural land, heavily taxed, worked by a population that believes their sacrifices serve a noble cause.

### Borders

- **North**: Argysis (enemy) in the Kharvorn Mountains
- **South**: The Crags of Geth (Griselia) — source of goblin raids
- **West**: Erasnus (barely) — a potential target
- **East**: Other Kharvorn foothills

### The Dragon Feud

Tepheranos and Rothogomos were brothers who came to conquer Argysis together. Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, taking the dwarven treasure for himself. Tepheranos retreated to Anarak, built it into a regional power, and now both dragons plot each other's destruction.

Neither can strike elsewhere while the other lives. Anarak is stronger but vulnerable; Argysis is weaker but fortified. The standoff has lasted generations.
