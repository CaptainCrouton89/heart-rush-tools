## Watar

Tags: state, nation

A Dwarblin merchant state on a peninsula in the western Middle Sea. Northwest of the Telphineas Strait, south of Erasnus, with Echea at the peninsula's tip beyond them. Ruled by an oligarchy of trading families, Watar is scrappy, entrepreneurial, and hungry for more.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though increasingly straining against it. Relations with Bestacia are worsening over control of the Telphineas Strait.

### Solera

The capital, seat of the Soleri family. A bustling port city where deals are made in every tavern and warehouse. The harbor is crowded with merchant vessels; the streets are crowded with traders, sailors, and opportunists. Wealth is displayed openly—the Dwarblin have nothing to prove to anyone but themselves.

### Gravo

Major city controlled by the Gravo family, on the eastern coast. More industrial than Solera—shipyards, workshops, and craftsmen producing the practical, unbreakable goods Dwarblin are known for. The Gravo family made their fortune in manufacturing and shipping.

### Madero

Major city controlled by the Madero family, in the south near the strait. The most strategically positioned of the three cities, and the Madero know it. They've invested heavily in naval power and are the loudest voices pushing for strait control.

### The Coinspine Mountains

The mountain range along Watar's western border. Named by Dwarblin merchants who saw the peaks as a spine of silver waiting to be mined—and mined it they did. The mountains yield iron, copper, and enough precious metals to fund the trading families' ambitions.

### Gleiwood Forest

Forest in the east, inland from the coast. Managed for timber—Dwarblin shipyards have an endless appetite for wood.

### Forest of Durnos

Southeastern forest, wilder than Gleiwood. Less economically developed; the Dwarblin haven't found a good reason to exploit it yet.

### Seabreach Forest

Southern coastal forest, along the approach to the Telphineas Strait. Strategically important—whoever controls this coastline controls access to the strait from the north.

### Telphineas Strait

The prize. This narrow passage connects the eastern and western Middle Sea. Watar is positioned northwest of it, Bestacia northeast (but blocked by mountains). Whoever controls the strait controls tariffs on half the sea trade.

Watar has ships. Bestacia has lawyers. The situation is escalating.
