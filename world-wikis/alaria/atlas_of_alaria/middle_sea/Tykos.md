## Tykos

Tags: state, nation, island, geography

Tykos is an island chain south of Erpeus, home to minotaur clans who've practiced slavery for longer than most civilizations have existed. The islands are rocky, resource-poor, and strategically positioned at a crossroads of Middle Sea trade routes. The minotaurs turned these disadvantages into a brutal economy: what they can't grow, they take; what they can't use, they sell.

The slave markets of Tykos are famous—or infamous—across Alaria. Buyers come from nations that publicly condemn the practice, purchasing trained workers, household servants, and worse. The minotaurs don't pretend to be anything other than what they are. They find the hypocrisy of their critics amusing.

### Slavos

The capital and largest settlement, built around the primary slave market. Slavos sits on the largest island's best harbor, positioned to receive raiding ships returning with captives and merchant vessels arriving to buy.

The market operates daily, with major auctions weekly. The facility is well-organized, almost clinical—holding pens, inspection areas, auction blocks, and processing centers for new arrivals. The minotaurs treat their merchandise as valuable property, which means adequate food, basic medical care, and protection from damage. It's not kindness; it's business.

The ruling clan of Slavos holds outsized influence in Tykos politics by controlling the market. Other clans raid and capture; Slavos processes and sells. The arrangement creates dependencies that keep the peace.

### The Major Islands

#### Toros

The second-largest settlement, controlled by a clan known for military prowess. Toros produces most of Tykos's mercenary companies—minotaur warriors hired out to foreign conflicts. The training facilities here are brutal and effective; Toros mercenaries command premium prices.

#### Skoldar

A quarry town on a rocky island whose stone has been extracted for generations. Slave labor works the quarries under minotaur overseers, cutting blocks that are shipped across the Middle Sea. The work is hard and dangerous; life expectancy in Skoldar's quarries is not long.

#### Fynol

A fishing and raiding settlement on Tykos's southern edge. The clans here specialize in coastal raids—fast ships, quick strikes, captured populations. They supply raw material to Slavos's markets and take a percentage of the sale price.

#### Alyzon

A smaller island settlement that's developed a reputation for training household slaves. Alyzon's graduates are prized for their obedience, skills, and presentation. Wealthy buyers specifically request Alyzon-trained servants.

#### Pyndar

A port town that handles legitimate trade—the non-slave commerce that Tykos needs to survive. Grain imports, luxury goods, weapons, and other necessities flow through Pyndar. The merchants here maintain relationships with traders who won't deal in Slavos's markets.

#### Stonebreach

A coastal fortress town on Tykos's eastern edge, positioned to watch the Tykon Channel and the ongoing chaos in Ofrenia. Stonebreach serves as early warning for any naval threat and as a base for raids into disrupted Ofrenian waters.

### Smaller Settlements

#### Scarr

A harsh settlement on a small, rocky island. The name refers to the landscape—scarred by quarrying, stripped of vegetation, barely habitable. Scarr's residents are the toughest of Tykos's minotaurs, and they're proud of it.

#### Seaview

A settlement on Tykos's southeastern edge, overlooking open water. Seaview maintains the lighthouse network that guides ships through the island chain's treacherous passages—a service that earns goodwill even from nations that despise Tykos's primary trade.

### The Slave Trade

Tykos's economy runs on human suffering. The process is systematic:

**Acquisition**: Raids on coastal settlements, purchases from pirates and criminals, children of existing slaves, and convicted criminals sold by foreign courts seeking revenue.

**Processing**: New arrivals are assessed, classified, and prepared for sale. Skilled workers are identified; potential troublemakers are noted. Medical issues are addressed to maximize sale value.

**Training**: Depending on intended use, slaves receive training in Slavos or specialized facilities like Alyzon. Household servants learn etiquette; laborers learn obedience; pleasure slaves learn to perform.

**Sale**: The markets of Slavos operate continuously. Buyers arrive from across the Middle Sea, often through intermediaries who provide deniability. Prices vary by age, health, skills, and appearance.

**Distribution**: Purchased slaves are shipped to their new owners. Tykos maintains no responsibility after sale; what happens next is the buyer's business.

### The Minotaurs

Tykos's minotaurs are massive—seven to eight feet tall, heavily muscled, with the distinctive bull heads that give them their name. They're not mindless brutes; their society has laws, traditions, and complex politics. They simply believe that strength justifies dominance, and they're very strong.

The clan system organizes everything. Each minotaur belongs to a clan through birth or adoption. Clans control territories, compete for status, and sometimes war—though the rules of conflict limit damage to valuable infrastructure and slave populations.

Minotaur culture values martial prowess, clan loyalty, and practical results. Philosophy and abstract morality are for weaker races. The minotaurs know what they are and don't apologize for it.

### Relations with Neighbors

Most nations maintain complicated relationships with Tykos. They condemn slavery publicly while purchasing slaves privately. They refuse diplomatic recognition while sending merchants to Pyndar. They threaten intervention while calculating that the cost isn't worth it.

Lier trades with Tykos despite moral discomfort—the minotaurs have gold, and gold spends regardless of source. The United Free Nations officially boycotts Tykos but can't prevent all commerce. Ofrenia's ongoing civil war has disrupted trade routes, creating both problems and opportunities for Tykos's raiders.

The minotaurs understand their position perfectly. They're too useful to destroy, too profitable to ignore, too strong to conquer cheaply. As long as that calculation holds, Tykos will continue exactly as it always has.
