## Erpeus

Tags: island, geography

Erpeus is a major island in the Middle Sea, positioned between Ofrenia to the east and the mainland to the west. Three distinct states share the island—the wind-monk theocracy of Azuros in the northern peaks, the merchant republic of Lier in the central hills, and the gem-gnome oligarchy of Mkinti in the southwestern mountains. They couldn't be more different, and they manage to coexist through a combination of geographic separation and mutual disinterest.

### Geography

Erpeus is mountainous, with the highest peaks in the north (Azuros) and southwest (Mkinti's Gemstone Peaks). The central region (Lier) is lower, with rolling hills suitable for agriculture, though even here the terrain is rugged by mainland standards.

The island's shape is irregular, with a pronounced peninsula in the north where Azuros clings to the heights, and a bulge in the southwest where Mkinti's mountains dominate. The coastline is rocky and dramatic throughout, with few natural harbors—Hessam in Lier being the notable exception.

### The Three States

#### Azuros

The northernmost territory, home to the Shogi Monastery and its air-attuned monks. Azuros occupies the island's highest peaks, accessible only through difficult mountain paths. The monks have lived here for centuries in deliberate isolation, developing wind magic to extraordinary levels while ignoring the outside world entirely.

#### Lier

The central territory, controlled by human merchant families operating out of Hessam. Lier serves as the commercial hub of Erpeus, handling trade between the reclusive gnomes of Mkinti and the broader Middle Sea. The Bay of Whispers, a supernatural phenomenon where words echo across time, draws seekers of forbidden knowledge.

#### Mkinti

The southwestern territory, domain of the Ohblex gem gnomes. Mkinti is defined by the Gemstone Peaks—mountains riddled with precious stones and honeycombed with trapped tunnels. The gnomes are the sole keepers of clockwork secrets on Alaria, and they guard those secrets with paranoid intensity. Recent political upheaval has thrown Mkinti into crisis, with four of five ruling houses suddenly headless.

### Major Features

#### The Murder Hills

The highland region between Lier and Azuros, dangerous enough that the name stuck. Bandits, monsters, and worse shelter in the rocky terrain, preying on travelers attempting to reach the monastery. Neither Lier nor Azuros takes responsibility for clearing them out.

#### Devil's Crest

A dramatic volcanic formation on the border between Lier and Mkinti. The jagged peaks are largely uninhabited, and local legends suggest something ancient and dangerous lurks within. Travelers avoid the area when possible.

#### The Gemstone Peaks

Mkinti's mountain range, famous for the precious stones embedded throughout. The Ohblex have mined these peaks for generations, building underground cities that extend far beneath the surface.

#### The Bay of Whispers

The supernatural bay outside Hessam, where spoken words are captured forever and can be heard across time. The phenomenon draws scholars, mystics, and desperate seekers from across the Middle Sea.

#### The Bejeweled Palace

An abandoned palace in Mkinti, cursed and avoided. The treasury of an ancient gnome king lies within, along with whatever killed him and his entire court. No one has successfully plundered it; few who've tried have returned.

### Surrounding Waters

#### Okesha's Passage

The strait northwest of Erpeus, connecting different portions of the Middle Sea. Ships traveling between the western Middle Sea and points east often pass through here.

#### Tiber's Passage

The strait south of Erpeus, between the island and Tykos to the south. The waters here are busy with traffic moving between Erpeus, Tykos, and Ofrenia.

#### Tykon Channel

The waters east of Erpeus and west of Ofrenia, separating Erpeus from the three kingdoms' ongoing civil war. Traffic through the Tykon Channel has declined since Alisandra's conquest disrupted regional trade.

### Relations Between States

The three states of Erpeus exist in a state of mutual tolerance rather than cooperation. Mkinti needs Lier to reach the outside world. Lier profits from the gnomish trade. Azuros ignores both entirely.

There have been no wars between the three states in recorded history—the geography makes conquest impractical, and none of them wants what the others have. The gnomes wouldn't know what to do with farmland. The merchants can't reach the monastery. The monks don't want anything.

This arrangement has proven remarkably stable. Whether it will survive Mkinti's internal crisis remains to be seen.
