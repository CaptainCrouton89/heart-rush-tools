## Myorna

Tags: state, nation

A Sivakr (Silver Elf) kingdom in the Grey Mountains, a sub-range of the southern Kharvorn. The Sivakr spent thousands of years underground before emerging fifty years ago to trade with the surface world. It's going poorly.

Borders Camaran (southeast), Erasnus (southwest), and barely touches Hephake (northwest). Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though neighbors are turning hostile as they discover the truth about Sivakr memory manipulation.

### Vad Ilghak

The capital city, built into the Grey Mountains. A vertical city of stone, carved chambers, and passages leading deep underground to the old warrens. Home to the royal palace, the great memory libraries, and the massive Deoric library—one of the largest collections of sacrifice-based magical texts in existence.

### Urkhuk

The second major city, positioned closer to the Erasnun border. More surface-oriented than Vad Ilghak, with Sivakr who've begun assimilating into surface culture. A point of tension between those who want to stay and those who want to return underground.

### The Forbidden Valley

A massive, impossibly deep valley north of Vad Ilghak. At its bottom, the Sivakr keep a chained giant in perpetual captivity, extracting blood sacrifices to power all Sivakr mind magic. A colossal statue of Tiira overlooks the valley—their patron goddess, cultivated (some say brainwashed) to serve Myornan interests.

Access is forbidden to all but the highest-ranking Sivakr. Outsiders who learn of it rarely live long enough to spread the knowledge.

### The Stone Slums

Foggy districts of flat, slate-built, short buildings where the poor of Myorna make their homes. Without paper records, the inhabitants slip through the system of control. This is where golems were first discovered and built—and where unsavory characters find refuge from Sivakr society.

### The Grey Mountains

The sub-range of the Kharvorn where Myorna is situated. The mountains contain extensive underground complexes—remnants of thousands of years of subterranean civilization. Many passages remain unexplored or sealed.

### The Underground

Most Sivakr still live partially underground, in warrens and complexes connected to the surface cities. The old ways persist. Some want to seal the surface entrances and return to isolation; others see the underground as backwards and want full integration with the surface world.
