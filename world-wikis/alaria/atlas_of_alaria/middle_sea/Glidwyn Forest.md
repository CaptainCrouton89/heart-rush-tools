## Glidwyn Forest

Tags: forest, region

Glidwyn Forest fills the transition zone between Eloweir coastal territory and the interior plains, a dense temperate woodland that marks where Eloesi ends and wilder lands begin. The forest isn't claimed by any nation—it's simply there, a green buffer between the sea elves and the goblin chaos to the east.

### The Forest Character

Glidwyn is old forest, though not as old or strange as the Glass Forest to the south. The trees are tall, the canopy thick, and the undergrowth dense enough to make travel difficult for anyone not on established paths. Game is plentiful—deer, boar, birds—and the streams run clear with fish.

The Eloweir of Eloesi use the forest's western edges for timber and hunting. They've never pushed deep into the interior; there's no need, and the further east you go, the closer you get to goblin territory.

### The Eastern Edge

Where Glidwyn Forest thins into grassland, the Shiverplains begin. Goblin broods occasionally camp at the forest's edge, using the trees for shelter before raiding expeditions or retreating into cover when pursued. The Eloweir don't bother chasing them into the forest—the goblins know the terrain better and aren't worth the trouble.

### The Bygone Hills Border

Glidwyn's northeastern edge approaches the Bygone Hills, where Eidlsandres hides behind its illusions. The gnomes don't use the forest, but their defensive magic sometimes affects travelers passing through—a wrong turn, a sense of being watched, a sudden conviction that continuing east would be a bad idea.

Goblins who wander through Glidwyn toward the Bygone Hills sometimes emerge weeks later on the forest's western edge, confused about where they were trying to go. Others don't emerge at all. The forest itself isn't dangerous—but the hills beyond certainly are.

### Wildlife

Standard temperate forest fauna: deer, wolves, bears, boar, rabbits, and the full complement of smaller creatures. Nothing magical or unusual, which makes Glidwyn stand out in a region where Old Talaria's influence bleeds strangeness into everything nearby.

Some scholars believe the forest's mundanity is intentional—that the gnomes of Eidlsandres extend subtle protective magic to keep the Glass Forest's corruption from spreading north. Others think it's just luck. The forest doesn't care about scholarly theories; it simply grows.

### Travel Routes

Paths through Glidwyn connect Eloesi's eastern settlements to the plains beyond. These routes are maintained by no one officially but persist through regular use—hunters, traders willing to deal with goblins, and travelers heading south. The paths are safe enough by day; by night, the usual forest hazards apply.
