## Joswik

Tags: state, nation

Joswik occupies southern Ofrenia, a land of mountains, fertile valleys, and windswept plateau. It's the largest of the three Ofrenian kingdoms by area, though much of that territory is difficult terrain—the Gnomestone Mountains in the south, the Oshkensi Plateau in the southwest, and the rugged interior hills that have always made centralized rule difficult.

Prince Edric governs from Padena, watching his sister's armies occupy the north and waiting for the inevitable. The landscape that makes Joswik hard to govern also makes it hard to conquer—but everyone knows Alisandra will try eventually.

### Padena

The capital city, nestled in a river valley in the northern interior. Padena grew up around a natural ford—a crossing point that became a market, then a town, then a city. The architecture is practical rather than grand: stone buildings built to last, streets wide enough for cattle drives, and fortifications that show their age.

Prince Edric's palace is the largest structure in the city, but it's modest by royal standards. The old king built for function, not display, and his youngest son has maintained that tradition.

Since the Tornian occupation, Padena has swelled with refugees. Tent cities ring the walls. Markets are crowded and prices are climbing. The city that seemed sleepy a year ago now buzzes with desperate energy.

### Valeria

The second city, a port on the southeastern coast overlooking the Gulf of Joswik. Valeria handles most of Joswik's maritime trade—what's left of it, now that routes through Tornia are disrupted. The harbor is deep and well-protected, and the city's merchants have profited from the chaos by offering alternative shipping.

The city has a rougher feel than Padena, more cosmopolitan and less concerned with tradition. Some of the wealthier Tornian refugees have settled here, bringing gold and connections that the locals view with mixed feelings.

### The Gnomestone Mountains

The mountain range that defines Joswik's southern border, named for the gnome communities that supposedly dwelt here before humans arrived. Whether gnomes ever lived here is debatable; the stone formations that look like gnome-carved structures might just be unusual geology.

What's not debatable is the wealth. Iron and copper seams run through these mountains, and mining towns dot the valleys and passes. The mountain lords have always been semi-independent, paying taxes to whoever rules in Padena but governing their own affairs.

#### Mining Towns

Scattered through the mountains, connected by difficult roads that become impassable in winter. Each town clusters around its mine—iron from the deep veins, copper from the surface deposits, stone from quarries that have operated for generations. The miners are tough, insular, and suspicious of lowland politics.

### The Oshkensi Plateau

A vast grassland plateau in the southwestern interior, rising above the surrounding valleys like a table set for giants. The herders who live here raise sheep and cattle in numbers that feed much of Ofrenia—or did, before the war disrupted everything.

#### Meadow of Laughing

A strange region in the Oshkensi Plateau where the grass grows in patterns that, viewed from the right angle, look like faces frozen in mirth. The herders avoid building here, though they graze their animals through. Local legend claims the meadow marks a mass grave from some ancient conflict, and the dead are laughing at the living.

#### Myrnol's Tower

A ruined wizard's tower on the edge of the plateau, overlooking the southwestern coast. Myrnol was supposedly a sage who withdrew from the world centuries ago to study the stars. The tower is crumbling now, picked over by treasure hunters, but locals claim lights still appear in the upper windows on moonless nights.

### Northern Settlements

#### Trenton & Greymill

Market towns in the northern valleys, serving the agricultural heartland. Grain from these regions once flowed north to Tornia; now it feeds refugees and fills storehouses against uncertain times.

#### Sculpton

A town in the northern hills known for its stone carvers. Decorative stonework from Sculpton adorns buildings across Ofrenia—or did, when trade flowed freely.

### Eastern Coast

#### Shardak

A fishing town on the eastern coast, named for the sharp rocks that make its harbor treacherous for unfamiliar sailors. The locals navigate by memory and childhood practice; outsiders hire pilots or risk their hulls.

### Southern & Southwestern Regions

#### Canfaldo, Banksted, Clifton

A chain of towns along the southern foothills, connecting the mining regions to the coast. Each has its specialty—Canfaldo processes ore, Banksted handles banking and contracts for the mines, Clifton serves as the gateway to the mountain passes.

#### Ellismare

A town in the southwestern interior, at the base of the Oshkensi Plateau. Livestock markets here draw herders from across the plateau for seasonal sales.

#### Osperton & Dagmanton

Coastal towns in the far southwest, looking out toward the open Middle Sea. These are quiet places, more concerned with fishing and local affairs than the great conflicts to the north.

#### Welldale & Pasterton

Southern settlements near the coast, farming communities that have escaped the worst disruption of the war. For now.

### The Gulf of Joswik

The waters south of Joswik's eastern coast, opening into the Middle Sea. The gulf provides sheltered waters for fishing and coastal trade, though the recent disruptions have reduced traffic. Valeria commands the best harbor, but smaller ports dot the coastline.

### The Passage

The strait separating Joswik from Tornia to the north, and from Myastor's island to the east. The Passage has always been contested water—whoever controls it controls traffic between Ofrenia's kingdoms. With Alisandra holding Tornia, the Passage has become a flashpoint. Joswik's few naval vessels patrol nervously, waiting for Sylke's fleet to make a move.
