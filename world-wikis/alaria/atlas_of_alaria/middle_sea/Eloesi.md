## Eloesi

Tags: state, nation

Eloesi occupies the northwestern coast where the landmass connecting Ofrenia to the southern interior meets the sea. It's Eloweir territory—sea elves who've lived here longer than anyone can remember, building curved cities that mirror the tides and harvesting the legendary pearls of Oyster Bay. The coast is rocky and dramatic, the interior rolls into forested hills, and the people are simultaneously laid-back and lethally competent.

### Kair

The capital city, built around a natural harbor on Elessi Bay. Kair's architecture follows Eloweir tradition—curved lines, circular plazas, buildings that flow into each other like water. The city feels organic, grown rather than constructed, though the engineering behind that appearance is sophisticated.

The council chambers occupy a headland overlooking the harbor, a reminder that in Eloesi, political power answers to the sea. Markets sprawl along the waterfront, trading pearls, fish, poisons, and goods from across the Middle Sea.

### Oyster Bay

The smaller bay just south of Kair, and the source of Eloesi's famous pearls. The waters here are shallow, warm, and perfect for oyster cultivation. Eloweir pearl divers have refined their techniques over generations, producing gems that command premium prices across Alaria.

The bay is carefully managed—harvesting quotas, seasonal restrictions, protected breeding areas. The councils take the pearl trade seriously, and poaching is punished severely.

### Elessi Bay

The main bay on Eloesi's western coast, sheltering Kair and several smaller settlements. The waters are deep enough for ocean-going vessels, and the harbor never freezes. Most trade passes through here.

### Urchin Bay

The large bay south of Oyster Bay, named for the giant urchins that make it treacherous. The waters are deeper, colder, and far more dangerous. Ships that venture in report seeing massive spined shapes in the murky depths—and those are the ships that come back.

Rumors persist of treasure in Urchin Bay—centuries of wrecked ships accumulated on the bottom. Expeditions occasionally form to recover it. Most fail expensively.

### The Seawatch Mountains

A range of hills and low mountains in south-central Eloesi. "Mountains" is generous—they're more like tall hills—but they provide timber, grazing land, and a natural barrier between the coast and the interior plains. Watchtowers dot the heights, originally built to spot approaching threats from the south.

### Coastal Settlements

#### Issasmir

A northern port town, smaller than Kair but prosperous. Shipyards here build the sturdy coastal vessels the Eloweir favor.

#### Brachly & Dematir

Twin towns on the eastern edge of Eloweir territory, near where the forest gives way to plains. They serve as trading posts with the goblin tribes—when the goblins feel like trading instead of raiding.

#### Oakdale

An interior town in the forested hills, known for timber and woodworking.

#### Trailsfor

A town at a crossroads in the southern hills, where paths from the coast meet routes heading south toward Old Talaria's ruins.

#### Zessos, Golun, Holckots

Smaller settlements scattered through the interior, mostly agricultural communities supporting the coastal cities.

#### Krakersport

A southern coastal town near the border with the Glass Forest. The people here have learned to live with strangeness drifting across from Old Talaria—trees that move when you're not watching, animals that speak in riddles, weather that doesn't match the sky. It's not safe, exactly, but it's home.

### The Eastern Border

Eloesi's eastern edge fades into Glidwyn Forest and then the open plains beyond. The border is more ecological than political—where the Eloweir forests end and the goblin grasslands begin. Relations with the Scalawag broods are chaotic but manageable; the goblins raid occasionally, the Eloweir retaliate, and life continues.

### The Southwestern Border

The Glass Forest marks where Eloesi ends and Old Talaria's ruins begin. The Eloweir maintain watchtowers along this border, keeping an eye on what emerges from the fae-touched wilderness. Most days, nothing happens. Some days, something does.
