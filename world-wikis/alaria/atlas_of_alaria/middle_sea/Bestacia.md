## Bestacia

Tags: state, nation

A Goshwen gnome republic on the Middle Sea coast, known for scholarship, invention, and a complete lack of military ambition. Bestacia is one of the happiest places on Alaria—pleasant climate, good food, rewarding intellectual culture. The gnomes here would rather tinker than fight.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. Currently dealing with the Ubrik refugee crisis, silvertongue incursions, and escalating tensions with Watar over the Telphineas Strait.

### Petra

The capital city. A charming, well-organized gnome city full of workshops, academies, and comfortable homes. The government operates through elected councils—debates are lively, decisions are slow, and everyone has opinions.

### Kisoy

The second major city, located just north of the southern mountains. Kisoy is the gateway to the mountain passes and the closest Bestacia gets to the Telphineas Strait. More militarily minded than Petra (which isn't saying much), it houses what passes for Bestacia's border defenses.

### Pastrova

A town famous for one of the best law schools in Alaria. Scholars come from across the Middle Sea to study here. Bestacian legal experts are in high demand—they've made careers out of finding loopholes and crafting airtight contracts.

### The Southern Mountains

The mountain range separating Bestacia from the Telphineas Strait. These peaks are home to a remarkable variety of creatures—some native, some introduced by curious Goshwen naturalists over the centuries. The gnomes have a fondness for exotic fauna, and the mountains have become an informal preserve.

Crossing the mountains is difficult. Bestacia's lack of control over the strait stems partly from this geographic barrier.

### The Forests

Temperate woodlands cover much of Bestacia's interior. They'd be lovely if not for the ghouls.

The forests are infested with these soulless undead—remnants of ancient wizard experiments, driven by eternal hunger. They hunt travelers, lurk in the deep woods, and occasionally raid isolated settlements. The gnomes can't exterminate them; their military is too weak, and killing ghouls requires elemental magic or overwhelming force.

Most Bestacians simply avoid the deep forests. Ghoul hunters visit occasionally. The problem persists.

### Telphineas Strait

South of the mountains, this strait is a crucial trade chokepoint connecting different parts of the Middle Sea. Control means tariffs, influence, and economic leverage.

Bestacia wants it. Watar wants it. Bestacia has brains and intrigue; Watar has ships and soldiers. The situation is deteriorating.
