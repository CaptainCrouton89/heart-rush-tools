Golden skinned sky-knights. Numerous towers in the sky, interconnected city built on towers. Higher nobility ride on griffin. Harvest water from the clouds (no water down below). Had city Shtaneres until Hermelia burned it to the ground and fled.

### Shtaneres


Once a great city of Breia. However, Hermelia worked there, got pissed, and burned the entire thing down.
