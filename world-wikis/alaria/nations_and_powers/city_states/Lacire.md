## Lacire

Tags: state, westwilds, human

A city-state of roughly fifteen thousand people built on the Springs of Vyowehr, deep within Ierya at the heart of the Walking Forest. Lacire is unique among human settlements: an entire city that communicates in silence.

### Overview

Lacire exists because its people have learned to live without speech. The Grayls—wooden humanoids who dwell throughout the Walking Forest—find mortal voices physically painful. Early settlers who spoke were driven out or worse. The survivors developed Stillspeech, an elaborate sign language, and over generations built a culture around the absence of voice.

The city sprawls across the springs and surrounding forest floor, its architecture organic and flowing—buildings that curve around massive roots, integrate fallen branches, and use stone from the springs' pools. No sharp angles, no hard edges; the aesthetic minimizes echo and sound reflection.

### Government

Lacire is governed by the Council of Hands—a body of twelve elders chosen for their wisdom in Stillspeech, their understanding of the Compact (the ancient bargain with the Grayls), and their ability to navigate the complex relationships between the city and the forest.

The Council rules by consensus, which is slower than autocracy but suits Lacirean temperament. Debates happen in formal signing chambers where every citizen can watch and participate through gesture. Major decisions can take weeks.

A Keeper of the Compact serves as the Council's spiritual advisor, responsible for maintaining the relationship with the Grayls and leading the generational pilgrimage to Ierya's heart.

### Culture

**Silence:** The defining trait. Speaking above a whisper within city limits is forbidden. Lacireans communicate through Stillspeech, written notes, and a vocabulary of gestures so sophisticated it can convey poetry, philosophy, and insult. Children learn to sign before they walk.

**Sound Discipline:** Lacireans minimize all sound, not just speech. They walk softly, handle objects carefully, build with sound-dampening materials. This creates a city that feels almost dreamlike to visitors—activity everywhere, but nearly silent.

**Music:** Not forbidden, but transformed. Lacirean music is percussion-only: drums, which the Grayls tolerate. Rhythms carry emotion and meaning; a skilled drummer can make listeners weep without a single melodic note.

**Patience:** Lacireans have absorbed something of the Grayls' character. They move deliberately, think slowly, plan for generations. Visitors often find them frustratingly unhurried.

### Economy

Lacire survives on three precious commodities:

**Spring Water:** The Waters of Vyowehr have genuine healing properties. Carefully controlled export ensures the springs are never depleted and prices remain high.

**Grayl-Amber:** Hardened sap from the Walking Forest's trees, occasionally purchased directly from Grayls. Valuable for enchanting and alchemy.

**Guidance:** Anyone crossing the Walking Forest needs a Lacirean guide. They know which paths are passable this season, which groves to avoid, how to navigate a forest that doesn't stay still. Essential and expensive.

### Military

Lacire doesn't need conventional defenses. The city's walls are modest; its militia is small. The Walking Forest itself is the defense.

Hostile forces entering the forest find paths closing, landmarks shifting, the trees themselves seeming to watch. Those who come with violence rarely find Lacire at all. The few who have reached the walls discovered the Grayls waiting—slow, patient, implacable defenders who fight like nothing else.

### Relations

**The Walking Forest:** The defining relationship. Lacire exists at the Grayls' sufferance, maintained by the Compact. The relationship is respectful, careful, and not entirely understood by either side.

**Jüt:** Primary trading partner. Lacirean caravans make the long journey to the coast regularly, carrying spring water and amber. The route through Tenekee Woods is arduous but well-established.

**Outsiders:** Lacireans are hospitable but alien to most visitors. The silence is oppressive at first; the sign language takes years to learn properly; the patience can feel like obstruction.

### The Compact

The ancient bargain with the Grayls, known only in fragments:

- No fire larger than a candle within Ierya (cooking uses geothermal vents)
- No cutting of living wood (construction uses only deadfall and stone)
- The springs must remain open to all who come in peace
- Once per generation, a pilgrimage reaffirms the agreement

In exchange, Ierya doesn't shift around Lacire. The city exists in a pocket of stability within the ever-moving forest.

### Notable Locations

**The Springs of Vyowehr:** Sacred pools at the city's heart, their waters cold and clear with subtle magical properties.

**The Grayl Market:** Outside the walls, where Grayls occasionally come to trade. Transactions take days; the results are worth fortunes.

**The Signing Hall:** Where the Council of Hands meets, built in a natural amphitheater where hundreds can watch debates conducted entirely in gesture.
