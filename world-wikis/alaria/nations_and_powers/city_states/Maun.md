## Maun

Tags: citystate

A dwarven city-state on the southern coast of SW Urok, where the Maun River empties into Beauty Bay. Maun is home to the most famous school of music and theater in Alaria—an institution that has trained generations of bards, performers, and composers. But unlike most conservatories, Maun demands more than artistic talent from its students. Everyone who enters the School must spend a year fighting in the tunnels below.

### Overview

Maun is a city of sound. Music drifts from every quarter at every hour—students practicing scales, masters demonstrating techniques, street performers competing for coins, orchestras rehearsing for evening concerts. The buildings themselves seem designed to carry and enhance music; acoustic engineering is as important as structural engineering here, and the finest concert halls are considered architectural masterpieces.

The city sprawls along both banks of the Maun River, connected by bridges of increasing architectural ambition. The oldest bridges are functional stone; the newest are elaborate constructions that incorporate wind chimes, resonating chambers, and materials chosen specifically for how they ring when struck. Walking across a Maun bridge is meant to be a musical experience.

The School of Music dominates the city's eastern bank—a complex of practice halls, performance spaces, instrument workshops, and dormitories that houses thousands of students at any given time. Admission is competitive but not expensive; Maun wants talent, not wealth, and scholarships are common for promising applicants. The real cost comes later.

### The Requirement

Every student who enters the School of Music must serve one year in the military.

This is non-negotiable. No exceptions for nobles, no exemptions for prodigies, no alternatives for pacifists. You can serve before your studies, during them, or after graduation—but you will serve, or you will not study at Maun.

The service isn't ceremonial. Students spend their year in the tunnels beneath the Pearly Mountains, fighting the things that rise from the depths. The Shattered Court—ancient dwarven nobles transformed into hungry revenants—is drawn toward beauty, and Maun's music summons them more powerfully than anything except Wisgarrd's finest gems. Someone has to fight them back.

The military year is brutal. Students train for three months above ground, learning to fight in close quarters with weapons that don't require much space to wield—short swords, hammers, crossbows. Then they descend. For nine months, they patrol the tunnels, man the defensive positions, and respond when something breaks through. Casualties vary year to year; bad years see one in five students die or suffer permanent injury. Good years, only one in twenty.

Survivors emerge changed. They've seen things no musician should have to see, done things no performer should have to do. Many find that their art deepens—pain and survival giving their music an emotional weight it previously lacked. Others break, unable to reconcile their experiences with their aspirations. The School offers no counseling; Maun's philosophy holds that true art requires suffering, and the tunnels provide.

### The School of Music

Despite its military requirement—or perhaps because of it—the School of Music produces the finest performers in Alaria. Its graduates are sought by royal courts, theatrical troupes, and wealthy patrons across the continent. A Maun-trained bard commands respect wherever they go.

The curriculum is comprehensive. Students study theory and composition, master at least one instrument, train in vocal performance, learn theatrical technique, and develop their own artistic voice. The faculty includes legendary performers who could have their pick of positions anywhere in the world but choose to teach at Maun because they believe in its mission.

Instruction is divided into three tracks:

**Performance** focuses on technical mastery and stage presence. Students learn to captivate audiences, to project emotion through music, to make a thousand-seat hall feel intimate. Performance graduates become soloists, orchestra leads, and celebrity entertainers.

**Composition** emphasizes creation over execution. Students learn to write music in every style, to orchestrate for any combination of instruments, to craft songs that will outlive their creators. Composition graduates become court composers, theatrical songwriters, and preservers of musical tradition.

**Craft** teaches instrument-making. Students learn to build everything from simple drums to complex pipe organs, using materials both mundane and magical. The finest instruments in Alaria come from Maun's workshops, and Craft graduates can name their price for commissions.

### The Yearly Competition

Each year, the School holds a competition open to all students. The details vary—some years emphasize composition, others performance, others innovation—but the prize is always the same: a magical instrument of extraordinary power.

These instruments are created by the School's master craftsmen, incorporating techniques passed down through generations and materials gathered from across Alaria. Past prizes have included a flute that charms any creature that hears it, a drum that can shatter stone, and a harp whose music heals wounds. Winning the competition is the fastest path to fame and fortune for any Maun student.

The competition is fierce and occasionally deadly. Sabotage happens; students have been known to poison rivals, destroy instruments, or arrange "accidents" in the tunnels. The School officially discourages such behavior but does little to prevent it. Competition, they argue, produces excellence.

### The Ghost

Something haunts the School's halls.

Students report encountering a figure in old-fashioned clothing who offers advice, encouragement, and occasionally harsh criticism of their work. The Ghost—as students call it—appears most often to those struggling with their art or their military service. Its advice is invariably useful; those who follow it tend to improve dramatically.

No one knows who the Ghost was in life. The most popular theory holds it was one of the School's founders, unable to leave the institution even in death. Others suggest it's a former student who died in the tunnels and returned to guide future generations. A minority view claims the Ghost isn't a ghost at all but a living person who's found a way to move unseen through the School's corridors.

The faculty refuses to discuss the Ghost officially. Unofficially, most have encountered it at least once. Several credit it with saving their lives during their own military service.

### The Martial Tradition

Maun's military isn't just a requirement—it's a culture. The School celebrates its warrior-musicians, maintains memorials to students who died in the tunnels, and incorporates martial themes into its curriculum. Battle songs are as respected as love ballads; percussion students learn to play drums that can coordinate troop movements; graduates often serve as military musicians in armies across Alaria.

This tradition connects to something older. Some scholars believe Maun was founded by students of the Order of the Falling Leaf—the warrior-monks whose spirits now guard Shenchen Forest. The Order's philosophy held that martial discipline and artistic excellence were two expressions of the same underlying principle. Maun seems to agree.

The connection is speculative but suggestive. Maun's fighting techniques share elements with what's known of Falling Leaf styles. The School's emphasis on precision, on finding beauty in violence, on transcending the self through performance—all echo the Order's teachings. Whether the connection is historical or coincidental remains debated.

### Beauty Bay

The bay where Maun meets the sea has earned its name. The mineral-rich waters—runoff from Tyberoskos's limestone sinkholes—create sunsets of impossible color, oranges and purples that painters struggle to reproduce. Maun has embraced this gift; the School holds outdoor performances in a natural amphitheater on the eastern shore, timing finales to coincide with the sunset's peak.

The bay also provides Maun's connection to the wider world. Ships arrive carrying would-be students from across Alaria and depart bearing graduates, instruments, and the city's famous theatrical costumes. The harbor district is the one part of Maun where music competes with commerce—the bustle of trade drowning out even the most determined street performer.

The same minerals that color the sunset make the bay's water unsuitable for drinking but perfect for certain dye-making processes. Maun's costumes are famous partly for colors that can't be reproduced elsewhere. Theatrical troupes pay premium prices for authentic Maun dyes, and the secret recipes are guarded as jealously as any musical technique.

### Relations with Wisgarrd

Maun and Wisgarrd need each other and hate that they do.

The relationship is simple: Wisgarrd pays, Maun fights. The jewelry school's extraordinary tuition provides the gold that funds Maun's military—weapons, armor, supplies, veteran salaries, compensation for families of the fallen. Without that money, Maun couldn't maintain the force necessary to hold the tunnels. Without Maun's force, Wisgarrd would be overrun within months.

The cultural tension is less simple. Wisgarrd's jewelers consider themselves the true artists—patient craftsmen who create works of lasting beauty, not performers chasing applause. Maun's musicians consider themselves the true artists—people who bare their souls before audiences, not technicians polishing rocks. Each city mocks the other's pretensions; each city secretly envies what the other does well.

Officially, relations are cordial. A standing committee coordinates military operations, negotiates funding levels, and resolves disputes. Unofficially, students from both schools have been known to brawl when they encounter each other, and romances between Maun and Wisgarrd citizens carry the same frisson as forbidden love affairs.

The greatest art, everyone admits, comes from collaboration between the two cities. A Wisgarrd gem set in a Maun instrument creates something neither could produce alone. Such collaborations are regulated carefully—they attract the Shattered Court more powerfully than anything—but when they work, the results are legendary.

### Government

Maun is governed by the **Chorus**—a council of twelve masters representing different aspects of the School. Four represent the three academic tracks plus the instrument workshops; four represent the military; four are elected by alumni to represent the broader community's interests.

The Chorus makes decisions by consensus when possible, by majority vote when necessary. The system is slow but ensures all perspectives are heard. Critics argue Maun is too conservative, too resistant to change; defenders argue that tradition is precisely what makes the School excellent.

Below the Chorus, the city operates through a web of guilds, associations, and committees that would confuse any outsider. The important thing to understand is that everyone answers to the School. There is no separate civic government; Maun is the School, and the School is Maun.

### Player Hooks

- **The Silent Song**: A student has discovered a technique for making music that doesn't resonate into the tunnels—sound that the Shattered Court can't hear. If perfected, it could revolutionize Maun's relationship with the deep. But the student has disappeared, and her notes are missing.

- **Tunnel Collapse**: Something has blocked the main defensive tunnel, trapping a patrol on the wrong side. Rescue is possible but dangerous—the route requires passing through territory held by the Court, and time is running out.

- **The Competition**: A student needs protection during the yearly competition. Someone is eliminating rivals, and they're next on the list. The saboteur's identity is unknown, but they're skilled, ruthless, and connected enough to operate freely within the School.

- **Ghost Hunt**: A scholar from Xi Chin wants to study the Ghost—to determine what it is, who it was, and whether it poses any danger to the School. The Chorus has reluctantly agreed to allow the investigation. The Ghost, however, seems to have opinions about being studied.

- **The Falling Leaf Connection**: Evidence has surfaced suggesting that Maun's founders came from the Order of the Falling Leaf—and that they brought something with them from Shenchen Forest. Something the Order was supposed to destroy. Whatever it is, it's been hidden in the School for centuries, and someone is looking for it.
