## Sweivyon

Tags: city-state, dragons-spine-coast, silver-slopes, mining

A city-state of approximately twelve thousand souls perched in the Silver Slopes, controlling the richest silver deposits in the southern Dragon's Spine. Sweivyon is younger than most city-states—founded only four centuries ago by prospectors who struck a vein so pure it changed the region's economics—but it has accumulated wealth faster than many older polities accumulate history.

The city occupies a naturally defensible position: a broad shelf of relatively flat terrain between two peaks, accessible only by a handful of passes that ice over in winter. The founders chose the location for the silver underneath it; the defensive advantages were a fortunate bonus they've since learned to exploit.

Sweivyon smells like money. The refineries run constantly, producing the characteristic sulfurous tang of silver processing. The markets display wealth openly—jewelry, fine metalwork, imported luxuries. The architecture trends toward ostentation, with even modest houses sporting silver-inlaid doors and windows. Visitors either find it impressive or vulgar, depending on their background.

### Government

**The Silver Council** governs Sweivyon—eleven seats divided among the founding families, the major guild representatives, and two rotating positions elected by property owners. The council elects a Warden from among its members to handle executive functions, but real power lies with the controlling families who vote as blocs.

The current Warden is **Helkos Varn**, a third-generation mining magnate who built his family's position by consolidating smaller claims during a price collapse forty years ago. He's competent, ruthless about competitors, and generous with civic improvements that happen to benefit his properties. Most citizens consider him acceptable. His enemies consider him inevitable.

Below the council, governance is largely guild-based. The Miners' Compact regulates extraction rights and safety standards. The Refiners' Guild controls processing and quality certification. The Merchants' Assembly manages trade and external relations. These organizations handle daily administration while the council focuses on policy and patronage.

### Economy

Silver dominates everything. The city extracts, processes, certifies, and exports silver in quantities that influence markets across southern Alaria. The famous "slope silver" commands premium prices for its purity, and the Sweivyon stamp has become a guarantee of quality that competitors can't easily replicate.

The **Sunbeam Catchment**—a system of sluices and settling pools along the upper river—captures mineral runoff that would otherwise wash down to the strait. This operation employs hundreds and produces a significant fraction of city income, while also limiting opportunities for independent prospectors downstream.

Secondary industries have grown around the silver trade: jewelry-making, assaying, banking, security services. Sweivyon hosts the only reliable banking house in the southern Dragon's Spine, and its letters of credit are accepted throughout the region.

Trade flows primarily through **Glintwater**, a settlement at the mouth of the Sunbeam River that serves as Sweivyon's de facto port. A portage road connects the navigable lower river to the city proper. Overland trade reaches Gondurak through mountain passes and the Dalizi lowlands through longer routes that skirt the Miramar region.

### Culture

Sweivyon's culture is transactional. Wealth is respected, poverty is pitied, and everyone is always calculating. Social status correlates directly with property holdings, and the founding families maintain elaborate records of who owns what. A prospector who strikes rich can rise to council-adjacent status within a generation; a family that loses its claims can fall just as fast.

The **Assay Festival** occurs twice yearly, when the refineries announce their production totals and the council sets tax rates. It's part civic celebration, part anxious speculation, and part excuse for the wealthy to display new acquisitions. The streets fill with silver-themed decorations, and even the poorest residents wear something shiny.

Religion is practical—shrines to various daemons of commerce and craft dot the city, and citizens make offerings based on what they need rather than theological conviction. The most popular shrine honors **Rodton**, daemon of deals and bargains, whose priests serve as informal arbitrators for disputes the guilds can't resolve.

### Defenses

Sweivyon's military capacity is modest. The city maintains a professional guard of roughly four hundred, adequate for keeping order and patrolling the passes but not for fighting a war. The mountain geography provides natural protection—the passes can be held by small forces, and the winter closures give the city months of effective isolation.

The real defense is economic. Sweivyon trades with everyone and threatens no one. Gondurak values the silver supply. The Dalizi value the trade route. Even Kanzekill, far to the west, has no interest in a city that doesn't interfere with her hunt. Sweivyon survives by being useful to everyone and dangerous to no one.

This strategy has limits. If a power decided Sweivyon's wealth was worth taking, the city couldn't resist alone. The council quietly maintains contingency agreements with Gondurak for military support, though the terms have never been tested.

### Relations

**Gondurak** is Sweivyon's most important trading partner. Fengruk metalworkers turn slope silver into finished goods of exceptional quality, and the trade benefits both parties. Relations are cordial but not warm—the Fengruk consider Sweivyon nouveau riche, and Sweivyon considers the Fengruk insufferably traditional.

**The Splinter Villages** of the Shrapnel Strait theoretically acknowledge Sweivyon's authority, though enforcement is minimal. The city claims tariff rights on strait trade and occasionally sends inspectors, but the villagers largely govern themselves. The relationship works because neither side pushes too hard.

**Glintwater** and the glitter-panners present ongoing friction. The river-mouth prospectors resent the catchment system that limits their take, and conflicts over water rights occasionally turn violent. Sweivyon's position is that the upstream owners control what reaches downstream; the panners' position is less legal and more visceral.

**The Miramar region** and its dragon problems are kept at careful distance. Sweivyon doesn't trade with Kanzekill's territory, doesn't discuss Mountainveil, and doesn't ask questions about refugees who arrive from the west. The city has no interest in drawing dragon attention.

### Notable Features

**The Stamp House** certifies all silver exports, applying the famous Sweivyon brand that guarantees purity. The building is heavily fortified and rumored to contain the largest silver reserve in the region—a claim the council neither confirms nor denies.

**The Varn Spire** rises from the city's highest point, a tower of silver-inlaid stone that the current Warden's family built as a monument to their success. It serves no practical purpose beyond demonstrating that the Varns can afford a monument that serves no practical purpose.

**The Lower Slopes** house the working population—miners, refiners, laborers—in densely-packed neighborhoods that contrast sharply with the upper city's ostentation. Conditions are adequate but not generous, and labor organizers occasionally attempt to improve terms. These efforts rarely succeed; the council has experience containing unrest.

**The Prospectors' Quarter** accommodates the constant stream of fortune-seekers who arrive hoping to stake claims in the Silver Slopes. It's rough, transient, and dangerous after dark, but it's also where new wealth enters the city before climbing to respectability.

### Hooks

**The Claim War**: Two founding families dispute a boundary in the deep mines, where a newly-discovered vein runs exactly along the legal division. Both sides are hiring—surveyors, lawyers, thugs, and anyone who might tip the balance.

**The Catchment Sabotage**: Someone is damaging the Sunbeam Catchment system, allowing silver-rich runoff to reach the glitter-panners below. The council wants the saboteur found quietly; the panners want them protected; someone is getting very rich.

**The Gondurak Offer**: A Fengruk delegation has arrived with an unusual proposal: joint operations in mines that cross into both territories. The deal would be lucrative but would tie Sweivyon's economy even more closely to its larger neighbor. Not everyone considers this wise.

**The Dragon Question**: A scholar claims to have evidence that Kanzekill's true name once passed through Sweivyon—that the refugees who built Mountainveil sold something in the city before vanishing into the mountains. The council wants this rumor suppressed before it reaches the wrong ears.
