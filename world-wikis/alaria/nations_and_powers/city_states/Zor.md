## Zor

Tags: city-state, wycendeula, eyendra, dragon-pact

A city-state of roughly 15,000 souls on the western shore of Moornik Bay, Zor is the only permanent settlement in the vast Eyendra forest. It exists because a dragon permits it, and eight centuries of survival have taught its people that some bargains are worth keeping.

Zor turns its back on the forest. The city faces the sea—economically, culturally, psychologically. The forest behind them is not wilderness to be tamed but a presence to be acknowledged and carefully avoided. Every citizen grows up knowing the rules: extract only from the permitted zones, disturb no ruins, never enter the interior without cause. The penalty for breaking these rules is not execution by the council. It's simply vanishing, and no one asks too many questions about those who do.

### The Dragon Pact

Zor's existence is predicated on an agreement with Ezra Olkanis, an ancient dragon who dwells in the Eyendra interior. The pact was made eight centuries ago with a fishing village that eventually grew into the current city. Every generation, the ruling council formally reaffirms the terms:

**Zor must not disturb the interior.** Certain ruins are forbidden. Certain lakes—particularly in the Wer Azenzi region—must never be approached. The boundaries shift over decades as the dragon sends word through channels the council doesn't discuss publicly.

**Zor must report what it observes.** Changes in the forest, unusual activity, strangers asking questions. The dragon wants eyes on her borders.

**The dragon may demand service.** Guides, supplies, artifacts, occasionally people with particular skills. Those summoned to the interior usually return.

**Zor may take from the forest's edge.** A strip roughly twenty miles deep along the coast is open for extraction—timber, herbs, game. Beyond that boundary, permission ends.

In exchange, Zor survives. Whether the dragon actively protects the city or merely refrains from destroying it is a theological debate. Pragmatists note the distinction is academic.

### Government

Five hereditary families rule Zor—descendants of those who negotiated the original pact. Power rotates on a complex schedule, with one family holding the Speakership (executive authority) for fifteen years. The system is stable but rigid. Reform movements exist but rarely gain traction; most citizens prefer a functioning arrangement to an exciting collapse.

The current Speaker is **Maera Theln**, a practical woman in her sixties known for cautious competence rather than vision.

Below the council, guilds manage daily governance: the Foresters' Guild (extraction rights), the Fishers' Guild (harbor control), the Archive scholars, and various lesser organizations. The guilds defer to the council on anything touching the pact.

### Economy

Maritime and extractive. Zor exports Eyendra timber (prized for shipbuilding), forest herbs (some enhanced by proximity to whatever the forest has become), and preserved fish. It imports grain, metal goods, and lumber from outside the forest for buildings where Eyendra wood might be unreliable.

Trade happens by sea. Overland routes exist but are rarely used—the journey through the coastal fringe is uncomfortable, and the risk of accidentally crossing boundaries deters most merchants.

### Culture

Zor's people are practical, superstitious, and acutely aware of their precarious position. The first thing visitors notice is the quiet—conversations tend toward the hushed, as if everyone is instinctively avoiding the forest's attention.

The Telling shapes civic life—a ritual Zor developed (not demanded by the dragon) to ensure everyone understands the dangers that surround them. Children learn what happens to those who cross boundaries before they learn to fish. The midsummer Telling lasts three days. It's survival education disguised as civic ceremony.

The dragon is acknowledged in ways that blur the line between respect and worship. Oaths are sworn on her name. When something goes well, people say she permitted it. When something goes wrong, people check whether anyone broke the pact.

### Relations

Zor trades with other Wycendeula coastal settlements but maintains no close alliances. The city is too isolated, too specialized, too strange. Merchants welcome Zor's timber and herbs; they're less comfortable with Zor's culture.

The dragon is not technically a diplomatic entity, but she might as well be. Anything that threatens Zor risks drawing her attention, which means Zor has enjoyed remarkable security for a city its size. No one has seriously attempted to conquer it since the pact was established.

### Threats

**The Rationalists**: A merchant faction arguing the dragon is dead, gone, or exaggerated. They want to explore the interior and exploit resources beyond the current boundaries. Their numbers grow when trade is poor.

**Resource Pressure**: Zor's population has grown but the extraction zones haven't. Demand is outpacing sustainable supply. Eventually someone will cross a boundary.

**The Interior Dreams**: People in Zor sometimes dream of the forest—walking paths they've never seen, seeing faces that feel familiar. The frequency seems to be increasing.
