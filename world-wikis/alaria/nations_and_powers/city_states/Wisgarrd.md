## Wisgarrd

Tags: citystate

A dwarven city-state built into the foothills where the Pearly Mountains descend toward the southern coast of SW Urok. Wisgarrd is home to the most prestigious school of jewelry-making in Alaria—an institution that has produced master craftsmen for over a thousand years and guards secrets of magical enchantment that nobles would kill to possess.

But Wisgarrd exists for a darker reason than artistry. The city was built to fund a war that never ends—a war against something that lives beneath the mountains and hungers for beauty.

### Overview

From the outside, Wisgarrd appears prosperous and serene. The city cascades down the hillside in terraces of pale stone, workshops and residences nestled among gardens where the famous peonies bloom. The School of Jewelry dominates the upper terraces—a complex of workshops, libraries, and demonstration halls where students spend years learning to cut gems with supernatural precision.

The tuition is extraordinary. A single year costs what a skilled craftsman earns in a decade. Nobles across Alaria pay it gladly, sending their personal jewelers to learn techniques that can't be found anywhere else. The wealthiest students gain access to the Inner School, where masters teach the secrets of binding magic into metal and stone—creating jewelry that doesn't just display wealth but confers power.

What the students don't know—what visitors never learn—is where the money goes.

### The Shattered Court

Beneath the Pearly Mountains lies a vast cavern system carved over millennia by underground rivers. The caverns are not empty. Something lives there—many somethings—that were once the ruling class of an Uline Dwarven kingdom that predated Wisgarrd, Maun, and perhaps Xi Chin itself.

When that kingdom fell—to invasion, to civil war, to causes now forgotten—the nobles refused to accept death. Through rituals that modern scholars can barely comprehend, they bound themselves to the stone itself, becoming something between ghost and golem. Their bodies crumbled. Their minds fragmented. But their hunger remained.

The Shattered Court, as they're called, still holds session in the deepest chambers. Noble houses that haven't existed for two thousand years still compete for status among the ruins of their underground palaces. They remember being patrons of the arts—remember loving beautiful music, collecting exquisite gems, hosting celebrations where the finest craftsmen displayed their work.

They still want those things. The wanting has become all they are.

### The Resonance

The caverns beneath Wisgarrd and Maun *resonate*. Sound carries strangely through the tunnels, amplified and transformed. A song performed in Maun might echo through miles of stone, reaching chambers where the Shattered Court waits. A gem cut in Wisgarrd, when light strikes it, sends reflections rippling through crystal formations that connect to the deep places.

The Court responds. When something beautiful enough reaches them—a masterwork composition, a perfectly cut diamond, a performance of transcendent skill—they rise. They climb through tunnels toward the surface, drawn by the beauty they crave. They want to witness it. They want to possess it. They want to consume the artists who created it.

This is the curse that Maun and Wisgarrd live with: the better they become at their arts, the more monsters they attract.

A mediocre jewelry student poses no danger. A master whose work achieves perfection might trigger an incursion that costs dozens of lives. The greatest artists of both cities have learned to work in cycles—producing their finest pieces only when the defenses are ready, then retreating to lesser work while the Court subsides.

### The Arrangement

Wisgarrd and Maun hate each other. The jewelry-makers consider the musicians pretentious dreamers; the musicians consider the jewelers mercenary snobs. They've feuded for centuries over prestige, students, and which art is more essential to civilization.

But they need each other to survive.

Wisgarrd has wealth. The tuition from noble patrons fills its coffers year after year. What it lacks is warriors—gem-cutters don't make effective soldiers, and the city's guards are barely adequate for peacetime duties.

Maun has warriors. The School of Music requires every student to serve a year in the military, fighting in the tunnels beneath the mountains. Generations of martial tradition have produced soldiers who know the underground terrain, who've faced the Shattered Court, who understand how to fight things that are already dead.

The arrangement is simple: Wisgarrd's gold pays for Maun's army. Maun's army protects both cities from what rises below. Neither city could survive without the other, which only makes them resent the dependency more.

### The School of Jewelry

The School occupies Wisgarrd's highest terrace, its workshops oriented to catch the best natural light. Students begin with fundamentals—metallurgy, gem identification, basic cutting techniques—and progress over years to increasingly sophisticated work. Competition is fierce; only the top students advance to each subsequent level.

The curriculum is divided into the Outer School and the Inner School.

**The Outer School** teaches technical mastery. A graduate can cut gems with supernatural precision, design settings that enhance a stone's natural beauty, and create jewelry that wealthy patrons will treasure for generations. This is what most students come for, and it's enough to justify the extraordinary tuition.

**The Inner School** teaches magic. Only students personally selected by the faculty—those who demonstrate not just technical skill but what the masters call "resonance"—are invited to continue. Here, they learn to bind enchantments into their creations: rings that protect their wearers, amulets that enhance specific abilities, gems that store magical energy for later release.

The Inner School's deepest secrets are recorded in the **Book of Gems**, an ancient text kept in the library's most secure vault. The book supposedly contains techniques for creating artifacts of genuine power—items that rival the work of legendary artificers. Access is granted only to the most trusted masters, and even they are forbidden from copying its contents.

### The Peonie River

The Peonie flows past Wisgarrd's walls, its banks carpeted with the flowering plants that give the river its name. The blooms—pink, white, and occasionally a deep crimson—have inspired Wisgarrd's jewelers for centuries. Peonie motifs appear in the oldest and most traditional designs, and graduating students traditionally receive a brooch in the peonie pattern.

But the flowers serve another purpose. Something in their scent—or perhaps in the mineral content of the water that feeds them—seems to dampen the resonance effect. During the blooming season, incursions from below decrease noticeably. Some scholars theorize the original founders planted the peonies deliberately, knowing their properties; others think it's coincidence. Either way, Wisgarrd guards its riverbanks carefully, and damaging the peonie fields is a capital offense.

### Culture

Wisgarrd values precision, patience, and discretion. Loud displays of emotion are considered vulgar; residents communicate through subtle gestures and carefully chosen words. The city's architecture reflects this restraint—beautiful but understated, designed to showcase the jewelry its citizens create rather than compete with it.

The contrast with Maun couldn't be sharper. Where Maun fills its streets with music at all hours, Wisgarrd maintains a studied quiet. Where Maun celebrates performers as heroes, Wisgarrd's master jewelers work in anonymity—their pieces speak for themselves. The rivalry between cities often manifests as cultural snobbery: Wisgarrd dismisses Maun as attention-seeking noise, while Maun mocks Wisgarrd as cold and emotionally stunted.

Despite the animosity, students from both schools sometimes collaborate. A Wisgarrd gem set in a Maun instrument creates something neither city could produce alone—and attracts the Shattered Court more powerfully than anything else. Such collaborations are regulated carefully, permitted only when the military is prepared for what they might summon.

### Government

Wisgarrd is governed by the **Gemcutters' Council**, composed of the school's senior masters. The Council controls both the city and the school, making no distinction between civic and academic authority. All citizens are either students, faculty, or support staff; there is no separate merchant class or nobility.

The Council's primary concerns are maintaining the school's reputation, managing the flow of tuition money, and—above all—coordinating with Maun's military for defense. A standing committee meets weekly with Maun's commanders to plan patrol schedules, discuss threat assessments, and argue about whose fault the latest incursion was.

### Player Hooks

- **The Perfect Piece**: A master jeweler believes she can create something that will satisfy the Shattered Court permanently—a gem so beautiful that they'll retreat to their depths and stay there. She needs rare materials from dangerous places, and she needs someone to protect her while she works. If she's wrong, her masterpiece might trigger the worst incursion in centuries.

- **The Book of Gems**: Someone has stolen pages from the Book of Gems. The Council wants them recovered before the thief can use the knowledge—or sell it to competitors. The trail leads through both Wisgarrd and Maun, suggesting the thief knows both cities well.

- **Resonance Sickness**: Some students develop "resonance sickness"—an attunement to the caverns below that lets them sense when the Court is stirring. The condition is useful for early warning but devastating to the afflicted; most go mad within years. A student with the sickness wants to find a cure before it's too late.

- **The Old Alliance**: Before Wisgarrd and Maun, before the Shattered Court, another kingdom ruled these mountains. Records suggest they had a way to control or pacify the Court—a technique lost when the kingdom fell. Someone needs to explore the deep tunnels, find the old archives, and learn what the ancients knew.
