## Rilyn

Tags: state, splinkreen

A city-state of the Splinkreen — the tree-souled people who dwell in Puma Wood on Petrona Septia Island. Rilyn is less a political entity than a community that happens to occupy the same forest, its "governance" emerging from consensus among beings who've had centuries to learn patience.

The Splinkreen are the legacy of an ancient wizard's experiment, their souls transplanted from mighty trees into humanoid forms. They move through their forest home with eerie calm, speaking in slow deliberate tones, showing little concern for their own mortality. Death, they believe, is simply returning to the earth that birthed them.

### Government

Rilyn has no formal government — no council, no leader, no laws in the conventional sense. Decisions emerge through discussion that can take weeks or months, as the Splinkreen consider all perspectives and gradually reach consensus. Urgent matters are handled by whoever happens to be present and willing; long-term matters are handled by everyone, eventually.

This works because the Splinkreen share fundamental values and have centuries to resolve disagreements. It fails when dealing with outsiders who expect decisions in hours rather than seasons. Visitors to Rilyn learn quickly that "we will consider your proposal" means something very different from Splinkreen than from humans.

The closest thing to authorities are the eldest Splinkreen — those who've lived longest and accumulated the most wisdom. Their opinions carry weight not through any formal position but through respect earned over centuries. When an elder speaks, others listen. They still take their time about acting.

### The Splinkreen

The inhabitants of Rilyn share certain characteristics: bark-like skin ranging from smooth birch white to rough oak brown, a tendency to sprout small leaves or moss in places of rest, and a perspective shaped by their origin as trees.

They're not emotionless — they feel joy, sorrow, affection, anger — but they feel these things slowly, deliberately, without the urgency that characterizes shorter-lived peoples. A Splinkreen grieving a death might mourn for a decade, but the grief is genuine. A Splinkreen celebrating a birth might celebrate for years. Time moves differently when you expect to live three centuries.

Their relationship with death is particularly unusual. The Splinkreen view dying as transformation rather than ending — a return to the earth from which they emerged. They don't seek death, but they don't fear it either. This makes them disconcertingly willing to sacrifice themselves for causes they deem worthy, and equally willing to accept losses that would devastate other communities.

### Economy

Rilyn's economy is minimal by outsider standards. The Splinkreen need little — they don't eat much (some claim they photosynthesize, though this may be exaggeration), don't require elaborate shelter, don't accumulate possessions. What trade exists involves forest products, craftwork, and the occasional service as guides through Puma Wood or the Screech Peaks.

The Splinkreen produce nothing in quantity and see no reason to start. They have what they need; more would require effort that could be spent on contemplation. Merchants who visit Rilyn hoping to establish trade relationships usually leave disappointed. The Splinkreen are happy to trade; they're just not interested in trading much.

### Culture

Life in Rilyn centers on the forest and the community. The Splinkreen spend their long lives in contemplation, conversation, and the slow cultivation of wisdom. They create art — intricate woodwork, woven tapestries, songs that take hours to perform — but creation is a process to be savored rather than a goal to be achieved.

They remember being trees. Not clearly, not in detail, but as a deep awareness of what it meant to stand in one place for centuries, growing slowly, feeling the seasons pass. This memory shapes everything about them — their patience, their rootedness, their acceptance of time's passage.

Outsiders often find Rilyn peaceful but unsettling. The Splinkreen's calm acceptance of mortality, their indifference to urgency, their willingness to let matters resolve themselves over decades — these qualities feel alien to those accustomed to human timeframes. Some visitors find enlightenment in Rilyn's pace. Others find it maddening.

### Relations

**With Ios**: The Splinkreen observe Ios's decline with philosophical interest. A civilization built on artificial servants, now forced to rediscover labor — it's the sort of irony the Splinkreen appreciate. Some have traveled to Todakres to study the stone dolls, curious about the animation techniques and what they might reveal about the nature of transferred souls.

**With Moigos**: The Kappa and the Splinkreen have nothing to offer each other. The toad-folk deal in debts, urgency, and leverage; the Splinkreen have no debts, feel no urgency, and cannot be leveraged. The two peoples exist in parallel without interaction.

**With the wider world**: Rilyn receives occasional visitors and maintains correct relations with distant powers. The Splinkreen don't seek isolation, but they don't seek connection either. They're content in their forest, engaged with the world when the world comes to them, otherwise focused on their own long contemplations.

### Notable Locations

- **Rilyn (city)**: The arboreal city built among the trees of Puma Wood
- **Puma Wood**: The old-growth forest that contains and defines the city-state
- **The Eastern Traverse**: Mountain pass through the Screech Peaks, maintained by Splinkreen guides

### Player Hooks

- **The Patient Teacher**: A Splinkreen elder offers to teach something valuable — a skill, a secret, a piece of wisdom. The catch: the teaching will take months, conducted at Splinkreen pace. Is the knowledge worth the time?

- **Ancient Memory**: A Splinkreen claims to remember something from their time as a tree — something they witnessed centuries ago, something relevant to current events. But tree-memories are fragmentary and strange. Interpreting what they saw requires patience and lateral thinking.

- **The Willing Sacrifice**: The Splinkreen have decided that a particular cause is worth dying for, and they're prepared to do exactly that. Their allies must decide whether to accept this aid or try to find another way.
