## Blvnird

Tags: citystate, dwarves, first-brotherhood, westrim

One of the three leadership city-states of the First Brotherhood—the ancient dwarven coalition formed when the world was far more dangerous. Along with Üod and Melaia, Blvnird's citizens hold the exclusive right to lead the Brotherhood.

### Overview

Blvnird is a dwarven city-state in Westrim, likely in the Eronia Range that separates the region from the Tarkhon Empire. The city serves as a trading partner for Kura's northern city of Labakh, connecting the desert kingdom to the First Brotherhood's economic networks.

### Government

The city is governed according to First Brotherhood traditions. Only citizens of Üod, Blvnird, or Melaia may hold leadership positions in the Brotherhood's councils. This exclusivity has been a source of tension with dwarven settlements elsewhere, who pay membership fees to a union they can never truly lead.

### Relations

**Tarkhon Empire**: Tributary but influential. The First Brotherhood's relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they accept imperial authority nominally while maintaining independent diplomatic relationships with dwarven communities worldwide.

**Üod and Melaia**: Sister cities. The three leadership city-states coordinate on Brotherhood policy and present a united front to outside powers.

**Kura**: The desert kingdom of Kura trades with Blvnird through the city of Labakh, exchanging desert goods for dwarven metalwork and mountain resources.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: The Brotherhood claims to represent all dwarves, but not all dwarves agree. Some view the First Brotherhood as a relic institution more interested in collecting fees than serving dwarven interests.

### Economy

Blvnird's economy centers on metalwork, mining, and trade with the desert kingdoms to the south. The city's position in the Eronia Range makes it a natural gateway between the mountain-dwelling dwarves and the peoples of Westrim.
