# City-States Writing Guide

This directory contains entries for independent city-states—urban polities whose political authority is essentially limited to the city itself and its immediate surroundings.

## What Belongs Here

City-states are defined by urban concentration of power. They may control surrounding farmland or a small hinterland, but they don't govern large territories or multiple major settlements. Examples:

- **Tollgate** - Controls a strait but only the city itself
- **Maun** - Dwarven city famous for its music school
- **Lacire** - The silent city in the Walking Forest
- **Rilyn** - Splinkreen community in Puma Wood

If a polity controls significant territory with multiple cities, it belongs in `states/` instead.

## Lunar Calendar Context

All city-states share Alaria's dual-moon calendar. **Auris** (the Bright Moon, 11-day cycle) marks the week. **Nyxara** (the Dark Moon, 23-day cycle) creates the monthly rhythm. **Brightnight** (double full) and **Hollownight** (double new) are major holidays.

## Entry Structure

City-state entries should generally cover:

- **Overview**: Location, character, and what makes it distinct
- **Government**: How the city is ruled, major offices
- **Economy**: What the city lives on—trade, craft, unique resource
- **Culture**: Customs, values, local character
- **Defenses**: Walls, militia, magical protections
- **Relations**: Key trading partners, rivals, protectors
- **Notable Features**: Landmarks, institutions, neighborhoods
- **Player Hooks**: Adventure seeds, conflicts, opportunities

Scale sections to the city's importance and development level.

## Tone

Write as an informed traveler would describe the place: specific, opinionated, alive with texture. What do visitors notice first? What offends locals? What's the best tavern?
