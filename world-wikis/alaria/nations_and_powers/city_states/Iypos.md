## Iypos

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant oligarchy (Harbor Council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Mixed humans, Vethrani mountain folk (trading presence)

**Population**: ~15,000 in the city; ~20,000 Vethrani in the mountains (not under city authority)

**Stability**: Stable (aggressive neutrality maintains balance)

**Core Values**: Trade, neutrality, independence, pragmatism

Iypos is a city-state built on geographic necessity. It controls the only significant harbor on Migos—the largest island in the northern Western Isles—and profits from everyone who passes through.

The city maintains careful independence from regional powers. Harbor Master Theodras Vane has spent eighteen years being useful to everyone and committed to no one. Iypos trades with Sheîr, Knova, Tarkhon, and whoever else brings goods. They take no sides in conflicts that might disrupt commerce.

The mountains above the city belong to the Vethrani—fierce highland clans who've never been conquered. Iypos doesn't claim authority over them. They trade with them, defend the coast that protects the whole island, and generally leave each other alone. This arrangement works because both sides benefit.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Standard

**Primary Exports**: Mountain products (herbs, furs, minerals), maritime services, brokered trade goods

**Primary Imports**: Grain, manufactured goods, luxury items, raw materials

Iypos's economy runs on location. Ships traveling between the Iron Sea and the Shattered Sea stop here for supplies, repairs, and rest. The harbor charges fees; merchants sell goods; everyone profits.

The Vethrani contribute unique mountain products that Iypos processes and exports. This creates economic interdependence—the city needs the mountains' goods, and the mountains need the city's market access.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Adequate for local defense

**Enrollment**: Professional militia (~800)

Iypos maintains a city militia focused on harbor defense and keeping order. They couldn't fight a major war and don't intend to.

The real defense is the mountains. Any invader who takes the harbor still has to deal with the Vethrani—and no one has managed that in recorded history.

### Geography

**Location**: Southeastern Migos, on Harbor Bay

**Biomes**: Coastal city at mountain base

**Climate**: Temperate maritime coast, brutal mountains above

**Named Features**: Harbor Bay, Mount Iypos, the Terrace Markets

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Iypos (the only significant settlement on Migos's coast)

### The Harbor Council

Seven merchant families control the Council, which controls the city. Seats are technically purchased, practically inherited, and occasionally contested through violence.

**Current Harbor Master**: **Theodras Vane**, whose family has held the position for three generations. He's kept power by being marginally more competent and marginally less corrupt than alternatives.

The Council manages:
- Harbor access and fees
- Trade agreements
- The city militia
- Relations with the Vethrani (carefully maintained)

### The Vethrani Question

The mountain folk aren't citizens of Iypos. They're neighbors with a mutually beneficial arrangement.

The Vethrani govern themselves through clan structures, maintain their own territory, and could overwhelm the city if they chose. They don't choose because Iypos is useful—a market for their goods, a buffer against outside powers, a source of lowland products they can't make themselves.

When external threats appear, the Vethrani defend the whole island. When external threats disappear, they go back to ignoring the coast. This works. Changing it would be catastrophic for everyone.

### Primary Conflicts

**External Pressure**

Sheîr wants Iypos as a vassal. Knova wants mountain training grounds. Various powers want preferential trade arrangements. Harbor Master Theodras refuses everyone equally, maintaining independence through consistent non-commitment.

**Vethrani Tensions**

The arrangement with the mountain folk holds, but it's not guaranteed. Some Vethrani clans want to expand coastal influence. Some city merchants want to claim mountain territory. The Temple of the Mountain mediates, but peace requires constant maintenance.

**Succession**

Theodras is aging. His likely successors are less skilled at the diplomatic balancing act that keeps Iypos independent. The next Harbor Master might make mistakes that invite exactly the intervention the city has avoided.

### Notable Figures

**Theodras Vane** — Harbor Master for eighteen years. A merchant prince who's kept Iypos independent through pragmatic neutrality. Aging, increasingly worried about what happens after him.

**High Priest Kavan** — Leader of the Temple of the Mountain. The only person with diplomatic immunity in both city and Vethrani territory. Uses this position to mediate disputes.

**Clan-Chief Dhorgal** — Leader of the largest Vethrani clan. Respects the arrangement with Iypos but could change his mind if provoked.

### History

**The Founding**: Iypos was established as a trading post centuries ago, when someone realized Migos's harbor was the only good anchorage for hundreds of miles.

**The Vethrani Wars**: Early attempts to claim the mountains failed catastrophically. The current arrangement emerged from that failure—cooperation rather than conquest.

**The Present**: Iypos at equilibrium. Profitable, independent, carefully balanced between powers who would absorb it if they could.
