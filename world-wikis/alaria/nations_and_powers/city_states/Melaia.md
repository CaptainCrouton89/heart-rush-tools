## Melaia

Tags: citystate, dwarves, first-brotherhood

One of the three leadership city-states of the First Brotherhood—the ancient dwarven coalition formed when the world was far more dangerous. Along with Üod and Blvnird, Melaia's citizens hold the exclusive right to lead the Brotherhood.

### Overview

Melaia is a dwarven city-state, one of the three seats of First Brotherhood power. The city maintains a complex relationship with the Tarkhon Empire—technically tributary, but exercising influence over dwarves across the world through its position in the Brotherhood.

### Government

The city is governed according to First Brotherhood traditions. Only citizens of Üod, Blvnird, or Melaia may hold leadership positions in the Brotherhood's councils. This exclusivity has been a source of tension with dwarven settlements elsewhere, who pay membership fees to a union they can never truly lead.

### Relations

**Tarkhon Empire**: Tributary but influential. The First Brotherhood's relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they accept imperial authority nominally while maintaining independent diplomatic relationships with dwarven communities worldwide.

**Üod and Blvnird**: Sister cities. The three leadership city-states coordinate on Brotherhood policy and present a united front to outside powers.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: The Brotherhood claims to represent all dwarves, but not all dwarves agree. Some view the First Brotherhood as a relic institution more interested in collecting fees than serving dwarven interests.

### Economy

Melaia's economy centers on metalwork, mining, and the administration of First Brotherhood affairs. The city charges membership fees to dwarven communities worldwide, funding Brotherhood operations and maintaining the city's prosperity.
