Before adding content, check for established lore in:
- `cosmology_and_religion/` - Calendar, planes, leylines, religious systems
- `history_and_lore/` - Wars, empires, timelines
- `atlas_of_alaria/` - Geographic context, neighboring regions
- `heart_rush/races/` - Racial populations and their established cultures

## Distinction: States vs City-States

**States** are territorial—they control regions, have borders with neighbors, and govern populations across multiple settlements.

**City-states** are urban—their political authority essentially ends at the city walls (or the immediate hinterland). They may be powerful, wealthy, or influential, but they don't govern large territories.

When creating a new entry, place it in the appropriate directory based on this distinction.
