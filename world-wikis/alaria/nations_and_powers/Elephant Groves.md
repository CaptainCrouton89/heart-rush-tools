## Elephant Groves

Tags: forest

Enormous forest, inhabited by the spirit of an ancient elephant. Guards this grove, as it is the birthplace of the loxodon. Intruders are repelled. Also contains the pool of knowledge—state into the pool and your wisdom becomes 20. If your wisdom is already 20, your wosdom becomes 22. Sacred pool however.
