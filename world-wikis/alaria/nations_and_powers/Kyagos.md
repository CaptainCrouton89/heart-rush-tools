### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederacy of city states

**Primary Inhabitants**: Sylthik, Drasnian slaves

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Somewhat stable

**Core Values**: Discipline, influence, societal rank, power

- Rank in Kyagos is determined by the number of scars on one's cheeks; the king has five scars on each cheek, while lowly residents have none. 
- Non-sylthik races are viewed as sub-sentient, and undeserving of even the slightest decency, concern. 
- Those who enter Kyagos are given handkerchiefs to be wrapped around their knecks to be marked as outsiders. They are under the rank of any resident, and have no rights while within the cities.


### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Gems, jewels, metals

**Primary Imports**: Drasnian dwarves from Tamadrez

- Kyagos' entire economy rests on the shoulders of their massive slave population that works in the mines. Nowhere is this more prevalant than in Syvlius, the largest city, nested on Syvlius mountain.


### Military

**Size**: Very small

**Quality**: Very low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- If you are not talented enough to do anything else, you are enlisted in the military. Few wish to enter, as it pays poorly, and holds very little respect within the population.

### Primary Conflicts

- The lower class do not love their subjugated position within Kyagos society.
- Many dislike the disrespect they receive from their superiors.
- The Drasnians rarely rebel, but they vastly outnumber the Kyagos armies.
- For decades, Kyagos has been at war with the Dead Moon Tribe, which lives in the outer jungle. Very little has happened in this time, as both entities remain failry incapable of or unwilling to inflict serious damage on one another.
