Once controlled by dwarves, these mountains have been taken over by goblins and Cirthikin, large, burrowing, praying mantis-like creatures. The tunnels form an enormous network that travel for hundreds of miles underground. The dwarves, driven deeper into the ground, have become pale monstrosities below, known as Surry dwarves. Mines, hidden lairs, and underground fortresses litter the mountains.
