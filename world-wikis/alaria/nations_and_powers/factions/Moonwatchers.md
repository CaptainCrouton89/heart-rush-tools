## The Moonwatchers

Tags: cult, lunar, killing moon, apocalyptic

The Moonwatchers—sometimes called Lunarchs in their own liturgy—are a secretive cult dedicated to the Killing Moon. They believe the Third Moon was real, that it was unjustly destroyed or banished, and that its return will transform Alaria forever.

### Beliefs

The cult's core doctrine holds that the Third Moon still exists somewhere beyond the planar stack, damaged but not destroyed. The destabilization periods that plague Alaria every several thousand years are not random cosmic events—they are the Third Moon trying to return home. Each time, it gets a little closer. Each time, it is pushed back.

Most Moonwatchers believe the Third Moon's eventual return will bring a great cleansing—the weak will die, the corrupt will be scoured away, and those who remained faithful will inherit a purified world. Some sects interpret this more mystically: the Third Moon's return will dissolve the boundaries between planes entirely, allowing mortals to ascend to a higher form of existence.

A minority faction within the cult believes the Third Moon doesn't want to return at all—it is *hiding*, and the destabilization periods are its death throes as it slowly expires in the void. These Moonwatchers seek to find and heal the Third Moon, not summon it.

### Practices

**The Blindfold Covenant:** Many Moonwatchers keep one eye permanently covered—bandaged, patched, or ritually blinded. The covered eye is "saved" for the Third Moon's return, preserved to witness what no mortal has seen in millennia. Senior cultists sometimes blind both eyes entirely, claiming to see more clearly through faith.

**Crescent Scarification:** Initiates receive ritual scars in crescent patterns—typically on the forearm, shoulder blade, or scalp. The number and arrangement of crescents indicates rank and sect affiliation.

**Hollownight Gatherings:** The cult's most important rituals occur on Hollownight, when both Auris and Nyxara are absent from the sky. On these darkest of nights, Moonwatchers gather in high places to "call" the Third Moon back, chanting prayers toward the empty sky. Orthodox doctrine holds that the Third Moon can only return when enough faithful call for it simultaneously.

**Moonstone Veneration:** Moonwatchers collect and trade fragments they believe fell from the original Third Moon. These "moonstones" vary wildly—some are clearly ordinary rocks, others are strange meteorites, and a few are genuinely anomalous materials that scholars cannot identify. The most prized moonstones glow faintly on Hollownight or cause unease in those who hold them.

### Organization

The Moonwatchers have no central leadership. Individual cells operate independently, connected by traveling preachers called **Heralds** who carry news, doctrine, and moonstones between groups. This decentralization makes the cult nearly impossible to stamp out—destroying one cell does nothing to the others.

**Sects** differ in their interpretation of what the Third Moon's return will mean:
- **The Cleansed** believe in purifying apocalypse
- **The Transcendent** believe in planar dissolution and ascension
- **The Mourners** believe the Third Moon is dying and must be saved
- **The Wrathful** believe the Third Moon was murdered and demands vengeance on those responsible (they disagree on who that might be)

### The Deadmoon Connection

The Deadmoon Tribe of Moonwood may be connected to the Moonwatchers—either as the cult's original founders who grew disillusioned, or as survivors of a Killing Moon period who rejected worship of what killed their ancestors. The relationship is unclear, and both groups refuse to discuss it.

### Threat Assessment

Most governments consider the Moonwatchers a nuisance rather than a genuine threat. Their apocalyptic beliefs seem delusional, their rituals harmless, their membership small.

However, the cult has been implicated in several concerning incidents:
- Assassination of astronomers who publicly denied the Third Moon's existence
- Sabotage of observatories and destruction of celestial records
- Attempted rituals involving mass sacrifice "to feed the returning moon"
- Theft of genuine anomalous artifacts that may actually be fragments of something

The Moonwatchers believe absolutely in what they're doing. That makes them unpredictable—and in the wrong circumstances, dangerous.

### For Players

Moonwatcher NPCs might serve as:
- Informants on obscure celestial lore
- Antagonists pursuing dangerous rituals
- Unlikely allies against threats to "their" moon
- Sources of genuine moonstones with strange properties
- Madmen, true believers, or something in between

A Moonwatcher PC would be unusual but playable—someone who believes the world is ending (eventually) and has complicated feelings about it.
