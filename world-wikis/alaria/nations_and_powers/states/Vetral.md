## Vetral

Tags: state, alrock ocean, theocracy, triton, underwater

An ancient triton theocracy claiming sovereignty over the entire Alrock Ocean. The Vetralians fled Adron in an age so distant that even the naga have forgotten why. Now they are reclusive, arrogant lords of the deep—and they are losing a war they cannot afford to lose.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Triton

**Population**: Unknown (estimates range from 50,000 to 200,000)

**Stability**: Strained

**Core Values**: Divine mandate, oceanic sovereignty, ancestral tradition, secrecy

**The Depths Conclave**: Vetral is ruled by a council of high priests who interpret the will of their sea-gods. The eldest serves as Voice of the Deep, speaking for the Conclave in matters requiring a single authority. Succession is determined through elaborate divination rituals that reportedly take months.

**The Sovereignty Claim**: Vetral claims the entire Alrock Ocean as sacred territory—from the seabed to the surface, from Adron's eastern coast to Ve's western shores. This claim is ancient, largely symbolic, and until recently, enforced only near Vetralian waters. Surface nations have never recognized it. The tritons have never needed recognition; they've needed only enforcement.

**The Old Lanes**: For millennia, Vetral maintained order through a simple arrangement. Ships that follow the "Old Lanes"—ancient, twisting routes that avoid triton holy sites and breeding grounds—sail safely. Ships that stray experience accidents: uncharted reefs, freak storms, vessels that simply never arrive. Nobody calls it piracy. The tritons take nothing. Ships just... have bad luck.

### The Bfaspeik War

The conflict with the Bfaspeen has ground on for longer than surface nations have kept records. Two underwater civilizations with incompatible interests, fighting over territory that neither can afford to cede.

**What Vetral Wants**: Ordered seas. The Old Lanes system depends on predictable surface activity. Ships following approved routes means the tritons can manage what happens above their domain. Control is everything.

**What the Bfaspeen Want**: Chaos. The Bfaspeen thrive on shipwrecks—every merchant vessel that sinks adds to their glittering hoards. Orderly trade lanes protected by triton "accidents" are bad for the brood mothers' treasure piles.

**The Current State**: Vetral is losing. Slowly, but losing. The Bfaspeen breed faster, fight dirtier, and don't care about casualties. Every triton offensive follows the same pattern: initial victories, then grinding attrition, then withdrawal. The brood mothers retreat into volcanic vents the tritons cannot follow, then resurge.

Worse, the broods have started coordinating—something Bfaspeen historically don't do. Multiple matriarchs working together, sharing intelligence, targeting triton supply lines. Someone or something is organizing them.

**The Desperation**: The war has pushed Vetral to expand enforcement of their sovereignty claims. They've begun sending formal notices to distant surface nations—demands for vessel registration, adherence to approved routes, traditional respects. It's a bid to build alliances, to pressure the Bfaspeen from above while fighting them below. So far, the responses have been... disappointing.

### Economy

**Size**: Unknown

**Tech**: Advanced (underwater)

**Primary Exports**: Forgecrab metal, deep-sea salvage, navigation agreements

**Primary Imports**: Surface metals, certain foods, intelligence

**Forgecrab Dependence**: Vetral's military power rests on forgecrab metal—living alloy harvested from massive crustaceans that migrate up from volcanic vents to die on Vetralian shelves. The shells grow and heal, making forgecrab armor and weapons extraordinarily durable. But the forgecrabs spawn near Bfaspeik, and the war has disrupted the harvest.

**The Salvage Trade**: Tritons know where every ship has sunk in the Alrock for the past thousand years. Occasionally they'll trade salvage rights to surface nations—for a price, and only for wrecks in "approved" waters. It's one of the few ways surface folk interact with Vetral directly.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Religious obligation

The triton military is a temple force—warriors blessed by sea-priests, wielding forgecrab weapons, trained from youth in underwater combat. On their home ground, they're nearly unbeatable. The problem is, war with the Bfaspeen isn't fought on their home ground. It's fought in volcanic trenches, thermal vents, and the lightless deep where the brood mothers lair.

**The Depth Riders**: Elite warriors mounted on trained sea creatures—sharks, rays, and stranger things. They serve as scouts, messengers, and shock troops. Depth Riders are the tritons' answer to Bfaspeen mobility, but there aren't enough of them.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Alrock Ocean (underwater)

**Biomes**: Coral cities, kelp forests, abyssal trenches

**Named Entities**: The Coral Throne (capital complex), the Breeding Shallows, the Old Roads (underwater highways)

**Adjacent Waters**: Alrock Ocean (claimed entirely)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Coral Throne—a vast underwater complex grown from living coral over millennia. The Depths Conclave meets here. Surface ambassadors have never been permitted entry.

**Cities**: Numerous underwater settlements, names unknown to surface cartographers

### Primary Conflicts

**The Bfaspeik War**: The defining struggle of modern Vetral. The tritons are losing slowly, and they know it. The Conclave debates whether to seek surface allies (humiliating), abandon outlying territories (unthinkable), or continue the grinding attrition (unsustainable).

**The Alliance Question**: Keletus has the finest navy in the world. Vetral has approached them repeatedly. King Varrosh has refused repeatedly. The insult stings, but the tritons need allies too badly to escalate. For now.

**Internal Fractures**: Younger tritons question the Conclave's strategy. Some advocate abandoning the sovereignty claims entirely—focus on core territory, let the surface do what it wants. Others want total war against the Bfaspeen, regardless of cost. The Conclave tries to navigate between these factions while presenting unified purpose.

**The Breeding Shallows**: Vetral's greatest secret and greatest vulnerability. Every seventeen years, tritons from across the Alrock return to specific thermal vents to spawn. If surface nations—or the Bfaspeen—learned when and where this happens, they could exterminate the species in a single coordinated attack. The Conclave's refusal to explain *why* certain waters are sacred has cost them diplomatic credibility. But explaining would cost them everything.

### History

The tritons fled Adron in prehistory. Why they left, what they were fleeing, what they abandoned—all lost to time. Even the naga, who have long memories, recall only that the tritons were there, and then were not.

The Alrock became their new home. They built coral cities, established the Old Lanes, claimed sovereignty over all the waters they could reach. For ages, this worked. Surface nations learned to respect the routes. The sea was orderly.

Then the Bfaspeen population exploded—no one knows why, perhaps a shift in volcanic activity providing more thermal habitat. What had been occasional skirmishes became constant warfare. The tritons have been fighting for three generations now, and they're running out of forgecrab metal, running out of Depth Riders, running out of options.

### Player Hooks

- **The Desperate Embassy**: Vetral has sent an envoy to a surface nation. They need allies. They're offering things they've never offered before—salvage rights, safe passage guarantees, perhaps even forgecrab metal. But they won't explain why their situation is so dire. Players could serve as intermediaries, translators, or spies.

- **The Breeding Shallows**: Someone has learned the tritons' secret. Now they're selling it—to Keletus, to Bfaspeik, to the highest bidder. The Conclave wants this person silenced before the knowledge spreads. Players might be hired to find the leak, or to buy the information themselves.

- **Behind Bfaspeen Lines**: The Conclave suspects someone is organizing the brood mothers. They need surface agents—people who can breathe air, survive the volcanic waters with the right magic, and investigate without being identified as triton allies. Suicidal? Yes. Necessary? Also yes.

- **The Old Wreck**: A Vetralian salvage priest has offered coordinates to a ship that sank carrying something valuable—truly valuable, nation-changing valuable. The catch: it's in waters the Bfaspeen now control. The tritons can't retrieve it themselves. They need surface divers willing to risk brood mother territory.
