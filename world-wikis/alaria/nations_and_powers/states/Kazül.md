## Kazül

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Oznak, Glorindian (Humans)

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Tradition, religion, wealth, night/day

- Kazül is ruled by **King Salomor**, who wears a legendary ring granting him the power to summon extremely powerful creatures to do his bidding. The ring is well known—it's why no one challenges him.
- Society is divided into three castes: laborers, merchants, and nobility. Only nobility can own land. Only merchants and nobility can make or procure loans.
- When you marry, your children inherit the **lower** caste of their two parents. This ensures downward mobility and keeps the lower castes growing while the nobility remains exclusive.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Glass, stained glass, various minerals

**Primary Imports**: Metal, textiles

- Kazül is the **largest producer of glass in Alaria**. The glass artists of Kazül are world-renowned, and Kazüli stained glass decorates temples and palaces across the continent.
- The desert sands provide perfect raw materials for glassmaking. The secret techniques are jealously guarded by guild families.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Very Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (lower castes)

- Kazül lacks violent neighbors, and the desert is not an appetizing prize for would-be attackers.
- Lower castes are required to serve two years in the military. Merchant castes may volunteer and enter as officers. Nobility don't serve.
- The real military power is Salomor's ring—why maintain an army when the king can summon monsters?

### The River Settlements

A river flows from Glorin in the north down through Kazül, and most settlements cluster along it. The river is life—without it, the interior would be uninhabitable. Kazüli settlements stretch up the river almost to Glorin's border.

### The Jahazai Desert

The vast interior desert that makes up most of Kazül's territory. Harsh, beautiful, and full of buried secrets. Ancient ruins lie beneath the sands—remnants of civilizations that flourished before the desert claimed the land. Treasure hunters and archaeologists venture into the Jahazai, though many never return.

### The Towers of Ederhi

Deep in the Jahazai Desert stand the Towers of Ederhi—ancient spires of fused glass rising from the sand. No one knows who built them or why. The glass is unlike anything Kazüli artisans can produce—harder, clearer, and faintly luminescent at night.

Some believe the towers are tombs. Others think they're beacons, waiting for someone to activate them. Expeditions have explored the exterior but found no entrance. The towers remain a mystery—and a reminder that the desert holds secrets older than Kazül itself.

### Bhutag

A town in the eastern desert, near the coast. Bhutag sits atop a vast underground complex—catacombs that predate the current settlement by millennia. The locals avoid the deeper tunnels, which are said to be haunted. Occasionally, artifacts emerge from the depths, sold quietly to collectors who don't ask questions.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Caste System**

The brutal downward-mobility rule ensures resentment festers in the lower castes. Laborers have no path upward, and mixed-caste marriages doom children to the bottom. Unrest simmers, though Salomor's ring keeps open rebellion unthinkable.

**Desert Secrets**

The Jahazai holds treasures and dangers. Expeditions into the deep desert sometimes disturb things better left buried. Not every ruin is empty.

### History

Kazül grew along the river, sustained by water in a land of sand. The desert was always there, full of ruins from older times—civilizations swallowed by the advancing sands.

King Salomor's dynasty has ruled for generations, their power secured by the summoning ring. Where the ring came from is a matter of legend—some say it was found in the Jahazai ruins, others that it was a gift from a dying god. Salomor isn't telling.

The glass trade made Kazül wealthy. The caste system keeps that wealth concentrated. The desert keeps enemies away. It's a stable arrangement—for those at the top.
