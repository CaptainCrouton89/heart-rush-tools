## Istora

Tags: state, winter-elf, istori, crimson-coast

The eastern successor to the unified Winter Elf kingdom, Istora is ruled by Queen Lamenrae—daughter of the murdered Istor XXVI and the first woman to claim the elven throne. What was once the summer half of a realm that stretched across the Crimson Coast is now a kingdom defined by grief, rage, and the slow grind of civil war.

### Overview

Istora follows the Sova Chyda river from its sources in the Suftos Hills to the Void. The sacred Winterwood anchors its spiritual life; the contested hills define its western border. The Istori were once renowned for regal calm, dignified restraint, and the patient wisdom of the long-lived. The succession crisis has burned much of that away.

Capital: **Tuur** (~3,000 population)

### Government

**Queen Lamenrae** rules—the first woman to hold the Winter Elf throne. Her claim rests on blood (daughter of the murdered king), necessity (no male heirs existed), and force of will. Traditionalists in both kingdoms consider her reign illegitimate; her supporters argue that tradition must evolve or the elves will die clinging to it.

Her court is divided between progressives (who see the crisis as opportunity for reform), revanchists (who want Klevnaf conquered and reunified), and pragmatists (who just want the kingdom to survive). Lamenrae herself is revanchist at heart—she wants her uncle dead and her kingdom restored—but she's learned to speak the progressives' language when it serves her purposes.

**The Council of Seasons** traditionally advised the monarch, with members representing different aspects of elven society. Lamenrae has gutted it, replacing deliberation with command. The remaining councilors are loyal but increasingly concerned about what their queen is becoming.

### Culture

The Istori are Winter Elves—the Istori subrace, to be precise, though they'd bristle at being called a "subrace" of anything. They live for centuries, mature slowly, and have traditionally valued patience, ceremony, and the long view. Foxes and snowy owls serve as companions and messengers, a tradition dating back to the first settlements.

The war has changed them. Outsiders describe the Istori as having "become much nastier"—centuries of regal calm replaced by siege mentality. Strangers are suspected; questions are threats; mercy is weakness. They still perform the old ceremonies, but the grace has gone out of them. What remains is going through motions, clinging to forms while their substance erodes.

**Theological innovation** has emerged from necessity. Traditional elven religion demands a male monarch leading the rites; Lamenrae's coronation required new interpretations. Istora's priests have developed justifications—arguments that the gods care about spirit rather than form, that tradition must serve the people rather than rule them. Klevnaf considers this heresy; Istora considers it survival.

The Winterwood remains central to Istori spirituality. Unlike Klevnaf's absolute prohibition on logging, Istora permits sustainable harvesting from the sacred forest's edges—another theological innovation that horrifies traditionalists. The elves say the ancestors understand the needs of the living. Whether they actually do is a matter of faith.

### Economy

Istora's economy is strained but functional. The Sova Chyda provides irrigation for limited agriculture; the Winterwood offers sustainable timber; eastern trade routes to the Dragon's Spine Coast remain open. The kingdom exports exquisitely carved woodwork—Istori craftsmen are renowned across Aboyinzu—and imports food, weapons, and metal goods.

Fishing supplements agriculture. The Istori have developed preservation techniques that allow catches to last through long winters. It's not enough; the kingdom runs a food deficit and depends on imports that the war makes expensive and unreliable.

### Military

Istora fields roughly 1,000 trained soldiers—more than Klevnaf due to larger population and better supply. Training occurs at Bejakørn, far from the front lines. Young elves arrive as civilians and leave as warriors, ready for deployment to the Suftos line.

Their equipment is superior—eastern trade keeps weapons and armor flowing—but terrain favors defense. Advancing across the Suftos Hills means attacking uphill into prepared positions. The war has stalemated because neither side can project force effectively.

**Special forces**: Istora has developed units specialized in shadow warfare—assassination, sabotage, intelligence gathering. Lamenrae denies their existence while deploying them aggressively. Several Klevnaf officials have died under mysterious circumstances.

### Relations

**With Klevnaf**: Active war. Border skirmishes are constant; major offensives occur when one side thinks it sees an opening. Both kingdoms are exhausting themselves without achieving decisive results.

**With Tangiern**: Complicated. Lamenrae has approached King Halvard about alliance, emphasizing that a progressive elven kingdom would be a better neighbor than traditionalist alternatives. Halvard has listened but not committed. Neither trusts the other, and both suspect any deal would leave them worse off.

**With the Dragon's Spine Coast**: Limited trade continues through Bejakørn. The eastern powers consider the Crimson Coast a backwater and its civil war a local problem.

### History

The Winter Elves arrived on the Crimson Coast millennia ago, displacing or absorbing earlier inhabitants. They built a civilization spanning the region—elegant in summer, enduring in winter—that lasted until the murder of Istor XXVI.

The succession crisis began when the old king (Istor XXV) died and his eldest son inherited. Within months, Istor XXVI was dead—poisoned, his daughter claimed, by his own brother Taoinor who wanted the throne. Taoinor denied it; the evidence was circumstantial; the kingdom split along existing fault lines. Those who valued tradition over evidence followed Taoinor; those who believed Lamenrae (or simply wanted change) followed her.

The split wasn't clean. Families divided; villages were purged; the Suftos Hills became a killing ground. The initial chaos has settled into attritional warfare that neither side can win or end.

### What Outsiders Notice

- The cold courtesy that feels like it might turn hostile at any moment
- Foxes and owls that watch strangers with uncanny intelligence
- Architecture that combines elegance with recent fortification
- The way conversations stop when outsiders approach
- References to "the usurper" delivered with genuine hatred

### Adventure Hooks

- Lamenrae wants deniable agents to infiltrate Klevnaf—information, assassination, or sabotage
- Something in the Winterwood is behaving strangely; the priests won't discuss it but seem frightened
- A moderate faction in both kingdoms wants to negotiate peace; they need neutral intermediaries
- The Shrine of Reflections has begun producing prophecies that terrify those who hear them
