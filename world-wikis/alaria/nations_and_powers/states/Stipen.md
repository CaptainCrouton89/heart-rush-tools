## Stipen

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Gerontocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ezuri (Tree Gnomes)

**Population**: 9,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Truth, honor, creativity, beauty

- Settlements are built into massive trees—interconnected homes supported by living wood.
- The Ezuri here live up to 500 years, their longevity sustained by the trees themselves. To leave the forest is to give that up.
- Upon reaching elder years, you join the Stipen Council, which makes all decisions for the state.
- Fully integrated with the trees—they can speak with them and are expert gardeners.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Specialty flora

**Primary Imports**: None

- Largely self-sufficient. People grow their own gardens in the trees, kept alive and producing through accelerated growth magic.
- People rarely leave—their longevity is tied to the forest.
- Trade is minimal; outsiders are tolerated but not encouraged.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Although not formally trained, the Stipen people are incredibly adept at working with nature to fight back against enemies.
- All their might is defensive. Outside the forest, they lose their connection and their power.
- The forest itself fights for them—trees shift, roots trip, branches strike.

### Geography

**Location**: Middle Sea coast along the Chedwin Strait, east of Thespia, north of Zintacas

**Biomes**: Ancient forest (entirely forested)

**Climate**: Temperate coastal—mild, humid, perfect for trees

**Named Features**: Teleriwood (western forest), Schousterwood (eastern forest)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Atra

**Cities**: None (Atra is the closest thing)

**Towns**: Shamwet, Kestrel, and scattered tree-settlements throughout the forest

### Primary Conflicts

**The Generational Divide**

There is growing tension between the young and old. The council of elders makes all decisions, but young Ezuri—who may be a century old and still considered "youth"—feel they lack any representation. Elders dismiss their concerns as impatience; youth see elders as out of touch with a changing world.

**The Drug Question**

Psychedelic substances have been discovered—flora that grows in the deeper parts of the forest. Some Ezuri use them for spiritual experiences or creative inspiration. The council has not approved, viewing them as dangerous or corrupting. The debate is quiet but persistent.

**Isolation vs. Engagement**

The outside world is increasingly chaotic—mad queens in Thespia, silvertongue plagues in Ubrik, dragon standoffs. Some younger Ezuri think Stipen should engage more, help their neighbors, participate in the wider world. Elders argue that leaving the forest means death, and involvement brings only trouble.

### History

The Ezuri came to these forests long ago, fleeing the Mad Gorehorn disease that ravaged the Jungles of Titania. They climbed into the trees to escape and never came down. Over centuries, they bonded with the forest until their lives became intertwined with it.

Now Stipen is an ancient, peaceful realm where gnomes live for centuries among the branches. They want nothing from the outside world, and hope the outside world wants nothing from them.
