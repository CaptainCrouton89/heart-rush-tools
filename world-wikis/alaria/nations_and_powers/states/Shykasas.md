## Shykasas

Tags: state, shacklands, alekroin

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Alekroin

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Patience, territorial dominance, ancestral tradition, predatory hierarchy

The King of Shykasas rules over the six noble houses from the Palace of the Six Jaws in Vila Bonsa. Royal succession follows ancient ritual: an egg is selected from the King's brood and incubated in isolation at precise temperatures, watched by keepers who will never see it hatch. The chosen heir grows larger, stronger, and more cunning than any other Alekroin. The process is not explained to outsiders.

Each noble house controls territory within the archipelago and maintains its own hunting traditions, but all defer to the crown in matters of foreign policy and territorial defense. Internal disputes are settled through ritualized challenges—rarely lethal, but always decisive.

Shykasas has no allies because it wants none. The Alekroin view diplomatic relationships as a form of weakness, an admission that one cannot survive alone. They trade when convenient but make no treaties, sign no pacts, and join no coalitions.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Medicinal plants, bioluminescent algae, cured hides, rare shells, aquaculture products

**Primary Imports**: Metals, worked steel, luxury goods

The swamps provide abundantly for those who know how to harvest them. The Alekroin have developed sophisticated aquaculture, cultivating shellfish and medicinal plants in managed pools throughout the archipelago. Their bioluminescent algae—harvested from the deeper channels—fetches high prices in foreign markets for both decorative and alchemical purposes.

Trade happens on Alekroin terms. Foreign merchants are restricted to Bixesarri on the outer islands. The Alekroin do not haggle, do not negotiate, and do not explain their prices. Traders who complain are free to leave and never return.

Metal remains the critical import. The swamps offer no ore deposits, and the Alekroin require steel for tools, weapons, and construction. This dependency is their only significant vulnerability, and they maintain carefully hidden stockpiles against the possibility of trade disruption.

### Military

**Size**: Very small

**Quality**: Exceptional

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (effectively universal)

Every adult Alekroin is a capable combatant—their predatory physiology and lifelong hunting experience make formal military training almost redundant. The "military" consists primarily of the coastwatch stationed at Erez and similar posts, who track vessel movements and coordinate responses to intrusion.

When Shykasas goes to war, it does so with the patient, methodical lethality of its people. They do not march in formations or hold battle lines. They wait in water that looks empty until it isn't. Three Gorathi survey vessels learned this lesson. Gorath has not sent a fourth.

An individual Alekroin can engage four or more typical soldiers with reasonable odds of victory. They are ambush predators by nature and training, striking from unexpected angles and using terrain that advantages them and disadvantages everyone else.

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Shacklands, between the Sea of Sighs and open ocean

**Biomes**: Saltwater swamp, tidal marshland, mangrove forest, coastal archipelago

**Climate**: Hot, humid, monsoon seasons

**Named Entities**:
- Turiik Forest (northern mangrove boundary)
- Soso Mari (southern tidal bay)
- Thizun (taboo ruins, northwest island)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Numerous tidal channels; no major freshwater rivers

**Adjacent Waters**: Sea of Sighs (north), open ocean (south and west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Vila Bonsa

**Cities**: None (Vila Bonsa is the only major settlement)

**Towns**: Bixesarri (trade), Ansalonga (hunting), Molleres (eastern border), Arinsal (aquaculture), Erez (coastwatch)

**Villages**: Sornas (fishing/pearl diving)

### Relations

**Gorath**: Cold indifference. Gorath wants shipping access through Soso Mari; Shykasas has not responded to diplomatic overtures. Three survey vessels have entered the bay; none returned. The matter remains unresolved.

**Lyoki Ingi Ingi**: Neutral non-interference. The Mudzwiti goblins and Alekroin share a border at Molleres. Both peoples are territorial and respect boundaries. Trade is minimal but not hostile.

**Kyagos**: No meaningful contact. The mountain island's recent revolution has not affected Shykasas in any way.

**Slave Trade**: No participation. The Alekroin have no interest in slavery—they consider the practice inefficient and demeaning to the enslaved (who become prey) and the enslaver (who relies on prey for labor).

### Primary Conflicts

**The Soso Mari Question**: Gorath's interest in the bay shipping lanes remains unresolved. The Alekroin's continued silence forces Gorath to choose between accepting the status quo and risking another expensive lesson.

**Thizun**: The taboo ruins occasionally attract treasure hunters. The Alekroin do not interfere with these expeditions, but neither do they assist. Something in those ruins prevents most explorers from returning, and the Alekroin seem content to let this natural defense continue.

**Succession Tensions**: The ritual selection of royal heirs occasionally generates resentment among noble houses whose eggs were passed over. These tensions rarely escalate beyond pointed comments and careful watching.

### History

The Alekroin have occupied these swamps for millennia. Their oral histories speak of arriving from elsewhere—"when the waters were different"—but the details have been worn smooth by generations of retelling. What remains is the certainty that they belong here and always have.

Thizun predates them. The ruins were already ancient and already taboo when the first Alekroin settled the archipelago. The prohibition against visiting the site has been maintained without explanation for as long as anyone can remember.

Shykasas has never been conquered. Several powers have considered the attempt over the centuries. Those who proceeded learned why the others did not.
