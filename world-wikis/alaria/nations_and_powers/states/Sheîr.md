## Sheîr

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal monarchy (nominal), island autonomy (actual)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Bledreon Islanders (humans with dual-lid eyes), various mainland humans

**Population**: ~35,000 (capital ~8,000; scattered island populations ~27,000)

**Stability**: Stable in chaos (the system is dysfunction, but it functions)

**Core Values**: Naval freedom, island pride, ancestral territory, the hunt

Sheîr is two nations wearing one crown. The capital—called simply **The Seat**—is a proper kingdom: courts, nobles, laws, tax collectors. The islands are something else entirely. Bledreon sailors acknowledge the king exists. They ignore everything he says.

The Bledreon Islanders are immediately recognizable: their eyes have dual lids, an inner membrane that protects against salt spray and harsh sun. They can see underwater with surprising clarity. Some claim the trait comes from interbreeding with sea spirits; the Bledreon say their ancestors simply learned to live at sea until the sea lived in them.

The capital's nobles are a different breed—mainlanders who married into island families or received land grants from forgotten kings. They ride **raptors**—swift, vicious creatures somewhere between lizard and bird—and maintain the deadliest land army in the Western Isles. When Sheîr's raptors land on an island, everyone on that island dies.

### The Ghost Treaty

Sheîr's relationship with Tarkhon is... complicated.

Five hundred years ago—before the Tarkhon Empire existed as such—the Neferati fire-bloods made a pact with Sheîr's ancestors. The terms were specific: Sheîr would provide naval support to whoever held the Evertorch in Tarkhetan. In exchange, the Neferati would never claim Sheîr as territory, would guarantee its independence, and would support it against external threats.

The pact was sworn on the Evertorch itself. It cannot be broken by either party—only renegotiated by mutual agreement.

When the Severance happened and humans inherited Tarkhon, they inherited the pact too. The current emperor claims this makes Sheîr a vassal—bound to support whoever holds the Evertorch. Sheîr's king argues the pact makes them *equals*—allies, not subjects, with no obligation beyond what they choose to give.

Both interpretations are legally defensible. Neither side wants to test the pact's limits.

In practice: Sheîr sends ships when Tarkhon calls—sometimes. Sheîr's nobles occasionally lend their raptor cavalry to Tarkhon's campaigns—when they feel like it. Tarkhon doesn't try to tax Sheîr or station troops there. Everyone pretends this is a functioning relationship.

The Kingdoms of Fire find the whole arrangement darkly amusing. The pact was with the Neferati. Perhaps the *original* holders of the Evertorch could interpret it differently...

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Standard, advanced shipbuilding

**Primary Exports**: Ships, sailors, fish, sea products, raptor mounts (rarely)

**Primary Imports**: Grain, metals, luxury goods, mainlander goods

Sheîr builds the best ships in the Western Isles. The Bledreon have been sailing these waters for centuries; they know what works. Shipyards on the larger islands produce vessels for clients across the Shattered Sea.

The islands themselves produce fish, salt, and various sea products. Some islands have valuable timber; others have little but rock and stubbornness. The capital controls most overland trade with Tarkhon.

Raptor breeding is controlled exclusively by noble families. The creatures are too dangerous and too valuable to sell casually. Occasionally a foreign noble will pay an obscene price for a trained mount—but they rarely survive long without Sheîr handlers.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Naval excellence, elite cavalry

**Enrollment**: Island volunteers (navy), noble retinues (cavalry)

Sheîr's military has two branches that barely interact:

**The Island Fleets**

Every significant island maintains its own ships and crews. There's no unified navy—each captain answers to their island elder. When Sheîr needs a fleet, the king sends word and captains who feel like responding show up. This sounds chaotic. It is. But it also means enemy raiders never know how many ships they'll face.

The Bledreon fight from ships with devastating effectiveness. Their dual-lid eyes let them see in spray and sun. They can dive overboard, swim to enemy vessels, and attack from below. Most naval powers fear engaging them.

**The Raptor Nobility**

The capital's nobles breed and ride raptors—pack-hunting predators standing taller than a man. The creatures are stupid, vicious, and terrifyingly fast. They hunt by running prey to exhaustion, then tearing it apart.

On open ground, raptor cavalry is nearly unstoppable. The problem is reaching open ground—Sheîr is mostly islands and water. But when the nobles land their raptors on an enemy island, the result is massacre. This happens rarely, but the threat keeps rival islands from pushing too hard.

### Geography

**Location**: Eastern Western Isles, jutting into the Shattered Sea from the Tarkhon coast

**Biomes**: Island archipelago, coastal mainland territory

**Climate**: Warm maritime, frequent storms

**Named Features**: The Seat (capital), Phyndarr Sound (northern waters), numerous unnamed islands

Sheîr straddles the boundary between the Western Isles and Tarkhon proper. The mainland portion is small—a coastal strip with the capital city. The real territory is the islands: dozens of them spreading west into the Shattered Sea.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Seat (~8,000)

**Major Islands**: Named by their elders, too numerous to list. Larger islands have populations of 500-2,000; smaller ones might have a few families.

### The Seat

The capital is everything the islands aren't: orderly, hierarchical, concerned with appearances. Stone buildings line planned streets. Nobles maintain townhouses and compete for proximity to the palace. The royal court observes elaborate protocols that islanders consider laughable.

**King Varos III** rules from the Driftwood Throne—carved from timbers of the ship that supposedly carried the first Bledreon to these shores. He's thirty-seven, competent, and increasingly frustrated by his inability to actually control the islands that are nominally his.

The Seat's power comes from three sources: control of Tarkhon trade, the raptor cavalry, and the legal fiction that the king speaks for all Sheîr. The first two are real. The third is useful mainly for negotiating with foreigners who expect someone to be in charge.

### The Islands

The islands govern themselves through tradition. Each has an elder or council; decisions are made by consensus or force. The king has no authority there. He can request assistance, but islanders respond only to direct threats or opportunities for profit.

Island culture values freedom above all. A Bledreon sailor answers to their captain, their captain answers to their elder, and their elder answers to no one. This makes coordinating anything nearly impossible—but it also means no foreign power can conquer Sheîr by taking the capital.

**Key Island Groups:**
- **The Inner Ring**: Islands closest to the mainland, most influenced by capital politics
- **The Drift**: Central island clusters where the true Bledreon traditions survive
- **The Far Reach**: Western islands barely connected to Sheîr at all—practically independent states

### Primary Conflicts

**King vs. Islands**

King Varos wants to actually rule his kingdom. The islands want to be left alone. This tension has existed since Sheîr's founding and will probably never resolve. Varos's recent attempts to collect island taxes have been met with selective deafness.

**The Ghost Treaty Question**

What exactly does Sheîr owe Tarkhon? The empire keeps pushing for more active support. Sheîr keeps finding reasons to provide less. Eventually someone will force the issue—and then the ancient pact will be tested in ways no one can predict.

**The Fire Kingdom Interest**

The Kingdoms of Fire have started asking questions about the Ghost Treaty. The pact was with the Neferati who held the Evertorch. What if the original holders reclaimed their flame? Would the treaty transfer? Some in Sheîr are curious. Others are terrified of being caught between Tarkhon and the Fire Kingdoms.

**Raptor Succession**

The noble families who breed raptors are dying out. Three of the seven breeding bloodlines have ended in the past century. The remaining families guard their secrets jealously—but secrets don't help if there's no one to inherit them.

### Notable Figures

**King Varos III** — Ruler of Sheîr in name, frustrated administrator in practice. Competent, ambitious, and increasingly willing to take risks to expand his actual authority.

**Elder Kresh of the Drift** — Unofficial leader of the island faction. Eighty years old, sailor since childhood, respected across the archipelago. When Kresh speaks, islanders listen—which is more than the king can say.

**Duchess Seravyn** — Leader of the raptor cavalry and head of the oldest breeding family. Cold, competent, and deeply concerned about her family's fading bloodline. Has three daughters; none have the talent for raptor bonding.

**Captain Drell Stormwake** — Most famous Bledreon sailor alive. Commands a fleet of twelve ships that he's built up through piracy, trade, and strategic marriages. Theoretically loyal to Elder Kresh; practically loyal to profit.

### History

**The First Bledreon**: The islands were settled long ago by humans who developed—or acquired—their distinctive eye trait. Origin stories vary; the Bledreon don't much care which is true.

**The Neferati Pact** (~500 years ago): When the Neferati were building what would become Tarkhon, they needed naval support. They couldn't conquer the Bledreon, so they made a deal. The Ghost Treaty has bound Sheîr to whoever holds the Evertorch ever since.

**The Severance**: When humans inherited Tarkhon, they inherited the pact. The relationship has been contentious ever since—Sheîr honoring the letter while ignoring the spirit.

**The Present**: A kingdom divided against itself, bound by an ancient treaty to an empire it doesn't respect, and increasingly caught between Tarkhon and the Fire Kingdoms. Something will break eventually.
