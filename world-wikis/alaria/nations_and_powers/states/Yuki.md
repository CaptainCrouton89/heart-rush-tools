Sister city of Garlow.

Located at (172, 82). 

Both cities, due to anomalies in the void are overlaced on top of each other. It is difficult to know which city you are in at any particular moment.

Primarily populated by etherweaver goblins, who have trapped the shit out of the city to protect it from the Krell.
