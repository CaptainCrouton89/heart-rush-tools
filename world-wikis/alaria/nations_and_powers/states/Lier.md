## Lier

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 45,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Trade, pragmatism, discretion, profit

- Lier is governed by a council of merchant families who've accumulated enough wealth to buy seats. Politics is transactional—votes are traded, favors are currency, and everyone understands that principle matters less than profit.
- The population is predominantly human, though the port of Hessam attracts visitors and residents from across the Middle Sea. Diversity is tolerated as long as it's profitable.
- Lier serves as the commercial hub of Erpeus Island, trading Mkinti's clockwork and gems to the wider world while supplying the gnomes with goods they can't produce underground.
- The culture values discretion. Lier's merchants have learned that asking too many questions loses customers, and everyone has secrets worth keeping.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Re-exported Mkinti goods, agricultural products, fish, ships

**Primary Imports**: Grain, luxury goods, raw materials for Mkinti

- Lier's economy runs on being the middleman. Mkinti's gnomes don't want to deal with outsiders; Lier's merchants are happy to do it for a cut.
- The fertile hills produce grain, olives, and wine that feed both Lier and supplement Mkinti's non-gnomish population.
- Fishing fleets work the surrounding waters, and shipyards in Hessam build vessels for Middle Sea trade.
- The Bay of Whispers draws a peculiar sort of tourism—those seeking lost secrets or trying to speak across time.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (mercenary-heavy)

- Lier maintains a small professional military supplemented by mercenaries when needed. The merchant families prefer hiring soldiers to raising them.
- The navy is more substantial—protecting trade routes matters more than defending borders on an island this size.
- The real defense is economic. Attacking Lier would disrupt trade across Erpeus, and the gnomes of Mkinti have made clear they'd respond to threats to their supply chain.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Erpeus Island, in the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Rolling hills, coastal lowlands, rocky highlands

**Named Entities**: Hills of Soromun, Murder Hills, Devil's Crest, Bay of Whispers

**Rivers & Lakes**: Several rivers flowing from the highlands to the coast

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (east and west coasts)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Hessam

**Cities**: Hessam

**Towns**: Lucsha, Dozna, Coyzevan, Tothpa, Oychka, Gam

**Villages**: Numerous farming and fishing villages

### Primary Conflicts

**The Gnomish Question**

Lier's prosperity depends on Mkinti, but the gnomes' internal crisis threatens everything. If House Wizzik loses control, if civil war breaks out, if the clockwork trade stops—Lier's economy collapses. The merchant council is desperately trying to maintain good relations with all factions without picking sides.

**The Bay of Whispers**

The supernatural bay outside Hessam attracts seekers of forbidden knowledge—and the trouble that follows them. Strange cults, obsessed scholars, people trying to undo the past or learn the future. The council tolerates the tourism revenue but worries about what secrets might emerge.

**The Murder Hills**

The highlands got their name honestly. Bandits, fugitives, and things that don't like sunlight shelter in the Murder Hills, preying on travelers between Lier and Azuros. The council sends occasional expeditions to clean them out; the hills refill within months.

**Azuros Relations**

The monks to the north are harmless but unhelpful. They won't trade, won't fight, won't engage with the world in ways Lier's merchants understand. The council mostly ignores them—but some worry about what would happen if the monastery's isolation ever broke down.

### History

Lier was founded as a fishing village that grew into a trading post. Its position on Erpeus made it the natural intermediary between the gnomes of the mountains and the human world beyond.

The merchant families emerged gradually, accumulating wealth through generations of careful dealing. They formalized their power into the council system, where money determines influence and old blood means nothing without new gold.

The discovery of the Bay of Whispers changed Lier's character. The supernatural phenomenon drew attention—scholars, mystics, the desperate, and the curious. The merchants adapted, charging fees for access, selling supplies to seekers, and learning which questions not to ask.

Modern Lier is prosperous, pragmatic, and perpetually anxious. The gnomish crisis threatens everything. The Bay of Whispers generates opportunity and danger in equal measure. The Murder Hills resist all attempts at civilization. But the merchants keep trading, the ships keep sailing, and the money keeps flowing—for now.
