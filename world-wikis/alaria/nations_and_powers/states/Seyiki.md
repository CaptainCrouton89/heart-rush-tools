## Seyiki

Tags: state, gnome, westwilds

A distributed nation of dragonfly-riding gnomes living among the Chakatann pillars—the massive stone monuments left by the fallen Postronamas Empire in the western Piktiniti Desert.

### Overview

Seyiki isn't a single city but a network of pillar-communities, each hosting between 200 and 2,000 gnomes in carved chambers along the pillar sides. The pillars rise hundreds of feet from the desert floor, and the Seyiki have adapted to vertical life: children learn to fall (safely, using wingsuit-robes) before they learn to climb.

Below many pillars lie saltwater lakes—remnants of ancient seas now trapped in desert basins. The giant dragonflies the Seyiki ride have adapted to tolerate saltwater, using the lakes as breeding grounds.

### Government

Seyiki governance is loose and distributed. Each pillar-community is largely autonomous, governed by a council of elders, successful merchants, and veteran riders. The pillars cooperate through periodic gatherings—"Sky Moots"—where representatives from across the network meet to resolve disputes, coordinate defense, and arrange marriages between communities.

No central authority exists. Attempts to create one have historically failed; the Seyiki are too independent, too scattered, and too suspicious of concentrated power (they remember, mythologically, what happened to the Postronamas).

### Culture

**Vertical Life:** Status correlates with elevation. Pillar-tops are prestigious; base-dwellers are low-caste. Everything important happens high up.

**The Robes:** All Seyiki wear flowing garments that convert to wingsuits when falling. This isn't fashion—it's survival. A Seyiki without their robe is naked in a way that has nothing to do with modesty.

**Dragonfly Bonds:** The relationship between gnome and mount is intimate and lifelong. Losing a dragonfly is a genuine tragedy; bonding with a new one takes months of patient work.

**The Reaping:** The seven-year locust swarms are the most important cultural event. Seyiki don't hide—they hunt, riding into the swarms to harvest locusts by the ton. A gnome's worth is measured partly by how many Reapings they've survived.

### Economy

Seyiki export crystal fragments (twyl from depleted pillars), dragonfly chitin, and locust products. They import metal, textiles, and luxuries through Jüt. Trade caravans are rare; most commerce happens via dragonfly-back, with hauler-breeds carrying cargo between pillars and to the coast.

### Military

Seyiki warriors are fantastic fighters despite their small size. Their combat doctrine emphasizes three-dimensional movement: dropping from above, striking from unexpected angles, retreating upward or into the air. On their home pillars, they're nearly impossible to defeat; enemies can't pursue them vertically, and the gnomes know every passage and platform.

The dragonfly-mounted cavalry is feared across the region. War-dancer breeds are fast, maneuverable, and aggressive. A Seyiki warband can harry an army indefinitely, picking off stragglers, raiding supply lines, and never committing to a fight they might lose.

### Relations

**Jüt:** Primary trading partner. The coastal city is the Seyiki's window to the wider world. Relations are commercial and cordial.

**The Orc States:** Distant but wary. The orcs control the inland Westwilds; the Seyiki control the desert pillars. Neither has much the other wants, so conflict is rare.

**Treasure Hunters:** A constant irritation. Outsiders seeking crystal cores are tolerated if they ask permission; those who try to claim pillars by force discover why the Seyiki have held this territory for millennia.

### Notable Locations

See atlas entry for Chakatann. The pillars themselves are the notable locations—each one a vertical village with its own character, history, and specializations.

### Player Hooks

- Hire Seyiki guides to cross the Piktiniti safely
- Seek Postronamas artifacts in the ruins near Enimogos (the Seyiki won't help, but they might not stop you)
- Join a Reaping—outsiders who prove themselves worthy earn Seyiki respect
- Investigate a pillar whose crystal core has begun humming *wrong*
- Mediate a dispute between pillar-communities threatening to escalate into inter-pillar war
