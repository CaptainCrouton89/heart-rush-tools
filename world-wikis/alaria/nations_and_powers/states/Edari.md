## Edari

Tags: state, ve, korel

Edari is not a state in the conventional sense—it has no government, no cities, no taxes, no laws. It is a geographic region claimed entirely by the Korel, the Wildborn Koren, who tolerate no permanent settlement within their territory.

### Government

None. The Korel organize into hunting packs of 10-40 individuals, each led by whichever member has proven strongest or most cunning. Packs are fluid—members leave and join based on personal loyalty, mating, or disputes. There is no overarching Korel authority, no council of packs, no paramount chief.

This makes diplomacy with "Edari" effectively impossible. One pack might grant safe passage; the next might hunt the same travelers for sport.

### Culture

The Korel embrace their predatory nature where their Kor cousins suppress it. They live by instinct, valuing cunning, strength, and pack loyalty above all. Their camps are temporary—hide tents, fire pits, drying racks for meat—abandoned when the game moves on.

They have no written language and little use for trade goods. What they want, they take. What they need, they hunt. Outsiders are viewed as either potential prey, potential threats, or (rarely) potential pack members. The last category requires proving oneself through trials that few non-Korel survive.

### Economy

Subsistence hunting. The Korel have no currency, no markets, no exports. They occasionally trade with Sestran merchants at the edge of their territory—furs and bones for metal tools and weapons—but such exchanges are informal and sporadic.

### Military

Every adult Korel is a hunter and fighter. Their warfare is ambush, pursuit, and overwhelming force at chosen moments. They don't hold territory in a military sense—they simply make occupying it so costly that no one tries.

Organized armies have entered Edari before. None have conquered it. The Korel simply fade into the grassland, strike supply lines, pick off stragglers, and wait for the invaders to starve or retreat.

### Relations

- **Sestros**: Uneasy coexistence. Sestran merchants trade at the border; Sestran settlers die if they cross it.
- **Shyona**: Minimal contact. The Turquish Bay and Coquray Sound provide a water barrier.
- **Others**: Edari is too remote and too dangerous for most powers to care about.

### Player Hooks

- **Crossing the Savannah**: The party needs to reach the northern coast. Do they negotiate with Korel packs, try to sneak through, or find another way?
- **Pack Politics**: A Korel pack is in conflict with neighbors. Outsiders who prove themselves might tip the balance—and earn passage.
- **Wind-Singer Territory**: Someone needs something from deep in Howlwood. The Korel won't go—the wind-singers that live there can kill a hunting party. But outsiders might be desperate or foolish enough to try.
- **Hume Une**: The abandoned Kor colony on the Estri Islands contains records and artifacts untouched for centuries. The Korel consider entering it spiritual contamination. An outsider with a boat could walk right in—if they can get past Korel waters first.
