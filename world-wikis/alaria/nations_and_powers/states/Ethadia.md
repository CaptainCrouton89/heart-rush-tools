## Ethadia

Tags: state, kingdom, shacklands, maritime

The kingdom of clean hands and dirty money. Ethadia occupies the Strymün Isles—a volcanic archipelago in the Gindrik Sea—and has survived for eight centuries by making itself useful to everyone and threatening to no one. Their ships carry Kuzagt salt to markets that would never trade with Bonnetaz directly. Their banks hold deposits from Gorathi merchants and escaped slaves alike. Their diplomats speak every language, follow every custom, and commit to nothing.

This is not neutrality. Neutrality implies principle. Ethadia practices profitable cowardice—and has grown rich doing so.

To the older generation, this is wisdom: survival through accommodation. To the younger generation, increasingly, it is shame.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Aristocratic republic (Crown + Council of Families)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (majority), mixed maritime populations

**Population**: ~70,000 (50,000 in Regina, 15,000 in Sivirine, 5,000 scattered)

**Stability**: Stable but aging (succession concerns)

**Core Values**: Discretion, commerce, neutrality, pragmatism

#### The Crown and the Council

Power in Ethadia divides between two institutions that spend as much energy fighting each other as governing.

**The Crown** is hereditary within the Aldric dynasty, currently worn by **Queen Morvena III** (age 67, ruling for 31 years). The Crown controls the royal fleet, sets harbor fees, conducts foreign policy, and maintains the appearance of unified rule. In practice, the Crown's power extends only as far as its revenue—and the Families control most of the revenue.

**The Council of Families** represents twelve noble houses, each holding their seat by hereditary right. These families own the merchant houses that generate Ethadia's wealth. They set trade policy, control banking, and check every royal initiative that threatens their interests. Conflict between Crown and Council is constant, bitter, and carefully constrained—neither side wants to break the system that enriches both.

The current queen has maintained balance for three decades through a combination of strategic marriages, selective bribery, and the threat of exposing each Family's dirty secrets. She is aging, her designated heir is young, and several Families smell opportunity.

#### The Twelve Families

Each Family specializes in specific aspects of Ethadia's economy:

- **House Valdren**: Primary handlers of Bonnetaz trade; the Family most implicated in slavery-adjacent commerce
- **House Mircalis**: Gorathi connections; timber, hardwoods, and the ugly business of moving cargo Gorath prefers to keep quiet
- **House Petrani**: Banking; rumored to hold deposits from half the criminals in the Gindrik Sea
- **House Thorne**: Fishing and food distribution; least politically ambitious, most practically essential
- **House Corvallo**: Information brokers; they know things, and they sell that knowledge
- **(Seven others)**: Various specializations in shipping, insurance, luxury goods, and services the Crown prefers not to examine closely

#### The Common Population

Ethadian commoners enjoy practical freedoms unusual in the region. The kingdom needs skilled sailors, competent clerks, and reliable workers—oppressing them would be economically foolish. A capable commoner can accumulate wealth, own property, and live comfortably.

They cannot, however, accumulate power. Political voice remains firmly with Crown and Families. Commoners serve; they do not rule. This arrangement has persisted because prosperity makes it tolerable. How long that tolerance would survive economic hardship remains untested.

### Religion & Culture

#### The Religion of Getting Along

Ethadia observes standard Alarian religious practices without distinctive fervor. Temples to major deities operate in both cities. The population is conventionally pious in the way of people who have more pressing concerns.

One exception: mariners throughout the kingdom venerate **Pelagos**, a local spirit or minor deity associated with safe passage. Before every voyage, sailors pour fish blood into the harbor and toss coins into the sea. Whether Pelagos exists, whether these offerings accomplish anything, is a matter of faith. What matters is that the tradition continues.

#### The Ethadian Character

Ethadians are often described as slippery—not dishonest exactly, but resistant to commitment. They speak in qualifications. They hedge their positions. They maintain relationships with parties who despise each other. This is cultural adaptation, not individual failing. In a kingdom that survives by accommodating everyone, rigidity is death.

The older generation prizes discretion above all. What you know matters less than what you *admit* knowing. A successful Ethadian merchant can sit across the table from a Kuzagt bone-worker and a Free Isles abolitionist in the same day without expressing an opinion that would offend either.

The younger generation finds this exhausting. Some have begun speaking more directly—about Bonnetaz's camps, about Gorath's brutality, about Ethadia's profitable complicity. Their elders consider this dangerous idealism. The young consider it basic decency.

#### Generational Tension

The conflict between accommodation and resistance plays out in families across the kingdom. Parents who built careers on discretion watch their children openly question the moral cost of Ethadian prosperity. Children who grew up comfortable wonder why comfort required such compromise.

This tension has not yet produced organized resistance. It has produced awkward dinner conversations, strained relationships, and a growing sense that something must eventually change. What, when, and how violently remain open questions.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium (regionally significant)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Transshipped goods (salt, timber, exotic materials), financial services, information

**Primary Imports**: Food (supplement), luxury goods, skilled labor

#### The Transshipment Trade

Ethadia produces little of unique value. Its wealth comes from moving other peoples' goods:

- Kuzagt salt becomes "Ethadian salt" when shipped under Ethadian flags to markets that won't deal with Bonnetaz
- Gorathi timber becomes "Gindrik lumber" through similar alchemy
- Goods of questionable origin pass through Ethadian warehouses and emerge with clean paperwork

The markup on this rebranding is substantial. Buyers pay premium for not knowing where their purchases originated.

#### Banking

The major Families offer financial services with legendary discretion. Deposits are secure. Loans are available. No one asks where the money came from. This policy has made Ethadia the preferred banking center for the Gindrik Sea region—including clients whose money the Families would rather not examine closely.

#### Information

Ethadian merchants travel everywhere, hear everything, and remember what they hear. This information has value, carefully commodified and sold to interested parties. House Corvallo has built an entire enterprise on knowing things others don't—and knowing who would pay to know them.

#### Neutral Ground

Enemies meet in Ethadian territory to negotiate truces, exchange prisoners, or conduct business impossible elsewhere. Ethadia charges for this service: hosting fees, security guarantees, witness services, and the implicit promise of discretion. Some of history's most significant treaties were negotiated in Regina's back rooms.

### Military

**Size**: Small (deliberately limited)

**Quality**: Moderate (naval focus)

**Enrollment**: Professional only

#### The Defensive Fleet

Ethadia maintains approximately forty naval vessels—enough to discourage casual piracy, insufficient to threaten any major power. The fleet's primary purpose is escort duty: protecting Ethadian merchants from the hazards of the Gindrik Sea.

This limitation is intentional. An armed Ethadia would frighten its neighbors and invite the very conflicts it seeks to avoid. The Families prefer spending money on commerce rather than conquest.

#### Land Forces

Minimal. A small professional guard maintains order in the cities. Beyond that, the population is expected to arm itself if circumstances require—though no one expects circumstances to require it. The Strymün Isles' geography makes invasion difficult, and Ethadia relies on diplomatic relationships rather than walls.

#### The Strategic Reality

Ethadia cannot defend itself against a determined major power. It survives because conquering it would damage trade networks that benefit everyone. If that calculation ever changed—if Gorath decided it wanted the islands, or the Kuzagt decided Ethadia had outlived its usefulness—the kingdom would fall.

The Families know this. They ensure it doesn't happen by remaining indispensable.

### Geography

**Location**: Strymün Isles, Gindrik Sea (Shacklands region)

**Biomes**: Temperate volcanic islands, temperate forest

**Named Regions**: Strymün (main island), the Strymün Isles (satellites)

**Adjacent Waters**: Gindrik Sea

The archipelago consists of one major island and numerous smaller satellites:

**Strymün** (main island): Approximately eighty miles long and forty wide, dominated by twin volcanic peaks—Mount Aldris (dormant) and Mount Brevani (venting steam and occasional ash). The Greenwood covers the mid-slopes; the coasts range from rocky cliffs to protected harbors.

**The Strymün Isles**: A dozen inhabited islets plus countless rocks and shoals, scattered northeast of the main island. Most support small fishing communities.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Regina (~50,000)

**Secondary City**: Sivirine (~15,000)

**Scattered Settlements**: Fishing villages, farming communities (~5,000 total)

#### Regina

The capital sprawls across Strymün's southern harbor—a natural bay so perfect for shipping that the city's founding was inevitable. Regina is commerce made physical: warehouses, counting houses, the Merchant's Exchange, and the Aldric Palace watching over it all. The twelve Family compounds form a ring around the palace, each a small fortress competing in architectural display.

#### Sivirine

The second city faces the open Gindrik from the northwest coast. Where Regina is cosmopolitan and commercial, Sivirine is working-class and resentful. The population traces its ancestry to the original founders; they speak older dialects, observe older customs, and maintain older grudges against the capital. The Fisher's Council holds real power here, not the Crown's appointed governor.

### Relations

**Bonnetaz**: Essential trading partner. House Valdren handles most Kuzagt trade, rebranding salt and bone-goods for markets that won't deal with slavers directly. Both parties profit. Neither discusses what makes the arrangement necessary.

**Gorath**: Careful distance. House Mircalis maintains connections for timber and other goods, but Ethadia avoids deeper entanglement. The Gorathi are too aggressive, too militaristic, and too likely to eventually want the Strymün Isles.

**Tamadrez/Yava**: Regular trade through the neutral port. Ethadian merchants are among Yava's most reliable customers.

**The Free Isles**: Complicated. Some Isles welcome Ethadian trade; others view them as collaborators with slavers. Ethadian merchants tread carefully, emphasizing their own non-participation in slavery while avoiding discussion of where their money comes from.

**Trømgar**: Distant but watching. The dwarven kingdom dislikes anyone who profits from Drasnian suffering. Ethadia has not yet crossed whatever line would provoke action—but the dwarves have long memories.

### History

Ethadia was founded approximately eight centuries ago by refugees from a mainland conflict whose details have been deliberately obscured. The founders established Regina as a trading post, built relationships with the Kuzagt (then a minor power), and gradually accumulated wealth sufficient to buy independence.

The kingdom's history since has been remarkably uneventful by regional standards. No great wars. No dramatic conquests. No existential crises. Just centuries of careful accommodation, profitable neutrality, and the steady accumulation of wealth.

This stability is Ethadia's greatest achievement and its greatest vulnerability. The kingdom has never been tested. When Queen Morvena dies—and she is sixty-seven—the succession may provide that test.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Succession**: Queen Morvena's designated heir is young and untested. Several Families believe they could do better. When the queen dies, the careful balance she maintained may collapse into civil conflict—or worse, outside intervention by powers who prefer a weaker Ethadia.

**The Youth Movement**: Younger Ethadians increasingly reject their parents' accommodation. Some organize secretly, planning to disrupt the slave trade their kingdom enables. Others simply leave, seeking lives less morally compromised. Either trend, if it accelerates, could destabilize the kingdom.

**House Valdren's Secret**: The Family most involved with Bonnetaz trade has recently received unusual requests—and unusual payments. Something is happening in the Kuzagt council, and Valdren knows more than they're sharing.

**The Sivirine Question**: Resentment in the second city has simmered for generations. The current governor maintains peace, but he is a Thorne cousin, not a leader. If Regina's attention wavers during a succession crisis, Sivirine might finally push back.

**Pelagos**: The sailors' spirit has been silent lately. Offerings go unanswered. The superstitious worry something has changed in the Gindrik Sea—something that may require more than fish blood to address.
