## Aldriktch Trade Alliance

Tags: faction

### Overview

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is an agreement between Erasnus, Watar, Myorna, Camaran, Bestacia, and Ubrik that dictates open trade routes between the countries. It sets limits on maximum tariffs for ports and foreign trade, and gives member nations more favorable trading rights.

Currently, the entie alliance is under threat, as tensions between Myorna and its neighbors continue to rise. Allowing Myorna into the trade alliance was only barely permitted (spear headed by phenomenal diplomats from both Myorna, Ubrik, and Bestacia), and now it's causing trouble.

It is also threated by the massive silvertongue outbreak in Ubrik, which has driven half the country into a canabalistic frenzy, terrorizing the nearby countryside. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold the alliance together (it is most profitable for them of all the countries), but it is difficult to hold on.

Camaran has become more isolationist recently as well, which spells trouble, and the Watari and Bestacians relations are getting worse as tension over control of the Telphineas Strait escalates. 

### History

Echea was vetoed by Camaran. Myorna was partially let in because people wanted access to the incredible quanities of silver in those mountains. Bestacian diplomats also hoped that it would deter war.
