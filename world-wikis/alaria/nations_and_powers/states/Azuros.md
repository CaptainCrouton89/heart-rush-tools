## Azuros

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 8,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Discipline, silence, respect, abstinence from pleasure

- Various subsects of the Shogi Monastery practice here in different monk groups. Each is managed by a head monk, who sits on the Council of the Silent Elders which oversees the mountain. All are taught by a mysterious figure known as the Rhea monk.
- Families are raised in simple stone houses built on the side of the mountain. Life is austere, contemplative, and governed by ritual.
- A large percentage of the population have attunements to air, due to the high altitude and powerful winds that constantly sweep the peaks. The monastery encourages this development.
- The order demands full devotion. Those who achieve mastery become something remarkable—able to walk on air, fly, call forth lightning. The greatest monks are legendary figures, spoken of in hushed tones across Alaria.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Air elemental masters (who leave to serve or teach elsewhere)

**Primary Imports**: None

- Azuros is little more than a collection of villages surrounding the monastery. There is almost no economy to speak of—the monks grow what they need and want nothing else.
- The monastery produces nothing for trade. Pilgrims occasionally bring gifts, which are accepted with humility and distributed to those in need.
- The only "export" is the monks themselves. Those who complete their training sometimes leave to serve as teachers, advisors, or guardians elsewhere. Their services are never purchased—they go where they feel called.

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: N/A

**Enrollment**: Forbidden

- The Azuros monks forbid violence. To become involved in a physical altercation is deeply shameful. The monastery has no warriors, no guards, no defenses.
- There is little wealth to steal from Azuros, and so no one bothers trying. The difficulty of reaching the monastery, combined with the absence of anything worth taking, makes it secure through irrelevance.
- That said, the most powerful monks could devastate armies if they chose. They don't choose. The threat is never spoken but universally understood.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Erpeus Island, the highest peaks

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, wind-scoured peaks, high meadows

**Named Entities**: Shogi Monastery, Devil's Crest (southern border)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Mountain streams, snowmelt pools

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (visible from the heights)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Shogi Monastery (no formal capital)

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Azur, Pul, and several unnamed settlements clinging to the mountainsides

### Primary Conflicts

**Isolation and Stagnation**

Traveling to Azuros is like traveling back in time. The monastery interacts so little with the outside world that it has fallen behind technologically and culturally. Some younger monks question whether complete isolation serves the order's true purpose—but questioning itself is discouraged.

**The Rhea Monk**

The mysterious figure who teaches the head monks is ancient, powerful, and increasingly absent. Some say the Rhea monk is dying. Others say they have transcended mortality entirely. The uncertainty creates quiet tension among the Council of Silent Elders.

**The Murder Hills**

The path to Azuros passes through Lier's Murder Hills, where bandits and worse prey on travelers. The monastery officially doesn't acknowledge the problem—violence is forbidden, and the monks won't fight even in self-defense. Pilgrims must fend for themselves.

**The World Encroaches**

Despite centuries of isolation, Azuros cannot remain untouched forever. Wars, magical catastrophes, and political upheavals across the Middle Sea send ripples that eventually reach even the highest peaks. Some monks have begun wondering whether withdrawal from the world is sustainable—or responsible.

### History

The Shogi Monastery was founded in an age before reliable records, by monks seeking a place where the wind blew pure and the world's distractions couldn't reach. They found the peaks of northern Erpeus and began building—simple stone structures that have survived centuries.

The monastery developed its techniques for working with air magic over generations, guided by the Rhea monk whose origins are lost to legend. Students learned to feel the wind as an extension of themselves, to ride the currents, eventually to become one with the element.

The order grew slowly. Those who couldn't commit to its demands left; those who remained became something extraordinary. The most powerful monks achieved abilities that looked like miracles—flight, lightning-calling, storm-speaking. They used these abilities only for contemplation and never for conflict.

Modern Azuros is much as it was centuries ago. The same stone houses. The same rituals. The same devotion to discipline and silence. The outside world has changed beyond recognition; Azuros hasn't changed at all. Whether this is wisdom or blindness depends on who you ask—but the monks don't ask, and don't answer.
