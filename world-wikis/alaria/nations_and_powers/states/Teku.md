## Teku

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council oligarchy (founding families)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Mixed humans (descended from multi-cultural shipwreck survivors)

**Population**: ~8,000 (fluctuates with trade seasons)

**Stability**: Stable (external threats unite the population)

**Core Values**: Survival, adaptation, shark-mastery, community resilience

Teku exists because its founders couldn't leave and their descendants learned not to want to. The city-state occupies Survivor's Island in the heart of the Sea of Sharks—waters so dangerous that normal ships can't cross them. The inhabitants have spent generations developing techniques to survive where nothing should.

The population is remarkably diverse. The founding refugees came from a dozen different cultures; their descendants have blended into something uniquely Tekuan—a people defined not by ancestry but by their relationship with the sharks.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (but essential to regional trade)

**Tech**: Standard, advanced in shark-resistance technology

**Primary Exports**: Safe passage, shark products, salvage goods, navigation services

**Primary Imports**: Metal (for hull reinforcement), food variety, manufactured goods

Teku's economy is built on being the only safe harbor in the Sea of Sharks. Ships that must cross the shark waters—carrying goods between the Shattered Sea and southern regions—stop at Teku and pay whatever the city charges.

The shark-hunting industry provides secondary income: shark hide, teeth, oil, and meat all have value. Salvage from wrecked ships supplements the economy; Teku salvagers are experts at recovering cargo from shark-infested waters.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Exceptional in shark waters

**Enrollment**: Shark-hunters serve as de facto military

Teku has no formal military because it doesn't need one. The Sea of Sharks is the city's defense. Any attacking fleet would have to cross shark-infested waters, losing ships and crews before reaching the island.

The shark-hunters serve as the city's warriors when needed. They're experts at operating in conditions that would kill normal fighters—small boats in dangerous waters, close combat with marine predators, the psychology of survival.

### Geography

**Location**: Survivor's Island, central Sea of Sharks

**Biomes**: Rocky tropical island surrounded by shark-infested waters

**Climate**: Warm, humid, tropical

**Named Features**: Survivor's Island, the Barrier Harbor

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Teku (the only significant settlement on Survivor's Island)

### The Shark Council

Teku is governed by the **Shark Council**—representatives from the twelve founding families who've held power since the city's desperate early days. Council positions pass within families, though demonstrated incompetence can trigger replacement.

The Council manages:
- Harbor fees and trade regulations
- Shark defense maintenance
- Hunter coordination
- Dispute resolution

**Council Head**: **Admiral Kess Ironhull**, elected from among the Council members based on demonstrated shark-killing prowess and administrative competence.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Isolation Question**

Some younger Tekuans wonder if the city should expand—claim more territory, build more ships, become a regional power. Elders argue that Teku's strength is its isolation; trying to be more would risk everything.

**The Metal Shortage**

Teku depends on imported metal for hull reinforcement. The supply chains are vulnerable to disruption from Shattered Sea politics. Finding reliable suppliers is a constant concern.

**The Breeding Grounds**

Why are the sharks in the Sea of Sharks so numerous and aggressive? Some Tekuans want to find the breeding grounds and control the population permanently. Others argue this would destroy the natural defense that keeps Teku safe.

### Notable Figures

**Admiral Kess Ironhull** — Council Head and legendary shark-hunter. She's personally killed more sharks than anyone else alive and maintains her position through continued demonstration of competence.

**Salvage Master Dorek Finch** — Runs the salvage operations that recover cargo from wrecked ships. He knows every wreck site in the Sea of Sharks and has strong opinions about territorial claims.

**Old Coral** — A shark-hunter who survived being swallowed by a massive shark and cut his way out from inside. He's mostly retired now but still trains young hunters.

### History

**The Founding** (~400 years ago): Refugee ships fleeing an unknown war were blown into the Sea of Sharks. Most were destroyed. Survivors established a settlement on the only significant island.

**The Desperate Years**: Early Teku barely survived. Each generation learned from the sharks, developed new techniques, and passed knowledge to the next.

**The Harbor**: Construction of the Barrier Harbor—a protected lagoon with underwater barriers—transformed Teku from survivor camp to functioning city.

**The Present**: Teku at equilibrium—not growing, not declining, simply persisting in a place that should be uninhabitable.
