## Glador

Tags: state, kendrel

The heart of the Kendrel Kingdoms—oldest, largest, and most stubbornly traditional. Glador occupies the central archipelago of the eastern Agreben Sea, a maze of reef-fortresses and coral palaces where the ancient customs of Kendrel society are preserved in amber-like perfection. Here, courtship is war, reputation is currency, and violence remains the one true obscenity.

### Overview

Glador sprawls across roughly 200 miles of the Agreben's eastern waters, from the Flurin border in the north to Pelaria's volcanic reaches in the south. The kingdom encompasses dozens of inhabited islands and reef systems, but its true extent lies beneath the surface—a network of interconnected coral cities housing the largest Kendrel population in existence.

The continental shelf here is broad and shallow, perfect for the cultivated reef architecture that defines Kendrel civilization. Underwater forests of giant kelp alternate with open plains of cultivated coral, while the deep trenches that cut through the shelf provide natural defenses against Bfaspeen incursions. Glador has refined this environment over millennia, shaping it into something halfway between garden and fortress.

Where Flurin compromises with the surface world and Pelaria adapts to volcanic necessity, Glador simply persists. This is Kendrel society as it was meant to be: insular, refined, and utterly convinced of its own superiority.

### Government

**The Abyssal Throne** sits at the heart of Delphran, Glador's capital and the largest Kendrel city anywhere. Unlike Flurin's rotating primacy, Glador practices hereditary monarchy—the **Pearl Crown** passes from parent to chosen heir within the ruling House Delanthos, which has held power for over six hundred years.

The current monarch is **Queen Thessaly Delanthos**, called "the Patient" by admirers and "the Stagnant" by critics. Her reign of ninety-three years has seen no major wars, no significant reforms, and no willingness to acknowledge that the world beyond the Agreben is changing. Thessaly's court operates on traditions codified before humans built their first stone cities, and she sees no reason to update them.

**The Deep Council** serves as advisory body—twelve noble houses that theoretically check royal authority but in practice spend most of their energy competing with each other for favor, marriage alliances, and social position. Council sessions are legendary for their byzantine protocols and devastating understatements.

**The Coral Courts**: Below the central government, Glador divides into seven **Coral Courts**, each governing a cluster of settlements under a hereditary **Reef-Lord**. These courts handle local matters and compete fiercely for prestige, pearl production quotas, and the right to host royal events.

### Culture

Glador is Court Kendrel territory—the iridescent-scaled aristocrats who elevated social manipulation to art form. Pelaendor servants and traders exist in the margins, and Cendoriln handle necessary unpleasantness in the depths, but the Court Kendrel set all standards worth meeting.

**The Courtship Games**: What surfaces dwellers might call politics, Kendrel call courtship. Every interaction is a dance—literal or metaphorical—where participants compete for favor, demonstrate worthiness, and establish social hierarchy. Marriage is merely the most formalized version; the same dynamics govern business negotiations, legal disputes, and diplomatic relations.

**The Three Shames**: Glador society recognizes three cardinal sins:
1. **Vulgarity** (violence, crude speech, unseemly haste)
2. **Gracelessness** (poor aesthetics, clumsy movement, failure to maintain appearances)
3. **Isolation** (refusing to participate in social obligations, hoarding connections, breaking the web)

The punishments are social rather than physical: exclusion from events, withdrawal of favor, subtle signals that mark someone as *beneath notice*. For Kendrel, who live centuries and build their entire existence around social standing, this is worse than death.

**Pearl Culture**: Glador produces the finest pearls in the known world—not merely through better oyster beds (though they have those) but through generations of cultivation technique and jealously guarded trade secrets. A Glador pearl is a status symbol among surface aristocracies from Adron to Ve. The kingdom controls supply with ruthless precision, maintaining scarcity and mystique.

**The Silence on Violence**: Glador doesn't have prisons, executions, or soldiers in any form surface dwellers would recognize. Criminals face social exile—their names added to the **Tide of Shame**, their presence unwelcome everywhere, their descendants marked for generations. For offenses too severe for exile, there are the Cendoriln, and no one asks what happens in the deep trenches.

### Economy

**Primary Exports**: Pearls (the finest anywhere), coral jewelry and art objects, preserved delicacies, trained marine creatures, and **memory coral**—a living material that can be shaped and will hold its form indefinitely, used in architecture and art throughout the Greenwater Isles.

**Primary Imports**: Metals (always metals), surface textiles for the small above-water populations, exotic foods, and intelligence about the wider world. Glador affects disinterest in surface affairs while paying handsomely for information about them.

**The Pearl Monopoly**: Glador's wealth derives from controlling the pearl trade. They don't merely produce pearls—they control the *idea* of pearls. Cheaper alternatives from other sources are dismissed as inferior (sometimes correctly). Forgeries are identified with uncanny accuracy and their sources ruthlessly excluded from Kendrel markets. The seven Coral Courts each have pearl production quotas, and exceeding or falling short both carry consequences.

**Trade with the Surface**: Glador conducts minimal direct trade with surface nations, preferring to work through Flurin intermediaries. This maintains their mystique and allows them to pretend they don't care about surface wealth. They care very much. They just won't admit it.

### Military

Glador maintains the **Coral Guard**—a formal military structure that, by Kendrel standards, constitutes a significant armed force. The Guard's primary mission is defense against Bfaspeen incursions, a task they've performed with mixed success for centuries.

**The Trench Wardens**: Elite fighters stationed at the deep passages where Bfaspeen broods are most likely to attack. These Cendoriln warriors are the closest thing Glador has to professional soldiers, though they're officially classified as "specialized custodians" to preserve the fiction that Kendrel don't do violence.

**The Defensive Theology**: Glador's approach to the Bfaspeen problem is fundamentally defensive. They've fortified the reef-cities, established early warning networks, and cultivated the trenches to channel attacks into kill zones. What they haven't done is take the fight to the brood mothers. Offensive warfare would require admitting that Kendrel society needs warriors, and that's ideologically unacceptable.

**The Flurin Dependency**: When Bfaspeen raids threaten Flurin, Glador sends the Coral Guard. When raids threaten Glador, they handle it themselves. This asymmetry breeds resentment in Flurin and quiet satisfaction in Glador—proof, they believe, of which kingdom truly matters.

### Relations

**Flurin**: Condescending tolerance. Glador views Flurin as a necessary embarrassment—useful for dealing with surfaces dwellers so Glador doesn't have to, but culturally degraded by the contact. Flurin's Merchant Assembly particularly offends; allowing non-nobles (and worse, non-Kendrel) formal political standing violates everything Glador believes about proper society.

**Pelaria**: Complicated respect. The volcanic kingdom's willingness to embrace violence troubles Glador's traditionalists, but their effectiveness against Bfaspeen raids commands grudging admiration. House Delanthos maintains careful diplomatic ties with Pelaria's ruling family, aware that open conflict between the kingdoms would be catastrophic.

**The Surface World**: Officially, Glador affects supreme indifference to surface affairs. Unofficially, they're deeply concerned about changes they don't understand—new nations rising, old powers falling, technologies and magics that might eventually threaten Kendrel isolation. The Deep Council debates whether to engage more actively with the surface world or retreat further into insularity. Queen Thessaly has, characteristically, decided nothing.

**The Bfaspeen**: Eternal enemy, permanent threat, useful boogeyman. The brood mothers have raided Kendrel waters since before recorded history. Glador has never attempted to negotiate, never considered offensive war, and never seriously contemplated that the threat might someday be eliminated. Some cynics suggest the nobility finds the Bfaspeen useful—an external enemy that justifies the Guard, unifies the courts, and provides convenient explanation for any economic difficulties.

### Settlements

**Delphran** (capital): The Abyssal Throne's seat, largest Kendrel city anywhere. A vertical complex descending from surface islands through five distinct depth-layers, each with its own character and social standing. Population ~25,000 Kendrel. Surface visitors are permitted only in the upper tier, and only with proper introductions.

**Aquicada**: Northern gateway town, handling most traffic with Flurin. More relaxed standards than the interior—out of necessity rather than choice.

**Telune**: Small fishing village in the northern waters, notable for its **Oracle Pools**—natural formations where bioluminescent creatures create patterns that some Kendrel interpret as prophetic.

**Liculvia**: Eastern settlement, closest to Atriik's coast. Maintains the pretense that Glador doesn't deal directly with surface nations while quietly handling exactly that.

**Thautias**: Central town, famous for its memory coral cultivation and the artisans who shape it into impossibly delicate works.

**Caecadis**: Southern border town, traditionally the site where Glador and Pelaria resolve disputes through competitive courtship displays rather than negotiation.

**Neptusia**: Deep-water village, Cendoriln-dominated, handling the kingdom's less mentionable necessities.

### Player Hooks

- A surface noble has mortally offended a Glador house. They need someone to navigate Kendrel social customs and somehow repair the damage—without violence, which would make everything worse.
- Something is organizing the local Bfaspeen into coordinated attacks. Glador's Trench Wardens need outside help to investigate the deep trenches where Kendrel forces cannot easily go.
- A priceless pearl has been stolen from House Delanthos. The thief must be identified and the pearl recovered, but the investigation must be conducted without anyone learning a theft occurred—the shame would be devastating.
- Queen Thessaly is finally dying after a century on the throne. The succession is contested, and outsiders might tip the balance—if they can figure out which side to support and how to help without visibly helping.
