## Deo Esari

Tags: state, elves, confederation, titans, hand-magic

The mountain kingdom. Deo Esari occupies the Kelder Mountains along the eastern edge of the Farlands—a vertical realm of peaks, passes, and the bones of ancient titans. Of the three elven kingdoms, Deo Esari is the smallest in population, the most isolated in geography, and the most sacred in purpose. They are the keepers of the titan dead.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic council (Titanic Priesthood)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Elves

**Population**: ~80,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:
- Sacred duty to the titan remains
- Preservation of ritual knowledge
- Isolation from corrupting outside influences
- Patient observation over hasty action

Deo Esari is governed by the **Titanic Priesthood**—a council of ritual specialists who have dedicated their lives to the proper handling of titan remains. The High Priest serves as head of state, but decisions are made collectively. Secular matters are delegated to appointed administrators; anything touching the bones requires priestly consensus.

The priesthood is not hereditary. Candidates are identified in childhood through aptitude testing, then trained for decades before receiving their first tattoo. The hand-magic traditions of Deo Esari are restricted entirely to the priesthood—no lay elf may bear titan-bone markings.

### The Titan Bones

The Kelder Mountains are a graveyard. During the God War, titans fell here in numbers—some killed by dragons, some by other titans, some by weapons or forces that left no survivors to record them. Their bones remain, buried in the peaks, exposed by erosion, scattered through valleys.

Deo Esari exists to tend these remains.

**The Sacred Monopoly**

Approximately 95% of all titan bone in the world comes from the Kelder Mountains. The Deo Esari do not sell it. They do not trade it. Titan bone is sacred material, and its distribution is controlled absolutely:

- Bones are harvested through elaborate ritual by designated priesthood teams
- Processed bone is used for religious ceremonies within the confederation
- Small amounts are provided to Lenora and Illron for their own sacred purposes
- Nothing—ever—leaves the three kingdoms legitimately

**Defectors**

The only way titan bone reaches the outside world is through defection. Occasionally, an elf (usually not a priest, but someone with access to processed materials) steals what they can carry and flees east over the mountains into Rakite territory, or south into Wycendeula.

These defectors are criminals of the highest order. Their names are struck from all records. Their families disown them publicly. They are considered spiritually dead—worse than the Grieving of Imyena Edhil, who at least remain within the community of elves.

The defectors don't care. A single titan-bone blade can purchase a lordship in the human kingdoms. A pouch of processed bone powder is worth more than most merchants see in a lifetime. The temptation is immense.

Defections are rare—perhaps one or two per decade—but they are the entire source of the world's titan-bone supply outside the elven lands. Deo Esari's priests hunt defectors relentlessly, but the mountains are vast and the eastern passes are many.

### The Southern Disaster

Two centuries ago, the southern harvesting grounds were abandoned.

The hills below the main Kelder range—Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—were once productive territory. Villages supported the harvesting operations. Generations of priests worked these sites.

Then the contamination spread.

**What Happened**

Titan bones are not uniformly safe. Most are inert—ancient material, chemically strange but not actively dangerous. But some titans died badly. Some were killed by forces that left traces. Some carried things in their marrow that survived their deaths.

The southern sites hit a bad vein. The specific nature of the contamination is recorded only in sealed priesthood archives, but the effects were unmistakable: harvesters who handled certain bones began showing symptoms within weeks. Wasting sickness. Skin discoloration. Children born wrong—or not born at all. The contamination spread through families, then through villages.

The priesthood ordered evacuation. Anyone who had worked the southern sites, anyone who had lived in the affected villages, anyone who had prolonged contact with those who had—all were relocated to quarantine settlements in the high mountains. Most died within a generation. The contamination burned through them.

**The Abandoned Lands**

The villages still stand. Ot'Pelyon and Mosimor in Tomgryir Eror. Novranas, Salenial, and Myrth in Eshbya Hills. Sarki Tulo in Kirthdron Soytas. Empty now, but intact. Clothes in wardrobes. Tools in workshops. Everyone simply left.

No one goes there anymore. The priesthood maintains warning markers at every approach. The contamination may have faded by now—or it may be waiting. No one is willing to test it.

**Economic Impact**

The southern disaster cut Deo Esari's harvesting capacity by roughly 40%. Remaining sites in the northern Kelder are worked more intensively, but total output has never recovered. This has driven titan-bone prices worldwide to unprecedented heights—which, ironically, makes defection more tempting than ever.

The priesthood's response to this pressure has been to become more insular, more secretive, more suspicious of outsiders. The disaster proved that carelessness with sacred materials brings catastrophe. They will not repeat the mistake.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (extremely advanced in ritual crafts)

**Primary Exports**: Nothing to outsiders. Limited ritual objects to confederation partners.

**Primary Imports**: Food (from Lenora), textiles, tools, anything that cannot be produced in mountain territory

Deo Esari cannot feed itself. The mountains grow little. Nearly all food comes from Lenora in exchange for titan-bone ritual objects—a dependency the priesthood accepts as the cost of their sacred duty.

The kingdom's internal economy centers on the harvesting operations: miners, porters, craftspeople who process raw bone into usable materials, artisans who create the final ritual objects. Everyone serves the bones, directly or indirectly.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: High (enhanced by hand-magic)

**Enrollment**: Mandatory service for non-priests

Deo Esari's military is small but enhanced. Every soldier bears at least basic protective tattoos—not the full priest markings, but enough to provide resistance to common threats. The priesthood guards its monopoly on advanced hand-magic, but defensive applications are shared for the kingdom's protection.

The mountain terrain provides most of their defense. Invasion through the Kelder passes would be suicidal. Deo Esari's soldiers exist mainly to guard the harvesting sites and pursue defectors.

### Geography

**Location**: Kelder Mountains, eastern Farlands

**Biomes**: Alpine, high mountain, some sheltered valleys

**Major Geographic Features**:
- **Kelder Mountains**: The entire bracket-shaped range along the Farlands' eastern edge. Titan bones throughout.
- **Mathavia Mountains**: Southern extension of the range, including some contaminated zones
- **The Abandoned Lands**: Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—off-limits since the disaster

**Rivers**:
- **Ver Pyur**: Flows from Isyherius southward
- Various mountain streams feeding into the lowland rivers

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Thillesari (in the central Kelder range)

**Major Cities** (north to south):
- **Isyherius**: Northernmost city, source of the Ver Pyur
- **Mysaneas**: Secondary administrative center
- **Leleth Serine**: Major harvesting hub
- **Ryhaneas**: Eastern slopes
- **Eyslon**: Central range
- **Iyathelneor**: Southern range (above the contaminated zone)
- **Ulfe Alari**: Southernmost active settlement

Deo Esari has cities and towns but relatively few villages. The population is concentrated—mountain living doesn't support scattered agriculture. Settlements are built near harvesting sites or along the passes that connect them.

### Relations

**Lenora**: Necessary but cool. Deo Esari needs Lenora's food; Lenora receives titan-bone ritual objects in exchange. Neither side particularly likes the other. Lenora's agricultural ambition feels vulgar to the priesthood. Deo Esari's secretiveness frustrates Lenoran merchants.

**Illron**: Warm. Both kingdoms prioritize tradition and view Lenora's growth-focused culture with suspicion. Deo Esari's disaster has only reinforced their conservatism, which aligns them further with Illron's ancient-pact philosophy.

**The Outside World**: Hostility. Outsiders are forbidden from entering Deo Esari. The eastern passes are guarded. Ships cannot approach—there is no coast. Any non-elf found within the kingdom's borders is detained, questioned, and expelled (if lucky) or imprisoned (if suspected of seeking bones).

### Primary Conflicts

- **Defection**: The ongoing leak of titan bone to the outside world. Every defector strengthens foreign powers and weakens the sacred monopoly.
- **The Contaminated Lands**: Should anyone attempt to reclaim the southern sites? The priesthood says no. Some younger elves point out that the bones there are incredibly valuable and may have been safe for decades.
- **Food Dependency**: Reliance on Lenora is uncomfortable. Some priests advocate for stricter rationing to reduce imports; others argue this would weaken the population.

### History

The elves who became Deo Esari discovered the titan bones shortly after arriving in the Farlands. They recognized what they had found: remnants of beings from before the current age, material of immense power and danger.

The priesthood formed organically—those who learned to handle the bones safely teaching those who came after. Over generations, the casual mining operations became ritualized, then sacred. By the time of the Three Kingdoms Treaty, Deo Esari was already the defined keeper of the titan dead.

The southern disaster, 200 years ago, is the defining event of recent history. It validated every conservative instinct, every warning about carelessness, every ritual restriction. The priesthood that emerged from the crisis is more cautious, more secretive, and more certain of its purpose than ever before.

### Hand-Magic (Titanic Tattoos)

The priests of Deo Esari practice **hand-magic**—a form of permanent body modification using processed titan bone. Tattoos inscribed with titan-bone ink grant various abilities depending on the pattern and placement:

- Protective wards against physical harm
- Enhanced strength or endurance
- Resistance to magical effects
- Sensory improvements
- More esoteric effects known only to senior priests

The process is painful, permanent, and sacred. Only Titanic Priests may receive full marking. The secrets of inscription are guarded absolutely—no outsider has ever learned the techniques, and defectors who flee with bone material cannot replicate the magic.

A fully marked priest bears dozens of tattoos accumulated over centuries. They are walking arsenals of subtle power. But they do not flaunt this—the marks are usually covered, revealed only when necessary.
