## Mkinti

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchy (formerly five houses, now one)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ohblex (Gem Gnomes)

**Population**: 25,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Secrecy, scheming, craftsmanship, family loyalty

- Until recently, Mkinti was controlled by five major gnome houses locked in endless political games—alliances, betrayals, marriages, assassinations. Then four of the five house heads died in quick succession. Now only House Wizzik remains.
- The Ohblex are crystalline gnomes born from the gems of the Gemstone Peaks. Their skin reflects precious stone colors, and they sustain themselves by consuming gems rather than food.
- They are the sole keepers of clockmaking secrets on Alaria, crafting incredible mechanical devices and jewelry that fetch astronomical prices abroad.
- The gnomes live in elaborate underground mazes filled with mechanical traps, their cities expanding ever deeper into the mountains. They value secrecy, mystery, and complication above all else.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Clockwork devices, jewelry, gems, mechanical components

**Primary Imports**: Food (for non-Ohblex residents), metals, raw materials

- Mkinti's clockwork is unmatched. No one else on Alaria has cracked the secrets of precise mechanical timekeeping, and the Ohblex intend to keep it that way.
- Gem trade is tightly controlled. The Ohblex consume gems as sustenance, which gives them intimate knowledge of every stone's quality and magical properties—making them impossible to deceive in gem trades.
- The economy runs on schemes. Every transaction has hidden layers, every contract contains clauses within clauses. Outsiders who try to do business in Mkinti without gnomish advisors invariably get fleeced.
- The recent political upheaval has disrupted trade. House Wizzik controls everything now, but the transition has been chaotic.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (house guards)

- The Ohblex don't maintain a traditional army. Each house maintained its own guards, and now those guards serve whoever pays them—mostly House Wizzik.
- The real defense is the terrain. The Gemstone Peaks are treacherous, the underground cities are mazes, and every corridor is trapped. Invading Mkinti would be a nightmare.
- The gnomes prefer assassination and sabotage to open warfare. Why fight battles when you can remove problems quietly?

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Erpeus Island, in the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Mountains, underground caverns, gem-veined tunnels

**Named Entities**: Gemstone Peaks, Bejeweled Palace

**Rivers & Lakes**: Underground rivers and pools

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Wizzik (formerly shared among the five house seats)

**Cities**: Wizzik, Zunuki

**Towns**: Uzikni, Elfekin, Tiknurtir

**Villages**: Numerous small settlements in the mountains and underground

### Primary Conflicts

**The Succession Crisis**

Four house heads are dead. House Wizzik claims they had nothing to do with it—and perhaps they didn't. Someone orchestrated the assassinations, and no one knows who or why. The surviving Wizzik leadership is consolidating power rapidly, but the other houses' remnants are scheming in the shadows. Civil war seems inevitable unless Wizzik can establish legitimacy fast.

**The Bejeweled Palace**

The cursed palace of an ancient Mkinti king sits abandoned in the mountains, its treasury legendary and its dangers worse. Gnomes don't dare approach it—too many have tried and never returned. But with the political chaos, some desperate factions are considering whether the palace's treasures might be worth the risk.

**The Clockwork Monopoly**

Other nations would pay anything to learn Ohblex clockmaking secrets. Spies infiltrate constantly. The gnomes have responded with increasingly elaborate counter-intelligence operations, but the pressure never stops. If the secrets ever leaked, Mkinti's economic dominance would collapse.

**Relations with Neighbors**

Mkinti shares Erpeus with Lier and Azuros, neither of which the Ohblex particularly like. Lier's humans are too straightforward, Azuros's monks are too honest. The gnomes trade with both while scheming against both, as is their nature.

### History

The Ohblex emerged from the Gemstone Peaks in an age before human records, born from the gems themselves through processes the gnomes don't discuss with outsiders. They discovered their clockwork aptitude early and realized its value—and its danger if shared.

For centuries, the five great houses competed for dominance through intricate political games. Wars were rare; assassinations were common but carefully targeted. The system was stable in its instability, each house checking the others' ambitions.

Then someone broke the rules. Four house heads died within a single month—poison, accidents, mysterious disappearances. The survivors pointed fingers at each other, then at House Wizzik, then at unknown outside forces. No one proved anything.

House Wizzik moved fastest, seizing control of the shared institutions while other houses scrambled to choose new leadership. Now they rule Mkinti alone, but their grip is tenuous. The old game of five has become a game of one against many, and the many are regrouping in the shadows.
