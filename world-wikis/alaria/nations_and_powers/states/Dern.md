## Dern

Links: States

The middle child of the Widebarrow mountain states, Dern occupies the central peaks between Thorum's northern strongholds and Mez's nightmare warrens below. It is a kingdom defined by siege—not the dramatic, banner-waving kind, but the grinding, generational kind. The Lyzine have been coming up from below for centuries. The Dernish have been pushing them back down for just as long. Neither side wins. Neither side stops.

Dern's people are hard in the way that survivors of endless war become hard: practical, suspicious of outsiders, and utterly unsentimental about violence. They don't hate the Lyzine the way softer peoples might hate an enemy. Hatred requires energy. The Dernish simply kill Lyzine the way farmers kill rats—methodically, without passion, because the alternative is being overrun. This grim pragmatism extends to everything. A Dernish proverb: "Hope is for those who've never lost a child to the deep."

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary Monarchy (War Council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (Dernish)

**Population**: 35,000

**Stability**: Somewhat Stable

**Core Values**: Vigilance, sacrifice, duty, silence

- The Crown of Dern passes through the royal bloodline, but true power lies with the War Council—seven commanders who control the nation's defenses. The current king, Aldric IV, is twelve years old. The Council rules in his name and has done so since his father died in a Lyzine raid three years ago.
- Every Dernish family owes "deep-debt"—mandatory service in the tunnel watches. One adult from each household must serve two years in five, patrolling the sealed passages and ancient mines where the Lyzine breach attempts occur. The duty is dreaded but unavoidable; those who flee are hanged, and their families inherit double debt.
- Silence is a cultural virtue. The Dernish speak quietly, value restraint, and distrust the demonstrative. This stems from practical necessity—sound carries in tunnels, and a loud voice can draw Lyzine scouts—but has become ingrained in the national character. Visitors find the Dernish disconcertingly quiet, interpreting calm as coldness.
- The dead are cremated immediately. No exceptions. Bodies left too long can be... used by things from below. This extends to battlefield protocol: Dernish soldiers carry fire kits and prioritize burning fallen comrades over recovering weapons.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Iron, copper, silver, worked metal goods

**Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, timber, alchemical supplies

- The Widebarrow Mountains hold rich veins of iron, copper, and silver that would make any nation wealthy—if mining weren't a death sentence. Dern's mines operate under military escort, with tunnel watches stationed at every shaft. Production is steady but costly in lives.
- Dernish metalwork is prized across Ve. Necessity breeds skill: their weapons are designed for close-quarters tunnel fighting, their armor optimized for protection against Lyzine venom and web. The famous "Dern-forged" blades fetch premium prices in Shyona and Avalon.
- Food is Dern's constant need. The mountain valleys produce some grain and the slopes support sheep, but it's never enough. Dern trades metal for Avalon's surplus grain, and this dependency shapes their foreign policy. They cannot afford to anger their breadbasket.
- A peculiar trade exists with Mez itself: Lyzine silk, harvested from abandoned webs or slain raiders, is worth more than silver by weight. Dernish "silk-hunters" venture into cleared tunnels to collect it—dangerous work, but profitable enough that some make a career of it.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Universal (with deep-debt rotation)

**The Tunnel Watch**: Dern's primary defensive force, numbering roughly 4,000 at any time. Tunnel Watchers are experts in subterranean warfare—they know which echoes mean danger, which passages flood seasonally, and how to fight in spaces where you can't swing a sword. Their distinctive short-hafted axes and heavy crossbows are designed for cramped combat.

**The Surface Guard**: A smaller force of 1,500 that patrols the mountain passes and protects the settlements. Less celebrated than the Tunnel Watch, but essential—the Lyzine occasionally emerge on the surface in force, and someone must meet them.

**The Sealers**: An elite corps of 200 specialists who close breached tunnels. They work with explosives, shaped stone, and a brutal willingness to collapse passages on themselves if necessary. Sealer mortality is horrific. Sealer volunteers are never lacking.

- Dern's military doctrine is purely defensive. They don't invade Mez; they can't. The tunnels below are the Lyzine's domain, and venturing deep means fighting on enemy ground against creatures perfectly adapted to darkness. Instead, Dern holds the line, seals breaches, and endures.
- Every settlement maintains "last-stand" protocols—designated fortified buildings, stockpiled weapons, and memorized evacuation routes. Children learn the drill before they learn to read.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Widebarrow Mountains, bordered by Thorum (north), Mez (below and southwest), Avalon (northwest), Shyona (northeast), and the Suki Jungle (south)

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, highland valleys, subterranean passages

**Named Entities**: Central Widebarrow Range, Promisewood (border forest with Avalon)

**Rivers & Lakes**: None named (small mountain streams)

**Adjacent Waters**: None (landlocked)

- The Central Widebarrow is less dramatic than Thorum's Steadfast peaks but more extensive—a broad band of rugged highlands that stretches from the Avalon border to the Shyonan frontier.
- Below the surface, the mountain is honeycombed with natural caves, ancient mines, and Lyzine-carved tunnels. Maps exist, but they're never complete—the Lyzine dig constantly, and new passages appear faster than the Watch can chart them.
- The Promisewood, on the northwest border, is Dern's gentlest region—a forested slope that descends toward Avalon. Timber from the Promisewood is essential for mine supports and construction. The forest is named for the marriage pacts it witnessed when Dern and Avalon's royal houses allied three centuries ago.
- The Boneswamps lie to the south, technically in Chimean territory but close enough to stain Dern's border. Ancient wars between Dern and Chimea filled those waters with corpses; now they walk again. Dernish patrols avoid the southern marches.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Dodi
**Cities**: None
**Towns**: Foster
**Villages**: Lush

**Dodi** — The capital clings to a defensive valley in the central mountains, built around the entrance to the oldest Dernish mines. Perhaps 15,000 people live here, making it by far the largest settlement. The city is constructed in concentric rings: the outermost residential districts can be abandoned and sealed if Lyzine break through; the inner fortress holds the palace, the armories, and the deepest food stores. Dodi has never fallen. The Dernish intend to keep it that way.

The Royal Forge operates here—the premier metalworking facility in Ve, where the finest Dern-forged weapons are made. Master smiths guard techniques passed down for generations. The forge's output is split between military needs and export revenue; balancing these demands is a constant political tension.

**Foster** — A fortified town on the northeastern border where Dern meets Shyona. Foster guards the only reliable pass between the two nations—a fact that gives it strategic importance far exceeding its size. The town's 3,000 residents are a mix of Dernish soldiers, merchants handling cross-border trade, and Shyonan observers who maintain a permanent "diplomatic presence" that everyone understands is espionage. Relations are polite but tense; neither side fully trusts the other, but both prefer the devil they know to the Lyzine below.

Foster's commander, Marshal Brynn Kolste, has held the post for twenty years. She's outlasted three kings and two wars, and her relationship with her Shyonan counterpart is said to be the true guarantor of the border's peace.

**Lush** — A small village of perhaps 800 souls, tucked into an interior valley that sees the most sun in all of Dern. The name is aspirational—Lush is merely less bleak than its neighbors. The village exists to farm the valley's modest fields and tend the sheep that graze the upper slopes. It's the closest Dern comes to a peaceful settlement: far from the major tunnel systems, too poor to raid, forgotten by history. Families who've served their deep-debt sometimes retire here, seeking quiet after years of darkness below.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Mez and the Lyzine**: The eternal war. Every generation thinks it might end; none have been right. The Lyzine want the surface—"their rightful place," as they see it. The Dernish want to survive. No negotiation is possible; the Lyzine don't recognize lesser species as worthy of treaties.
- **The Regency Question**: King Aldric IV is twelve. The War Council rules. Some councilors genuinely intend to surrender power when he comes of age; others have grown comfortable with authority. As Aldric grows older, this tension will break one way or another.
- **Chimean Border**: The Boneswamps and the old wars are not forgotten. Chimea claims territory Dern considers its own; Dern fortifies passes Chimea considers theirs. The conflict is frozen, not resolved—both nations have more pressing enemies, but the grudge remains.
- **Economic Dependency**: Dern needs Avalon's grain. This gives Avalon leverage that sophisticated diplomats increasingly exploit. The current trade agreements favor Avalon heavily; renegotiating them without losing food supply is a delicate problem.

### History

Dern was founded as a mining colony roughly 600 years ago, when prospectors from the lowlands discovered silver in the central Widebarrow. For two centuries, it prospered unremarkably. Then the Lyzine came.

The First Breach (approximately 380 years ago) was catastrophic. An entire mining settlement—nearly 2,000 people—vanished overnight. The survivors who escaped spoke of spider-things from below, of webs that clogged the tunnels, of beautiful, terrible voices demanding surrender. The lowland kingdoms sent armies; the armies died in the dark. Within a decade, Dern's population had halved, and the remaining survivors had learned the first harsh lessons of subterranean warfare.

The next three centuries forged modern Dern. A military monarchy emerged, built around the imperative of defense. The tunnel watches organized. The sealers developed their grim art. Dern stopped trying to exterminate the Lyzine—an impossible goal—and focused on containment. The Lyzine, for their part, never stopped trying to break through, but their efforts became raids rather than conquests.

The War of Bone (approximately 200 years ago) saw Dern's bloodiest conflict with Chimea, fought over mountain passes and mining rights. Both nations exhausted themselves; the Boneswamps are the war's lasting monument. The Treaty of Ash ended formal hostilities, but the dead in those swamps ensure neither side truly forgives.

Today, Dern endures. The Lyzine press harder in some years than others—the pattern seems random, though some scholars suggest it correlates with the spider queens' breeding cycles. The regency holds. The mines produce. The Tunnel Watch keeps vigil. And every night, somewhere in the mountains, something scratches at a sealed door from the other side.

### Hooks

- **The Child King**: Aldric IV is approaching the age where he might assert authority. He's been raised by warriors but advised by politicians. What kind of ruler will he become? Players who gain his trust could shape Dern's future.
- **The Deep Breach**: A new tunnel has been discovered—not Lyzine-dug, but ancient, predating human settlement. It goes deeper than any known passage. The Tunnel Watch is organizing an expedition. They're hiring.
- **Silk Hunters**: The reward for Lyzine silk has increased sharply. Chimean buyers are paying triple rates, no questions asked. Why do they want it? What are they making?
- **The Promisewood Marriage**: An Avalonian noble seeks a Dernish bride to seal a trade agreement. The Dernish princess in question would rather fight Lyzine than marry a soft lowlander. Complications ensue.
- **Boneswamp Stirring**: The dead in the southern marches are more active than usual. Some are wearing Dernish armor from the War of Bone. Others are wearing armor no one recognizes at all.
