## Jeh Bli

Tags: state, citystate, orc, farlands

The only city in the northern Farlands—an orc settlement on the shores of Lake Kro Nymos, five hundred miles from the nearest civilization. The Xi'ivrach who live here are among the strangest orcs in the known world: stone-weighted, scar-covered, and utterly devoted to gods that might actually answer.

### Overview

Jeh Bli is less a city than a sprawling religious complex that happens to house twelve thousand people. Stone towers rise from the lakeshore, their bases submerged, their tops hung with offerings. Bridges of carved basalt connect platform neighborhoods built on artificial islands. Everything is heavy, deliberate, built to endure—and built to sink, eventually, into the sacred waters below.

The Xi'ivrach came here centuries ago, following visions that promised a place where the gods would be close. They found Kro Nymos and its central island, *Ghural-Kro*, where something answered their prayers. What exactly it is, the Xi'ivrach don't say—perhaps they don't know. But their priests speak in Deoric, the language of truth, and their prayers produce results. That's enough for them.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic oligarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Xi'ivrach orcs

**Population**: ~12,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

The city is ruled by the **Keth-Vorun**, the "Bearers of Weight"—seven high priests who have survived the trials of ascending to the highest ranks of their faith. Each wears ceremonial stone armor weighing hundreds of pounds, which they never remove. They sleep in it, eat in it, conduct all business in it. The weight is their proof of devotion.

Decisions are made by consensus among the Keth-Vorun, with the eldest serving as tiebreaker. In practice, most governance is handled by lower-ranking priests; the Keth-Vorun concern themselves primarily with religious matters and interpreting the will of the gods.

**Core Values**:

- Devotion expressed through burden—the more you carry, the closer you are to the divine
- Scars as sacred text, earned through trials of pain and endurance
- The lake provides; the lake is owed

### The Faith

The Xi'ivrach worship what they call *Keth-Ghural*, "the Weight Beneath"—a divine presence they believe resides in or beneath Lake Kro Nymos. They don't personify it with faces or stories. It simply is: vast, patient, hungry for devotion.

Worship takes the form of burden. Children begin wearing stone beads at age three. By adulthood, a devout Xi'ivrach carries fifty pounds of sacred stone at all times—jewelry, clothing, woven stone cord in their hair. The priests carry more. The Keth-Vorun carry weights that would crush an ordinary orc.

The scarification is equally important. Every significant moment in a Xi'ivrach's life is marked on their skin—births, deaths, victories, failures, visions, answered prayers. The scars are raised with ash rubbed into the wounds, creating ridged patterns that cover most of their bodies by middle age. Reading someone's scars is an intimate act; lying about what your scars mean is the closest thing the Xi'ivrach have to blasphemy.

### Deoric Magic

The high priests of Jeh Bli have mastered fragments of Deoric, the language of truth that underlies reality itself. Speaking Deoric is enormously difficult—most mortals cannot form the sounds at all—but the Xi'ivrach have spent generations training their mouths and throats to approximate it.

When a priest speaks a Deoric word, reality pays attention. The language doesn't grant wishes; it describes what is true, and the universe adjusts. A priest who can say "healed" in Deoric doesn't cast a healing spell—they state a fact that wasn't true until they said it.

This power is limited. No one in Jeh Bli speaks more than a handful of Deoric words, and each one requires years of training. But even a few words of truth in a world of lies gives the Xi'ivrach an advantage that's kept them safe in their isolation for centuries.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**:
- Carved stone (religious objects, weapons, architectural elements)
- Deoric blessings (extremely expensive, rarely offered to outsiders)
- Ridgeback hides (from mountain hunts)
- Preserved fish (*kro-zheth* oil is valuable as fuel and waterproofing)

**Primary Imports**:
- Metal (they have almost none locally)
- Textiles (stone doesn't replace all clothing)
- Medicines (the lake provides food, not pharmacology)
- Occasional luxury goods for the temples

The Xi'ivrach are largely self-sufficient. The lake provides fish, the Butterfly Forest provides game and timber (during careful daytime expeditions), and the mountain streams provide water. What they can't produce, they trade for—primarily with merchants brave or foolish enough to make the five-hundred-mile journey from Lenora.

Trade caravans arrive perhaps twice a year. The Xi'ivrach pay in carved stone, which is valued by elven collectors for its alien aesthetics, and occasionally in blessings—a Deoric word spoken over a newborn, a sacred scar cut into a merchant's flesh to ward off misfortune. These services are expensive. They're also genuine.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (but all adults are trained)

Every Xi'ivrach learns to fight. The weight training that begins in childhood produces warriors of tremendous strength and endurance. A Xi'ivrach soldier can march in stone armor that would exhaust a human in minutes. Their weapons are stone-headed—axes, hammers, maces—and they hit harder than metal in Xi'ivrach hands.

The city maintains no standing army; it doesn't need one. No enemy has ever reached Jeh Bli. The wilderness filters out anyone who isn't determined enough to cross it, and anyone that determined is either trading or dying in the Butterfly Forest overnight.

The priests are the elite. Those who've mastered even one Deoric word are walking weapons—capable of stating "broken" or "stopped" or "dead" and having it be true. The Keth-Vorun could end most battles before they begin. They've never had to.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Farlands, shore of Lake Kro Nymos

**Biomes**: Mountain valley, lake shore, forest edge

**Named Entities**:
- *Ghural-Kro* (the island) — sacred, forbidden
- *Kro Gheth* (the north shore) — sacred ground for shamanic rites
- The Sunset Mountains — western boundary, hunting grounds
- The Butterfly Forest — eastern boundary, dangerous

**Rivers & Lakes**: Lake Kro Nymos (the foundation of everything)

**Adjacent Waters**: Troikan Strait (distant, irrelevant)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Jeh Bli (the only settlement)

**Cities**: None besides the capital

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Seasonal fishing camps on the lakeshore, abandoned in winter

### Neighbors and Relations

The Xi'ivrach have no neighbors in any meaningful sense. The elven kingdoms are five hundred miles south; they've never had a conflict because they've never had contact. Ios lies across the Troikan Strait, but the Xi'ivrach have no interest in the stone-doll builders and their failing civilization.

Occasional traders come from Lenora. The Xi'ivrach treat them with formal hospitality, trade fairly, and make clear they should leave before sunset. The traders obey.

The orcs are aware of the wider world. They're not curious about it. They found what they were looking for when they found Kro Nymos. Everything else is distraction.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Island Stirs**: Something on *Ghural-Kro* has become more active lately. The offerings sink faster. The shamans return from *Kro Gheth* with new scars they didn't cut themselves. The Keth-Vorun are praying more and eating less.

- **The Youth Question**: Some younger Xi'ivrach chafe at the isolation. They want to know what's beyond the forest, across the strait, south of the mountains. The elders say there's nothing worth knowing. The tension is growing.

- **The Forgetting**: An old shaman died last year, and with her went knowledge of a Deoric word no one else could speak. It's happened before, will happen again. The language of truth is slipping away, one death at a time.

### History

The Xi'ivrach arrived at Kro Nymos approximately four centuries ago, part of a larger orc migration whose origins are lost to oral history. They say they were called—that shamans dreamed of a still lake where the gods waited. They followed the dreams across unmapped wilderness until they found it.

What happened when they arrived is unclear. The Xi'ivrach don't record history the way other peoples do; they record it in scars, and the first generation's scars died with them. What's known is that they made contact with something in or beneath the lake, and that something made a bargain with them.

The terms of the bargain, if there are terms, aren't public. The Xi'ivrach are allowed to live here. The lake provides. The island is forbidden. Offerings are made. The priests learn Deoric. That's all outsiders know.

Four centuries later, nothing has changed. The Xi'ivrach aren't expanding, aren't building empire, aren't interested in the affairs of the wider world. They're waiting for something. They might not know what.

### Player Hooks

- **The Deoric Trade**: A dying merchant offers the party a fortune to escort him to Jeh Bli. He's heard the priests can speak health into existence. The journey is five hundred miles through monster territory. The priests might refuse him. He doesn't care.

- **The Exile**: A young Xi'ivrach has fled the city, her sacred stones abandoned, her scarifications defaced with self-inflicted burns. She's trying to reach Lenora. She says something is wrong at Kro Nymos—that the island is waking up, that the Keth-Vorun are preparing for something terrible. She might be telling the truth. She might be insane from guilt. She might be both.

- **The Empty Word**: A Deoric fragment has surfaced in Lenora—a stone tablet inscribed with a word no one can read. The elves want to sell it. The Xi'ivrach want it back. Various other parties want it for their own reasons. It's worth killing over, if it's genuine.

- **The Trade Caravan**: A merchant house is organizing its annual expedition to Jeh Bli and hiring guards. Good pay, dangerous work. The merchants know the route, know the risks, know exactly how not to anger the orcs. All the party has to do is keep them alive.
