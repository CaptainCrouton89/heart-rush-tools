## Illron

Tags: state, elves, confederation, fae

The southernmost of the three elven kingdoms, and the most traditional. Illron follows the old ways—not as empty phrase, but as literal practice. Where Lenora has cleared forests and built roads, Illron has kept faith with agreements older than the confederation itself. The kingdom's heart is a forest no elf will settle, surrounding a ruined palace no elf will enter.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary monarchy with council of elders

**Primary Inhabitants**: Elves

**Population**: ~100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**:
- Honor to ancestors and ancient pacts
- Preservation of the old ways
- Respect for the forest and its inhabitants
- Patient endurance over aggressive expansion

Illron is ruled by the **Thornwood Crown**—a hereditary monarchy that has passed through the same bloodline for over 4,000 years. The current monarch, traditionally styled the Keeper of the Old Ways, governs from Ishla'Anore with the counsel of an assembly of elders drawn from the kingdom's settlements.

The monarchy's power is largely ceremonial in peacetime. Day-to-day governance happens at the local level. But the Crown holds absolute authority in matters of tradition, treaty interpretation, and relations with non-elven powers—including the fae.

### The Iyaklomori Grera

The great forest at Illron's heart is not elven territory. It belongs to the fae.

Three rivers run through Iyaklomori Grera—the Kilgre Venora in the north, Ver Ta'Eres in the center, and Ver Suterela in the south. Any of them could support thriving settlements. None do. The forest is empty of elven habitation except for one ruin: Kilren's Palace, which stands as monument to the last time the elves forgot this fact.

The Illronese have a treaty with the fae court. The terms:
1. Elves may travel on two designated routes: the river-road along Kilgre Venora, and the diagonal trail from Hassera to E'lethelas
2. Elves may not settle, build, or clear any part of the forest
3. Elves may not hunt, harvest, or take anything that grows within the bounds
4. In exchange, the fae leave the coastal settlements and eastern edge alone

Breaking these terms is not punished by elven law. The fae handle enforcement themselves.

Travelers on the legal routes report being watched constantly. Movement in peripheral vision. Laughter at night. The sensation of attention. Nothing directly hostile—but nothing welcoming either. The 180-mile diagonal trail through the forest's heart takes 8-10 days. Most elves who've walked it once refuse to do it again.

Those who stray from the paths, or who take something, or who camp too long in one place—most are never seen again. The few who return are changed. Silent. Hollow. Wrong in ways that are hard to describe. They live out their remaining years but never speak of what happened.

### Kilren's Palace

Three thousand years ago, King Kilren decided to break the treaty.

He was a young king, ambitious, frustrated by the restrictions his ancestors had accepted. He believed the fae were not as powerful as the stories claimed. He marched 10,000 soldiers into the forest to establish a permanent military presence and prove that elves could take what was theirs.

The forest let them enter. Let them build. Kilren's Palace rose in a clearing on the Ver Ta'Eres—a proper fortress, stone walls, garrison quarters, armories. The elves brought their best weapons: blades forged from titan bone, armor worked with titan blood, the finest craftsmanship of the age. They garrisoned the palace for a full year. Nothing happened.

Then, one night, everyone inside vanished.

Not killed—gone. The fortress stood empty. The weapons remained in the armory. The food sat uneaten. Ten thousand soldiers simply ceased to be present.

King Kilren was found a week later, walking out of the forest toward Ishla'Anore. He couldn't speak. He lived another forty years, sitting in his palace, staring at walls. He never wrote. Never gestured meaningfully. Never communicated in any way. When he died, he was buried without ceremony—his name is not among those the Illronese remember.

The fortress still stands. The armory is still stocked with the finest titan-bone weapons ever forged—an arsenal worth more than most kingdoms' treasuries. The elves refuse to touch it. The few outsiders who learn of the treasure and attempt to claim it almost never return. Those who do return are like Kilren, or worse.

The fae don't seem to use the palace. They don't build or live in structures. It simply sits there, preserved, waiting. A monument and a warning.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Coastal fish, crafted goods, traditional textiles

**Primary Imports**: Grain (from Lenora), metals, titan-bone ritual objects (from Deo Esari)

Illron's economy is modest by necessity. They fish the coastal waters, craft goods in their settlements, and trade for what they cannot produce. They have no agricultural heartland—the forest takes up most of their territory, and they cannot use it.

This dependence on Lenora's grain is a source of quiet resentment. Every shipment is a reminder of what Illron gave up to honor the old pacts.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Traditional service obligations

Illron's military is small but exceptionally trained. They don't need large numbers—no one invades through fae territory, and the coastal approach is easily defensible. What soldiers they have are drilled in traditional combat forms passed down for millennia.

The Illronese do not make war. They haven't fielded an army beyond their borders since before the confederation. Their military exists to defend, not to project power.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Farlands, bordered by Ocean of Elorinia (west), Amholia Greras (north), and Wycendeula (south)

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, coastal scrubland

**Major Geographic Features**:
- **Iyaklomori Grera**: The sacred forest. Fae territory. See above.
- **Poscuni Gretanu**: Grasslands on the northeastern edge, transitioning toward Amholia Greras

**Rivers**:
- **Kilgre Venora**: Northern river, one of two legal travel routes
- **Ver Ta'Eres**: Central river, site of Kilren's Palace
- **Ver Suterela**: Southern river

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Ishla'Anore (eastern edge, outside the forest)

**Cities**:
- **E'lethelas**: Secondary city, south of Ishla'Anore, connected by road

**Coastal Settlements** (connected by coastal road):
- **A'valenor**: Northern coast, sits on the Air astral current
- **Olymethemar**: Central coast
- **Hassera**: Southern tip

**Cross-Forest Routes**:
- **Northern road**: Along Kilgre Venora, from Ishla'Anore to A'valenor
- **Diagonal trail**: 180 miles from Hassera to E'lethelas through the forest interior (rarely used)

The kingdom's settlements are arranged around the edges of Iyaklomori Grera, never within it. The eastern cities handle administration and trade with the other kingdoms. The coastal cities handle fishing and what little foreign commerce Illron engages in.

### Relations

**Lenora**: Tense. The confederation's voting structure gives Illron equal voice with Lenora despite having a quarter of the population. Lenora resents this. Illron insists the old agreements are binding and that population is irrelevant to a kingdom's worth. Both sides are correct according to their own values.

**Deo Esari**: Respectful. Both kingdoms prioritize tradition over growth. Deo Esari's recent disaster has only deepened their conservatism, which Illron quietly approves of. They are natural allies in confederation disputes.

**The Fae**: The Illronese do not consider their relationship with the fae to be diplomatic in the normal sense. The fae are not negotiating partners—they are powers to be acknowledged. The treaty is honored because the alternative has been demonstrated. Illron's monarchy derives some of its legitimacy from being the designated keeper of this relationship.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Confederation Voting**: Lenora wants representation proportional to population. Illron refuses. The treaty signed at Laeroth Esori specifies one kingdom, one voice. The ancestors are watching.
- **Economic Dependence**: Relying on Lenora for food is humiliating but unavoidable. Some younger Illronese wonder if there's a way to reduce this dependence without breaking the fae treaty.
- **The Palace Question**: The treasure in Kilren's Palace is immense. Every few generations, someone suggests mounting an expedition. The Crown always refuses. But the temptation doesn't go away.

### History

The elves who became the Illronese were the first of the eastern migrants to reach the Farlands. They found the forest already occupied. Their initial attempts to settle it ended badly. After enough failures, they negotiated.

The treaty with the fae predates the Three Kingdoms Treaty by at least a millennium. When the confederation was formed, Illron's representatives insisted that their prior obligations be acknowledged—the forest would remain fae territory, and no confederation decision could overrule that. Lenora and Deo Esari agreed. They had no reason not to; the forest wasn't theirs anyway.

King Kilren's invasion, roughly 3,000 years ago, was the last serious attempt to change the arrangement. The lesson it taught has not been forgotten.
