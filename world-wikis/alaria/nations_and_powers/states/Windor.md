## Windor

Tags: state, nation

Windor is a halfling nation occupying the northern slopes of Terrenia, wedged between the Green Mountains and the cold northern coast. It's a quiet country by most standards—pastoral, prosperous, well-organized—but the quietness is earned. The Windorf have built something comfortable in the shadow of troll-infested peaks, and they maintain it through luck, vigilance, and a practical understanding of acceptable losses.

### People

The Windorf are the dominant population: halflings who've lived here long enough that no one remembers arriving. They're small, clever, and blessed with an unusual relationship to probability. Fortune-magic runs in Windorf blood—not dramatic sorcery, but a subtle attunement to chance. Dice fall their way more often than statistics suggest. Dangers miss by inches. Opportunities appear at convenient moments.

This isn't universal or reliable. Most Windorf experience it as good instincts, lucky breaks, a sense of when to push and when to fold. A minority—those with genuine talent—can cultivate it into something more deliberate. These luck-blessers are valued throughout Terrenia and beyond.

Other peoples live in Windor—human traders, dwarf craftsmen, the occasional wanderer who settled down—but they're a small minority. Windorf culture dominates, and outsiders either adapt or move on.

### Government

Windor is governed by the Council of Chairs, a representative body that meets in Nylen. Each settlement sends delegates based on population and contribution, with seats weighted accordingly. The capital and Roye hold the most influence; villages share seats or rotate representation.

There's no king, no hereditary aristocracy. Local nobility exists—old families with wealth and reputation—but their authority comes from economic and social standing, not legal privilege. They serve on the Council like anyone else, and they can be voted out.

The Council handles defense coordination, trade agreements, taxation, and disputes between settlements. Local matters stay local. The system works because Windor is small enough for it to work, and because the Windorf temperament favors negotiation over confrontation.

**The Bureau of Fortune** operates under Council oversight, regulating luck-blessing services, training practitioners, and preventing the worst abuses. Fortune-magic for hire is legal and common—merchants pay for favorable winds, gamblers for loaded odds, parents for safe childbirths. The Bureau takes a cut and maintains standards. Unlicensed practice isn't illegal exactly, but the Bureau makes life difficult for competitors.

### Economy

Windor is modestly prosperous without being rich. The economy rests on four pillars:

**Agriculture**: The lowlands produce grain, dairy, and fruit—especially apples. Windorf cider is exported throughout Terrenia. Sheep and goats graze the hill country, providing wool and meat.

**Fishing**: The coastal villages work the cold northern waters. Cod, herring, and crab move inland; grain and goods move out. It's not glamorous work, but it's steady.

**Fortune Services**: Luck-blessing brings outside money into Windor. Merchants, nobles, and adventurers travel to Nylen seeking favorable odds. The Bureau of Fortune charges well for its services, and independent practitioners find plenty of clients despite official discouragement.

**Troll Materials**: An uncomfortable but profitable trade. Troll blood, bone, and hide have alchemical and magical applications. The Wardens sell what they harvest. Buyers don't ask too many questions about sourcing.

### Military

Windor doesn't maintain a standing army—there's no one to fight except the trolls, and trolls don't respond to conventional warfare. Instead, the nation relies on the Warden system.

**The Wardens** are professional troll-hunters, maintained by Council funding and stationed at posts along the mountain fringe. Each post covers a section of the border, running patrols, maintaining signal towers, and responding to raids. Wardens aren't soldiers; they're specialists. They know troll behavior, troll vulnerabilities, and troll territory better than anyone.

Warden service is voluntary but well-compensated. Recruits train for two years before field deployment. Casualties are expected—not catastrophic, but steady. The work attracts a certain type: people who want purpose, danger, and the respect that comes from doing something most can't.

**Village Militias** supplement the Wardens. Every mountain-fringe settlement maintains a watch, trains its adults in basic defense, and keeps weapons accessible. They're not expected to fight trolls directly—their job is to sound the alarm, evacuate civilians, and delay until Wardens arrive.

**Signal Towers** dot the mountain rim, each within sight of at least two others. Fire by night, smoke by day, specific patterns for different threats. When a tower lights, the message can reach Nylen within hours.

### Relations

**Aal Salma** (south): The human nation on Windor's southern border. Relations are civil but distant. Trade flows through Gorstraat. Aal Salma views Windorf fortune-magic with a mix of suspicion and envy—useful but untrustworthy, the way humans often view halfling advantages.

**Poum Titch** (across the mountains): The Scalawag territory beyond the Green Mountains is currently in civil war. Cross-mountain trade has collapsed. Refugees occasionally make the dangerous passage, bringing news that rarely improves.

**Broader Terrenia**: Windor is a small player in regional politics. It trades, it maintains neutrality, it avoids entanglements. The Council's priority is always internal—keep the trolls contained, keep the harvests coming, keep the luck flowing.

### Tensions and Hooks

**Something's Stirring**: Troll activity has increased over the past two years. Not dramatically, but noticeably. Raids are more frequent. New warrens are appearing in areas previously clear. The Wardens don't know why, and the Council doesn't want to admit they're concerned.

**The Deep Caves**: The mountains are riddled with unexplored cave systems. The trolls emerge from somewhere. What else lives down there? Occasional reports mention things that aren't trolls—larger, stranger, glimpsed in thermal fog or sulfur-steam. The Wardens don't investigate deep. Maybe they should.

**Bureau Politics**: The Bureau of Fortune holds significant power over a significant industry. Not everyone is happy about that. Independent luck-blessers chafe at regulation. Council members question the Bureau's growing treasury. Rumors of corruption circulate—favoritism, price-fixing, occasionally darker things. The Bureau denies everything.

**Clawsnatch**: The lake hides something. The Wardens know more than they say. Someone will eventually want answers.

**The Old Workings**: Pre-Windorf ruins dot the mountains. Who built them? What happened to them? The mines went deep before they were abandoned. Some shafts connect to places the Windorf have never mapped.

### Visiting Windor

Windor welcomes travelers and traders. The roads are good, the inns are comfortable, and the Windorf are hospitable in a reserved sort of way. They'll sell you cider, rent you a room, answer your questions politely. They won't invite you home for dinner unless they've known you for years.

The coast is cold. The lowlands are pleasant in summer. The mountains are off-limits unless you have business there and the sense to register with the Wardens.

Fortune-blessing services are available in Nylen through the Bureau or through less official channels. Prices vary. Results vary more. The Bureau guarantees satisfaction within defined parameters. Independent practitioners guarantee nothing but offer discounts.

Don't insult a Windorf's luck. It's the closest thing they have to a cultural taboo. Suggesting that their fortune is unearned or manipulated is deeply offensive—even when it's obviously true.
