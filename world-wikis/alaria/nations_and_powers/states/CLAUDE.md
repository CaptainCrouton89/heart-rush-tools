# States Writing Guide

This directory contains entries for nations, kingdoms, empires, and other territorial polities across Alaria.

**Note:** City-states belong in `../city_states/` instead. States are territorial—they control regions with borders and govern populations across multiple settlements.

## Lunar Calendar Context

All states share Alaria's dual-moon calendar. **Auris** (the Bright Moon, 11-day cycle) marks the week, beginning at new moon and reaching full moon mid-week on Merrynight. **Nyxara** (the Dark Moon, 23-day cycle) creates the monthly rhythm. When both moons align, **Brightnight** (double full) and **Hollownight** (double new) create major holidays observed across most cultures.

The 200-day year divides into eight 25-day quarters. Lunar cultures (elves, arcane societies) emphasize moon-phase holidays; solar cultures (agrarian commonfolk) emphasize seasonal celebrations. Most states observe both in varying degrees. Consider how each state's dominant culture weights these traditions.

## Entry Structure

State entries should generally cover:

- **Overview**: Geography, climate, and character in 1-2 paragraphs
- **Government**: Political structure, succession, major offices
- **Culture**: Customs, values, notable traditions, religious practices
- **Economy**: Primary industries, trade relationships, resources
- **Military**: Defense posture, notable forces, martial traditions
- **Relations**: Key allies, enemies, and complicated neighbors
- **History**: Founding, major events, current tensions
- **Notable Locations**: Important cities, landmarks, sites of interest
- **Player Hooks**: Adventure seeds, conflicts, opportunities

Not every entry needs all sections—scale to the state's importance and development level.

## Cross-Reference Before Writing

Before adding state content, check for established lore in:
- `cosmology_and_religion/` - Calendar, planes, leylines, religious systems
- `history_and_lore/` - Wars, empires, timelines that may involve this state
- `atlas_of_alaria/` - Geographic context, neighboring regions
- `heart_rush/races/` - Racial populations and their established cultures

## Tone

Write as an informed traveler or scholar might describe the place: specific, opinionated, alive with texture. Avoid encyclopedic dryness. Include details that would matter to someone actually going there—what do they eat, what offends locals, what's the first thing you notice?
