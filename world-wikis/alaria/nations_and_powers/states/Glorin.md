Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Clan-based confederation

**Primary Inhabitants**: Glorindian (Gold Eyes Dwarves)

**Population**: 15,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Secrecy, worthiness, clan loyalty, the earth's gifts

- Glorin is governed by a loose confederation of mining clans, each controlling different sections of the vast underground workings. Clan elders meet to resolve disputes and coordinate when necessary, but mostly each clan manages its own affairs.
- The Glorindians are secretive by nature and by necessity. Their golden eyes can sense precious metals through solid stone—a gift that has made them targets of exploitation throughout history. They've learned to keep quiet about their wealth.
- They believe gold calls to those worthy of finding it, and that hoarding beyond one's needs brings misfortune. Wealth flows through the community rather than pooling in individual hands.

### Economy

**Size**: Large (secretly massive)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Gold, precious metals (in controlled quantities)

**Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, surface goods

- Glorin sits atop one of the richest gold deposits in Alaria. The Glorindians have mined it for generations, carving vast underground chasms in pursuit of precious veins.
- The true scale of their wealth is unknown to outsiders. The Glorindians deliberately limit their visible exports to avoid attracting attention. What the world sees is a modest mining operation; what exists below is staggering.
- Trade with Kazül is steady but unremarkable. The Glorindians prefer it that way.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (clan obligation)

- Each clan maintains its own warriors, primarily for defending the mines. The Glorindians have no interest in conquest—they just want to be left alone.
- The mountains and tunnels are their best defense. Invaders who don't know the passages get lost, trapped, or worse.

### Geography

**Location**: Between Thespia (north) and Kazül (south), centered on the Whistle-Stone Mountains

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, deep valleys, vast underground complexes

**Climate**: Temperate mountain—cool summers, cold winters

**Named Features**: Whistle-Stone Mountains (named for the eerie sound of wind through the peaks)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Gamgara (surface settlement above the main mine complex)

**Cities**: Gamgara

**Towns**: Matabono, Zubaydah, Taufig

### The Underground

The surface settlements are just the tip. Below lies a network of mine shafts, tunnels, and vast underground chasms where the Glorindians have extracted gold for centuries. Some chambers are so large they have their own weather. The deepest workings are clan secrets, known only to those who labor there.

The wealth down there is almost incomprehensible. The Glorindians have mined tons upon tons of gold—and they're still finding more. Their auric sight means they never dig blind; they always know where the veins run.

### The Whistle-Stone Mountains

The mountain range that defines Glorin. The peaks are riddled with natural caverns and tunnels that create an eerie whistling sound when wind passes through. Outsiders find it unsettling; the Glorindians consider it the voice of the mountains.

### Primary Conflicts

**Staying Hidden**

The Glorindians' greatest challenge is remaining unremarkable. If the outside world understood how much gold lies beneath these mountains, every kingdom within marching distance would find a reason to invade. So they export modest amounts, live modestly on the surface, and keep the vast underground wealth secret.

**Morgnor's Interest**

The dragon Morgnor, King of the Mountains to the northwest, knows about Glorin. He knows about the gold. He hasn't moved yet—perhaps he's patient, perhaps he's waiting for the right moment, perhaps he's dealing with other matters first. But the Glorindians are aware that a dragon's eye has turned their way.

When Morgnor decides to act, Glorin's secrecy won't save them. Their small military won't stop a dragon. They're quietly trying to figure out what to do about this—but options are limited when you can't ask for help without revealing what you're protecting.

### History

The Glorindians found these mountains generations ago, drawn by the call of gold that only they could hear. They dug deep, found riches beyond imagining, and learned to keep quiet about it. History taught them that their gift made them valuable—and being valuable to the powerful is dangerous.

So they built modest surface towns, traded modest amounts of gold, and let the world forget about them. It worked. Glorin became a footnote, a small mining state between more interesting neighbors.

Now Morgnor threatens that peace. The dragon has noticed what the world has not. The Glorindians face a choice they've spent centuries avoiding: reveal their wealth to seek allies, or face the dragon alone.
