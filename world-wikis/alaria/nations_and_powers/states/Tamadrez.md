## Tamadrez

Tags: state, shacklands

Tamadrez is not a nation. It is what's left.

The island of Pesalolo stretches a thousand miles from northeast to southwest, bisected by the Freedom Mountains and divided by Gorathi violence. The south belongs to the slavers—occupied territory where Gorathi ships collect their human cargo. The north belongs to no one in particular—a scattering of villages and towns that call themselves "Tamadrez" because they need a name when foreigners ask. There is no king, no council, no capital. There is only the shared understanding that Gorath could crush them whenever it chose, and the desperate hope that it won't.

Three centuries ago, Gorathi explorers discovered Pesalolo and the Drasnian dwarves who had lived there for millennia. Within a generation, the slave trade had transformed both societies. Gorath occupied the southern coast by force; the northern settlements survived because they weren't worth conquering. The mountains are too rugged, the villages too poor, and Gorath's military too stretched thin on other fronts. So the empire takes what it wants from the south and leaves the north alone—as long as the north stays out of the way.

Gorath's terms are simple: the empire operates freely in the south. The north does not interfere. Any village that harbors escaped slaves burns. One northern town learned this lesson permanently when Gorathi warships firebombed it to ash for sheltering hundreds of escapees. The Drasnians never agreed to these terms—there was no negotiation, no treaty, no signing. Gorath simply announced how things would be, and the alternative was extermination.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: None (loose confederation of autonomous villages)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Drasnian dwarves

**Population**: ~200,000 (north); unknown thousands in the south under Gorathi control

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Duty, custom, pragmatic survival, wealth as security

#### The Non-Government

Tamadrez has no central authority because it never did. The Freedom Mountains made unification impractical long before Gorath arrived—villages on opposite coasts might as well be in different countries. Each settlement governs itself through elder councils, hereditary headmen, or simple consensus depending on local tradition.

This fragmentation happens to frustrate Gorath. When the empire demands that "Tamadrez" crack down on escape networks, there is no one to receive the demand. When a village defies Gorath's terms, other villages can honestly claim they had no knowledge and no control. Gorath would prefer a central authority to threaten and negotiate with. The Drasnians have no intention of providing one—not as resistance, but because creating a unified government would be difficult, expensive, and would only make them easier to coerce.

When coordination is necessary—which is rarely—representatives meet in Yava. These meetings produce no binding agreements, no formal resolutions, no accountable decisions. Just talk, and whatever informal understanding the participants carry home.

#### The Drasnian Dwarves

The Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and most widespread of dwarven heritages, found in vast numbers at nearly every cultural hub across Alaria. The Pesalolo Drasnians are one branch of this diaspora—darker-skinned from generations in the tropical climate, but otherwise recognizable to their continental kin.

Drasnian culture values education, money, and the preservation of their elaborate customs. Their religious and social traditions govern worship, relationships, and daily life in intricate detail—which prayers for which occasions, which foods at which meals, which obligations between which relatives. These customs persist in Tamadrez despite three centuries of Gorathi predation, maintained with characteristic Drasnian stubbornness.

The Drasnians are pragmatic about survival. They value wealth not for luxury but for security—coin hidden away means options when disaster comes. They count, they plan, they prepare. The arrangement with Gorath is distasteful, but Drasnians have survived worse through careful calculation. They will endure this too.

In the south, Drasnian customs survive in fragments—abbreviated prayers, simplified rituals, the small observances that remind the enslaved who they are. In the north, the full weight of tradition continues, adapted where necessary but never abandoned. A Drasnian wedding in Yava still follows the same seventeen steps as one in distant Drasnia, even if the specific prayers now include petitions for absent family members who will never return.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Fish, tropical hardwoods, dyes, Yava's port services

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, weapons (quietly), information

#### The Two Economies

The south has no economy—it has extraction. Drasnian dwarves are the product, collected and shipped like timber or ore. Whatever the captives produced before their capture becomes Gorathi property.

The north survives on fishing, subsistence farming, and the mountain forests that Gorath has never managed to exploit. Villages trade among themselves using barter and informal credit. Coin is rare outside Yava.

Yava itself operates differently. The port city trades with the wider world—Ethadia, Shir, Windori, whoever sails through Screamstrait. This trade provides the foreign goods that filter into the rest of Tamadrez, and the foreign contacts that make certain... arrangements... possible.

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: n/a

**Enrollment**: n/a

Tamadrez has no army. It cannot have one. Any organized military force would give Gorath the excuse it needs to invade.

What Tamadrez has instead:
- Village militias for local protection (bandits, wildlife, occasional Gorathi "inspection teams" that get too aggressive)
- Hunters who know the mountain passes better than any Gorathi patrol
- A population that has spent three centuries learning to disappear when soldiers come looking

The Freedom Mountains themselves are Tamadrez's best defense. Gorathi expeditions have repeatedly failed to establish permanent control of the highland routes. The terrain favors those who know it.

### Geography

**Location**: Island of Pesalolo, Shacklands region

**Biomes**: Tropical jungle (lowlands), highland forest (mountain slopes), scrubland (Ryujilin Hills)

**Named Entities**: Freedom Mountains (Apuindi, Gesichi, Tishkung sections), Ryujilin Hills, Slaver's Coast, Yava

**Rivers & Lakes**: Numerous rivers draining from the Freedom Mountains to both coasts

**Adjacent Waters**: Divinity Passage (east), Torgan Passage (southeast), Gindrik Sea (south), Screamstrait (southwest)

See [Pesalolo](../../atlas_of_alaria/shacklands/Pesalolo.md) for detailed geographic information.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (Yava serves as informal meeting point)

**Cities**: Yava (~30,000)

**Towns**: Scattered along both coasts and in mountain valleys

**Villages**: Dozens, mostly unnamed on foreign maps

#### Yava

The only real city, at the island's southwestern tip. Yava survives because destroying it would destabilize trade across the Gindrik Sea. Every major trading power has made clear that burning Yava would have consequences. So Gorath pretends it's a minor fishing town, and Yava pretends it doesn't shelter escapees.

See [Pesalolo - Yava](../../atlas_of_alaria/shacklands/Pesalolo.md#yava) for details.

#### Slavewatch

The Gorathi fortress in the central Gesichi Mountains, officially monitoring the passes for escaped slaves. In practice, Commander Kassander Volso runs a profitable corruption operation that takes bribes from all sides.

See [Slavewatch](../../atlas_of_alaria/shacklands/Slavewatch.md) for details.

### Primary Conflicts

**Compliance**: Every day, Tamadrez must choose between obeying Gorathi demands and risking annihilation for defiance. Most villages comply just enough to avoid attention. Some take greater risks.

**The Underground Railroad**: Escaped slaves flee north through the mountain passes. Someone is organizing the routes, providing safe houses, bribing Slavewatch patrols. Gorath wants the network found. Many Tamadrezans quietly support it. A few actively participate.

**Agtakkeri**: The dragon hunting Gorathi ships in the northern waters has accidentally become Tamadrez's greatest protector. But the dragon kills slaves along with slavers, and its methods are monstrous. Supporting it means enabling a torturer. Opposing it means helping Gorath.

**The South**: The Drasnians in occupied territory are still kin. The north survives by staying out of the way while the south is harvested. Some northerners rationalize this as necessary pragmatism. Others fund the underground railroad. A few argue for open war, regardless of the cost. The division runs through families.

**Internal Fractures**: Some villages want open resistance. Others counsel patience. A few have been thoroughly compromised by Gorathi informants. Trust is scarce.

### History

**Before Contact**: The Drasnian dwarves settled Pesalolo millennia ago, building a civilization in the mountains and along both coasts. They were never unified under a single government—the Freedom Mountains made that impractical—but they shared language, culture, and trade networks.

**The Tamadrez Contact (~300 years ago)**: Gorathi explorers discovered the island and its inhabitants. Initial contact was peaceful. Trade began. Then Gorath realized how valuable Drasnian labor could be.

**The First Raids**: Gorathi slave ships began taking captives from coastal villages. The Drasnians resisted, but their village militias couldn't match Gorathi legions. Coastal settlements fell or fled into the mountains.

**The Occupation**: Gorath seized the southern coast and established the Slaver's Coast—a chain of ports for collecting and shipping human cargo. The northern settlements were too poor and too difficult to conquer, and Gorath's military was already stretched thin. So the empire announced its terms: the south belongs to Gorath; the north stays out of the way; any interference results in destruction. The Drasnians never agreed to this. They simply survived it.

**Three Centuries of Extraction**: The arrangement has persisted because it remains profitable for Gorath and survivable for the north. Periodic Gorathi violence reinforces the terms—the firebombing that destroyed Kalashev being the most dramatic example. Smaller punishments occur regularly. The Drasnians adjust their calculations accordingly.

**The Present**: Emperor Veramus maintains the current arrangement because full invasion would overstretch Gorath's already-thin military. The underground railroad operates despite Slavewatch—some say because of Slavewatch's corruption. Agtakkeri hunts the northern waters. And the Drasnian dwarves continue what they have always done: count the costs, preserve what they can, and plan for better circumstances.

### Hooks

- **The Network**: The party is asked to move escaped slaves through the mountain passes. Success means saving lives. Failure means Gorathi retribution on the villages that helped.

- **Kalashev's Ghosts**: The firebombed town left survivors—scattered, angry, with nothing left to lose. They're planning something. It might be resistance. It might be revenge. It might get everyone killed.

- **The Southern Question**: A Drasnian leader in the north wants to establish contact with resistance cells in Gorathi-controlled territory. The mission would require traveling into the Slaver's Coast itself.

- **Yava's Secret**: Someone in Yava is selling information to Gorath—escape routes, safe house locations, network contacts. Finding the informant means navigating the port city's tangled politics.

- **The Dragon Dilemma**: Gorath has finally assembled a serious dragonslaying expedition against Agtakkeri. If it succeeds, the northern escape routes close forever. If it fails, the dragon continues killing innocents along with slavers. The party might be hired by either side—or might have to choose for themselves.
