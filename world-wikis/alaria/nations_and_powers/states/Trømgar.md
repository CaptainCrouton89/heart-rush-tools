## Trømgar

Tags: state, dwarves, innerrim

The mountain fortress. Trømgar is a dwarven nation where warfare has become religion, where armor is sacred art, and where how one dies matters more than how one lived. The Strømgodden have carved their civilization into the Thunderdark Peaks, creating fortress-cities that have never fallen and forging a culture that measures worth in battle-scars and glorious endings.

This is not mere militarism—the Strømgodden genuinely believe that combat is holy, that sacrifice in battle honors the gods, and that a spectacular death redeems any life. Their spiked armor transforms each warrior's body into a weapon; their charge attacks trade damage given for damage taken, accepting wounds to deliver devastation. They are simultaneously the most honorable and the most terrifying warriors on Alaria.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Military meritocracy (Warcouncil)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Strømgodden (battle dwarves)

**Population**: ~50,000

**Stability**: Very stable

**Core Values**: Sacrifice, fury, glory, battle, bravery, "full heart"

#### The Warcouncil

Trømgar is ruled by the **Warcouncil**, a body of twelve war-leaders who have proven themselves through exceptional deeds in battle. Seats are earned, not inherited—a warrior who achieves sufficient glory may challenge for a position, and the Council regularly loses members to combat deaths (as expected and honored).

The Warcouncil makes decisions by consensus when possible, by combat when necessary. Disputes that cannot be resolved through debate are settled in the **Ring of Judgment**, where the disagreeing parties fight until one yields or dies. This sounds chaotic to outsiders, but it produces remarkably efficient governance—the Strømgodden don't waste time on debates that could be settled by blade.

The current Council includes warriors from each major fortress-city, ensuring regional representation, plus several "wandering seats" held by heroes whose deeds transcend local affiliation.

#### The High Forge-Master

A unique position outside the Warcouncil: the **High Forge-Master** oversees all armor-smithing in Trømgar. This role is spiritual as much as practical—the Forge-Master ensures that sacred techniques are preserved, that the gods of war receive their due honor in every piece of armor created, and that no inferior work leaves the forges.

The current High Forge-Master, **Valdrik Ironvein**, has held the position for forty years. His armor is worn by half the Warcouncil, and his word on matters of smithing tradition carries more weight than any warrior's blade.

#### Strømgodden Society

Strømgodden society is organized around the concept of **drengskald**—roughly translated as "warrior-worth" or "battle-reputation." Every adult Strømgodden accumulates drengskald through combat, craftsmanship (especially armor-smithing), and sacrifice. Those with high drengskald command respect; those with low drengskald are pitied rather than scorned.

Children begin combat training at age ten. By fifteen, they've forged their first piece of spiked armor—a coming-of-age ritual that marks the transition to adulthood. By twenty, most have seen their first real combat against Ix'Vasyla raiders or in the ritual challenges that settle personal disputes.

Women fight alongside men in Strømgodden culture; the gods care only for courage, not gender. Some of the most legendary warriors in Trømgar's history have been women, and their names are carved in the Hall of Glorious Ends alongside any man's.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (specialized)

**Primary Exports**: Weapons, armor, metalwork, mercenary services

**Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, luxury goods

#### The Forge Economy

Trømgar's economy runs on metal and war. The Thunderdark Peaks provide abundant iron, copper, and the rare alloys needed for superior armor-smithing. Strømgodden metalwork commands premium prices across Alaria—their weapons never break, their armor never fails, and their spiked designs are both functional and terrifying.

Beyond equipment, the Strømgodden export their services. Strømgodden mercenaries are expensive but worth it—disciplined, fearless, and bound by personal honor to fulfill their contracts. They're especially valued for desperate situations where other soldiers would break and run.

#### Economic Limitations

Food is Trømgar's weakness. The mountains don't support significant agriculture, and the population depends on trade for grain, vegetables, and anything that doesn't grow in stone. This vulnerability is mitigated by extensive stockpiles—every fortress-city maintains years' worth of preserved food—but a prolonged siege or trade embargo would eventually bite.

The Strømgodden are aware of this weakness and deeply resentful of it. Their dependence on lowland food is considered slightly shameful, a necessary compromise with a world that doesn't cooperate with dwarven ideals.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Extremely High

**Enrollment**: Universal

#### The Spiked Doctrine

Strømgodden combat doctrine is unique: their armor is their primary weapon. Every warrior wears custom-fitted armor embedded with spikes, blades, and protrusions designed to turn the body into a weapon. The signature **spiked charge** involves building momentum and slamming into enemies body-first, the armor's spikes doing the killing.

This fighting style is inherently sacrificial. The impact damages the charger as well as the target. Warriors accept wounds to deliver wounds, trading their own blood for enemy blood. Against most opponents, this exchange favors the armored dwarf—but the Strømgodden would use the tactic even if it didn't, because sacrifice itself is holy.

#### Organization

The Strømgodden military is organized by fortress-city. Each settlement maintains its own garrison and can field warriors for offensive operations when the Warcouncil calls. A full muster of all fortress-cities would produce perhaps 15,000 warriors—small compared to nations like Gorath, but each Strømgodden fighter is worth several ordinary soldiers.

Elite units include:
- **The Venom-Scarred**: Warriors who have survived Ix'Vasyla bites, specialists in anti-lizardfolk combat
- **The Tunnel-Breakers**: Experts in underground warfare, maintaining the tunnel network and fighting in its depths
- **The Storm-Riders**: Warriors who fight during thunderstorms, using the lightning and chaos to their advantage

#### Every Citizen a Soldier

Military service in Trømgar isn't mandatory because it doesn't need to be—the entire culture is military. Every adult Strømgodden trains for combat, maintains their armor, and stands ready to fight when called. There is no distinction between "soldier" and "civilian" because the concept of civilian doesn't exist.

### Geography

**Location**: Eastern Inner Rim (Thunderdark Peaks)

**Biomes**: Mountain (dominant), highland forest, coastal mangroves (claimed but unoccupied)

**Named Regions**: Thunderdark Peaks, Duskwood Forest, Whispering Mangroves, Croaking Briars (border)

**Rivers**: Several unnamed rivers flowing from the peaks

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Levke

**Fortress-Cities**: Andvik, Kavnendal

**Outposts**: Traut

### Relations

**Nashua**: Eternal war. The Ix'Vasyla and Strømgodden have fought for generations in a conflict that has become almost ritualized. Neither side can conquer the other—the dwarves can't survive in the toxic marshes, the lizardfolk can't take the mountain fortresses. Both sides seem to find this arrangement... acceptable. The enemy you know, and all that.

**Gorath**: Cold war heating up. The Strømgodden are furious about Gorath's enslavement of Drasnian dwarves—distant kin, but kin nonetheless. Diplomatic protests have been ignored. Trade sanctions have been ineffective. More direct action is being discussed in the Warcouncil, though Gorath's sheer size makes open war inadvisable.

**Phirexes**: Barrier relationship. The Croaking Briars prevent meaningful contact. The Strømgodden know something lies beyond the briars, ruled by some queen the traders whisper about, but they can't reach it and it can't reach them. A frustrating stalemate for a people who prefer problems they can hit.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: Complicated kinship. The Strømgodden consider themselves the truest dwarves—the ones who remember what it means to be warriors. They view other dwarven cultures with a mixture of kinship and contempt, respecting their craftsmanship while deploring their softness.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Nashua War**: Endless but contained. Seasonal campaigns, ritual raids, acceptable casualties. Neither side wants to escalate because neither can win.

- **The Gorath Question**: How to respond to the enslavement of Drasnian kin? Open war is suicide against Gorath's numbers. Doing nothing is dishonorable. The Warcouncil debates while young hotheads agitate for action.

- **The Briars**: A frustration rather than a conflict. The Strømgodden hate that they can't breach the Croaking Briars through force. It offends their worldview.

### History

The Strømgodden arrived in the Thunderdark Peaks in an era now lost to exact record—at least eight centuries ago, possibly more. They came from somewhere else, fleeing or conquering or simply wandering, and found mountains that suited them.

The first fortress-cities rose within decades. The wars with the Ix'Vasyla began almost immediately and have never truly stopped. The culture of sacred warfare developed over generations, crystallizing into its current form roughly three centuries ago when the **Prophet Bjornir** codified the theology of glorious death.

Recent centuries have been stable—if "stable" can describe a nation in perpetual war. The Strømgodden population remains steady, deaths roughly balanced by births, the eternal conflict with Nashua providing both threat and meaning. The rising tension with Gorath over the Drasnian question is the first significant change in generations.

### Culture

#### Glorious Death

The Strømgodden believe that how one dies determines one's fate in the afterlife. A glorious death—in battle, through sacrifice, achieving something worthy—earns a place in the eternal feast-halls of the war-gods. An inglorious death—from old age, disease, or cowardice—condemns one to... something worse. The theology is vague on exactly what, but no Strømgodden wants to find out.

This belief shapes everything. The elderly seek death in combat rather than fade away. The sick volunteer for suicide missions. No Strømgodden retires, ever. They fight until they can't, then they find a way to die well.

#### The Armor-Soul

Strømgodden believe that a warrior's soul partially inhabits their armor. The forging process isn't just metalworking—it's spiritual binding, weaving the wearer's essence into the steel. This is why Strømgodden armor is never passed down or inherited; when a warrior dies, their armor is either buried with them or melted and reforged with the next generation's spirit.

Damaging a Strømgodden's armor is not just practical injury—it's spiritual violation. Warriors have killed over scratches to their plate.

#### The Full Heart

To act with a "full heart" (**hjartenful**) is the highest Strømgodden virtue: to commit completely, to hold nothing back, to throw oneself entirely into battle, craft, love, or anything worth doing. Half-measures are contemptible. If something is worth doing, it's worth dying for.

This philosophy produces warriors of terrifying commitment—and a society that struggles with nuance, compromise, and the kind of patient diplomacy that other nations practice.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Drasnian Underground**: Some Strømgodden are not content to wait for the Warcouncil to act on the Gorath situation. An underground network is forming, planning to strike at Gorathi slave operations directly. The Warcouncil officially disapproves. Unofficially, some members are sympathetic.

**The Briar-Breakers**: A young warrior named Astrid Thornsdaughter has sworn to breach the Croaking Briars or die trying. She's gathering followers, studying the patterns of the briars, and planning an assault that veterans consider suicidal. She might be mad—or she might succeed where generations have failed.

**The Old Tunnels**: The tunnel network beneath the Thunderdark Peaks connects to passages older than the Strømgodden presence. Something lives in the deepest levels. The dwarves have sealed those passages, but seals don't last forever.

**The Peace Faction**: A small but growing group questions the eternal war with Nashua. What if peace were possible? What if both sides simply... stopped? This heresy is dangerous to voice, but the whispers spread nonetheless.

**The Foreign Forges**: Strømgodden armor-smithing techniques are closely guarded. But someone has been selling secrets to outsiders—inferior copies of Strømgodden designs have appeared in distant markets. The High Forge-Master has sworn to find and execute the traitor.
