## Xi Chin

Tags: citystate

The Timekeeper city rises from a high plateau in the Tethryn Mountains of SW Urok, its white marble architecture stark against the dark volcanic stone. Xi Chin is home to the greatest astronomers in Alaria—scholars who track not just the movements of sun and moons, but the cycles of stars, the drift of planets, and patterns in the sky that most people never notice. When Xi Chin issues a prediction, wise rulers listen.

### Overview

Xi Chin exists because of a question: *What time is it?*

The question sounds simple. It isn't. Alaria's dual moons create a calendar of staggering complexity—Auris and Nyxara cycling at different rates, their alignments creating holidays that drift through the seasons, their light affecting magic in ways scholars still don't fully understand. Someone had to track it all. Someone had to maintain the authoritative calendar that merchants, priests, and kings could rely on.

That someone became Xi Chin.

The city was founded over two thousand years ago by an alliance of Uline Dwarven clockmakers and human astronomers who recognized that precision timekeeping required both mechanical expertise and observational patience. The dwarves built instruments; the humans watched the sky. Together, they created something neither could have managed alone: an institution dedicated to measuring time itself.

Today, Xi Chin remains cosmopolitan in a way the other dwarven city-states of SW Urok are not. Humans and dwarves share the city equally, with smaller populations of gnomes, elves, and others who've come for the knowledge and stayed for the culture. The marble architecture reflects this blend—dwarven precision in the stonework, human grandeur in the scale.

### The Great Clocktower

At the city's heart stands the Clocktower, visible from anywhere in Xi Chin and from ships in the Gulf of Xoth on clear days. The tower rises three hundred feet, its upper reaches housing the great orrery—a mechanical model of Alaria's sky that tracks the positions of sun, moons, and major celestial bodies with terrifying accuracy.

The Clocktower chimes the hours. Not just for Xi Chin—the sound carries across the mountains, and smaller towers throughout Alaria are synchronized to its rhythm. When the Clocktower strikes midnight at year's end, the new year officially begins. No other authority is recognized.

The tower's lower levels house the Chroniclers' archives: records of every astronomical observation made in Xi Chin's history, predictions issued and verified, calendars maintained for every nation that subscribes to the service. The archives are open to scholars, for a fee. The observation decks are not—those are reserved for the Chroniclers themselves.

### The Chroniclers' Compact

Xi Chin's neutrality is not an accident. It's a treaty.

The Chroniclers' Compact, signed over fifteen centuries ago and renewed every generation since, guarantees Xi Chin's independence. No nation may attack the Timekeepers. No army may march on the city. No trade embargo may starve it. In exchange, Xi Chin shares its calendrical services with all signatories equally, plays no favorites in political disputes, and issues predictions without bias.

The Compact has held because everyone needs it to hold. A war that destroyed Xi Chin's archives would plunge Alaria into calendrical chaos—festivals celebrated on wrong days, contracts with date-dependent clauses thrown into dispute, magical rituals timed to celestial events suddenly unreliable. The cost of destroying Xi Chin would exceed the benefit of conquering it.

This makes the city neutral ground. Diplomats meet here when they can't meet anywhere else. Treaties are signed in the shadow of the Clocktower. Enemies dine together in Xi Chin's restaurants, knowing that violence within the city walls would turn every signatory against the aggressor.

### Prediction as Power

The Chroniclers don't prophesy. They calculate.

Their predictions emerge from mathematical models of extraordinary sophistication—patterns identified in centuries of observations, correlations between celestial events and earthly consequences that most people would dismiss as coincidence. When Xi Chin predicted the Red Tide plague seven years before it arrived, they weren't reading omens. They were tracking a cyclical pattern in stellar positions that had preceded similar plagues twice before in recorded history.

Not every prediction proves accurate. The Chroniclers maintain careful records of their successes and failures, adjusting their models accordingly. But their track record is impressive enough that a formal warning from Xi Chin sends nations into preparation. They've predicted famines, volcanic eruptions, wars, and what they call "convergences"—moments when multiple celestial cycles align in ways that historically correlate with dramatic change.

The next major convergence, according to current models, is less than a decade away. The Chroniclers have not yet announced what they expect to happen. The silence makes people nervous.

### Government

Xi Chin is governed by the **Council of Hours**—twelve Chroniclers, each responsible for one aspect of the city's timekeeping mission. The Council selects its own members through a process involving peer review, demonstrated accuracy, and what they call "temporal intuition"—an ability to see patterns that others miss.

The Council has no hereditary component. Chroniclers come from any race, any background, any nation—what matters is the work. This meritocracy is genuine but brutal; failed predictions end careers, and the pressure to maintain accuracy drives some Chroniclers to obsession or madness.

Below the Council, the city operates through guilds: the Clockmakers who maintain the instruments, the Observers who watch the sky, the Calculators who crunch the numbers, the Archivists who preserve the records. Each guild has its own hierarchy, its own traditions, its own fierce pride in its contribution to the mission.

### The Orrery-City

Xi Chin's layout is not accidental. The city was designed as a functional astronomical instrument.

Streets align with solstice sunrises. Plazas mark the positions where specific stars rise over the eastern peaks. The Clocktower stands at the exact center of a geometric pattern that, viewed from above, maps the orbital paths of Auris and Nyxara. Walking through Xi Chin is walking through a model of the heavens.

This means the city cannot grow organically. Every new building must be approved by the Council to ensure it doesn't block sight-lines or disrupt the pattern. The result is a city of unusual order—beautiful, precise, and slightly unsettling to visitors used to the chaos of normal urban growth.

### Culture

Life in Xi Chin revolves around time. Appointments are kept to the minute. Lateness is a moral failing. The city's music features complex polyrhythms that mirror celestial cycles; its poetry counts syllables with mathematical precision; its cuisine emphasizes dishes that must be prepared at exact moments or they fail.

Outsiders find it exhausting. Residents find everywhere else sloppy.

The city celebrates time-based holidays that most of Alaria has forgotten—ancient observances tied to stellar positions rather than the common lunar calendar. Some of these celebrations are open to visitors; others are private, conducted in observatories at moments when specific stars align.

### Relations with Neighbors

Xi Chin maintains formal neutrality, but geography creates practical relationships.

**Wister Valley** feeds the city, and the valley folk resent their dependent status even as they profit from it. Tensions simmer but never boil—Xi Chin needs the food, and Wister needs the protection the Compact provides.

**Maun and Wisgarrd** are trading partners. Xi Chin's precision instruments often incorporate Wisgarrd gems; Maun's musicians perform at Chronicler ceremonies. The relationship is commercial rather than warm—the dwarven city-states find Xi Chin's mixed population vaguely distasteful, and Xi Chin finds their artistic obsessions frivolous.

**Xoth** is the complication. The Compact requires Xi Chin to serve all signatories equally, and Xoth is a signatory. This means providing calendrical services to a nation whose daemon-aided military makes everyone else nervous. Some Chroniclers argue the Compact should be revised to exclude Xoth; others argue that would destroy the principle of neutrality entirely. The debate has lasted generations without resolution.

### Player Hooks

- **The Silent Prediction**: The Chroniclers have identified something in their models—something they're not announcing publicly. Rumors suggest it involves Xoth, or the Shattered Court beneath Maun and Wisgarrd, or something older. Someone needs to find out what they know and why they're keeping quiet.

- **Temporal Anomaly**: A Chronicler has gone missing, along with records of specific observations. The Council wants the records recovered discreetly—whatever the Chronicler discovered, they don't want it becoming public knowledge.

- **The Convergence**: With a major celestial convergence approaching, various factions are positioning themselves. Some want to prevent whatever's predicted; others want to exploit it. Xi Chin is the only place with enough information to understand what's actually coming.

- **Compact Crisis**: A signatory nation has violated the Compact's terms—attacking a Xi Chin citizen, or pressuring Chroniclers for favorable predictions. The Council must respond, but harsh action might trigger the very conflict the Compact was designed to prevent.
