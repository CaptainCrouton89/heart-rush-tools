Tags: state, city

pronounced "wah-tah-LEE-nah"

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant oligarchy (Council of Pearls)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Kendor (primarily Pelaendor wanderers)

**Population**: 3,000 permanent residents, plus transient traders

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Commerce, neutrality, discretion, beauty

- Watalina is governed by the Council of Pearls, seven Kendor merchant-houses who rotate leadership annually
- The settlement maintains strict neutrality in Atriik's internal politics—they trade with all four city-states equally
- Violence is not just illegal but socially unthinkable; disputes are resolved through elaborate arbitration rituals
- Non-Kendor visitors are welcome but expected to conduct themselves with decorum

### Economy

**Size**: Small but influential

**Tech**: Sophisticated (underwater engineering, shipbuilding)

**Primary Exports**: Pearl cultivation, pilotage services, shipbuilding, preserved seafood

**Primary Imports**: Timber (from Sprenwood), freshwater, surface-world luxuries

- Watalina controls all maritime traffic in Shark Bay through their monopoly on pilotage
- Their shipbuilding combines Kendor design principles with Sprenwood hardwoods
- Pearl cultivation is a closely guarded secret; Watalina pearls command premium prices across Westrim
- The settlement serves as the primary interface between Kendor society and the Atriik city-states

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: n/a

**Enrollment**: n/a

- The Kendor consider organized violence vulgar and maintain no military force
- Defense relies on the settlement's underwater location (inaccessible to land forces), maritime leverage (no one attacks the only pilots who know the channels), and diplomatic relationships with all parties
- In emergencies, Kendor can summon aquatic creatures or simply withdraw to deeper waters

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Shark Bay, at the interface between coastal shallows and open water

**Biomes**: Submerged coral structures, floating platforms, tidal zones

**Named Entities**: The Pearl Halls (council chambers), the Pilot's Ledge (training center), the Market Platforms

**Rivers & Lakes**: n/a

**Adjacent Waters**: Shark Bay, Agreben Sea approaches

### Physical Structure

Watalina is not a conventional city. The settlement consists of:

- **Submerged Architecture**: Coral-grown buildings in the shallows, accessible only by swimming or diving. This is where most Kendor live and conduct private business.
- **Floating Platforms**: Moored structures where surface-dwellers can meet with Kendor traders. Markets, hostels, and negotiation chambers for those who cannot breathe water.
- **Tidal Gardens**: Cultivated oyster beds and pearl-producing mollusk colonies in the bay's shallows, maintained by Kendor aquaculture.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Pearl Halls (submerged council chambers)

**Districts**:
- The Shallows (residential, submerged)
- The Market Platforms (commercial, floating)
- The Outer Anchorage (visiting ships)

### Primary Conflicts

- The Kendor's strict neutrality occasionally frustrates Atriik's city-states, who would prefer Watalina to favor their interests
- Some younger Kendor chafe at the isolation from the wider Kendor fortress-cities to the south
- Surface traders sometimes resent Kendor price-setting on essential maritime services

### Relations

**Positive**: All Atriik city-states (trading partners), Mueras merchant-kings (distant trade contacts)

**Neutral**: Northern states (limited contact)

**Negative**: None—the Kendor cultivate relationships, not enemies

### History

Watalina was established generations ago when Pelaendor wanderers recognized Shark Bay's strategic value. The settlement grew as Atriik developed, providing maritime services that the land-bound city-states could not supply themselves. The relationship is symbiotic: Atriik needs the sea access; Watalina needs the trade goods.

The Council of Pearls has governed since the settlement's founding, with remarkable consistency in policy despite annual leadership rotations. The Kendor view the surface-dwellers with the patient amusement of beings who measure time in centuries.
