## Postronamas Empire

Tags: ruins, state, fallen, westwilds

An ancient civilization that rose to greatness through mastery of twyl crystals, built an empire spanning the western Westwilds, and collapsed into madness and civil war when they pushed too deep into their own power.

### Overview

The Postronamas dominated the Piktiniti Desert and surrounding regions for centuries, perhaps millennia. Their civilization was built on twyl—a crystalline mineral that produces oxygen and, when concentrated, resonates at frequencies that can enhance mental abilities, enable long-distance communication, and amplify magical power.

At their height, the Postronamas constructed the Chakatann pillars: massive stone columns containing twyl crystal cores, spaced ten miles apart in a grid across the western desert. The pillar network allowed them to project power across continental distances.

Then they pushed too deep into the crystal caverns beneath their capital, Enimogos. The music of the deepest crystals broke their leaders' minds. The madness spread through the resonance network, cascading from pillar to pillar. Within a generation, the empire collapsed.

### Culture (What Survives)

**Aesthetic:** Egypt + Japan + Tlingit. Geometric line art, flowing garments, an emphasis on symmetry and pattern. Postronamas artifacts are immediately recognizable—clean lines, insect motifs, crystal inlays.

**Insect Partnership:** The Postronamas worked closely with the giant insects of the Piktiniti. They bred enormous dung beetles whose wing vibrations could harvest twyl at precise frequencies. They wore armor crafted from insect chitin—beautiful and effective. Their art featured insects prominently.

**Crystal Meditation:** Postronamas leaders used massive crystal caves as meditation chambers, achieving enhanced perception and magical sensitivity. This practice was their greatest achievement and their downfall.

### The Collapse

The crystal caverns extend far underground, and the deeper crystals sing differently. The Postronamas leaders who sought the deepest power found it—a resonance that permeates the mind, overwhelming thought, erasing identity.

The madness spread through the pillar network. Civil war erupted as factions blamed each other, as leaders descended into psychosis, as the empire tore itself apart. Survivors scattered. Most died. A few found refuge—on the pillars (becoming the Seyiki), in the musical forest (becoming the Melodians), or into the mysterious Woods of Systoril (fate unknown).

### Legacy

**The Chakatann Pillars:** Still standing, now colonized by Seyiki gnomes. Most are broken or depleted; some still hum.

**Enimogos:** The shattered capital, still resonating with maddening intensity. A death trap for treasure hunters.

**Melodia:** A forest where Postronamas-engineered trees still sing.

**The Seyiki:** Gnomes who merged with Postronamas survivors and inherited fragments of their knowledge.

**Artifacts:** Postronamas relics—crystal-powered devices, insect-chitin armor, resonance tools—command enormous prices. Most are dangerous.

### What They Knew

The Postronamas understood harmonics and resonance at levels modern mages don't match. Their twyl-harvesting technique (using dung beetle wing vibrations at specific frequencies) has never been replicated. Their pillar network demonstrated engineering capabilities that seem impossible.

Whether this knowledge is lost or simply waiting to be rediscovered in Enimogos is a question that draws scholars and fools to the Piktiniti.
