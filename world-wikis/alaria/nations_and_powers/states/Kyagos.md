## Kyagos

Tags: state

### Overview

A mountainous island-nation in the southern seas, Kyagos sits between the Sea of Seven Snakes and the Alrock Ocean. The Aktarvkus Mountains dominate the interior, dividing the island into isolated coastal territories that never unified under a single government. Instead, four city-states emerged: Syvlius, Vassum, Tekos, and Sy—each controlling its own slice of coast, its own mountain approaches, and its own slave-worked mines.

The Sylthik who rule these city-states built a society around visible hierarchy. Scars mark rank: one cheek-scar for minor distinction, five for the highest lords. Outsiders wear handkerchiefs around their necks marking them as rightless visitors. Non-Sylthik races are considered sub-sentient, undeserving of even basic decency.

This arrangement held for centuries. Then Syvlius burned.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederacy of city-states (fractured)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Sylthik, Drasnian slaves, Dead Moon Tribe (humans)

**Population**: ~100,000 (pre-revolution); current numbers uncertain

**Stability**: Crisis

**Core Values**: Discipline, influence, societal rank, power

The scar-ranking system that once defined Kyagosi society is now openly questioned. In Syvlius, it's meaningless—the city is controlled by freed slaves and gangs who never participated in Sylthik customs. In Vassum, refugees have overwhelmed the social order. Only Tekos still enforces the old ways, and their doubled-down brutality suggests desperation rather than confidence.

Non-Sylthik have always been considered property or worse. The revolution hasn't changed that view among the remaining Sylthik—if anything, it's hardened their contempt. But the Drasnians who now control Syvlius's mines have demonstrated that contempt doesn't stop rebellion.

### Economy

**Size**: Large (diminished)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Gems, jewels, metals

**Primary Imports**: Drasnian slaves from Tamadrez (disrupted)

Kyagos's economy has always rested on mining. The Aktarvkus Mountains contain legendary deposits of silver, copper, iron, and gemstones. Drasnian dwarves—shipped from Gorath's Slaver's Coast—extracted this wealth under brutal conditions. The most lucrative mines clustered around Syvlius, feeding an export economy that made the island wealthy despite its isolation.

The revolution shattered this system. Syvlius's trade tower—the infrastructure connecting the island to the astral current that passes 35 miles east of the mountains—was toppled during the uprising. Sky trade has collapsed. The mines still operate, but under chaotic conditions: Drasnian factions fight over claims, production is erratic, and there's no functioning export system.

Tekos sits roughly 35 miles from the same astral current, on the opposite side of the mountains. Before the revolution, this was a disadvantage—they routed exports through Syvlius. Now it's an opportunity, if they can build their own trade tower. The investment would be staggering, but Tekos may have no choice.

Vassum controlled sea trade and overland routes to Syvlius. With that hub destroyed, they're scrambling to find new arrangements. Some merchants are already negotiating directly with Drasnian gang leaders in the ruins.

Sy's silver-focused economy may actually benefit from the chaos—silver is valuable everywhere, and their extraction doesn't depend on Syvlius's infrastructure.

### Military

**Size**: Very small

**Quality**: Very low (except Sy)

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

Military service in Kyagos has traditionally been a mark of failure. If you weren't talented enough for anything else, you were enlisted. The pay was poor, the respect nonexistent. This left all four city-states with paper armies incapable of serious warfare.

The exception is Sy, where constant werewolf pressure forced actual military investment. Sy's border patrols are competent, experienced, and respected—a stark contrast to the ceremonial forces elsewhere.

The revolution exposed this weakness. Syvlius's garrison crumbled when faced with thousands of desperate slaves backed by Dead Moon warriors. The other city-states watched and realized they couldn't have done better.

Tekos is now attempting military reforms, but building a real army takes time they may not have. Vassum has largely given up on military solutions, focusing instead on negotiation and economic adaptation.

### Current Conflicts

**The Syvlius Aftermath**
The revolution succeeded but left chaos. Drasnian factions control different districts of the ruined city, fighting each other over mine claims and resources. The Dead Moon Tribe helped destroy Syvlius but hasn't occupied it—they've retreated to Moonwood, leaving the Drasnians to sort themselves out. No unified government has emerged.

**Slave Unrest**
Every remaining slave in Kyagos has heard what happened in Syvlius. Tekos responds with increased brutality; Vassum tries to maintain order through economic incentives; Sy has quietly reduced the harshest treatment. None of these approaches is working particularly well.

**The Dead Moon Question**
For decades, Kyagos was "at war" with the Dead Moon Tribe in a conflict where neither side inflicted serious damage. The revolution revealed this as deliberate restraint—the tribe was waiting for their moment. Now they've demonstrated real military capability, and no one knows what they want next. Their shamans meet with Drasnian leaders in Syvlius. Their warriors patrol further south than they have in generations. Something is being negotiated.

**Economic Collapse**
The trade tower's destruction cut Kyagos off from the astral current that made sky trade possible. Sea routes remain, but they're slower, more dangerous, and lower capacity. The island's export economy is crippled until someone builds new infrastructure or finds alternative arrangements.

**Werewolf Pressure**
The Ulvsjael of Traevluong don't care about Kyagos's political crisis. They continue probing Sy's borders, picking off isolated patrols, enforcing their territorial claims. Sy can't afford to weaken their eastern defenses regardless of what's happening elsewhere.

**Kuru Opportunism**
The beast-warriors of the Killing Hills and Mythlias have noticed Kyagos's weakness. Raids on Tekos's agricultural settlements have increased. The Kuru aren't numerous enough to threaten the city directly, but they're making life harder for a city-state already under pressure.

### History

The Sylthik arrived on Kyagos centuries ago, displacing the human population that had lived there previously. These humans—the Dead Moon Tribe—retreated into Moonwood rather than submit to Sylthik rule. The new arrivals established city-states around the coastal regions they could defend, discovered the mountain wealth, and built an economy on mining.

The slave trade began when Kyagos's own population proved insufficient for the labor demands of the mines. Connections with Gorath's Slaver's Coast provided a solution: Drasnian dwarves, shipped across the sea in chains, extracted the wealth that made Kyagos prosperous. For three centuries, this arrangement held.

### The Syvlius Revolution

The revolution came suddenly. A band of outsiders—adventurers whose names are now legendary among the Drasnians—saw opportunity in Syvlius's massive slave population and Kyagos's weak military. They made contact with the Dead Moon Tribe, who had been waiting generations for exactly this kind of chance.

When the uprising began, it was coordinated. Slaves rose throughout the city while Dead Moon warriors swept down from Moonwood. The Sylthik garrison, trained for ceremony rather than combat, collapsed. Within days, Syvlius was burning.

The rebels didn't just overthrow the government—they demolished the city. The great trade tower, symbol of Syvlius's economic dominance, was toppled in a final act of destruction. Whether this was strategic (denying the other city-states easy reconquest) or emotional (destroying everything associated with Sylthik rule) depends on who you ask.

The heroes who led the revolution—Xe, Alice, Bryce, Woof, Bordrick, and Snuffles—departed after their victory. They lit the fire and left others to deal with the aftermath. The Drasnians they freed now struggle to build something from the ashes, while the Dead Moon Tribe has retreated to Moonwood with unclear intentions.

### Relations

**Gorath**: Primary source of Drasnian slaves. The revolution disrupts a profitable trade relationship—Gorath may intervene to protect their investment, or may simply redirect slaves elsewhere.

**Tamadrez**: Origin point for Drasnian slaves. News of the Syvlius revolution will spread to enslaved populations throughout the Shacklands.

**Trømgar**: The battle dwarves have long protested Drasnian enslavement. Syvlius's fall may embolden their underground resistance networks.

**Free Colonies**: Founded by Drasnian escapees from the Gorath-Kyagos slave route. They may reach out to the liberated Syvlius—or may stay cautiously distant.

**Phirexes**: Northern neighbor, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes. Minimal contact; the gorgon queen has her own problems.

**Shykasas**: Insular alligator-folk kingdom to the southwest. No meaningful relationship.

### Player Hooks

**Chaos in the Ruins**: Syvlius offers opportunities for those willing to navigate gang politics. Someone needs to broker peace between Drasnian factions, establish trade relationships, or simply loot the wealthy estates before someone else does.

**The Dead Moon Mystery**: What do the tribal shamans want? Their meetings with Drasnian leaders suggest plans beyond simple revenge. An outsider might learn things neither side would share with Kyagosi.

**Werewolf Diplomacy**: Sy has begun cautious outreach to the Ulvsjael. An envoy who could actually communicate with the werewolves—or survive long enough to try—would be invaluable.

**The Trade Tower Race**: Both Tekos and Vassum want to build replacement infrastructure for the astral trade. The engineering challenges are immense, the financial stakes enormous, and sabotage from rivals is guaranteed.

**The Underground Railroad**: Escaped slaves from Tekos need routes to safety. The traditional paths through Syvlius are now chaotic rather than hostile—is that better or worse?

**Skyreach Secrets**: The ancient fortress in the mountains predates Sylthik settlement. With Kyagos destabilized, someone might finally investigate what it was built for—and whether anything useful remains.
