## Myastor

Tags: state

Very poor. Once shared governance among the three Ofrenian kingdoms; post-fragmentation, it was granted to the Queen of Sylke. Alisandra sees it as a dump and uses it for political prisoners and unofficial exile.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Colonial administration (under Sylke)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Survival, keeping one's head down, minding one's business

- Myastor is ruled by a governor appointed by Queen Alisandra—always someone she wants out of her sight but not quite dead.
- The population is a mix of longtime residents, transported criminals, political exiles, and people who ended up here by accident and never left.
- No one chooses to live in Myastor. You're born here, sent here, or stranded here. Leaving requires money, connections, or both.
- The locals have developed a grim solidarity. Everyone has a past they don't discuss. Questions about how someone arrived are deeply rude.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Lumber, transshipment services

**Primary Imports**: Prisoners, everything else

- Myastor's economy is almost entirely based on its position. Ships stopping on the way to Sylke need provisions, repairs, and places to offload inconvenient cargo. The island provides all three.
- Lots of money flows through Myastor; almost none of it stays. Merchants arrive, conduct business, and leave. The locals see wealth pass by but can't capture it.
- Lumber from the interior provides some legitimate export, but the forests are thinning and no one invests in replanting.
- The prison economy is grimly important. Feeding, housing, and guarding prisoners employs a significant fraction of the population. When prisoner shipments slow, the whole island feels it.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (desperate)

- The garrison exists to guard prisoners and discourage pirates. It's understaffed, poorly equipped, and stationed here as punishment.
- Sylke's navy calls at Shipton regularly, which provides actual security. The local garrison is largely for show.
- Prison guards are technically military but function more like jailers. The distinction matters to no one except payroll clerks.

### Geography

**Location**: Paluva Amati island, in the Ofrenia Passage east of Ofrenia proper

**Biomes**: Scrubland, thinning forests, rocky coasts

**Named Entities**: Paluva Amati (island name)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Small streams, no significant bodies of water

**Adjacent Waters**: The Ofrenia Passage, the Middle Sea

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Shipton

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: Shipton, Telara, Partsmouth, Pasterton

**Villages**: Scattered fishing and lumber camps

### Primary Conflicts

**The Exile Economy**

Myastor's prosperity—such as it is—depends on Alisandra continuing to send prisoners and exiles. If she conquers Joswik and runs out of political enemies, the island's economy collapses. The governor privately hopes the war drags on forever.

**The Prison Population**

The prisoners outnumber the guards, and everyone knows it. The system works because escape from the island is nearly impossible and because the prisoners include many who've simply given up. But as conditions deteriorate and new arrivals bring fresh grievances, the balance grows more precarious.

**The Sylke Relationship**

Myastor exists at Alisandra's sufferance. The queen sees it as a dumping ground, not a priority. Requests for resources, personnel, or attention go unanswered. The governor has learned to manage without support—but in a crisis, no help is coming.

**The Passing Trade**

Merchants who stop in Shipton could bring prosperity if they stayed. They don't. The locals resent being treated as a waystation, but lack leverage to change anything. Some have begun exploring ways to make Myastor more attractive—or more necessary—to passing ships.

### History

Paluva Amati was settled generations ago as a waystation for ships crossing the Passage. The three Ofrenian kingdoms shared governance, using the island as neutral ground for negotiations and as a convenient place to warehouse people they'd rather forget.

When the old king died and his children divided Ofrenia, no one wanted Myastor. Tornia had enough ports. Joswik had no navy to speak of. Sylke needed a place to send problems. Alisandra claimed it by default, and her siblings were happy to let her.

Under Alisandra's rule, Myastor has become a dumping ground. Political prisoners fill the old warehouses-turned-prisons. Nobles who annoyed the queen find themselves "governing" the island until they die of boredom or despair. The locals have adapted, building an economy around human misery.

The conquest of Tornia has actually benefited Myastor slightly—refugee ships stop here, desperate for supplies and willing to pay premium prices. But the governor knows this prosperity is temporary. Once Alisandra consolidates her gains, the refugee flow will stop, and Myastor will return to its role as a place the world forgets.
