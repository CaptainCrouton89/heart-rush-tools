## Knova

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Institutional meritocracy (the Academy IS the state)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Mixed (students and faculty from across Alaria), Triton (defensive forces)

**Population**: ~6,000 permanent (fluctuates to ~10,000 during peak enrollment)

**Stability**: Extremely stable (clear hierarchy, absolute authority)

**Core Values**: Martial excellence, earned rank, the purity of combat

Knova isn't a nation that happens to contain a famous academy—it's an academy that happens to be a nation. The Iron Academy governs absolutely. The Commandant speaks with the authority of a king. Students and faculty form the population. There are no citizens, only practitioners.

The hierarchy is brutally simple: your rank depends on your combat record. Win fights, rise. Lose, fall. The Commandant holds their position because no one has defeated them—and many have tried. The current Commandant, **Irontide Vesk**, earned his title by killing a deep-sea serpent in single combat. The beast's skull still adorns the central courtyard.

Triton warriors patrol the surrounding waters under an ancient compact. They defend Knova's shores; in exchange, their warriors receive free training at any of the three schools. This has made Knova's triton alumni some of the most dangerous fighters in the undersea kingdoms—and ensures no naval force can approach the islands without a fight.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (but wealthy)

**Tech**: Advanced metallurgy, standard otherwise

**Primary Exports**: Trained warriors, tactical consultation, refined metals, weapons

**Primary Imports**: Food (almost everything), luxury goods, raw materials, students

Knova's economy runs on tuition and iron.

The islands are phenomenally metal-rich—iron, copper, tin, and traces of rarer ores. The forges run constantly, producing weapons and armor of exceptional quality. But the real product is people. A graduate of the Iron Academy commands premium wages anywhere in Alaria. A recommendation from Blackwater can make a general's career. Seatower alumni lead mercenary companies across the continent.

Tuition is steep. Noble families pay fortunes to train their heirs. Mercenary companies sponsor promising recruits as investments. Some students earn their way through arena victories—Knova's training matches draw betting crowds from across the Western Isles.

Food is the weakness. The rocky islands grow almost nothing. Everything must be imported. The triton help with fishing, but grain, vegetables, and livestock all arrive by ship. Knova maintains strategic reserves, but a determined blockade could starve them out—if anyone could get past the triton.

### Military

**Size**: Small but elite

**Quality**: Best individual fighters in Alaria

**Enrollment**: Students and faculty (everyone trains)

Every resident of Knova is a warrior—or training to become one. There's no separate military because the entire population IS the military.

The three schools each produce different specialists:

**Iron Academy** (main island): Personal combat in all forms. Sword, spear, axe, bare hands—students master multiple disciplines before specializing. Graduates are among the deadliest individual fighters alive.

**Seatower**: Tactics, command, and wargames. Students learn to lead units, plan campaigns, and think three moves ahead. The fortress hosts constant war simulations; commanding officers from across Alaria pay to observe.

**Blackwater**: History, strategy, and logistics. The unglamorous school, and the smallest—but arguably the most valuable. Wars are won by supply lines. Blackwater graduates keep armies fed, equipped, and moving.

The triton legion numbers around 500 warriors at any time, rotating through training cycles. They fight from the water—ambushing approaching ships, dragging sailors overboard, turning the sea itself into a killing ground.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Western Isles, south of the Iron Sea

**Biomes**: Rocky islands, mineral-rich terrain, deep surrounding waters

**Climate**: Temperate maritime, frequent storms

**Named Features**: Iron Academy (main fortress), Seatower (western fortress), Blackwater (northern fortress)

The Knova archipelago consists of a dozen significant islands and scores of rocky outcroppings. The three largest islands host the three schools; the smaller ones contain mines, training grounds, and support facilities.

The main island rises steeply from the water, its central fortress built directly into the rock. Iron reinforcement makes the walls nearly impervious—hence the name. The harbor is a narrow channel, easily defended, with triton patrols making underwater approach suicidal.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Iron Academy fortress (no other name—the fortress IS Knova)

**Other Settlements**: Seatower (western island), Blackwater (northern island)

### The Three Schools

**Iron Academy** (~4,000 residents)

The heart of Knova. A towering fortress of iron-reinforced stone rising from the central island. Training yards, sparring halls, armories, dormitories—all built for one purpose: creating fighters.

Students train for years, progressing through ranked tiers. Combat matches determine advancement. The annual Iron Tournament draws observers from across Alaria; victory guarantees employment anywhere.

**Commandant Irontide Vesk** rules from the Iron Throne—literally a chair forged from weapons taken from defeated challengers. He's held the position for twenty-three years. Before that, he held it for twelve years, lost it, spent eight years rebuilding his skills, then reclaimed it by defeating his replacement in single combat.

**Seatower** (~1,500 residents)

The western fortress, built on a rocky spire overlooking the shipping lanes. Seatower produces commanders, not fighters. Students study tactics through endless wargames—mock battles using ship models, sand tables, and (weather permitting) actual vessels.

**Battlemaster Kenna Stormwright** leads Seatower. She's never lost a wargame. Her actual combat experience is limited, which some Iron Academy purists consider disqualifying—but her tactical record is flawless.

**Blackwater** (~800 residents)

The northern fortress, named for the dark waters of its harbor. The smallest school, focused on strategy and logistics. Students learn supply calculation, terrain analysis, historical campaigns, and the unglamorous work that makes wars possible.

**Archon Drell Marshkeeper** runs Blackwater. He's seventy years old, has never won a fight in his life, and has helped plan three successful invasions. The Iron Academy sneers at him. Former employers worship him.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Meritocracy Problem**

Knova's system works—until it doesn't. When the Commandant is strong, everyone respects the hierarchy. When the Commandant weakens, challenges multiply. Irontide Vesk is still formidable, but he's aging. The next few years will see increasing challenges, political maneuvering, and potentially a bloody succession.

**Triton Tensions**

The triton compact has held for centuries, but some younger triton question why they should defend surface-dwellers. The training is valuable, but triton society has its own needs. A faction argues for renegotiation—or withdrawal.

**The Food Question**

Every year, Knova's population grows slightly. Every year, food imports must increase. The academy depends on peaceful trade routes—which means staying neutral in regional conflicts. But neutrality limits influence, and influence is how academies attract students.

### Relations

**Allies**: None formal (Knova maintains studied neutrality)

**Trade Partners**: Sheîr (closest port), Tarkhon (wealthy students), various merchant fleets

**Enemies**: None declared (but many grudges from training accidents and tournament injuries)

Knova's neutrality is its greatest asset and its greatest vulnerability. They train anyone who pays—noble heirs, mercenary recruits, even occasional pirates. This makes them universally useful and universally distrusted.

The triton connection provides some diplomatic weight. Offending Knova risks offending the undersea kingdoms. But this cuts both ways; triton politics occasionally drag Knova into conflicts they'd rather avoid.

### Notable Figures

**Commandant Irontide Vesk** — Current leader of Knova and the Iron Academy. A massive man scarred from decades of combat, famous for killing a deep-sea serpent solo. Aging but still deadly. His succession is the unspoken question hanging over everything.

**Battlemaster Kenna Stormwright** — Leader of Seatower. Brilliant tactician, mediocre fighter. Her wargame record is undefeated; her actual command experience is theoretical. Some respect her; others consider her an academic playing soldier.

**Archon Drell Marshkeeper** — Leader of Blackwater. Ancient, physically unimpressive, strategically invaluable. He's planned supply lines for half the successful campaigns in the last fifty years.

**Tide-Captain Muravel** — Senior triton commander. Liaison between Knova and the undersea kingdoms. She's trained three generations of triton warriors here and has strong opinions about the compact's future.

### History

**The Founding** (~400 years ago): A legendary warrior named Knovus established a training camp on the iron-rich islands after being exiled from his homeland (accounts vary on which). Students came. A school formed. The school became a fortress. The fortress became a nation.

**The Triton Compact** (~350 years ago): Early Knova faced constant pirate raids. A triton warrior named Deepcurrent offered a deal: his people would defend the waters if their warriors could train at the academy. The compact has held ever since.

**The Three Schools**: Originally there was only the Iron Academy. Seatower split off when tactical training outgrew its space. Blackwater formed later, when graduates demanded strategic education to match their combat skills.

**The Present**: Knova at its peak—famous, wealthy, influential. But an aging Commandant and growing triton restlessness suggest changes are coming.
