## Ubrik

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Democracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Uline (Chain Dwarves)

**Population**: 30,000 (and falling)

**Stability**: Catastrophic

**Core Values**: Wealth, honor, determination, grit

- Class ranking determined by land ownership. Wealthy mine-owners at top, landless workers at bottom—trapped in debt, working the mines to survive.
- Uline are stubborn, pragmatic, and respect authority. The democracy functions through councils of landowners; the landless have no vote.
- Even before the outbreak, Ubrik was a powder keg—brutal class disparity, cruel working conditions, and simmering resentment.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium (collapsing)

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Metals (formerly)

**Primary Imports**: Food, luxury items for the rich

- Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though the alliance is straining under Ubrik's crisis.
- The wealthy lived in luxury while miners lived in destitution. Now the wealthy are fleeing with their gold while the poor are left to deal with the infected.
- Most mines have been abandoned or overrun by silvertongues.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Very low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Ubrik military consists of conscripted peasants with little training and no desire to fight.
- Completely inadequate to contain the silvertongue outbreak. Military units sent into infected mines rarely return.

### Geography

**Location**: Middle Sea coast, between Camaran (east) and Bestacia (west)

**Biomes**: Mountainous highlands, mining valleys, sparse forests

**Climate**: Temperate continental, cold in the mountain heights

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Grothak (partially evacuated)

**Cities**: Grothak, various mining settlements (many abandoned or overrun)

**Towns**: Refugee camps forming along southern borders

### The Silvertongue Outbreak

**Slick Silver** is a corrupted mineral discovered in Ubrik's deepest mines—a shimmering, mercury-like substance that calls to those who see it. Miners who touched it felt compelled to taste it. Those who consumed it transformed.

The infection spreads through ingestion. Victims' mouths fill with liquid silver that coats their teeth and tongue, eventually spreading through the bloodstream. The silver drives them into cannibalistic madness—they lose all reason, attacking and consuming the living. Their eyes turn metallic, their veins visible as silver threads beneath the skin.

**The silvertongues** retain enough cunning to hunt. They don't just wander—they pursue, ambush, and overwhelm. Worse, they seem driven to spread the infection, forcing Slick Silver down victims' throats.

The outbreak started in the northern mines. Poor miners were exposed first—the wealthy owners didn't go underground. By the time anyone understood what was happening, entire mining communities had turned. Now the silvertongues are spreading beyond the mines, raiding nearby settlements and even crossing into neighboring states.

There is no known cure. Quarantine and extermination are the only containment measures, and they're failing.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Spreading Plague**

Silvertongues have escaped the mines and now terrorize the countryside. Their numbers grow with every settlement they overrun. Ubrik's military cannot contain them. The infected are spreading into Bestacia and threatening Camaran's eastern border.

**The Refugee Crisis**

Thousands of Ubrik dwarves have fled south and west, pouring into Bestacia, Camaran, and other neighboring states. They bring nothing but fear and desperation. Host countries are overwhelmed; some are closing borders. Rumors that any Ubrik dwarf might be infected are causing persecution and violence against refugees.

**Political Fallout**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold it together, but member states blame each other for the crisis. Camaran is using the outbreak to justify further isolationism. Bestacia is dealing with both refugees and silvertongue incursions.

**Internal Collapse**

What remains of Ubrik's government has retreated to the southern regions. The landowners who caused the brutal conditions that made the outbreak worse are now safe behind private guards while the common people suffer. Some refugees are more angry at their own nobility than at the silvertongues.

### History

Ubrik was founded by Uline dwarves who discovered rich mineral veins in the mountains. For centuries, the mines produced iron, copper, and precious metals that made the landowners wealthy. The workers who actually dug the ore saw little of this wealth—trapped in cycles of debt, they had no path to land ownership and no political voice.

The class system was always brutal, but it was stable. Then prospectors struck something new in the deep northern mines—Slick Silver. It glittered beautifully. It seemed valuable. The first miners who touched it couldn't resist tasting it.

Within months, the northern mines went silent. Rescue parties didn't return. By the time the surface understood what had happened, it was too late. The silvertongues emerged hungry, and Ubrik began to die.
