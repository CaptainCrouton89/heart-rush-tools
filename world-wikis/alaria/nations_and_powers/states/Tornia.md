## Tornia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Occupied monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, mixed

**Population**: 400,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Tradition, wealth, spectacle (pre-occupation); resistance, resentment (current)

- Tornia was ruled by King Aldric, eldest son of the late King of Ofrenia who once held all three kingdoms united. Aldric was more interested in the Gem Crest Races than governance, leaving the state to rot from neglect.
- Queen Alisandra of Sylke recently invaded in a "fairly bloodless war"—Tornia's hollowed-out military offered little resistance. The king fled or was captured; the situation remains unclear.
- Sylke's occupation has transformed simmering popular discontent into active rebellion. Alisandra's agents had been stoking revolution for years, but now that she's the occupier, the rebels have turned against her too.
- The nobility are split—some collaborate with Sylke for survival, others fund resistance cells, and many simply fled to Joswik or the mainland.

### Economy

**Size**: Large (collapsing)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Timber, ships, luxury goods, preserved fish, temporal services (illicit)

**Primary Imports**: Grain, wine, mercenaries, luxury goods

- The economy was already bleeding from King Aldric's obsession with the Gem Crest Races. Occupation has accelerated the collapse.
- The races continue—Alisandra hasn't stopped them, recognizing their value as distraction—but gambling houses now operate under Sylke supervision, and profits flow west.
- Besnoumeru's time-gangs have adapted to occupation with characteristic pragmatism. They're playing both sides, selling information to Sylke authorities while quietly supporting rebels who can pay.
- Trade routes are disrupted. Merchants avoid Ofrenia entirely when they can, routing through Myastor or the mainland.

### Military

**Size**: Small (remnant)

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (under Sylke command)

- What remains of the Tornian military has been absorbed into Sylke's occupation force or disbanded. Loyalist units fled south to Joswik or scattered into the countryside.
- The navy was captured largely intact—ships are valuable, and Sylke needed them.
- Resistance cells operate throughout the countryside. They're poorly coordinated but growing, drawing from disaffected soldiers, dispossessed nobles, and common folk who've had enough.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Occupation**

Sylke's armies hold Tornia, but holding isn't the same as controlling. Alisandra's troops garrison the major towns and patrol the roads, but the countryside seethes with resistance. Every week brings reports of ambushed supply wagons, assassinated collaborators, and occupation soldiers found dead in ditches.

**The Failed Revolution**

Alisandra spent years stoking revolution in Tornia, planning to sweep in as liberator once the old regime fell. Instead, she invaded before the revolution matured—and now the rebels she cultivated have turned against her. They wanted freedom, not a different queen.

**The Time-Gang Opportunism**

Besnoumeru's time-gangs see opportunity in chaos. They're selling intelligence to everyone, manipulating markets more brazenly than ever, and quietly acquiring the properties of fled nobles. Some suspect they're positioning themselves to emerge from the occupation as the real power in Tornia.

**Glowbud Forest**

The royal menagerie's escaped jaguars have transformed Glowbud Forest into a death trap. The great cats hunt humans now. Occupation forces avoid the forest; rebels use its edges as refuge, accepting the risk.

### History

Tornia was once the seat of power for all Ofrenia. The previous king—father to Aldric, Alisandra, and their brother in Joswik—united the island through diplomacy, marriage, and occasional war. Under his rule, Ofrenia prospered. The Gem Crest Races were prestigious events, not gambling dens. The time and darkness ley lines that cross Tornia were studied by respected scholars, not exploited by criminals.

When the old king died, he divided Ofrenia among his three children, expecting them to rule in harmony. Instead, they turned on each other within a year.

Tornia received Aldric, the eldest—handsome, charming, and utterly uninterested in governance. He inherited the richest kingdom and the strongest claim to reunification, then squandered both on pleasure and spectacle. The races consumed his attention. The treasury drained. The borders weakened.

Alisandra watched from Sylke, patient as a spider. She sent agents to fan revolutionary sentiment, bribed border commanders, and waited for the perfect moment. When she finally moved, Tornia's military collapsed in weeks. The "bloodless war" was bloodless because there was barely anyone willing to fight for Aldric.

Now Tornia is occupied territory, and Alisandra is learning that conquest is easier than rule. The land remembers better days—ancient roads built by forgotten empires, temples to half-forgotten gods, pre-human ruins beneath Catalina where the time-gangs learned their craft. That history doesn't belong to Sylke, and Tornia's people haven't forgotten it.
