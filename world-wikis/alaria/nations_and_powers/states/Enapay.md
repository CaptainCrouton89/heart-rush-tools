## Enapay

Tags: state

An ancient Dwelyn monarchy occupying the Green Wilds at the edge of the Ishnit Jungles. For as long as the Dwelyn have existed as a people, Enapay has been their home—and for nearly as long, Surrey Mahaila has been their protector. Now the dragon sickens, and the nation faces its first true crisis in generations.

### Geography

Enapay sprawls across the Green Wilds, a transitional zone where the dense Ishnit Jungle gives way to more open woodland. The terrain is still wild—massive trees, thick undergrowth, dangerous fauna—but navigable in ways the deep jungle is not. Rivers cut through the territory, providing trade routes and defensive boundaries.

The capital, **Lise**, sits where the Ishtar River delta meets the edge of the Green Wilds, roughly thirty miles inland from the Gulf of Norag.

### Government

Enapay is ruled by a hereditary queen whose authority derives from three sources: bloodline, martial prowess, and—most importantly—her bond with Surrey Mahaila.

**The Dragonbound Queen**: The current queen, **Teyara Greenmantle**, inherited the throne and the dragon bond from her mother, who inherited it from hers. This matrilineal succession has continued unbroken since before written Dwelyn history. The queen is believed to share some portion of Surrey Mahaila's consciousness—what the dragon knows, the queen can learn, and vice versa.

**Clan Chiefs**: Below the queen, the Dwelyn organize into clans led by chiefs who earn their position through combat and the accumulation of war trophies (the beads that signify Dwelyn influence). Chiefs manage their clan's territory and contribute warriors to the queen's campaigns.

**The Empty Throne Problem**: With Surrey Mahaila ill, Queen Teyara's authority has weakened. The dragon bond still exists but feels muted, distant. Some chiefs whisper that if the dragon dies, so does the queen's legitimacy—and succession by combat might replace succession by blood.

### Culture

The Dwelyn combine elven grace with orcish pragmatism. They value both the beauty of the kill and its efficiency.

**Bead Status**: Social standing is literally worn. The more beads woven into a Dwelyn's hair—crafted from the remains of defeated enemies—the greater their influence. A heavily-beaded warrior can challenge a poorly-beaded chief; a chief with few beads rules only at the sufferance of those with more.

**Jungle Craft**: Despite living at the jungle's edge, the Dwelyn have mastered its ways. Their hunters track prey through dense undergrowth, their warriors use the terrain for ambush and escape, and their shamans brew medicines from jungle plants that outsiders have never catalogued.

**The Dragon Cult**: Surrey Mahaila is not worshipped as a god, but revered as a living ancestor. The Dwelyn believe she chose them in the time before time, and their bond with her is what separates them from mere beasts. Her illness is not just a strategic problem—it's a spiritual crisis.

### The Dragon's Sickness

Surrey Mahaila has grown weak. The emerald dragon, once capable of devastating enemy armies and inspiring terror across the region, now rarely leaves her roost. Her scales have dulled. Her mind, once sharp enough to coordinate with Queen Teyara across miles, feels foggy and slow.

The cause is known but not understood: **the Faesong has been poisoned nearby**.

Faesong—the ambient magical melody of Melera that flows through creation—runs strong through the Green Wilds. Surrey Mahaila, a dragon of darkness, water, and earth, has always been attuned to this harmony. Something has corrupted the local Faesong, and the dragon suffers for it.

What poisoned it? Theories abound:
- Shadow emergence from Ekomorn tainting the magical currents
- Demonic influence spreading from Demonwatch
- Deliberate sabotage by enemies (the Naruaghin? The snake dragons?)
- Natural magical phenomenon that will pass in time
- Something older and stranger, awakened by some unknown trigger

Queen Teyara has sent agents throughout Alaria seeking answers. Healers, druids, fae scholars, anyone who understands Faesong has been invited (or compelled) to examine the dragon. So far, nothing has worked.

### The War

Enapay's expansion into East Naruaghin territory began three generations ago and seemed destined to succeed. With Surrey Mahaila's support, Dwelyn armies pushed deep into the jungle fringe, establishing settlements and claiming the best hunting grounds.

Then the dragon sickened.

The war has shifted. Dwelyn forces fight defensively now, protecting what they've taken rather than seizing more. East Naruaghin raids strike deeper into Dwelyn territory each season. Queen Teyara must balance the need to maintain pressure against the need to conserve forces for when—if—the dragon recovers.

### Economy

Enapay trades in jungle goods: exotic feathers, rare medicines, ironwood, and the products of skilled Dwelyn craftsmanship. Their curved scimitars and bone-and-fur armor fetch high prices from merchants brave enough to reach the Green Wilds.

The nation has no port—the Gulf of Norag coast is too dangerous, and the Naruaghin control the shoreline. Trade flows overland or upriver, making commerce slow but relatively secure.

### Notable Locations

**Lise**: The capital. See separate entry.

**The Dragon's Roost**: Surrey Mahaila's lair, built into a colossal jungle tree near Lise. Once the dragon's presence radiated power; now it radiates illness.

**Ishtar Ford**: The contested border crossing, currently held by Dwelyn forces but constantly threatened.

**The Green Marches**: The newest Dwelyn settlements, carved from jungle claimed in the last century. Most vulnerable to Naruaghin counter-attack.

### Player Hooks

**Cure the Dragon**: The ultimate quest hook. Anyone who could restore Surrey Mahaila would earn the eternal gratitude of the Dwelyn queen—and the enmity of the Naruaghin.

**Faesong Investigation**: What poisoned the local Faesong? Investigating could lead to Ekomorn, Demonwatch, or somewhere else entirely.

**War Profiteering**: Both sides need weapons, information, and deniable assets. There's coin to be made in the middle of a conflict.

**Dragon Succession**: If Surrey Mahaila dies, what happens? Could another dragon be bonded? Would the nation tear itself apart in succession crisis?
