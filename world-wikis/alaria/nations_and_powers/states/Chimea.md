## Chimea

Links: States

Chimea is a hungry nation. Its jungles sprawl across southwestern Ve, its mines burrow into the Blood Mountains, its colonies spread across the Emerald Coast of distant Rimihuica, and still it wants more. The Chimean Empire—they call themselves that now, though the title is barely a century old—is built on expansion, exploitation, and the unshakeable belief that strength justifies itself.

The irony is that Chimea's success comes not from military genius but from relentless opportunism. When the Aureum dwarves were weakened by internal strife, Chimea annexed their territories. When the Boneswamps made the northern border impassable, Chimea turned south and crossed the ocean. When New Chimea needed soldiers to fight elves and lizardfolk, the homeland sent convicts and debtors. Chimea doesn't plan conquests—it simply never stops probing for weakness, and when it finds one, it pushes.

The result is an empire stretched thin and held together by coercion. The Aureum in the Blood Mountains resist assimilation. The colonial governors in New Chimea pursue their own agendas. The Suki Jungle swallows settlements whole. And beneath the veneer of imperial confidence, the throne in Chimus knows that Chimea's reach has finally exceeded its grasp.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (Chimean), Naga, Aureum (subject population)

**Population**: 200,000

**Stability**: Stable (domestically); Unstable (in colonies and annexed territories)

**Core Values**: Strength, expansion, wealth, ambition

- Emperor Valdris III has ruled for thirty-two years, inheriting a kingdom and declaring it an empire. His title is grand; his authority is real. The Emperor's word is law, and the noble houses that once contested royal power have been systematically reduced to ceremonial roles. The secret police—the Quiet Office—ensure that ambition remains channeled toward external enemies.
- Chimean society is stratified by birth, wealth, and usefulness to the state. The old noble families retain prestige but little power. The merchant houses control trade and pay for the privilege. The military offers advancement to commoners willing to bleed for the Empire. At the bottom, convicts and debtors are shipped to New Chimea as "redemption colonists"—a polite term for expendable labor.
- The Naga occupy a peculiar position. These serpentine peoples have lived in the Suki Jungle since before humans arrived, and their relationship with Chimea is technically alliance rather than subjugation. Naga nobles attend the imperial court; Naga warriors serve in elite units. In practice, the alliance is increasingly one-sided, and younger Naga chafe at the arrangement.
- The Aureum dwarves are subjects, not citizens. Chimea conquered their Blood Mountain territories three generations ago, and the occupation has never been accepted. Aureum pay higher taxes, face restrictions on weapon ownership, and are excluded from military service. A low-grade resistance simmers constantly; the Quiet Office spends as much effort suppressing dwarven dissent as monitoring human rivals.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Rubies, iron, exotic hardwoods, jungle products, Naga silk, colonial goods

**Primary Imports**: Grain, manufactured goods, weapons, slaves (for colonial labor)

- The Blood Mountains are Chimea's treasure vault—ruby deposits, iron veins, and copper seams that would make any nation wealthy. The problem is extraction. The Bloodlings control the deepest mines and emerge at night to prey on workers. The Aureum population resents their conquerors and works slowly when they work at all. Every gemstone that reaches Chimus is stained with someone's blood.
- The Suki Jungle produces hardwoods, medicinal plants, exotic spices, and Naga silk—the last being nearly as valuable as Lyzine silk, though the Naga resent the comparison. Jungle harvesting is dangerous work, and the labor force relies heavily on convicts working off sentences.
- Trade with New Chimea is theoretically profitable: the colony produces tropical goods, and the homeland provides manufactured supplies. In practice, the ocean crossing is expensive and dangerous, and the colony increasingly produces what it needs locally. The trade balance has been shifting for years.
- Chimea imports grain from Avalon (the Suki Jungle doesn't farm well) and weapons from Dern (ironic, given the old wars). The grain dependency gives Avalon leverage; the weapons trade gives Dern gold. Neither relationship is comfortable.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (domestic); Conscription (colonial)

**The Imperial Legions**: Chimea maintains four legions of professional soldiers, each numbering roughly 5,000. The First Legion guards the capital and serves as the Emperor's personal force. The Second patrols the Blood Mountains and suppresses Aureum unrest. The Third watches the Dern border and the Boneswamps. The Fourth rotates between jungle pacification and colonial deployment.

**The Naga Cohorts**: Elite units of Naga warriors serve alongside the legions, specializing in jungle warfare and night operations. Their loyalty is to the alliance, not the Emperor personally—a distinction that makes some generals nervous.

**The Colonial Militia**: New Chimea fields its own forces, technically under imperial command but practically autonomous. Colonial troops are predominantly conscripts and redemption colonists, stiffened by a core of professional officers.

- Chimean military doctrine emphasizes flexibility and sustained pressure. They don't win wars with brilliant maneuvers; they win by refusing to stop. Campaigns in the Blood Mountains have ground on for generations. The colonial wars have lasted decades. Chimea accepts casualties that would break other nations.
- The Quiet Office maintains its own armed branch for internal security—secret police who answer directly to the Emperor and operate outside military command. Their exact numbers are unknown; their reputation is terrifying.

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Ve, extending from Traitor Bay and the Gulf of Chimea through the Blood Mountains and Suki Jungle

**Biomes**: Tropical jungle, mountains, coastal plains, swampland

**Named Entities**: Blood Mountains, Suki Jungle (West Suki, South Suki, North Suki), Boneswamps

**Rivers & Lakes**: Tonyfall River, Shoosus River (seasonal)

**Adjacent Waters**: Traitor Bay, Gulf of Chimea

- The Suki Jungle dominates Chimea's heartland—a vast tropical forest divided into three regions. West Suki stretches from the Blood Mountains to the coast, relatively tamed and settled. South Suki covers the southern interior, wilder but productive. North Suki borders the Boneswamps and Dern, and is the most dangerous region—close to enemy territory and haunted by the war dead.
- The Blood Mountains form the northwestern spine of Chimea's territory—conquered Aureum lands rich in minerals and infested with Bloodlings. The mountains are essential to Chimea's economy and a constant drain on its military.
- The Boneswamps mark the border with Dern—a cursed wetland where the dead from ancient wars still walk. Neither nation claims the Boneswamps; both patrol their edges. The swamps serve as an effective barrier, which is the only reason Chimea and Dern aren't currently at war.
- Traitor Bay earned its name from a naval battle where Chimean captains switched sides during a civil war. The bay is now Chimea's primary western port, though the name remains an uncomfortable reminder.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Chimus
**Cities**: Old Tyabb
**Towns**: Port Vincent, Miltalie, Kargunyah, Nugent, Aldaville, Frowat
**Villages**: Dozens scattered throughout the jungle and mountains

**Chimus** — The imperial capital sprawls across the southern plains where the Suki Jungle opens into cultivated territory. Perhaps 40,000 people live here, making it Ve's second-largest city after Shyona's capital. The city was built for display: broad avenues, marble government buildings, the massive Imperial Palace complex. The message is clear—Chimea is powerful, wealthy, and permanent.

The reality is more complicated. Chimus's grand façade covers cramped worker districts, ethnic enclaves where Aureum and Naga maintain their own customs, and a thriving underworld that the Quiet Office can suppress but never eliminate. The city works, but it works despite itself.

**Old Tyabb** — The gateway to New Chimea and Chimea's most important inland city. Old Tyabb sits where the western jungle meets the coastal road to Port Vincent, serving as the staging ground for colonial expeditions. Soldiers, supplies, convicts, and "redemption colonists" all pass through here on their way to the ships. The city is perhaps 15,000 people—a rough mix of military administrators, merchants supplying the colonial trade, and the desperate hoping for a new start across the ocean.

Old Tyabb has the character of a city perpetually saying goodbye. The taverns are full of people drinking away their last nights on Ve; the temples do brisk business in blessings for safe voyage; the loan sharks extend credit to colonists who'll never return to repay. It's not a pleasant place, but it's essential—the funnel through which Chimea feeds its distant ambitions.

**Port Vincent** — Chimea's primary western port, built around a natural harbor on Traitor Bay. Ships bound for New Chimea depart from here, as does most of Chimea's sea trade. The town is rough, commercial, and cosmopolitan in the way port towns become—criminals, merchants, and desperate colonists mixing in dockside taverns.

**Blood Mountain Settlements** — The conquered Aureum territories are administered from towns within the range itself. Gilla serves as the primary administrative center for the occupation, processing ore and coordinating the Second Legion's patrols. Jenolan Caves is a mining community literally built into cavern systems—and the site of frequent Bloodling incursions from the depths. Jindivick, Gorokan, Hell Creek, and Bumbaldry are extraction settlements deep in the range, while Courangra, Narara, and Boggabilla sit on the jungle-mountain border. Life is hard; Bloodling attacks are common; Aureum resistance makes every night uncertain.

**Jungle Towns** — Miltalie, Kargunyah, and Nugent anchor the interior jungle territories, while Aldaville and Frowat control the Tonyfall River. These towns harvest the jungle's resources and maintain roads that the forest constantly tries to reclaim. Many smaller villages dot the Suki—Harrismith, Tumut Shire, Portagabea, Huntley, Muringo, and dozens more—tiny outposts that appear and disappear as the jungle allows.

**Border Settlements** — The eastern edge of Chimea, near the Boneswamps, hosts nervous communities that watch for the walking dead: Bowning, Kinglake, Chatford, Broughton, Nymboida. These are not prosperous places. People live here because they have no better options.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Aureum Resistance**: Three generations of occupation have not produced acceptance. Aureum sabotage mining operations, assassinate officials, and dream of liberation. The resistance is decentralized—no single leader to capture—and the Quiet Office's brutal methods create martyrs faster than they eliminate threats.
- **The Colonial War**: In New Chimea, the Empire fights elves in Vystrilik and skirmishes with the Ix Tyrann lizardfolk. The war has lasted decades with no end in sight. Each year drains more resources; each year the homeland asks what it's getting in return.
- **The Blood Mountains**: Controlling conquered territory while extracting resources while fighting Bloodling incursions while suppressing resistance is a four-front war disguised as occupation. The Second Legion is permanently deployed; replacements arrive constantly; the costs never stop.
- **The Succession Question**: Emperor Valdris III is sixty-four and in declining health. His heir, Prince Aldric, is capable but untested. Various noble houses—supposedly powerless—are quietly positioning for influence in the next reign. The Quiet Office watches everyone.
- **The Naga Alliance**: Younger Naga leaders increasingly view the alliance as exploitation. Chimea takes Naga warriors, Naga silk, Naga knowledge of the jungle—and gives back a seat at a court that treats them as exotic curiosities. A formal break would be catastrophic for Chimea's jungle territories, but current trends suggest it's a matter of when, not if.

### History

Chimea began as one of several human kingdoms in southwestern Ve, distinguished only by its position between jungle and mountains. For centuries, it competed with neighbors, won some wars, lost others, and remained unremarkable.

The transformation began roughly 300 years ago, when the War of Bone against Dern ended in mutual exhaustion and the Boneswamps became impassable. Unable to expand north, Chimea turned its attention to the Aureum territories in the Blood Mountains. A century of pressure—economic, military, diplomatic—culminated in conquest. The Aureum kingdom fell; its people became subjects; its mines became Chimean property.

With mountain wealth funding expansion, Chimea pushed into the deeper Suki Jungle, negotiating alliance with the Naga rather than fighting them. The alliance was genuinely mutual at first—the Naga gained access to Chimean metalwork and trade goods; Chimea gained jungle expertise and warriors. Over generations, the balance has shifted.

The colonial era began eighty years ago, when Chimean explorers reached the Emerald Coast of Rimihuica and found the Jungles of Godahi. New Chimea was founded; settlers arrived; conflict with the native elves and lizardfolk proved inevitable. The colonial war has now lasted longer than some nations' entire histories.

Emperor Valdris III declared the Empire thirty-two years ago, formalizing what had become obvious—Chimea had outgrown kingdom status. The title changed nothing practical, but it signaled intent. Chimea means to rule, and it means to keep ruling, whatever the cost.

### Hooks

- **The Aureum Conspiracy**: A coordinated uprising is being planned in the Blood Mountains—not spontaneous resistance, but something organized. Someone is smuggling weapons. Someone is coordinating cells. The Quiet Office knows something is coming but can't find the leadership.
- **The Naga Secession**: A faction of young Naga nobles is preparing to withdraw from the alliance and declare the jungle territories independent. They're seeking outside support—from Dern, from Avalon, from anyone who'd benefit from Chimean weakness.
- **The Colonial Recall**: New Chimea's governor has stopped sending taxes and started issuing his own currency. He claims loyalty to the Empire but acts like a sovereign. Someone needs to go assess whether this is autonomy or rebellion.
- **The Boneswamps Incursion**: Something has riled up the dead in the Boneswamps—they're pushing deeper into Chimean territory than they have in centuries. The border settlements are evacuating. The Third Legion is mobilizing. And reports suggest the dead are organized in a way they've never been before.
- **The Bloodling Bargain**: A Bloodling emissary has approached the Imperial Court with an unprecedented offer: peace in the mines in exchange for... something. The Bloodlings won't say what. The Emperor is curious. The Quiet Office is suspicious. Someone needs to find out what the vampiric gnomes actually want.
