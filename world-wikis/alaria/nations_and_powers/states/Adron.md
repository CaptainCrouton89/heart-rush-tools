**Government Type**: Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Naga

**Population**: 500,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, intelligence, dignity

- The Adrak nobility are famously powerful, well mannered, knowledgeable, and agreeable. They can also be condescending toward non-Naga outsiders, though rarely to the point of rudeness.
- Descendants of the first dragon, Naga have upheld their ancestors' values for eons. "A Naga without honor is no Naga at all" is a famous saying among Naga elders.
- Three major ley lines cross Adron—water, time, and dark—creating numerous intersections that produce an unusually high number of elementally attuned citizens.

### Economy

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Cultural artifacts, financial services, food, ships, iron, luxury goods, magic

**Primary Imports**: Animal products, luxury goods

- The Adrak economy relies heavily on the Royal Adrak Bank, famous for funding both sides of foreign wars and coming out on top regardless of the victor.
- A steady stream of red gold mined out of the Gozwin and Majesty Mountains has provided insane wealth to the nobility of Adrak, and is the source of the famous Adrak jewelry. Red gold is the most valuable currency in Alaria.
- The shipyards of Shipmarsh are among the finest in the Middle Sea, producing both merchant vessels and warships.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Most Adrak citizens are enthusiastic to join the military, due to its prestige and honor. All Naga citizens are drafted at 19, where they serve until they are 23.
- The nobility generally are trained from a younger age to become leaders of the Adrak army, and it is customary for the king or queen of Adron to lead the charge into major battles.

### Geography

**Climate**: Mediterranean—warm, dry summers and mild winters

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Adrak

**Cities**: Shipmarsh, Greyport

**Towns**: Numerous small towns scattered throughout, particularly along the Tenori River and around the western lakes

### Primary Conflicts

- The Dwarf King continues to steal from travelers through the Majesty Mountains. He is descendant of the dwarves who used to live there, believes the resources of the mountains belong to him.
- The Royal Adrak Bank is rumored to be funding all three sides of the War of Three Kingdoms.
- A large influx of Danaki refugees from the Danak-Atyeska war is angering citizens of the northern settlements.
- The dragon Chavux raids ships near The Blades, but killing a dragon is sacrilege—merchants in Greyport would pay handsomely to have the problem "solved" quietly.

### History

Adron was once the land of dragon riders. For centuries, Naga warriors bonded with dragons through sacred rituals at the Maw of Chao, blessed by Damasaki Edara herself. The Adrak dragon cavalry dominated the Middle Sea.

Roughly four centuries ago, the Waterdark conspiracy ended this golden age. The secret order—masters of water and darkness magic who had long resented draconic dominance—performed a coordinated ritual that severed every dragon-bond in Adron simultaneously. The dragons, suddenly feeling nothing for their riders, simply flew away. Many riders died from the psychic shock. Those who survived found they could no longer pass through Oblivion to reach the Maw of Chao.

The royal family preserved their dragon eggs and bred smaller, domesticated dragons—beautiful but nothing like the war-beasts of old. The art of true binding was lost. Modern Naga feel deep pride in their draconic heritage alongside quiet shame that they are no longer dragon riders. Some believe the old bond could be restored; others think attempting it would be an abomination.

Before the Naga, Tritons inhabited this land. Their exodus left drowned ruins beneath the western lakes—remnants of a civilization that departed for the Alrock Ocean eons ago.
