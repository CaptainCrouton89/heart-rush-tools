## Iqes

Tags: state, trade, privateering

A glittering maritime power built on coral and colonization. Iqes's coastal cities are architectural marvels — towers of cultivated pink coral, walls shimmering with mica, plazas where wealth is displayed without shame. The Qindo people who built these cities, and whose labor still sustains them, have been relegated to the bottom of a society ruled by foreign-descended merchant families.

Two centuries ago, Iqes faced absorption by a larger power. The foreign merchants who'd slowly taken economic control formalized their grip through the voting ring system, presenting a unified front that preserved independence while cementing their dominance. The native Qindo were permitted to participate — in theory. In practice, they're sailors on other people's ships, servants in other people's houses, workers whose labor builds wealth they'll never share.

### The Qindo People

The indigenous people of Iqes are distinctive: dark-skinned humans and halflings with piercing blue eyes that seem to catch the light. They share a common culture, a common language (still spoken in the interior, suppressed in the cities), and a common history of dispossession.

**Before the merchants came**, humans farmed and fished the lowlands while halflings lived in elaborate mountain cave-communities. The two peoples traded, intermarried occasionally, and shared spiritual traditions centered on ancestor veneration. The caves held generations of accumulated craft knowledge; the lowland villages held generations of agricultural wisdom. It was not wealthy by foreign standards, but it was theirs.

**The merchant takeover** happened through economics, not armies. Foreign traders arrived with ships, capital, and ambition. Trade deals became debt obligations became ownership of land and resources. The humans were economically subjugated over generations; the halflings faced something worse.

**The cave destruction** remains the defining trauma of Qindo identity. When halflings resisted economic integration — when they refused to abandon their mountain homes for wage labor in the coastal cities — the foreign merchants responded with violence. Cave entrances were collapsed, water sources poisoned, access routes destroyed. The halflings' homes became their tombs.

This wasn't just displacement; it was cultural annihilation. The caves held ancestral shrines, craft traditions, the physical record of halfling history. All gone. The survivors were "incorporated into civilized life" — forced into the coastal economy as a permanent underclass. Elders who remember the caves are still alive. The grief is fresh.

**Modern Qindo** occupy every level of society except the top. Most work as laborers, sailors, servants, craftspeople — essential workers without whom Iqes would collapse. A small middle class exists in Simphiwe, where traditional culture retained more influence. Some Qindo have accumulated enough wealth to purchase voting rings, but they're vastly outnumbered.

The halfling population is particularly marginalized. The cave-destruction trauma is recent enough that survivors still live; their children carry the grief forward. Halfling communities maintain traditions of remembrance, making pilgrimages to the ruined cave-sites, holding ceremonies that preserve what can be preserved.

### The Voting Ring System

Iqes is governed by a council whose members' votes are determined by physical tokens — heavy golden rings worn on the fingers, each one representing a vote. The more rings you hold, the more votes you cast. There is no maximum; the wealthiest ring-holders possess dozens.

**How rings are acquired:**
- **Inheritance** — the most common path; ring-holding families maintain their status across generations
- **Purchase** — possible but deliberately expensive; existing holders keep prices high
- **Debt collection** — fail to repay a ring-holder, lose your ring
- **Council grant** — for "exceptional service," i.e., corruption and political favors
- **Force** — rare and risky; taking rings by violence requires covering your tracks

The system concentrates power among those who already have it. New wealth can buy in, but old wealth controls the game. Qindo who acquire rings are tolerated but watched — their presence in the council chambers makes the foreign elite uncomfortable, reminds them that their rule requires constant maintenance.

**The Ring Hall** in Mjiqa is where the council meets. Physically, it's impressive — coral columns, mica mosaics, galleries for observers. Politically, it's a theater where decisions made in private rooms receive public endorsement. The real negotiations happen elsewhere; the Ring Hall is for announcements.

### Current Power

Power in Iqes currently concentrates around two figures:

**Sir Calroy Garoldson** represents the traditional merchant elite — foreign-descended, old money, the families who've held power since the consolidation. The "Sir" is a purchased title from somewhere distant, meaningless in Iqes but impressive to outsiders unfamiliar with the island's politics. Garoldson is pragmatic rather than cruel; he maintains the system because it benefits him, not from particular animus toward the Qindo.

**Sorvos** is more complicated. Mixed heritage, possibly partly Qindo, risen through the system rather than born into it. Whether he's a genuine reformer working within constraints, a sellout who's abandoned his people, or playing a longer game than anyone realizes — the truth depends on who you ask and when you ask them. The Qindo themselves are divided on him.

The two reportedly balance each other — Garoldson representing stability and tradition, Sorvos representing the possibility of change. Whether this balance is genuine or performed is unclear.

### Privateering

Iqes privateers operate with official sanction — letters of marque authorizing raids on foreign shipping. In theory, they target only enemy nations. In practice, definitions are flexible, and "enemy" is defined by whoever holds the most rings this season.

**How privateering works:**
- Ring-holders sponsor captains, providing ships and letters of marque
- Privateers raid foreign shipping, keeping a percentage and paying the rest to sponsors
- The council maintains plausible deniability
- Neighboring nations complain; nothing changes
- Everyone who matters profits

**The privateer class** represents one of the few paths to wealth open to Qindo. Ship captains are often natives — skill matters more than bloodline when you're hunting prizes. Successful captains can accumulate enough to buy voting rings, creating tension with establishment ring-holders who resent these upstarts.

The **Privateers' Berths** in Mjiqa harbor represent a power center somewhat independent of the old elite. Privateer captains have money, armed followers, and connections across the Seacleft Coast. They're loyal to the system that enriches them, but their loyalty is to their own interests rather than to particular ring-holders.

### Economy

Iqes's wealth comes from three sources: trade, privateering, and the labor of its people.

**Trade** flows through Mjiqa — goods from across the Seacleft Coast, up the Shulka River from the interior, across from Gyosha and beyond. The coral cities exist because Iqes sits at a crossroads; merchants from a dozen nations do business here. The ring-holders take their cut of every transaction.

**Privateering** supplements legitimate trade with stolen goods and ransomed cargoes. The line between merchant and pirate blurs in Iqes; many ring-holders have investments in both. Foreign nations complain; Iqes expresses regret and does nothing.

**Labor** — Qindo labor — makes everything possible. The dockworkers who unload ships, the servants who maintain estates, the sailors who crew vessels both merchant and privateer, the craftspeople who build the coral towers. The economy would collapse without them. They see little of the wealth they create.

### Culture

Iqes culture is layered — foreign elite aesthetics laid over Qindo foundations that never entirely disappeared.

The **coastal cities** embrace foreign fashions, imported luxuries, cosmopolitan attitudes. Ring-holders compete through displays of wealth; coral architecture grows more elaborate each generation. The language of commerce is whatever the traders speak; the language of power is the foreign tongue of the original merchants.

**Ntando and the interior** preserve Qindo traditions — ancestor veneration, communal decision-making, crafts and practices that predate the merchant takeover. Village elders hold authority here; voting rings are irrelevant. The old language survives. The old ways persist.

Between these extremes, most Qindo navigate a mixed existence — working in the foreign-dominated economy, maintaining what traditions they can, speaking one language at work and another at home.

### Relations

**With Mirko**: Complicated entanglement. Mirko's criminal networks handle goods that Iqes privateers acquire and legitimate merchants prefer not to touch directly. The relationship is profitable for both sides. Zukisani serves as the primary interface, its shipyards building vessels for buyers who ask few questions.

**With Enavadi**: Minimal contact. Enavadi's insular fishing culture has little interest in Iqes's commerce, and Iqes has nothing Enavadi wants. The two ignore each other politely.

**With Linas**: Trade relationship. Linas dye reaches markets through Iqes merchants; Iqes goods reach Linas through the same channels. Privateers mostly leave Linas shipping alone — the dye trade is too profitable to disrupt.

**With neighboring powers**: A mix of trade, raiding, and diplomatic maneuvering. Iqes maintains relations with everyone, preys on everyone, and allies with whoever offers the best terms this season.

### Notable Locations

- **Mjiqa**: Capital city at the Shulka River mouth; Ring Hall, Coral Docks, Privateers' Berths, Qindo Quarter
- **Simphiwe**: Western city, gateway to Ntando; largest halfling population, most Qindo cultural influence
- **Zukisani**: Northern port on Myusha River; shipyards, fishing fleet, trade connection to Gyosha
- **Zuko**: Interior garrison city; Tax Houses, military control, resistance cells
- **Ntando**: Traditional Qindo interior; forest villages, elder governance, halfling pilgrimage sites

### Player Hooks

- **The Ring Game**: A Qindo captain has accumulated enough wealth to buy voting rings. Established ring-holders want to prevent this without creating a martyr. Players might be hired by either side — or play both against the middle.

- **Cave Secrets**: The destroyed halfling caves weren't just homes. They contained something the merchants wanted — or wanted buried. A halfling elder knows the location of a cave that wasn't completely destroyed, and what lies within.

- **Murder Point**: Someone important was sent to the point who shouldn't have been — a ring-holder who knew too much, or a resistance leader whose death will spark violence. The body needs to be recovered before the currents scatter it, and the truth needs to come out. Or be buried deeper.

- **Sorvos's Game**: The enigmatic ring-holder is making moves that could reshape Iqes politics — but toward what end? Players might be recruited as agents, obstacles, or pawns in a game whose rules they don't fully understand.

- **Privateer Complications**: A privateer captain with connections to the players has taken a prize that someone powerful wants back — or wants destroyed. The cargo might be valuable, dangerous, or both.
