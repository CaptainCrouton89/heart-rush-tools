## Glivornax

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

The most diplomatically sophisticated of the six orc states, Glivornax occupies the northwestern Wildwood between Hedroscobb and Uhionai. The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of the entire Tolkarsus watershed, and they fight Tarn for access to Plenjorn Swamp—where the Grand Tolkarsus river's waters possess miraculous healing properties.

### Overview

Glivornax is often called the "civilized" orc state—a term the Glivornaxi neither embrace nor reject. They have actual diplomats, written records (crude but functional), and something approaching consistent law. They're the only orc state that trades openly with the Vogenfeld dwarves, and the only one that has ever successfully negotiated with Tarkhon.

This relative sophistication comes from necessity. Glivornax fights for access to something other powers want: the healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp (controlled by Tarn). Defending their claim against Tarn's spirit warriors while also fighting Hedroscobb over the Yugurbas Dyos marshes requires more than brute strength.

### Government

**Type:** Council of Elders

The Glivornaxi are ruled by a council of the oldest and most scarred warriors—those who have survived decades of combat and proven their wisdom through endurance. Decisions require consensus, which means Glivornax moves slowly but with united purpose.

**Current Council:**
- **Elder Vorsha Swamp-Mother** — Eldest living Glivornaxi, over ninety years old. Her body is more scar tissue than skin. She counsels patience above all.
- **Elder Grukk River-Watcher** — Master of the swamp patrols, responsible for defending the healing waters.
- **Elder Thessik Spear-Broken** — Lost his arm to a Hedroscobbi axe in the Yugurbas Dyos; now leads diplomatic efforts and trade negotiations.

### Culture

**The Glivornaxi** have muddy green skin and dark, solid-colored eyes. They're primarily spear-fighters who've developed defensive combat styles optimized for swamp terrain—phalanx formations, fighting retreats, using the water and mud to negate enemy advantages.

**Core Values:** Defense of the sacred waters, patience, unity, survival through wisdom rather than aggression.

**The Healing Secret:** The Glivornaxi don't advertise the full extent of Plenjorn Swamp's power. Outsiders know the waters have some healing properties; few know that bathing in the swamp can cure even mortal wounds. If the truth spread widely, Glivornax would face invasion from every direction.

### Economy

**Size:** Small
**Tech:** Somewhat Developed (by orc standards)

**Exports:** Swamp herbs, preserved fish, leather goods, limited quantities of healing water (sold at enormous prices to trusted buyers)

**Imports:** Metal weapons and tools (primarily from Vogenfeld), grain, cloth

The Glivornaxi are primarily subsistence-focused—fishing, hunting, gathering swamp plants. But the healing water trade provides enough wealth to import the metal goods they can't produce themselves.

### Military

**Size:** Medium
**Quality:** High (defensive specialists)
**Enrollment:** Universal (all adults train)

The Glivornaxi military is built for defense. Their warriors train in phalanx formations using long spears, optimized for swamp terrain where they can control chokepoints and negate numerical disadvantage.

**Tactics:** The Glivornaxi never fight on open ground if they can avoid it. They retreat into the wetlands, where their knowledge of paths, depths, and dangers gives them enormous advantage. Pursuing armies find themselves mired in mud, picked off by spear-thrusts from concealment, or simply lost in the endless swamps.

**The Watershed Patrols:** Elite warriors who monitor the borders constantly, alert for Hedroscobbi algae-gatherers in Yugurbas Dyos or Tarni incursions into contested swampland.

### Geography

**Location:** Northwestern Wildwood, between Cykravikus Lake and the Yugurbas Dyos marshes

**Biomes:** Temperate forest transitioning to wetland; swamps and marshes along the eastern border

**Rivers & Lakes:** The upper Tolkarsus watershed; tributaries feed into Tarn's territory downstream

**Borders:**
- North: Uhionai territory (Ryunimir Forest)
- East: Tarn (hostile; the Water War over Plenjorn Swamp access)
- South: Hedroscobb (hostile; the War of the Marshes over Yugurbas Dyos)
- Southwest: Yugurbas Dyos (contested marshlands with Hedroscobb)

### Relations

**Hedroscobb:** Open warfare. The Hedroscobbi need swamp algae from Yugurbas Dyos to forge their corrosive armor. The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of all the Tolkarsus watershed. This War of the Marshes has continued for over a century—neither side can afford to lose.

**Tarn:** Open hostility. Tarn controls Plenjorn Swamp and its healing waters; Glivornax fights for access. The Tarni spirit weapons are terrifying—they attack souls directly—but the Glivornaxi are tenacious defenders. Neither side can win outright.

**Uhionai:** Respectful distance. The tree-orcs understand guardianship of sacred places. Occasional diplomatic contact; no conflicts.

**Grieb:** Minimal contact. The lakemen's hill territory is far from Glivornax's concerns, and fighting aquatic orcs in their home waters isn't worth it anyway.

**Shazuihn:** No direct contact. Tarn lies between Glivornax and the boar riders.

**Vogenfeld:** Trade partners (through difficult routes that skirt Hedroscobb). The dwarves provide metal; Glivornax provides information about orc movements. Both sides benefit, though neither fully trusts the other.

**The Orc Moot:** Glivornax participates but rarely leads. They prefer the status quo—endless low-level conflict that keeps other states too busy to threaten the swamp.

### Conflicts

**The War of the Marshes:** The southern conflict. Hedroscobb needs algae from Yugurbas Dyos to forge their signature armor. Glivornax considers all the watershed sacred. Armed expeditions clash every algae-harvesting season. Neither side can afford to lose—for Hedroscobb, it's their military advantage; for Glivornax, it's their identity as guardians.

**The Water War:** The eastern conflict. Tarn controls Plenjorn Swamp; Glivornax fights for access to the healing waters. Both states know that whoever controls the swamp controls the region. The Tarni fight with spirit weapons that damage souls; the Glivornaxi fight with terrain knowledge and defensive formations. Neither can win outright.

**Two-Front War:** Glivornax is the only orc state fighting on two fronts simultaneously. The strain shows. They can't commit fully to either conflict without leaving the other border exposed. This strategic weakness is balanced only by the fact that Hedroscobb and Tarn are also too busy with their own problems to exploit it.

### Player Hooks

- Seek healing in Plenjorn Swamp (requires getting through both Glivornaxi and Tarni territory)
- Negotiate between Glivornax and Tarn over swamp access
- Defend a Glivornaxi patrol against Hedroscobbi Gatherers in Yugurbas Dyos
- Escort a diplomatic mission to Vogenfeld (navigating around Hedroscobb)
- Investigate why the healing waters are said to be weakening
