## Klevnaf

Tags: state, winter-elf, istori, crimson-coast

The western remnant of the unified Winter Elf kingdom, Klevnaf claims legitimacy through Prince Taoinor—uncle to the murdered King Istor XXVI. They control Murder Creek and the sacred Whitewood, drawing authority from possession of the ancestral heartland. Their enemies call them usurpers and murderers; they call themselves the true continuation of the elven realm.

### Overview

Klevnaf occupies the central coastal strip of the Crimson Coast, wedged between Tangiern to the west and the contested Suftos Hills to the east. The realm follows Murder Creek from its highland sources to the sea—cursed water defining cursed kingdom. The sacred Whitewood provides spiritual legitimacy; the curse provides... something else.

Capital: **Svedlind** (~2,500 population)

### Government

**Prince Taoinor** rules Klevnaf—though "prince" is a pointed choice, not "king." He has never claimed the royal title, insisting that he rules as regent for a unified kingdom that will someday be restored. His supporters call this humility; his opponents call it cowardice; the practical truth is that claiming kingship would close the door to reconciliation.

Taoinor is old even by elven standards—ancient, weary, and possibly relieved that the succession crisis gives him something to do besides wait for death. His court is divided between hawks (push east, crush Istora, reunify by force), doves (negotiate settlement, accept partition), and traditionalists (focus on maintaining proper customs regardless of outcome).

Taoinor vacillates between factions, making decisions slowly and often reversing them. This frustrates everyone but may be intentional—a leader who commits to nothing can't be blamed for failure, and delay benefits the side that can't win quickly.

### Culture

Klevnaf represents traditional Winter Elf society—or claims to. They venerate the old ways: sacred forests where ancestors speak, ceremonies performed exactly as they've always been performed, rigid hierarchies that have governed elven life for millennia. The Whitewood is the physical manifestation of these values.

The curse of Murder Creek has been absorbed into this traditionalism rather than rejected. The visions are painful—those who drink from the creek experience King Ghy's ancient assassination as if they were present—but pain is reframed as sacred connection. Some warriors deliberately drink before battle, seeking the dead king's guidance through hallucination. This practice horrifies outsiders and increasingly concerns Klevnaf's own healers.

Foxes and snowy owls serve as companions, a tradition shared with Istora. The animals don't understand the civil war and will still carry messages to elves on either side if their masters aren't watching carefully. This has led to unofficial communications that both courts pretend don't exist.

**Theological conservatism** defines Klevnaf's religious life. They reject Istora's innovations—a queen leading rites, sustainable logging in sacred forests, the idea that tradition can be adapted. These aren't merely disagreements; they're fundamental challenges to cosmic order. The gods established proper forms; deviating from them invites disaster.

### Economy

Klevnaf's economy is strangled. The kingdom traditionally relied on trade with what's now Istora, tribute from Tangiern (now suspended), and prestige goods that require peace to produce. What remains is subsistence fishing, limited agriculture, and whatever can be salvaged from border skirmishes.

The Whitewood could solve everything. Its silver-barked trees are valuable beyond measure—lumber, furniture, magical components. But Taoinor has forbidden any logging in the sacred forest. Soldiers whose equipment is wearing out, families who can't afford food—they watch priceless trees stand untouched while the kingdom slowly starves. Resentment builds.

### Military

Klevnaf fields perhaps 800 trained soldiers—fewer than Istora, with worse equipment and shakier supply. Their strength lies in terrain: Murder Creek provides natural defense, the Whitewood offers endless ambush opportunities, and the curse itself might deter invaders who fear drinking the wrong water.

Their weakness is everything else. Equipment wears out and can't be replaced. Young elves who should be training are farming or fishing instead. The hawks want offensive action, but attacking across the Suftos Hills would be suicide with current resources.

**The Oath-Bound** are elite warriors who have drunk from Murder Creek deliberately, binding themselves to King Ghy's memory through shared vision. They're fearsome—the visions seem to grant insights in combat—but also increasingly unstable. Prolonged exposure to the curse damages minds in ways that are becoming impossible to ignore.

### Relations

**With Istora**: War. Skirmishes along the Suftos line are constant; assassination attempts flow in both directions; neither side can achieve decisive advantage. The conflict has become self-sustaining—too many dead for either side to accept peace without victory.

**With Tangiern**: Careful outreach. Taoinor has approached King Halvard about alliance—Tangier support for Klevnaf in exchange for reduced tribute when victory comes. Halvard hasn't committed. He probably never will; Tangier benefits from elven division and has no reason to end it.

**With other powers**: Minimal. The Crimson Coast is isolated behind the Dragon's Spine, and nobody outside cares enough about the civil war to intervene.

### History

Murder Creek's name dates back over a thousand years, to the assassination of King Ghy the Elder—the last monarch of a previous unified realm. The circumstances of Ghy's death are lost to time, but the curse that resulted is very much present. The creek remembers.

When Istor XXVI died under similar circumstances, the parallels were impossible to ignore. Lamenrae accused Taoinor; Taoinor denied it; the kingdom split along lines that had existed since Ghy's time. Western territories that had always chafed under eastern dominance chose Taoinor; eastern territories rallied to Lamenrae. The division was geographic, political, and theological simultaneously.

**Did Taoinor kill his nephew?** The evidence is circumstantial. Servants saw him near the king's chambers; a cupbearer noticed something strange about the wine; Taoinor benefited from the death. But witnesses can be bought, memories can be mistaken, and benefiting from a death doesn't prove causing it. Taoinor insists he's innocent. Maybe he is. Maybe Lamenrae accused him to seize power. Maybe someone else killed Istor XXVI and let the obvious suspect take the blame. The truth may never be established.

### What Outsiders Notice

- The dark water of Murder Creek, visible from everywhere in Svedlind
- The careful way locals avoid drinking from obvious sources
- Architecture that's elegant but poorly maintained—repairs deferred, decorations faded
- The silver gleam of Whitewood visible on the southern horizon
- References to "the pretender queen" delivered with weary contempt

### Adventure Hooks

- Taoinor wants to know the truth about Istor XXVI's death—someone to investigate without political agenda
- The Oath-Bound are becoming dangerous; find out what the curse is doing to them and whether it can be stopped
- A faction wants to log the Whitewood to fund the war; they need outsiders to do it without Taoinor's knowledge
- Something in the depths of Murder Creek has begun calling to those who drink its water
