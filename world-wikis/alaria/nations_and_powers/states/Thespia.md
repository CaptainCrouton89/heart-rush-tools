## Thespia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy (in chaos)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 50,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: (currently: survival)

- The Thespian king was recently overthrown by **Queen Akta**, a mercenary from the south. She is a powerful magic user and absolutely fucking bonkers.
- The kingdom is in chaos. Akta's rule is violent and unpredictable. No one knows what she wants or how long she'll last.
- Before the coup, Thespia was a quiet, underdeveloped agricultural kingdom that kept its head down to avoid angering the dragon to the northwest.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Grains

**Primary Imports**: Textiles, metals

- Thespia is primarily agricultural—rolling farmland between the Salty Hills and the mountains.
- Trade is difficult. The mountains to the west are dragon territory. The main routes run east toward Stipen and north toward Ta Minn.
- The current chaos is disrupting what little trade existed.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Thespian army was historically kept small to avoid provoking Morgnor, King of the Mountains, the dragon overlord to the northwest.
- Queen Akta is reportedly building up forces, though whether for defense, conquest, or sheer chaos is unclear.

### Primary Conflicts

**Queen Akta's Reign**

The kingdom is in chaos. Akta seized power through violence and magic, and rules through the same. She's unpredictable, powerful, and possibly insane. The old nobility are dead, fled, or in hiding. Common people are terrified.

No one knows what Akta wants. She came from the south as a mercenary—her origins and motivations are unclear. Some think she's after something specific in Thespia. Others think she just wanted a kingdom to burn.

**The Dragon Shadow**

Morgnor, King of the Mountains, rules the peaks to the northwest. Thespia has always lived in his shadow, keeping their army small and their ambitions smaller. The previous king paid tribute and caused no trouble.

Akta has not continued the tribute. Whether this is madness, confidence, or simply not caring is unknown. Morgnor has not yet responded. When he does, it may be the end of Thespia—or the end of Akta. Or both.

**Neighbor Relations**

Glorin to the southwest and Stipen to the southeast are watching nervously. A mad queen on their border is bad enough. A mad queen who might provoke a dragon is worse.

### History

Thespia was always a quiet, unremarkable kingdom—farmers tending fields in the shadow of dragon mountains. They paid their tribute to Morgnor, traded grain for goods, and caused no trouble.

Then Akta came. No one knows exactly how she did it—the coup was fast and brutal. The king and his family are dead. The army capitulated or died. Now Thespia belongs to a madwoman, and everyone waits to see what happens next.
