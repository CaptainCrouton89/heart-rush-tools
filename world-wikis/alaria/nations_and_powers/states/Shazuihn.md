## Shazuihn

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

They come from the east on giant boars, screaming, axes raised, and when they leave there's nothing but blood and burning. The Shazuihni don't build. They don't negotiate. They don't farm. They raid, they take, and they vanish back into the forest before anyone can retaliate.

The other orc states call them savages. The Shazuihni call themselves free.

### Overview

The Shazuihni are everything the other orc states have evolved past—or so the other states like to believe. They're enormous, hairy, and violent. They ride massive boars that can gore a horse to death. They wield axes that need two ordinary orcs to lift. They attack without warning, take what they want, and disappear.

But dismissing them as simple brutes is a mistake. The Shazuihni have survived for centuries in the hostile borderlands between forest and steppe. They've resisted every attempt to conquer or civilize them. They maintain a complex relationship with their boar herds that borders on spiritual. And their "primitive" raids have bled the other orc states for generations.

They're not sophisticated. They don't need to be. They're doing fine.

### Government

**Type:** War-Chief Dominance

The Shazuihni don't have formal government. They have whoever is strongest. A War-Chief rules until someone kills them or proves themselves more worthy of leadership—usually by killing them.

**Current Leadership:**
- **War-Chief Grokthul the Boar-Father** — Massive even by Shazuihni standards, Grokthul has ruled for fifteen years by being too dangerous to challenge. His boar, Skull-Splitter, has killed more orcs than most warriors.
- **The Blood-Riders** — A loose council of the most successful raiders. They advise Grokthul (when he asks, which is rarely) and lead their own warbands independently.
- **The Boar-Speakers** — Shamans who maintain the bond between riders and mounts. They hold surprising influence because without healthy boars, there are no raids.

Leadership changes frequently. Three War-Chiefs in the last generation died in raids; two were killed by rivals; one was trampled by his own boar. The Shazuihni consider this natural. The strong rule until they're not strong anymore.

### Culture

**The Shazuihni** are the largest of the Wildwood orcs—easily seven feet tall, covered in coarse hair, with prominent tusks and small, cunning eyes. They look like someone crossed an orc with an ogre, which may not be entirely wrong. Their intelligence is... different. Not absent, but focused. They don't think abstractly. They don't plan far ahead. They react, adapt, and survive.

**Core Values:**
- **Strength Is Everything** — The strong take. The weak give. This is how the world works.
- **The Boar Is Brother** — A rider and boar are bonded for life. Harming someone's boar is worse than harming them directly.
- **Take What You Need** — Property belongs to whoever can hold it. Theft is just a test of strength.
- **Die Well** — Death in battle is glorious. Death from old age or sickness is shameful. The best deaths involve taking enemies with you.

**Society:** Shazuihni society is organized around boar-bonds and war-bands. A young orc bonds with a boar around age ten—a dangerous process that kills many aspirants. Those who survive become riders; those who fail become servants, cooks, or corpses.

War-bands form around successful raiders. A rider who brings back good plunder attracts followers. A rider who fails too often finds themselves alone, which in the Shazuihni world is a death sentence.

Women raid alongside men. Children learn to ride before they learn to walk. The elderly—the few who reach old age—are quietly abandoned when they can no longer keep up. The Shazuihni don't discuss this. It simply happens.

**The Boars:** Giant boars, bred for size and aggression over centuries. A full-grown Shazuihni war-boar stands five feet at the shoulder, weighs over a thousand pounds, and has tusks that can punch through wooden shields. They're not horses—they're partners. The bond between rider and boar is genuine and profound, the one area where the Shazuihni show something like tenderness.

### Economy

**Size:** Very Small (formal economy)
**Tech:** Undeveloped

**Primary Exports:**
- Nothing (they don't trade)

**Primary Imports:**
- Nothing (they take what they need)

The Shazuihni don't have an economy in any meaningful sense. They raid for what they need—food, weapons, captives, anything useful. What they can't raid for, they do without.

Between raids, they hunt in the forests and steppes. The boars root for tubers and mushrooms. Captured slaves do the work the Shazuihni find beneath them. It's not sustainable in any civilized sense, but it's sustained them for centuries.

**The Captive Question:** The Shazuihni take slaves in their raids. Some are worked to death. Some are ransomed back. Some eventually earn acceptance by proving useful. A few have even become riders, though this is rare. The other orc states condemn this practice while quietly engaging in their own forms of bondage.

### Military

**Size:** Medium
**Quality:** High (in specific contexts)
**Enrollment:** Universal (all riders raid)

The Shazuihni military is simple: riders on boars with big axes. There's no infantry, no archers, no siege equipment. Just speed, mass, and overwhelming violence.

**The Raid:** A typical Shazuihni raid involves twenty to fifty riders appearing without warning, hitting a target hard, grabbing everything portable, and vanishing before defenders can organize. They don't hold territory. They don't fight pitched battles. They strike and run.

**Boar Charge:** The signature Shazuihni tactic. Fifty war-boars charging in formation create a wall of tusks, hooves, and screaming riders that can break any conventional defensive line. The charge is nearly unstoppable—but it only works once per battle. If the first charge doesn't break the enemy, the Shazuihni retreat to try again another day.

**Weaknesses:**
- Terrible at defense. They don't build fortifications and don't know how to hold ground.
- Useless in confined spaces. The boars need room to move.
- No ranged capability worth mentioning.
- Dependent on boar health. Sick boars mean no raids.
- Can't sustain long campaigns. They hit and run; they don't siege.

### Geography

**Location:** Eastern Wildwood edge, where forest meets the Steppe of Aziirn

**Biomes:** Forest margins, scattered woodland, open steppe

**Key Locations:**
- **The Rooting Grounds** — Semi-permanent camps where the boar herds graze and breed. Sacred to the Shazuihni.
- **The Blood Road** — The main raiding path west into Hedroscobb territory. Generations of raids have worn it into the land.
- **The Scorches** — Geothermal region to the north. Too dangerous for regular habitation but used as a retreat when enemies pursue.
- **Dragon Spout** — Where void and fire meet. The Shazuihni avoid it but use it as a boundary marker.

**Borders:**
- West: Hedroscobb (primary raiding target)
- Northwest: Tarn (secondary raiding target)
- North: The Scorches, eventually the northern steppes
- East: Steppe of Aziirn (mostly empty; occasional contact with steppe peoples)
- South: Wurmspine Mountains region

### Relations

**Hedroscobb:** Primary target. The Black Orcs have things the Shazuihni want—metal, food, slaves. The algae-iron armor is a problem, but the Shazuihni have learned to avoid the armored infantry and hit softer targets. This war has continued for generations with no end in sight.

**Tarn:** Secondary target. The Tarni spirit warriors are individually dangerous—nearly impossible to kill quickly—but they're few in number. Hit-and-run tactics work well against them. The river territory offers good plunder.

**Glivornax:** No direct contact. Tarn lies between Shazuihn and the Glivornaxi.

**Uhionai:** The Shazuihni learned the hard way not to raid the Wooden Men. The Ryunimir Forest is too dense for boars, and the Uihonaii make anyone who enters pay dearly. One catastrophic defeat was enough.

**Grieb:** No raids. Two generations ago, War-Chief Grulnak led fifty riders against the lakemen. Three came back. The boars won't go near water now—they remember something the riders won't talk about. The territory might be valuable, but nobody's willing to pay that price again.

**Vogenfeld:** The Shazuihni would love to raid the dwarves, but Hedroscobb is in the way. By the time raiders fight through Black Orc territory, they're too depleted to challenge mountain fortresses.

**The Orc Moot:** The Shazuihni attend irregularly. When they come, they demand tribute from the other states for "protection" (from themselves). This rarely works, but they keep trying.

### Conflicts

**The Eternal Raid:** The Shazuihni are always raiding someone. It's not a conflict that can be won or lost—it's a permanent state of affairs. They raid to survive. They survive to raid.

**The Boar Plague:** A sickness swept through the herds two years ago, killing a third of the war-boars. The Shazuihni are still recovering. Raids have been smaller and less frequent, but this won't last. The herds are growing again.

**The Eastern Question:** The steppe peoples beyond Aziirn have their own horse-riders and their own ambitions. Occasional clashes have occurred. If the steppe tribes ever unified, the Shazuihni would face a serious threat—but the steppes are even more fragmented than the Wildwood.

### History

Where did the Shazuihni come from? No one's sure. They were raiding the Wildwood before the other orc states formed. They might be descendants of ogre-orc crossbreeding. They might be an ancient orc lineage that never "civilized." They might have wandered in from the eastern steppes generations ago.

They don't keep records. They don't tell origin stories. They raid, they survive, they die in battle if they're lucky. That's enough history for them.

The other orc states have tried everything to stop them. Alliances, punitive expeditions, assassination attempts, even bribery. Nothing has worked. The Shazuihni absorb losses, retreat into the steppes, breed more boars, and come back. They're a fact of life in the Wildwood, as constant as the seasons and twice as destructive.

### Player Hooks

- Survive being captured in a Shazuihni raid
- Negotiate with a War-Chief for passage through their territory (bring gifts)
- Bond with a Shazuihni war-boar (extremely dangerous; possibly lethal)
- Investigate the boar plague—was it natural or something else?
- Hire Shazuihni mercenaries (they'll work for enough plunder)
- Unite the other orc states against the eternal raids (probably impossible)
- Convince the Shazuihni to raid somewhere truly dangerous (like Vogenfeld)
