## Murth

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Dual governance (shared authority between two capitals)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Rhea (Eynmore), Humans (Vastilin)

**Population**: ~25,000 (Eynmore ~8,000; Vastilin ~12,000; scattered communities ~5,000)

**Stability**: Stable but tense

**Core Values**: Knowledge and commerce, focus and profit, the binding of opposites

- Murth is governed by two capitals on two mountains: **Eynmore** on Mt. Disyus (Rhea scholars) and **Vastilin** on Mt. Arn (human merchants). Neither rules the other. Major decisions require agreement from both.
- This arrangement has persisted for over a thousand years—long enough that no one alive remembers it being any other way, but not long enough to resolve the fundamental tension between Rhea idealism and human practicality.
- The Rhea are air-elemental beings: small, unnaturally light, with grayish-blue skin and floating wispy hair. They value focus above all—choosing a single pursuit and mastering it over decades. Their monasteries produce legendary scholars, healers, and martial artists.
- The humans of Vastilin are merchants, craftsmen, and laborers. They value practical results—food on the table, coin in the pocket, goods moving to market. They find Rhea contemplation baffling but respect Rhea skills.

### Economy

**Size**: Small-Medium

**Tech**: Mixed (Rhea scholarship + human craftsmanship)

**Primary Exports**: Education, healing services, scholarly texts, mountain herbs, refined metals

**Primary Imports**: Food (grain, vegetables), cloth, luxury goods, raw materials

- Eynmore's monasteries are famous across Tarkhon. Wealthy families send children to study there. The sick travel miles for Rhea healers. Scholars seek the ancient texts in Rhea archives. This brings money and prestige.
- Vastilin's merchants handle the practical side—buying, selling, transporting, storing. They manage Murth's trade relationships, provision the monasteries, and ensure the state doesn't starve.
- Mt. Arn produces iron and copper; Mt. Disyus produces rare alpine herbs and materials for magical work. Each mountain has what the other lacks.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Specialized

**Enrollment**: Professional (Vastilin guard) + Monastery defenders (Rhea martial monks)

- Murth has no large army. It relies on difficult terrain and Tarkhon's broader protection for security.
- Vastilin maintains a small professional guard (~500) for law enforcement and caravan protection.
- The Rhea monasteries train martial monks—not many, but those who dedicate decades to combat become extraordinarily dangerous. A single Rhea master can defeat a squad of ordinary soldiers.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Tarkhon, in the mountains west of Vogenfeld and northwest of the Kingdoms of Fire

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, high valleys, thin air at elevation

**Climate**: Cold, dry, with harsh winters at altitude

**Named Features**: Mt. Disyus (north), Mt. Arn (south), the Murthian Tunnels, Lake Stillwater (underground)

### Political Geography

**Dual Capitals**: Eynmore (Mt. Disyus) and Vastilin (Mt. Arn)

**Other Settlements**: Small mining camps, traveler's rest stations, scattered farms in the valleys

### Mt. Disyus and Eynmore

The northern mountain rises high enough that only Rhea find the air comfortable. Human visitors struggle to breathe, to think, to move. This natural barrier keeps Eynmore isolated—and the Rhea prefer it that way.

**Eynmore** is built into the mountain itself: monastery complexes carved from stone, meditation halls open to the sky, libraries that have collected knowledge for a thousand years. The architecture is elegant but austere—beauty in simplicity, function elevated to art.

Perhaps 8,000 Rhea live here, along with a handful of human servants and students hardy enough to adapt to the altitude. The population hasn't changed much in centuries. The Rhea don't need growth. They need focus.

The **High Contemplative** leads Eynmore—currently a Rhea named **Whisper-of-Still-Waters**, who has held the position for forty-seven years. She speaks rarely, thinks deeply, and has forgotten more about philosophy than most scholars ever learn.

### Mt. Arn and Vastilin

The southern mountain is lower, warmer, and richer in minerals. Humans settled here long before establishing contact with the Rhea—miners and traders who found the mountain's resources worth the isolation.

**Vastilin** sprawls across the mountain's southern slopes: a proper city with markets, warehouses, foundries, taverns, and all the mess that humans create. Perhaps 12,000 people live here, mostly human but with representatives of every race who find mountain commerce appealing.

The city is governed by the **Merchant Council**—seven wealthy families who control Vastilin's major industries. The current **First Merchant** is **Aldous Brennan**, a third-generation trader who inherited his position and has proven surprisingly competent.

### Lake Stillwater

Deep beneath both mountains lies **Lake Stillwater**—an underground lake fed by glacial melt, its waters unnaturally calm and clear. The lake is the key to Murth's existence.

A thousand years ago, Rhea from what would become Eynmore began carving tunnels down into Mt. Disyus, seeking water. They found Lake Stillwater—and discovered that humans had carved tunnels from the other direction for the same reason.

Rather than fight over the lake, they negotiated. The **Stillwater Compact** established shared access: both peoples could draw water, neither could pollute or restrict the source. To enforce this, they carved connecting tunnels.

Those tunnels changed everything. Suddenly two isolated mountain communities could trade, communicate, cooperate. Over centuries, this practical arrangement evolved into political union. Not because either side wanted unity—but because cutting off the tunnels meant cutting off the water.

### The Murthian Tunnels

Miles of passages connect Eynmore and Vastilin through the mountains' hearts, with Lake Stillwater at the center. The tunnels are:

- **Transportation**: The fastest route between the cities, passable even when surface passes are blocked by snow
- **Trade routes**: Goods flow through constantly—food going up to Eynmore, finished products coming down to Vastilin
- **Neutral ground**: The tunnels belong to neither city, governed by separate tunnel-wardens from both communities
- **Emergency refuge**: If either city were threatened, the population could evacuate through the tunnels

The tunnels also contain shrines, way stations, and the great **Chamber of the Compact** where the original agreement is carved into the living rock.

### The Dual Government

Major decisions affecting all of Murth require agreement between Eynmore and Vastilin. This means:

- The High Contemplative and the First Merchant must both approve
- Disputes go to the **Council of Two Mountains**—representatives from both cities meeting in the tunnel system
- Deadlocks can persist for years (the Rhea are patient; the humans are stubborn)

In practice, most matters are handled locally. Eynmore governs Eynmore; Vastilin governs Vastilin. Only questions of trade policy, foreign relations, and shared resources require joint decision.

This works... mostly. The cultural divide creates constant friction:

- Rhea think humans are impatient, shallow, and obsessed with money
- Humans think Rhea are slow, impractical, and disconnected from reality
- Both are right. Both need each other too much to split.

### The Cultural Divide

**What Rhea value:**
- Focus: Choose one thing and master it completely
- Patience: Decades of study before speaking with authority
- Contemplation: Understanding matters more than acting
- Simplicity: Possessions are distractions

**What Vastilin humans value:**
- Results: Does it work? Does it sell?
- Efficiency: Get it done, move on to the next thing
- Growth: More trade, more wealth, more influence
- Comfort: Life should be enjoyed, not merely endured

These values clash constantly. A Rhea teacher might spend thirty years training a single student. A Vastilin merchant might make thirty deals in a month. Neither understands why the other works that way.

And yet: Vastilin's merchants sell Eynmore's teaching. Eynmore's scholars heal Vastilin's sick. The arrangement works not despite the differences but because of them. Each provides what the other cannot.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Trade Imbalance**

Vastilin handles all of Murth's external trade—and takes a cut of everything. Eynmore produces valuable services (education, healing) but Vastilin controls how those services reach the market.

Some Rhea argue this is exploitation. Some humans argue they're just being practical. The tension simmers without resolution.

**The Altitude Question**

Vastilin's population is growing; Eynmore's isn't. More humans means more pressure on shared resources—especially water from Lake Stillwater. Some in Eynmore worry that eventually Vastilin will simply outnumber them into irrelevance.

**The Plains of Oblivion**

Northwest of Murth lie the **Plains of Oblivion**—cursed grasslands that erase memories. The plains creep closer some years, retreat others. No one knows why.

Queen Eranes rules from her palace **Satyrn Gray** somewhere in those plains—a half-titan who enchanted herself to forget a lost love. She's immensely powerful and unpredictable. Murth tries not to attract her attention.

**The Tarkhon Question**

Murth is technically part of Tarkhon, paying tribute to Tarkhetan. But it's far from the strait, produces no strategic resources, and mostly gets left alone.

Some in Vastilin want closer ties to Tarkhon—more trade, more protection, more integration. Some in Eynmore want further distance—less interference, less entanglement, less of everything. The debate continues.

### Notable Figures

**Whisper-of-Still-Waters** (High Contemplative of Eynmore)
An ancient Rhea who has led Eynmore for forty-seven years. She speaks perhaps a dozen words a day, each chosen with care. Her silences communicate more than most people's speeches.

**Aldous Brennan** (First Merchant of Vastilin)
Forty-three years old, inherited his position, but has earned respect through competent administration. He genuinely wants what's best for Murth—he just defines "best" in commercial terms.

**Master Stonefist** (Martial monk of Eynmore)
A Rhea who has spent sixty years mastering unarmed combat. He's old, small, light as a feather—and could kill any ten soldiers who challenged him. He trains the monastery's defenders and occasionally takes students from outside.

**Sera Coldwell** (Tunnel-Warden)
A human woman who oversees the central tunnel network. Nominally neutral, practically essential. She knows every passage, every shortcut, every secret. Both cities trust her—which means neither fully trusts her.

### History

**The Founding (~1000+ years ago)**: Rhea settle Mt. Disyus; humans settle Mt. Arn. Both communities dig for water. Both find Lake Stillwater.

**The Stillwater Compact**: Rather than fight, the communities negotiate shared access. Connecting tunnels are carved.

**The Slow Integration**: Over centuries, trade and cooperation create interdependence. Political union follows economic reality.

**The Tarkhon Era**: Murth becomes part of the growing Tarkhon Empire, trading autonomy for access to broader markets and nominal protection.

**The Present**: Murth continues its strange dual existence—two peoples, two cultures, two mountains, one state. The arrangement works. Mostly.
