## Istokos

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Bloodline aristocracy (noble houses ranked by magical potency)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Chargon (eel-descended humanoids)

**Population**: ~28,000 (Kargak ~12,000; island communities ~16,000)

**Stability**: Stable but rigid (the hierarchy is absolute)

**Core Values**: Bloodline purity, land-dwelling ascension, the rejection of the ancestral sea

The Chargon are an eel race—elongated humanoids with smooth, glistening skin that ranges from deep black to pale silver. Their bodies retain the flexibility of their aquatic ancestors; they can contort through spaces that would stop a human. Their eyes are large and dark, adapted for seeing in murky depths they now refuse to enter.

What makes Istokos unique isn't the Chargon themselves—it's what they've done to themselves.

Centuries ago, the Chargon were fully aquatic. They lived in the sea, breathed water, and knew nothing of the surface world. Then their shamans discovered bloodline magic—the ability to encode powers into their very lineage. Through generations of selective breeding and magical enhancement, they evolved themselves to live on land.

The transformation came with a price. Seawater now *weakens* the bloodline magic. A Chargon who immerses themselves in the ocean feels their inherited powers fade, their connection to their ancestors drain away. Extended exposure can strip a bloodline entirely, leaving an ordinary Chargon with no magic at all.

So the Chargon rejected the sea. They walk on land. They sail in ships designed to keep water away from their skin. They consider the ocean their enemy—the element they conquered and can never return to.

### The Bloodlines

Every noble Chargon family carries bloodline magic—powers encoded in their ancestry and passed down through generations. Different families carry different gifts, each traced to one of the **Primordial Eels**: mythological ancestors who first received magic from the deep gods.

**Major Bloodlines:**

**House Murk** (Sight Beyond) — Descended from the Eel of Depths. Their bloodline grants vision through darkness, illusion, and time. The most politically powerful house; their seers advise the throne.

**House Coil** (Body Mastery) — Descended from the Eel of Currents. Their bloodline grants extreme flexibility, speed, and the ability to squeeze through impossibly small spaces. Assassins and scouts.

**House Spark** (Lightning Blood) — Descended from the Electric Eel. Their bloodline lets them generate and control electrical discharges. Rare and feared; their touch can kill.

**House Slick** (Surface Walking) — Descended from the Eel of Shores. Their bloodline grants perfect balance, the ability to climb any surface, and resistance to being grasped. The first family to master land-dwelling.

**House Depths** (Pressure Sense) — Descended from the Abyssal Eel. Their bloodline lets them sense weight, density, and structural weaknesses. Engineers and builders.

**Lesser houses** carry diluted versions of these bloodlines, or combinations that produce weaker, stranger effects. Commoner Chargon have no bloodline magic at all—their ancestors either never received it or lost it to seawater exposure.

### The Hierarchy

Istokos society is organized entirely around bloodline potency. The stronger your ancestral magic, the higher your rank. This is determined through formal testing—**The Tasting**—conducted on every Chargon at adolescence.

The Tasting involves controlled seawater exposure. A Chargon's bloodline magic resists the dilution; the longer they can maintain their powers while partially immersed, the stronger their bloodline. Results are recorded, published, and determine that individual's place in society forever.

**King Thesslan IV** rules from Kargak—not because his family conquered or inherited, but because House Murk consistently produces the strongest bloodlines. The throne passes to whoever can prove the most potent Sight Beyond, regardless of direct descent.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Standard, advanced in certain magical applications

**Primary Exports**: Bloodline services (seers, assassins, engineers), specialized magical goods, fish (processed by commoners)

**Primary Imports**: Everything that requires water contact in production, mainland goods, laborers

Istokos runs on magical aristocracy. Noble houses hire out their bloodline abilities—Murk seers advise foreign kings, Coil assassins take contracts across the Western Isles, Spark warriors serve as elite mercenaries.

Commoner Chargon handle everything that requires water contact: fishing, sailing, cargo handling. They do the work nobles can't without risking their bloodlines. This creates a rigid class divide—nobles literally cannot do commoner jobs.

Trade flows through Kargak, the only major port. Foreign ships dock; Chargon merchants negotiate from the pier without boarding. Goods are transferred through human intermediaries who don't understand why the eel-folk won't step onto wet decks.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Elite specialists, weak conventional forces

**Enrollment**: Noble retinues (magic users), commoner conscripts (sailors and laborers)

Istokos doesn't field armies. They field bloodline specialists.

A single Spark noble can kill a dozen soldiers before they close the distance. A Coil assassin can infiltrate anywhere. A Murk seer can predict enemy movements with unsettling accuracy. But there aren't many of them, and they can't operate near significant water.

Naval power is handled by commoner crews on ships specifically designed to keep nobles dry. These vessels have covered decks, sealed compartments, and elaborate drainage systems. Nobles who must travel by sea stay in waterproof cabins, never touching the hull.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Western Isles, south of the Shattered Sea

**Biomes**: Tropical islands, warm waters

**Climate**: Warm and humid year-round

**Named Features**: Kargak (capital), various island territories

Istokos occupies a cluster of islands south of the main Shattered Sea. The waters here are warm, calm, and full of fish that the Chargon once hunted from below. Now they hunt from above—or hire others to hunt for them.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Kargak (~12,000)

**Major Islands**: Controlled by noble houses, each island essentially a house's domain

### Kargak

The capital rises from the largest island in Istokos. Stone buildings with elaborate drainage keep rainwater away from noble quarters. The streets are covered during monsoon season. Everything is designed to let the aristocracy move through their city without risking accidental water exposure.

The **Dry Palace** dominates the city center—a massive complex where the king holds court, nobles negotiate, and the Tasting ceremonies occur. The palace has never allowed seawater within its walls in four hundred years.

**King Thesslan IV** is seventy-three and his Sight Beyond remains formidable. He can see up to a week into possible futures—not certainty, but probability. This makes him nearly impossible to surprise and extremely difficult to plot against.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Dilution Crisis**

Bloodlines are weakening. Each generation, the Tasting results show slightly lower averages. Noble families quietly panic—is the magic fading? Are marriages diluting the lines? Some houses have begun extreme measures: refusing to let children touch any water, not even rain.

**Commoner Resentment**

The Chargon who do all the water-work receive none of the power. Commoner movements argue that the bloodline system is oppressive—that the nobles' fear of water has created an artificial hierarchy. These movements are ruthlessly suppressed, but they keep returning.

**The Sea's Call**

Some young Chargon feel drawn to the water despite everything. They slip away to swim, to dive, to remember what their ancestors were. Most return diminished—their bloodline damaged. Some don't return at all. The elders call this madness. The rebels call it freedom.

**External Pressure**

Other Western Isles powers would love to understand—and exploit—the bloodline system. Istokos maintains strict secrecy about how the magic works, but secrets leak. Someone, someday, will figure out how to weaponize seawater against the Chargon nobility.

### Notable Figures

**King Thesslan IV** — Ruler of Istokos, head of House Murk. His Sight Beyond is legendary; he's reportedly never been surprised by anything in sixty years. Ancient, patient, and quietly terrified that his visions show the bloodlines fading.

**Lady Seris of House Spark** — Most powerful living Spark noble. Her electrical discharges can kill at thirty paces. She's also the last Spark with full bloodline potency; her children all tested weaker.

**Venn the Drowned** — Commoner revolutionary. She deliberately immersed herself in the sea, emerged with no bloodline magic, and now preaches that the Chargon should abandon their self-imposed exile and return to the water. The nobility wants her dead.

**Prince Malkon** — King Thesslan's grandson and likely heir. His Sight Beyond tested abnormally weak. The court whispers about what this means for House Murk's future.

### History

**The Sea Time**: The Chargon lived fully aquatic for millennia. Their shamans discovered bloodline magic and began encoding powers into family lines.

**The Ascension** (~800 years ago): Over generations, Chargon shamans evolved their people to breathe air and walk on land. The cost: seawater now weakened the bloodline magic.

**The Rejection**: The first land-dwelling Chargon formally rejected the sea. They built Kargak, established the Tasting system, and created the rigid hierarchy that persists today.

**The Golden Age**: Istokos at its height—powerful bloodlines, wealthy from magical services, feared across the Western Isles.

**The Present**: Bloodlines weakening, commoners restless, young Chargon drawn to the forbidden sea. The structure that made Istokos powerful may be crumbling from within.
