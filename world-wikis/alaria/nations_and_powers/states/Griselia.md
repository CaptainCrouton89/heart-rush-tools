## Griselia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederation of city-states (loose)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Scalawag Goblins

**Population**: 80,000 (across all city-states)

**Stability**: Chaotic but functional

**Core Values**: Brood loyalty, performance, rivalry, dramatic flair

- Griselia is not a unified nation but a collection of eight independent city-states, each ruled by a brood-father lineage. They compete constantly but present a united (theatrical) front to outsiders.
- Scalawag goblins dominate—mischievous, impulsive, passionate. Known for performers, philosophers, and devoting horrifying amounts of time to absurd projects.
- Some non-Scalawag goblins and a very slim number of non-goblins have migrated here over the years.
- Goblin politics are loud, dramatic, and bewildering to outsiders. Alliances shift constantly between city-states. Feuds can last generations or be forgotten by next week.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Crafts, performers, mercenaries, mountain goods, chaos

**Primary Imports**: Food, luxuries, anything shiny

- Trade with Erasnus is brisk despite (or because of) the constant theatrical threats of invasion.
- Each city-state has its own economic specialties and jealously guards them.
- Goblin craftsmanship is inconsistent—brilliant one day, incomprehensible the next.

### Military

**Size**: Large (on paper)

**Quality**: Variable

**Enrollment**: Brood obligation

- Every goblin is expected to defend the brood. This means Griselia can theoretically field enormous armies.
- In practice, coordinating eight city-states is like herding cats. Joint military exercises tend to devolve into arguments, competitions, or impromptu festivals.
- Individual city-states can be surprisingly effective when motivated. The problem is motivation.

### Geography

**Location**: The Crags of Geth, a shallow bowl-shaped mountain range west of Erasnus, east of Ta Minn, north of the Browthiel Hills

**Biomes**: Mountain valleys, rocky peaks, scattered forests in the bowl

**Climate**: Temperate, sheltered by the bowl shape

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (each city-state is independent)

**City-States (east to west along southern rim)**: Pholiki, Dygon, Aster (closest to Erasnus)

**City-States (elsewhere in the bowl)**: Shinishini, Codunp, Gor, Grisel, Bu

### Primary Conflicts

**Inter-City Rivalry**

The eight city-states compete over everything—trade routes, prestige, whose brood-father is most impressive, whose philosophers are most profound, whose parties are most legendary. This rarely escalates to actual violence (goblins don't like killing half-siblings), but the drama is constant.

**The Erasnus Theater**

Griselia's relationship with Erasnus is a perpetual comic opera. Goblin delegations arrive in Traduci making grandiose threats of invasion. Erasnun diplomats nod politely. Everyone trades. The goblins go home claiming diplomatic victory. Repeat endlessly.

Both sides know the invasion will never happen. But the theater serves domestic purposes for the goblins (brood-fathers look strong) and the Erasnuns (the military looks necessary). It's a mutually beneficial farce.

**Something Underneath**

Most of the posturing is theatrical. But some city-states—particularly those further from Erasnus, away from the profitable trade—may harbor genuine ambitions. The bowl of the Crags of Geth hides things. Not every brood-father is content with performance.

**Anarak to the North**

The great basin of Anarak lies between the Crags of Geth and Argysis in the Kharvorn Mountains. Relations with Anarak are... complicated. The goblins don't threaten Anarak the way they threaten Erasnus. There may be reasons for that.

### History

The Scalawag goblins have inhabited the Crags of Geth for as long as anyone remembers. The bowl-shaped range provided natural shelter, and the eight major valleys became eight city-states, each dominated by a single brood lineage.

They've never unified. They've never needed to. The mountains protect them, trade sustains them, and the endless inter-city drama keeps everyone entertained. Outsiders have tried to conquer Griselia; the mountains and the chaos defeated them all.

The theatrical threats toward Erasnus started centuries ago—possibly as genuine ambition, possibly as a joke that stuck. Now it's tradition. No one remembers why it began, and no one wants to be the brood-father who stops.
