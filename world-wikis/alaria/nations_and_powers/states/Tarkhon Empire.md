## Tarkhon Empire

Tags: state, empire

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Imperial monarchy with tributary states

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, Craven, Neferati, Dwarves, Halflings (varies by region)

**Population**: ~2,000,000 (across all territories)

**Stability**: Stable but fragile

**Core Values**: Trade, prosperity, imperial continuity, the eternal flame

- The Tarkhon Empire is ruled by **King Selron II** from the capital of **Tarkhetan** in Nektuna. His authority is absolute in the core territories but dilutes rapidly as distance from the strait increases.
- The empire holds together through economic incentive rather than military force. Subsidiary states receive preferential trade terms in exchange for fealty, tribute, and open roads. This arrangement is stable as long as Tarkhon remains wealthy—but it means loyalty is always conditional.
- Tarkhon's diversity is a strength and weakness. The empire contains humans, Craven, Neferati fire-kingdoms, dwarven city-states, and an immortal halfling kingdom. They have little in common except profit.

### Economy

**Size**: Massive

**Tech**: Advanced (maritime, financial)

**Primary Exports**: Everything (as intermediary)

**Primary Imports**: Everything (as intermediary)

- Tarkhon controls the **Tarkhon Strait**—the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. All maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world passes through Tarkhon-controlled waters.
- The empire doesn't produce much itself. It *taxes* production. Every ship that passes through pays tariffs. Every merchant who uses Tarkhon roads pays tolls. Every trader who wants access to Tarkhon markets pays fees.
- This makes Tarkhon fabulously wealthy—and deeply dependent on maintaining its chokehold on trade. If an alternative route opened, the empire would collapse within a generation.

### Military

**Size**: Large (navy-focused)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Professional

- Tarkhon maintains a powerful navy to control the strait. Ships that refuse to pay are sunk. Pirates are hunted relentlessly. The sea lanes are safe—for those who pay.
- The army is smaller but professional, primarily deployed to protect key assets and project power into tributary states that forget their obligations.
- Nektuna's fire leyline produces powerful **firemages** who serve as the empire's elite military asset. A single firemage can burn a ship from a mile away.

### Geography

**Location**: Straddles the strait between Clueanda (north) and Rimihuica (south)

**Biomes**: Temperate coastlands (north), arid highlands (south), volcanic mountains, fertile river valleys

**Climate**: Mediterranean to semi-arid

**Named Features**: Tarkhon Strait, Eronia Range, Fleimrut Mountains, Stone Forest, Sea of Merchants

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tarkhetan (in Nektuna)

**Core Territories**: Nektuna, Enymu, Kerwin

**Tributary States**: Astrelle, Yaif, Kabir, Gissemari, Wadiyah

**Allied City-States**: Üod, Blvnird, Melaia (First Brotherhood dwarves)

**Other Holdings**: Murth, Vogenfeld (northern shield), various smaller territories

### The Evertorch

In Tarkhetan's great cathedral burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting six centuries ago. The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing the empire's eternal dominion and unbroken continuity.

The Neferati founders kindled it from sacred fire brought north from Yaif when they established Tarkhetan. It has burned in the same cathedral ever since—through the Neferati dynasty, through the Severance, through three centuries of human rule. The torch doesn't care who sits on the throne. It just burns.

Ritual magic of time and fire occurs at the Evertorch shrine. The empire's most important oaths are sworn before it. Emperors—now called kings—are crowned in its light. The Kingdoms of Fire have never forgotten that it burns with their fire.

### Subsidiary States

**Northern Holdings (Clueanda)**
- **Nektuna**: The imperial heartland. Controls the strait, produces firemages, generates most of the empire's wealth.
- **Enymu**: Farming state east of Nektuna. Loyal but poor. Ruled by a long line of honorable kings.
- **Kerwin**: Halfling kingdom ruled by Ulyas the Immortal. Nominally tributary; practically independent.
- **Astrelle**: Vassal state of Nektuna. Fully integrated into the empire.

**The Kingdoms of Fire**
- **Yaif**, **Kabir**, **Gissemari**, **Wadiyah**: Four Neferati monarchies that act as a bloc. They maintain internal independence but coordinate on external matters.

**Dwarven City-States**
- **Üod**, **Blvnird**, **Melaia**: Leadership cities of the First Brotherhood. Their relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they're tributary but also exercise influence over dwarves across the world.

**Other Territories**
- **Murth**: Dual-capital state (Eynmore and Vastilin)
- **Vogenfeld**: Uline dwarf settlements holding the northern passes against Hedroscobb's orc hordes. The Vogenfeld Pact is ancient but increasingly strained.
- **Chykum** and various smaller holdings

### Klor the Blood Lord

Two hundred years ago, the **Eronia Range**—the mountains forming Tarkhon's southern boundary—was infested with a massive confederation of mountain clans. Orcs, goblins, and worse had raided Tarkhon's southern territories for generations. Caravans were ambushed. Villages burned. The problem seemed intractable.

**Klor** was a Tarkhon general, brutal and effective. He proposed a solution: systematic extermination. The empire gave him an army and a mandate.

The campaign lasted a decade. Klor earned his title—the Blood Lord—through the sheer scale of slaughter. He didn't negotiate, didn't accept surrenders, didn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. He cleared the mountains the way a farmer clears brush: thoroughly, methodically, without mercy.

When it was done, the Eronia Range was empty. Safe for Tarkhon travelers, at least. Klor died in the final campaign—some say heroically in battle, some say assassinated by his own officers who could no longer stomach the killing.

Tarkhon honors Klor as a necessary monster. The southern territories are safe because of what he did. Whether the cost was justified depends on who you ask—and whether they lived south of the mountains or in them.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Tenuous Grasp**

Tarkhon holds its empire through trade benefits, not loyalty. Every subsidiary state is calculating whether the advantages of membership outweigh the costs. If Tarkhon's wealth falters, if an alternative trade route opens, if the navy weakens—the empire will fragment within a generation.

**The Immortal Problem**

King Ulyas of Kerwin has outlived every Tarkhon ruler for five centuries. He remembers the Neferati founders, the old bargains, the Severance. He was ancient when Tarkhon was young—his kingdom predates the empire by centuries. His continued existence is an embarrassment to imperial narratives of progress and a reminder that some things in the empire are older than the empire itself. Worse, he knows secrets the current dynasty would prefer stayed buried.

**The Kingdoms of Fire**

The four Neferati monarchies act as a bloc, which makes them powerful enough to negotiate collectively with Tarkhetan. If they ever decided to leave the empire together, Tarkhon would have difficulty stopping them. So far, the trade benefits have kept them loyal. So far.

### History

**The Founding (~600 years ago)**

Neferati warlords from Yaif recognized that the Tarkhon Strait could be controlled—and that whoever controlled it would control trade across half the world. They brought sacred fire north, founded Tarkhetan on the Needle, and lit the Evertorch. From the beginning, Tarkhon was built on commerce.

**The Neferati Dynasty (~600-300 years ago)**

For nearly three centuries, Neferati emperors ruled from Tarkhetan. They expanded through trade agreements and tributary arrangements rather than conquest. Kerwin was already ruled by the immortal Ulyas; rather than fight him, the empire negotiated. Ulyas accepted nominal fealty in exchange for autonomy—an arrangement that has held for five centuries.

**The Dilution (~400-300 years ago)**

Neferati bloodlines mixed with human through generations of political marriages. The ruling family became increasingly human—fire-touched perhaps, but not truly of the flame.

**The Severance (~300 years ago)**

The last fire-blooded emperor died without legitimate heir. His children by his Neferati mistress were passed over for his fully human nephew. The Neferati faction resisted. The war that followed was brief but vicious. The human faction won. The pure Neferati withdrew to the Kingdoms of Fire. The Evertorch stayed—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish. But its keepers changed.

**The Klor Campaign (~200 years ago)**

Klor's brutal clearing of the Eronia Range secured the empire's southern frontier but left a moral stain that some believe has never washed clean. The mountains are safe now. The price was measured in tens of thousands of lives.

**The Present Day**

King Selron II rules an empire held together by profit rather than loyalty. The system works—for now. Trade flows, taxes are paid, the navy maintains order. But the foundations are fragile, the subsidiaries are calculating, and the immortal halfling in Kerwin remembers everything the current dynasty has forgotten.
