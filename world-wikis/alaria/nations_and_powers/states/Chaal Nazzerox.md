## Chaal Nazzerox

Tags: state, undead, empire

The undead empire of southern Terrenia, ruled by the lich king Xynoth Azkonor from his rotting capital at Emnatt Nazzerath. Approximately ninety-five percent of the population are undead—shadow-bound corpses with no spirit, no will, and no purpose except what their master commands. The remaining five percent are living collaborators: the cruel, the desperate, and the mad who have chosen service over death.

Chaal Nazzerox was once a prosperous agricultural region, its rivers carrying grain to markets across Terrenia. That ended when Xynoth rose. Now the rivers carry corpses and slave barges, the fields are tended by shambling dead under living overseers, and the cities crumble because no one remembers how to maintain them.

The empire is contained—for now. Sea to the west, mountains to the south, hostile forces to the east, and living nations to the north. Every year, Xynoth probes these barriers. Every year, he comes a little closer to breaking through.

### Government

#### The Lich King

**Xynoth Azkonor** rules absolutely. His word is law. His will animates the dead. Without him—or, more precisely, without the fragment of spirit that remains after centuries of death and rebirth—the undead would collapse into purposeless heaps.

Xynoth was human once, a necromancer of considerable power who sought immortality through lichdom. He achieved it, but lichdom is not free. Each time a lich dies and reforms, their spirit fragments—a piece lost, a piece changed. Xynoth has died many times. What remains is barely recognizable as the man he was. Whether he remembers his original motivations is unclear; whether they would matter anymore is doubtful.

The lich king rules from a citadel in Emnatt Nazzerath, emerging rarely but seeing much through the eyes of his dead servants. He does not eat, sleep, or engage in the activities of the living. He plans. He experiments. He waits.

#### The Living Elite

The five percent of living population are not slaves—they are collaborators, elevated above the masses in exchange for service. These are overseers, administrators, specialists whose skills the dead cannot replicate. They manage the living slaves, maintain what infrastructure survives, and compete viciously for the lich king's favor.

The living elite are not organized into formal houses or factions. Alliances form and dissolve based on immediate advantage. Trust is rare; betrayal is expected. The only constant is that everyone serves Xynoth, and everyone fears becoming unnecessary.

Some collaborators are true believers who worship the lich king as a god or see undeath as evolution. Others are pragmatists doing whatever survival requires. A few are biding their time, hoping for an opportunity that may never come. All of them are damned in the eyes of the living world outside.

#### The Undead Mass

Ninety-five percent of Chaal Nazzerox's population are animated corpses—shadows bound to dead flesh, with no spirit to provide consciousness or will. They are tools, not people. They follow commands with literal precision, lack initiative or creativity, and "mill aimlessly when not directed."

The undead hierarchy reflects this. Most are simple laborers or soldiers: shambling corpses capable of basic tasks and basic violence. Above them are the preserved—corpses maintained in better condition, capable of more complex work. At the top are the intelligent undead: revenants who retained their spirits, liches who followed Xynoth's path, and stranger things that serve for reasons of their own.

All undead ultimately answer to Xynoth. Without his will binding them, they would collapse. This makes him both the empire's greatest strength and its critical vulnerability.

### Settlements

#### Emnatt Nazzerath

The capital city, seat of the lich king. Once the grandest city in southern Terrenia; now a rotting monument to death's triumph over life.

The streets are choked with shambling dead—soldiers between assignments, laborers awaiting tasks, corpses that simply stopped and never moved again. The buildings decay because no one repairs them; roofs collapse, walls crumble, infrastructure fails. The living elite maintain their own compounds through constant effort, islands of functionality in a sea of rot.

At the city's heart rises Xynoth's citadel, a tower of black stone that predates the empire. Some say he built it; others claim he found it and made it his. The citadel never decays. It never changes. It watches.

The living population clusters in the merchant quarter, where food and goods still change hands. Slaves are bought and sold here. So are services, information, and favors. Everyone is for sale in Emnatt Nazzerath—including the buyers.

#### Gorvul Mkayin

A city on the southern shore of Deadman's Lake, built to control the one body of water where corpses stay dead. The empire disapproves of wasted resources, and every body dropped into Deadman's Lake is a soldier denied.

Gorvul Mkayin processes arrivals from the northern territories—slaves, tribute, captured refugees. The living elite here are particularly brutal; they earned their positions through demonstrated cruelty. The city also serves as a staging ground for campaigns against the holdouts, its position allowing rapid deployment in multiple directions.

The lake's strange property—preventing undead animation—has made Gorvul Mkayin a center for covert disposal. Living residents sometimes pay enormous bribes to have their dead relatives dropped into the lake rather than conscripted. The authorities take the bribes and make no promises.

#### Sklevyurn

A northern city serving as the empire's primary military staging area. Armies mass here before marching south against the holdouts or probing the northern borders. Smithies work slave labor to arm the dead—not that undead need much equipment, but Xynoth believes in overwhelming force.

Sklevyurn is grim, functional, and joyless. Even by the standards of Chaal Nazzerox, the atmosphere oppresses. The living here exist to serve military logistics; there is no pretense of normal life. Rations are distributed, quotas are met, and the war machine grinds forward.

#### Parthemylos

An eastern city that serves as the empire's administrative hub—taxes, census, supply allocation, the bureaucratic machinery that keeps even an undead empire functioning. The living elite here are clerks and accountants, tracking resources that the dead cannot count themselves.

Parthemylos maintains the empire's records, such as they are. Population counts (living and dead), tribute schedules, military deployments, slave inventories. The archives are a mess—the dead make poor record-keepers, and the living have more pressing concerns than organization—but they exist, and occasionally prove useful.

#### Pyaal Faras

A southwestern city near Hagswood, maintaining an uncomfortable proximity to the hag coven. Pyaal Faras serves as the point of contact between the empire and the hags—whatever arrangement exists between them, it's administered here.

The city has an undeserved reputation for commerce. Goods flow through Pyaal Faras that aren't available elsewhere in the empire: hag-brewed potions, items from the Strait of Curses, things better not examined closely. The living elite here are traders and intermediaries, people comfortable dealing with monsters.

#### Eyovlix

A southeastern town on the Melkron River, serving as the empire's forward base for campaigns against the Crystal Mountains. Undead armies stage here before their endless, grinding assaults on the mountain passes.

Eyovlix is less a settlement than a military camp that never disbanded. The living population exists to support operations—healers for the wounded (living soldiers do fight alongside the dead), quartermasters, engineers attempting to solve the problem of moving shambling armies through mountain terrain. Progress is slow.

### The Holdouts

Two significant settlements within the empire's claimed territory have never fallen: the Gray Citadel and Melthrayn. Both are under constant pressure but have held for years. Their continued existence is an embarrassment to Xynoth and a symbol of hope for those who resist.

#### Gray Citadel

A fortress in the Steed Hills, originally built to guard against threats from the south. When Xynoth rose, the citadel's garrison refused to surrender. They've been refusing ever since.

The Gray Citadel's survival owes to terrain, construction, and desperation. The Steed Hills are difficult for shambling armies to traverse. The fortress walls were built thick and have been reinforced with everything available. The defenders know that surrender means death or worse—they fight because there is no alternative.

The citadel is overcrowded with refugees, undersupplied by occasional smuggler convoys, and perpetually on the edge of starvation. Commanders debate whether to hold or attempt a breakout. Neither option offers good odds. They hold because holding is all they can do.

#### Melthrayn

A walled city-state in the eastern reaches that has somehow resisted incorporation into the empire. Unlike the Gray Citadel, Melthrayn is not just a fortress—it's a functioning city with farms within its walls, industries, a civilian population living something approaching normal lives.

How Melthrayn has survived is unclear. Theories include powerful wards, alliance with unknown powers, leverage over Xynoth himself, or simply that the lich king hasn't committed the resources to take it. The city's rulers don't explain, and visitors (what few there are) report a population that doesn't discuss the matter.

Refugees who reach Melthrayn rarely leave. Whether this is because they've found safety or because they're not permitted to leave is another question without answers.

### Military

The empire's military strength is simple: numbers without limit and soldiers that never tire, never flee, and never stop. An undead army is not particularly skilled or adaptive, but it doesn't need to be. It just keeps coming.

**Shambling hordes**: The bulk of the army. Animated corpses capable of basic weapon use and basic tactics—advance, attack, repeat. They're slow, clumsy, and easily confused by complex terrain. But there are so many.

**Preserved soldiers**: Better-maintained corpses, faster and more durable. These form elite units for specialized tasks.

**Siege forces**: The undead are natural siege troops. They don't need food, don't need rest, and don't care about casualties. They simply assault until the walls fall or they're destroyed.

**Living auxiliaries**: Some living soldiers serve the empire voluntarily—mercenaries, fanatics, those who've chosen the winning side. They provide tactical flexibility the dead lack.

**Command structure**: Intelligent undead and living commanders direct the mindless masses. Without direction, undead armies stall. Kill the commanders, and the assault fragments.

---

### Economy

Chaal Nazzerox produces almost nothing. The empire survives through:

**Slave agriculture**: Living slaves work fields to feed the living population. The undead don't eat, but their masters do.

**Plunder**: What the empire can't produce, it takes. Neighboring regions have been stripped; now the pickings are thin.

**Tribute**: Conquered populations pay in food, goods, and bodies. The Brevldorf Hills communities survive through this arrangement.

**Hag trade**: Whatever the Hagswood coven provides, it has value. Pyaal Faras facilitates exchange.

The economy is unsustainable. Without expansion, the empire will eventually consume itself. This is why Xynoth probes the borders constantly—he needs new resources, new slaves, new corpses.

---

### Travel

Nearly all travel is by river. The ground is soft—waterlogged, unstable, unsuitable for roads. The rivers are Chaal Nazzerox's highways, and whoever controls them controls movement.

The undead can wade through soft ground, but slowly. Living travelers without boat access are effectively immobile. This has shaped the empire's geography, concentrating power along riverbanks and leaving the interior accessible only to those willing to struggle.

Outsiders attempting to enter or leave Chaal Nazzerox face significant challenges. The rivers are patrolled. The overland routes are watched. The borders are guarded by things that don't sleep. Refugees still escape—through the Frowning Forest, down the Yephrenzi River, over the Prowling Hills—but the price is high.

---

### Relations

**Aal Salma**: The merchant nation to the northwest watches the empire with alarm. Refugees cross their border constantly. War seems inevitable, but neither side has struck.

**Windor**: The halfling nation further north has sealed its borders. No trade, no contact, no acknowledgment that the undead exist. This is official policy; unofficially, halfling smugglers make fortunes running goods to holdout forces.

**Poum Titch**: Currently tearing itself apart in civil war, which has distracted Xynoth from northern expansion. The lich king may be waiting for the war to end—whoever wins will be weakened.

**The Crystal Mountains**: Whatever lies beyond is defended. The mountain peoples have held the passes for years. Xynoth's armies assault and die and assault again.

**The Hagswood Coven**: An arrangement of unclear terms. The hags and the lich tolerate each other. No one knows why.

### What Makes It Dangerous

- **The dead keep coming**: Every defender who falls becomes an enemy. Attrition favors the empire absolutely.
- **Xynoth sees through his servants**: Surveillance is everywhere. The dead report to their master.
- **No conventional victory**: Kill every soldier, and Xynoth raises more. Destroy every city, and the empire operates from ruins. Only destroying Xynoth himself—and his phylacteries, wherever they are—ends the threat.
- **Containment is failing**: The barriers that hold the empire are weakening. The Crystal Mountain defenders lose ground each year. The northern states are distracted by their own problems.
- **The lich is patient**: Xynoth has been planning for centuries. Whatever he's waiting for, it's coming.
