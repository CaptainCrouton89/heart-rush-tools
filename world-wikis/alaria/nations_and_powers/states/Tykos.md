## Tykos

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Slaver aristocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Minotaurs, humans (enslaved)

**Population**: 35,000 (including slaves)

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Strength, dominance, tradition, hierarchy

- Tykos is ruled by minotaur clans who've practiced slavery for as long as anyone can remember. The strong rule; the weak serve. This isn't philosophy to them—it's simply how the world works.
- The minotaur aristocracy controls all land, all trade, and all decision-making. Humans and other races exist as property, workers, or (rarely) freed servants with limited rights.
- The clan system determines everything. Each major settlement is controlled by a clan, and inter-clan politics drive most conflicts. Marriages, alliances, and betrayals follow patterns as old as the islands themselves.
- Outsiders view Tykos with disgust, but the minotaurs don't care. They trade with anyone willing to buy or sell, and many are willing—Tykos slaves are well-trained and relatively cheap.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Slaves, labor, mercenaries, livestock, stone

**Primary Imports**: Luxury goods, weapons, grain

- The slave trade is Tykos's primary industry. Captives from raids, purchased prisoners, and the children of existing slaves flow through Tykos's markets to buyers across the Middle Sea.
- The minotaurs themselves are sought after as mercenaries—massive, disciplined, and terrifying in battle. Clans hire out warriors for premium prices.
- Quarries in the rocky islands produce quality building stone, extracted by slave labor and shipped throughout the region.
- Agriculture is limited by the terrain; Tykos imports much of its grain and pays with the products of forced labor.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (for minotaurs)

- Every minotaur male trains for war. Military service is a coming-of-age requirement and a lifelong obligation. The clans compete through martial prowess as much as political maneuvering.
- The Tykos navy is formidable—fast raiding ships designed to strike coastal settlements, take captives, and escape before organized resistance can form.
- Slave soldiers exist but are used carefully. Armed slaves are a risk, and the minotaurs prefer to do their own fighting when possible.

### Geography

**Location**: Island chain south of Erpeus, in the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Rocky islands, scrubland, limited arable land

**Named Entities**: Tiber's Passage (north), Tykon Channel (east)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Limited freshwater; cisterns and wells are critical

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (all directions), Tiber's Passage, Tykon Channel

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Slavos (the largest settlement and primary slave market)

**Cities**: Slavos

**Towns**: Toros, Skoldar, Fynol, Alyzon, Pyndar, Stonebreach

**Villages**: Scarr, Seaview, numerous smaller settlements

### Primary Conflicts

**Inter-Clan Rivalry**

The clans compete constantly for status, territory, and slaves. Open warfare is rare—it damages valuable property and weakens everyone—but raids, assassinations, and political maneuvering are constant. The current balance of power is always temporary.

**The Abolition Movement**

Some outsiders, particularly in Lier and the United Free Nations, argue that Tykos's slave trade should be ended by force. So far, no one has been willing to pay the cost of such a war. But as the moral arguments grow louder and Tykos's neighbors grow stronger, the calculation may change.

**Escaped Slaves**

Slaves who escape Tykos have nowhere safe to go on the islands—but some manage to reach the sea, steal boats, or swim to passing ships. The minotaurs hunt escapees relentlessly; a successful escape encourages others. The underground network that helps slaves flee is small, secretive, and constantly hunted.

**The Ofrenia Disruption**

Alisandra's conquest of Tornia has disrupted regional trade, including Tykos's slave markets. Some buyers can't reach the islands; others are distracted by war. The clans are adapting, but the uncertainty makes them nervous.

### History

The minotaurs came to these islands in an age before human memory, fleeing something they don't discuss. They found rocky terrain, limited resources, and a strategic position at the crossroads of Middle Sea trade. They adapted.

Slavery emerged naturally—or so the minotaurs claim. Raiding coastal settlements for workers solved the labor shortage. Selling surplus captives created trade relationships. The system grew, formalized, became tradition. By the time other civilizations developed moral objections, Tykos was too entrenched and too profitable to change easily.

The clan structure evolved to manage competition without constant warfare. Rules about raiding, about treatment of slaves, about territorial boundaries—these developed over generations, creating a society that's brutal but stable. The minotaurs see themselves as honest about what every civilization practices covertly: the strong exploit the weak. At least Tykos doesn't pretend otherwise.

Modern Tykos is much as it's always been. The slave markets operate. The clans compete. The minotaurs prosper while their property suffers. Outsiders condemn them and continue trading. The system continues because no one has yet found a way to stop it that doesn't cost more than they're willing to pay.
