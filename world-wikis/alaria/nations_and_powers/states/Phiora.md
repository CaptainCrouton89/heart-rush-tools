## Phiora

Tags: state, major island

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Fraternal monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Verucan (fire dwarves)

**Population**: 40,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Humor, wit, passion, smithing, craftsmanship

- The Verucan are fire dwarves—obsidian-black skin with glowing red veins that pulse with inner heat. Born from volcanic forges, they built their civilization within active volcanoes, harnessing geothermal energy.
- Like volcanoes, the Verucan are complacent most of the time, but will occasionally begin to bubble beneath the surface, only to explode with fiery temper at some unexpected moment. Their loves burn as hot as their hatreds.
- Phiora is ruled by siblings under a fraternal monarchy. The elder sibling has more executive power, but when succession comes, it passes to the children of the younger sibling. This unusual arrangement prevents power from concentrating in one branch and forces the ruling siblings to cooperate—or at least to limit their conflicts.
- Despite being master weaponsmiths, the Verucan are surprisingly non-militaristic. They view anger as a sacred flame that drives innovation and excellence in craft, not conquest.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Weapons, metalwork, volcanic glass, geothermal crafts

**Primary Imports**: Food, timber, textiles

- The forges of Mount Kajiit produce weapons of exceptional quality. Phioran steel is sought across the Middle Sea, and wealthy warriors pay premium prices for blades tempered in volcanic fire.
- The island's volcanic soil is poor for farming, and the Verucan have little interest in agriculture. They import most of their food in exchange for metalwork.
- The economy runs hot and cold, matching Verucan temperament. Production surges during periods of inspiration; work slows when the collective mood turns contemplative.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Despite being expert weapon craftsmen, the Phioran populace is largely non-militaristic. Most have never fought in a war. They make the tools of war; others use them.
- Verucan generally dislike the sea—something about the cold water conflicts with their fiery nature. The Phioran navy is pitiful, barely sufficient to patrol local waters.
- Defense relies on geography. The caldera of Mount Kajiit is virtually impregnable, and any invader would have to fight uphill through volcanic terrain against defenders who know every tunnel and lava flow.

### Geography

**Biomes**: Volcanic island, geothermal vents, obsidian fields

**Named Entities**: Mount Kajiit, Kedari Emnath

**Rivers & Lakes**: Geothermal pools, lava flows

**Adjacent Waters**: The Forgotten Sea, the Middle Sea

### Political Geography

**Cities**: Mereiki

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Doga (coastal)

### Primary Conflicts

**Sibling Rivalry**

The fraternal monarchy ensures that ruling siblings must work together, but it doesn't ensure they'll like each other. Court drama erupts regularly when the elder and younger clash over policy, pride, or petty grievances. The explosions are spectacular—sometimes literally, given Verucan tempers—but the system has survived for generations.

**Arms Dealing Ethics**

Phiora sells weapons to anyone who can pay, which means their blades often appear on both sides of the same war. This creates complicated diplomatic situations and occasional moral qualms. Some Verucan argue for restricting sales; others point out that a blade doesn't choose its wielder. The debate smolders but never quite ignites into policy change.

**Isolation vs. Engagement**

The Verucan dislike the sea and generally prefer to stay on their island, but trade requires engagement with the wider world. Younger Verucan increasingly question whether isolation serves their interests, while elders point out that every time Phiora has gotten involved in mainland politics, it's ended badly.

**The Kajiit Legacy**

Mount Kajiit was once forcibly erupted by a follower of Dyos to end the daemon wars, causing a volcanic winter and multi-millennia ice age that killed millions. The Verucan live with this history—literally, within the caldera of that catastrophic eruption. Some view it as ancient history; others believe the mountain remembers and might one day remind the world of its power.

### History

The Verucan emerged from the volcanic forges of southern peaks in ages past, and eventually found their way to Pii Island. They recognized Mount Kajiit as kin—a living volcano that matched their fiery nature—and made their home within its caldera.

The fraternal monarchy developed as a solution to succession crises that nearly destroyed early Phiora. When two siblings both claimed the throne, the compromise that prevented civil war became permanent tradition: share power, but ensure it passes to a different branch each generation. The system creates tension but prevents tyranny.

Phiora's reputation as a weapons source grew over centuries. The combination of volcanic heat, Verucan craftsmanship, and obsessive attention to quality produced blades that outlasted their wielders. Kings, generals, and assassins all sought Phioran steel. The Verucan sold to all of them and stayed out of the fights their weapons fueled.

The island's historical tragedy—the Kajiit eruption—predates Verucan settlement but shapes their worldview. They live in a place that once ended an age. They've built their civilization around a force that could destroy it at any moment. This awareness gives Verucan culture its characteristic intensity: life is short, the volcano is eternal, so work with passion while you can.
