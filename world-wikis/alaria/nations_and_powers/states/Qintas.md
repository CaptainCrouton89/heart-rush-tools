## Qintas

Tags: state

A coastal state in Central Aboyinzu, home to a significant Amverela high elf population and famous across Alaria for Sondoros wine—a vintage so legendary that it has shaped the state's economy, politics, and international relations for millennia.

### Government

Qintas is governed by councils that embody Amverela philosophy: deliberate, patient, and frustratingly slow to outsiders. The High Council in Constancias meets quarterly to address major policy; lesser councils handle administrative matters; emergency procedures exist for crises but have been invoked perhaps twice in living memory.

Representation is weighted toward longevity. Amverela who have served for centuries hold more influence than human delegates who die after a few decades. This isn't formal policy—it simply reflects how council dynamics evolve over time. Humans participate but rarely dominate.

The government's approach to problems is to have anticipated them generations ago. When this works, Qintas appears preternaturally prepared. When it fails—when something genuinely new arises—the response can be catastrophically slow.

### Population

**Amverela High Elves**: The cultural and political elite, though not numerically dominant. They hold most council positions, own most significant property, and set the tone for Qintan society. They are patient, wise, and sometimes paralyzed by their own caution.

**Humans**: The majority population, concentrated in cities and agricultural regions. They do most of the manual labor, including the physical work of the wine harvest. Relations with the Amverela are cordial if condescending—the elves view humans as useful but short-lived; humans view elves as impressive but insufferable.

**Others**: Qintas welcomes traders and visitors from across Alaria, particularly in Mataojo. A cosmopolitan port population has developed there, distinct from the more homogeneous interior.

### Economy

**Sondoros Wine**: The foundation of everything. The legendary wine produced from the Sondoros forest's unique vines cannot be replicated elsewhere—many have tried, all have failed. This monopoly has made Qintas wealthy and given the Amverela leverage far exceeding their military power.

Wine exports fund imports of everything else. Qintas produces food, wool, and crafts for domestic consumption, but its international significance rests entirely on Sondoros.

**Trade**: Mataojo serves as the state's commercial gateway, welcoming ships from across Alaria eager to purchase wine and whatever else the high elves will sell. The Amverela prefer to let others handle the actual sailing.

### Military

Qintas maintains professional guards rather than a true army—enough to patrol roads, protect wine shipments, and maintain order, not enough to fight a war. The Amverela philosophy holds that wars are won through diplomacy, economics, and patience, not through soldiers.

This philosophy has worked so far. Whether it will survive contact with Chaal Nazzerox's undead hordes remains to be seen. The Amverela are preparing—they've been preparing for centuries—but their preparations are characteristically opaque.

### Culture

Amverela culture values patience, beauty, and long-term thinking. Buildings are designed to last millennia. Decisions are made slowly and implemented gradually. Art is created with the understanding that the artist may not live to see it completed, but the work will outlast everyone.

Humans in Qintas have adapted to this pace or learned to work around it. The port city of Mataojo operates on human time; the rest of the state operates on elven time. The contrast can be jarring.

### Relations

**Grustos**: Friendly neighbor to the west. The Amverela consider Grustani slightly uncouth but appreciate their role as buffer against the undead. Trade flows freely; borders exist mainly on maps.

**Chaal Nazzerox**: The existential threat. If Grustos falls, Qintas is next. The Amverela have plans—centuries of plans—but no one outside their councils knows what those plans entail.

**Broader Alaria**: Qintas maintains cordial relations with anyone willing to buy wine, which is everyone. The state's soft power far exceeds its size.

### What Will Go Wrong

- **The wine could fail**: If something happens to the Sondoros vines—blight, magical corruption, climate change—Qintas loses its only real asset.
- **Ojos Goros**: The watching forest in the south. The Amverela avoid it and won't explain why. Whatever's in there has been watching for a long time.
- **Too slow to respond**: Amverela patience is a strength until it's a fatal weakness. Some threats don't wait for quarterly council meetings.
- **The undead are coming**: Chaal Nazzerox will eventually break out. The Amverela's long-term plans had better be good.
