## Tangiern

Tags: state, human, crimson-coast

A human kingdom on the Crimson Coast, Tangiern has survived for centuries in the shadow of the Winter Elves—paying tribute, keeping quiet, and building strength in the vast Fragenstor Mielthøn forest. The elven civil war has given them unexpected freedom. What they do with it will determine whether their kingdom thrives or burns.

### Overview

Tangiern occupies the western two-thirds of the Crimson Coast, bounded by the Dragon's Spine mountains to the north and the Void to the south. The land is dominated by the enormous Fragenstor Mielthøn—a dark conifer forest that has shaped Tangier culture as much as any king or god. The people are foresters, hunters, and trappers who have learned to find wealth in the endless woods while avoiding the attention of their powerful neighbors.

Capital: **Nøsen** (~4,000 population)

### Government

**King Halvard III** rules Tangiern, the sixth in a dynasty established when his ancestors unified the scattered forest clans. The kingdom functions as a loose confederation—jarls control the major towns and owe military service to the crown, but local governance remains local. The king's authority extends mainly to foreign relations, military coordination, and the settlement of disputes between jarls.

The current situation demands more centralization than tradition allows. Halvard has been quietly expanding royal authority, positioning loyalists in key positions and building a standing force separate from the jarls' levies. This hasn't gone unnoticed; some jarls grumble that the king is using the elven crisis as an excuse to seize power.

**Succession** follows male primogeniture with provision for regency. Halvard has three sons; the succession is secure unless the elves decide to remove him.

### Culture

The Tangier people are practical, taciturn, and deeply connected to their forest. They worship nature spirits and ancestors without formal priesthoods—each family maintains its own shrines, and sacred groves scattered through the forest serve as communal holy sites. The elves' daemon-worship seems alien and slightly repulsive to them; they cooperate with elven religion as little as possible.

**Festivals** mark the seasons: the Return of Light (spring equinox, celebrating survival of another winter), the Great Hunt (autumn, a kingdom-wide hunting competition), and the Long Dark (winter solstice, a somber acknowledgment of the hardest season). These celebrations are the rare occasions when the scattered forest communities gather.

**Social structure** is based on skill and contribution. A master woodsman outranks a wealthy merchant; a successful hunter outranks both. Titles exist but carry less weight than demonstrated competence. This meritocratic tendency frustrates outside traders who can't figure out who to bribe.

### Economy

Timber and furs drive Tangiern's economy. The Fragenstor Mielthøn provides seemingly endless lumber, and Tangier woodsmen have developed techniques for selective harvesting that maintain forest health while meeting demand. Furs—bear, wolf, fox, and the prized winter ermine—command premium prices in markets around the Void.

Agriculture is limited. The growing season is short, the soil acidic, and cleared land tends to revert to forest. Most grain is imported, creating vulnerability that Halvard is working to address through forest-edge farming initiatives.

The kingdom has no significant mining—the Dragon's Spine contains ore, but the mountains are too dangerous to work. Metal goods are imported, making Tangiern dependent on trade relationships that the elven civil war has disrupted.

### Military

Tangiern fields approximately 2,000 fighters when fully mobilized—jarls' levies plus a small royal guard. They're skilled in forest warfare: ambush, tracking, and survival in difficult terrain. In open battle against disciplined elven forces, they'd likely lose. In their own forest, they'd make any invader pay dearly for every mile.

**The Forest Guard** is Halvard's attempt to build a professional core. Currently perhaps 300 strong, these full-time soldiers train year-round and answer directly to the crown. Their existence annoys the jarls, who see it as a threat to their traditional military role.

### Relations

**With Klevnaf**: Cautiously neutral. Taoinor has made overtures—alliance against Istora in exchange for reduced tribute—but Halvard hasn't committed. He doesn't trust elven promises and suspects any alliance would leave Tangiern worse off than neutrality.

**With Istora**: Carefully neutral. Lamenrae has also made overtures, emphasizing her reformist agenda and hinting that a progressive elven kingdom might be easier to live beside than the traditional alternative. Halvard is skeptical; a nastier Istora under a vengeful queen might be worse than old-style elven rule.

**With the Dragon's Spine Coast**: Minimal contact. The mountains block easy travel, and whatever lurks beyond them isn't Tangiern's problem yet.

### History

Tangiern's history is one of survival through accommodation. When the Winter Elves arrived millennia ago, the scattered human clans faced extinction or submission. They chose submission—paying tribute, providing labor, and staying out of elven affairs. In exchange, they were left to govern themselves within their forest.

The unification came three hundred years ago when Halvard's ancestor, Bjorn the Builder, convinced the clans that a unified human voice would negotiate better terms than individual supplication. He was right; the unified kingdom negotiated reduced tribute and formal recognition of Tangier sovereignty within the forest.

The current crisis is unprecedented. For the first time in living memory, no elven power demands tribute. Halvard's challenge is converting this temporary freedom into permanent independence—without triggering elven retaliation that his kingdom can't survive.

### What Outsiders Notice

- The smell of pine resin everywhere
- Suspicious stares from locals who don't see many strangers
- Wooden construction even in the capital—stone is rare and expensive
- The casual competence with which even children handle axes and bows
- References to "the elves" delivered with careful neutrality

### Adventure Hooks

- Halvard needs deniable agents to gather intelligence on both elven factions
- Something in the deep Fragenstor Mielthøn has woken up, and the foresters can't handle it alone
- A jarl is secretly negotiating with one elven faction; find out which and what they're promising
- The ruins of Hildaneir have become active; Tangiern needs outsiders to investigate without elven notice
