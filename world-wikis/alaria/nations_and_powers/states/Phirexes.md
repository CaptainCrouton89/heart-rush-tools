## Phirexes

Tags: state, emerald coast, swamp

A fog-shrouded swampland at the southeastern edge of the Emerald Coast, ruled by the gorgon queen Phendexelas the Beautiful. What appears to be an absolute monarchy is something stranger: a nation of willing captives who praise their jailer nightly, trapped not by walls but by magical addiction to the very mists that imprison them.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy (de facto theocratic cult)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Dengar (swamp halflings)

**Population**: ~30,000 (concentrated in Maurevelious; several hundred refugees in hiding)

**Stability**: Stable (superficially); deeply unstable (beneath the surface)

**Core Values**: Gratitude, unity, devotion to the queen, "the worse it gets, the better it was"

The gorgon Phendexelas the Beautiful has ruled Phirexes for sixty years, having manufactured the crisis that brought her to power and positioned herself as savior. She does not need to rule through fear—the Dengar culture of finding silver linings in suffering has been weaponized into mass Stockholm syndrome. Citizens genuinely believe they are fortunate to live under her protection, because the alternative (the fog-maddened swamp she created) is so much worse.

Every evening, Phendexelas walks the raised boardwalk through Maurevelious's central district. Every citizen who can attend does attend, kneeling with heads bowed as she passes, listening to her speak of her love for them. Those who miss the Queen's Walk are noted. Those who miss it repeatedly are visited by her agents. Those visits end in one of two ways: renewed devotion or disappearance.

The refugees—a few hundred Dengar who escaped Maurevelious and cannot return—hide in Old One's Wood, sustained by smugglers and the Sweet Water River. They are sick, all of them; the fog-binding that makes the queen's subjects unable to leave also afflicts those who've fled. But they endure, waiting for something to change, holding onto the memory of what the Dengar were before Phendexelas came.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed (exceptional alchemy)

**Primary Exports**: Medicines, alchemical compounds, "swamp spirits" (alcohol)

**Primary Imports**: Metals, metal goods, preserved foods, textiles

The Dengar are master alchemists, a tradition predating the queen by centuries. Their still-houses produce medicines that no other culture can match: salves for infections that resist magical healing, elixirs that dull pain without clouding the mind, compounds that can purge exotic poisons. They also produce "swamp spirits"—a violently alcoholic brew that doubles as solvent, antiseptic, and (the Dengar insist) a perfectly reasonable breakfast drink.

Phendexelas has captured this economy without destroying it. She controls access to rare ingredients by controlling access to Duskwood Forest where they grow. She monitors what formulas are produced, confiscating anything that might counteract fog-binding. She takes her cut of all exports. But she lets the Dengar work, lets them profit, lets them feel like they're thriving under her rule. Happy workers are productive workers, and productive workers don't ask questions.

The swamps prevent heavy industry—no mining, no large-scale metalwork, no foundries. Everything metal must be imported, which gives the queen another lever of control. She decides what comes in and from whom.

### Military

**Size**: None (officially)

**Quality**: N/A

**Enrollment**: Forbidden

Phendexelas forbids any military force in Phirexes. She and the swamp itself, she argues, are sufficient defense against any invasion. This is not empty boasting—the Croaking Briars have repelled every Trømgar assault, and the fogs would make conventional warfare impossible even if an army could reach Maurevelious.

The real reason for the prohibition is control. An armed populace might get ideas. The queen's personal power—her gorgon gaze, her sorcery, her control over the fogs—is more than sufficient to handle any internal dissent. External threats simply don't exist in meaningful form.

The watching ships that patrol the Gulf of Tears are not military vessels; they're classified as "customs enforcement." The agents who visit those who miss the Queen's Walk are not soldiers; they're "concerned citizens ensuring community wellness." The distinctions are technical but important—the queen maintains the fiction that Phirexes needs no military because Phirexes has nothing to fear.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Maurevelious

**Cities**: None besides Maurevelious

**Towns**: None (all population concentrated in capital)

**Villages**: Scattered work camps (logging, harvesting), refugee camps in Old One's Wood

Phirexes is unusual in having essentially one settlement. Before the queen came, the Dengar lived throughout the swamp in small communities. Phendexelas consolidated them into Maurevelious "for their protection"—creating a population center she could monitor and control. The old village sites are now ruins slowly sinking into the bog, occasionally visible when the fog thins.

### Borders & Neighbors

**West (Trømgar)**: The Croaking Briars form an impassable living wall. The Strømgodden battle dwarves have tried repeatedly to breach it; the briars grow back overnight, faster where blood is spilled. An uneasy non-relationship exists—neither side can reach the other, so neither side bothers with diplomacy.

**South (Kyagos)**: The Cloud Mountains separate Phirexes from the lawless Shacklands to the south. Little contact exists; Kyagos has its own problems.

**Northwest (Emerald Coast nations)**: Trade relationships exist with Eoga and Vystrilik, though heavily controlled. The queen permits enough commerce to maintain her economy but discourages any cultural exchange that might give her subjects ideas.

**Southeast (Ogzwad/Pfustias)**: The dragon Pfustias controls this territory in all but name. The queen and the dragon have some kind of arrangement—neither moves against the other, but neither acknowledges the other as ally.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Queen vs. The Refugees**: Several hundred Dengar have escaped Maurevelious and hidden in Old One's Wood. They cannot truly leave (fog-binding), cannot return (the queen would destroy them), and cannot live openly (the queen cannot tolerate visible defiance). The queen walks a careful line: she must maintain her image as savior while suppressing those who've rejected salvation. So far, she's content to let them suffer in hiding, trusting that their sickness and hardship will eventually break them.

**The Queen vs. Old One's Wood**: Something in the ancient forest hates Phendexelas with cold patience. Her fogs penetrate but don't control it. Her creatures enter and don't return. The forest shelters her enemies and resists her power. She hasn't moved against it directly—perhaps she can't, or perhaps she's waiting for the right moment.

**The Queen vs. Pfustias**: The dragon arrived a decade after Phendexelas. Their relationship is unclear to outsiders—cold war? Mutual observation? Some kind of game? Pfustias knows something about the queen that she'd prefer stayed secret. What leverage that gives the dragon, and how she might use it, remains to be seen.

**Internal Tension**: Not all Dengar have fully surrendered to the cult of gratitude. Some remember what life was like before, or have heard stories from grandparents. Quiet dissent exists, carefully hidden, waiting for something to change. The queen's agents work constantly to identify and neutralize these elements before they can organize.

### History

Sixty years ago, the Dengar lived throughout the swamp in scattered communities. They knew its dangers and respected them; they'd negotiated relationships with its creatures and spirits over generations. Life was hard but sustainable. They were free.

Then the gorgon came.

No one knows where Phendexelas came from or why she chose Phirexes. Some say she was fleeing something worse. Others say she was drawn by the swamp's latent magic. What matters is what she did: within months of her arrival, the fogs descended.

At first, the mists seemed merely weather. Then the swamp beasts began to go mad. Creatures the Dengar had lived alongside for generations turned savage. The spirits withdrew or went hostile. The carefully negotiated peace collapsed into chaos.

The Dengar fled their villages, gathering in the only safe place they could find: a patch of high ground where a strange gorgon was building a city with impossible speed. Phendexelas welcomed them with open arms. She'd prepared, she said. She'd seen this coming. She would protect them.

Within a year, Maurevelious stood complete, and thirty thousand Dengar lived within its walls. They were grateful—so grateful. The queen had saved them from a catastrophe she herself had created, and they had no way of knowing. The fog-binding was subtle at first, a dependency that grew so slowly it seemed natural. By the time anyone realized they couldn't leave, it was far too late.

Sixty years later, two generations have grown up knowing nothing but the queen's rule. The elders who remember freedom are dying off. The refugees who carry that memory are hunted and sick. And Phendexelas walks her boardwalk every evening, accepting the worship of a people who believe she is all that stands between them and oblivion.

### Player Hooks

**The Smuggler's Run**: A Vystrilik smuggling captain needs crew for a supply run to the refugees. The pay is excellent. The route goes through the Crocodile Coast. Survival is not guaranteed.

**The Silent Grove**: An elderly Dengar exile approaches the party with a request: investigate the Grove of Migwam and find out why the ancestors stopped speaking. What happened to the spirits when the fogs came? Are they trapped? Dead? Something worse?

**Dragon's Bargain**: Pfustias has information about Queen Phendexelas—something that could shift the balance of power in Phirexes. She'll share it. For a price. The price is never gold.

**The Cure**: A brilliant Dengar alchemist claims to have developed a treatment for fog-binding. She needs rare ingredients from Duskwood Forest, which means getting the queen's permission—or going without it. She also needs test subjects willing to risk everything on an unproven formula.

**The Queen's Secret**: Rumor among the refugees: Phendexelas cannot leave Phirexes either. The fogs bind her too, or something does. She's as trapped as her subjects, ruling a prison she can never escape. If true, this changes everything. If false, investigating it means drawing the queen's attention.

**Heart of the Wood**: Something lives in the center of Old One's Wood—something that hates the queen and has been waiting sixty years for the right allies. The refugees speak of it in whispers. Pfustias speaks of it not at all, which might be more telling. Finding it means navigating a forest that thinks.
