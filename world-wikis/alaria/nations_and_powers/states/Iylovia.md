### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council of Silence (nominal)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gyv

**Population**: ~20,000

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Self-preservation, cunning, distrust

The Gyv cannot trust each other. Their Silver Tongue ability—subtle mind manipulation through conversation—means every interaction could be an attempt at control. So they built systems to govern without trust.

The **Council of Silence** meets in Theochori, in a chamber where speaking is forbidden. Proposals are submitted in writing. Votes cast by sealed ballot. Debates happen through intermediate written exchanges over days or weeks. It's agonizingly slow, but it prevents any single Gyv from manipulating the council through speech.

In peacetime, this worked. Representatives from across Iylovia would gather, deliberate through written protocol, and reach decisions. The process was glacial but fair—or at least, evenly manipulated.

In war, it's failing. Decisions take weeks while people die. The western settlements have started ignoring Theochori, making their own calls. The eastern settlements barely participate at all, too busy securing their own escape routes. The council still meets, still debates in silence, but its authority erodes with every passing season.


### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Timber, woven goods, forest medicines, rare plants

**Primary Imports**: Metal, grain, weapons

Iylovia's forests provide abundant resources: timber, plant fibers for cloth and rope, medicinal herbs, honey, rare dyes. The Gyv are skilled weavers and their textiles are prized across the region.

The problem is trade. The western regions are war zones—no merchants venture there. The center is isolated. Only the eastern coast has reliable trade access, through ports that connect to the Gray Isles and beyond.

This creates economic imbalance. The east grows wealthy while the west starves for supplies. Eastern merchants charge western settlements premium prices for metal and weapons. The west accuses the east of profiteering from their suffering. The east points out that they're the only ones keeping any trade flowing at all.

Both sides are probably right. Both sides are probably manipulating the situation for advantage.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (in western regions), Voluntary (elsewhere)

The Gyv have no conventional army. They never needed one—their manipulation worked better than swords. When the Silzar invaded, the Gyv discovered that mind control doesn't stop a charging mammoth.

Now they fight through **ambush and guerrilla tactics**. Small groups of fighters lurk in the forests, waiting for Silzar raiding parties to push too deep. When targets are isolated, the Gyv emerge, get close, and start talking. A minute of conversation can turn enemies against each other. The forests become killing grounds—not through superior force, but through confusion, betrayal, and manipulated rage.

The western settlements have developed the most effective fighters. They've learned to coordinate—somewhat—despite their cultural inability to trust. They use written signals, prearranged plans, and strict protocols that minimize conversation between allies. It's crude compared to how other armies operate, but it's better than nothing.

The east has almost no military presence. They're counting on the west to hold. Or they're counting on negotiating separately if the west falls.


### Geography

**Location**: Forested region east of Silwyn, with eastern coastal access

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, swampland, hills, coastal lowlands

**Named Entities**: Gwyrdyr Forest, Leering Wood, Astrella Forest, Bittermarsh, Spinefir Forest, Terror Grove, Hagwood, Howlwood, Graymist Forest

**Rivers & Lakes**: River Sorrow, Gwyrdyr River, Skleidyon River, Odrigi River, Savarin River, Torpastros River, Graymist Lake

**Adjacent Waters**: Eastern coastal waters (access to Gray Isles and beyond)

Iylovia is defined by its forests. Dense woodland covers most of the nation, broken by rivers, marshland, and scattered settlements. The forests provide the Gyv's only military advantage—close quarters where their manipulation works, cover for ambushes, terrain that mammoths cannot navigate.

The western border with Silwyn runs through Gwyrdyr Forest, the most contested territory in the region. The Skleidyon River cuts through the center, passing through Theochori. The eastern regions slope down toward the coast, where the forests thin and trade ports connect to the wider world.


### Political Geography

**Capital**: Theochori

**Cities**: Theochori (capital), Krania (northern fortress), Balastafika (central)

**Major Towns**: Malesi, Ambelokipol, Mega Kalitsi, Ayia Paraskevi (western front); Skala Tuzlas, Varvares, Andigonos (eastern coast)

**Notable Sites**: Cheykiov (fortress ruins)

Settlement patterns reflect the war:

**The Western Front** (Gwyrdyr Forest region): Dense clusters of towns along the River Sorrow and Gwyrdyr River. Krania anchors the north—a fortress-city that has held against repeated Silzar pressure. Settlements like Malesi, Ambelokipol, and Ayia Paraskevi form a defensive network, supporting each other through the forests. These are the stubborn Gyv, the ones who refused to flee when the plains fell.

**The Center** (around Theochori): The capital sits on the Skleidyon River, protected by Spinefir Forest to the north and Terror Grove to the south. Balastafika serves as a secondary administrative center. This region is relatively safe—far from the front, connected by river trade.

**The Eastern Coast** (Odrigi and Savarin rivers): Trading settlements with port access. Skala Tuzlas, Varvares, and Andigonos handle most of Iylovia's external commerce. These communities are wealthier than the west, more connected to the outside world, and increasingly willing to consider their own survival over national unity.

**Cheykiov**: Fortress ruins in the hills southwest of Spinefir Forest. This defensive position fell early in the war—not to Silzar assault, but to betrayal. Someone manipulated the defenders. Someone opened the gates. The details are disputed; everyone blames everyone else. Cheykiov stands as a monument to Gyv dysfunction: they couldn't hold even a fortified position because they couldn't trust their own garrison.


### Primary Conflicts

**The War with Silwyn**

For forty-odd years, the Silzar have been pushing the Gyv back. What was once a Gyv domain stretching to the southern desert is now Silwyn—plains controlled by mammoth-riding ogres who've learned to counter Gyv manipulation with ear protection and overwhelming noise.

The Gyv hold the forests. The Silzar raid the edges. Neither side can break the stalemate, but the Gyv are losing slowly. Every raid costs them people, supplies, morale. The Silzar can afford attrition; the Gyv cannot.

**East vs. West**

The western Gyv are fighting and dying. The eastern Gyv are trading and preparing escape routes. Neither trusts the other.

The west accuses the east of abandonment, profiteering, perhaps even secret deals with the Silzar. The east accuses the west of strategic incompetence, wasted resources, perhaps even provoking the Silzar unnecessarily.

Both accusations probably contain truth. Both sides are certainly manipulating the narrative. The Council of Silence is supposed to mediate, but the council is too slow, too compromised, too far from either faction to matter.

**Internal Betrayal**

Someone is selling information to the Silzar. Probably multiple someones. Raid patterns suggest the Silzar know things they shouldn't—patrol schedules, supply routes, which settlements have weak defenses.

Everyone suspects everyone. Accusations fly constantly. Some are genuine attempts to find traitors; others are schemes to eliminate rivals by branding them collaborators. The paranoia feeds itself: the more accusations, the more distrust, the more betrayal seems inevitable, the more people consider betraying before they're betrayed.

**The Reform Movement**

Some Gyv argue that manipulation itself is the problem. They point to the Marked—Gyv who've had their Silver Tongue suppressed—as potential leaders. "Let the trustworthy lead us. Let us learn to speak honestly, at least among ourselves."

The traditionalists call this cultural suicide. The reformers call it survival. The argument has no resolution because neither side trusts the other's motives.


### History

**The Dominion**

The Gyv once ruled far beyond the forests. The plains that are now Silwyn? Gyv territory. The Silzar who lived there were scattered, weak, hunted for sport or enslaved for labor. The Gyv built settlements across the grasslands, managed the land, took what they wanted from the primitive ogres who couldn't resist their manipulation.

This lasted for generations. The Gyv assumed it would last forever.

**The Covenant**

Then the Silzar formed their alliance with the mammoth herds, and everything changed.

The Gyv didn't understand the threat at first. Ogres riding beasts? Amusing. Let them play at cavalry. A few words in the right ears would send them fighting each other.

But the mammoths trumpeted. The sound drowned out conversation. The Silzar wore coverings over their ears. And the ballistae struck from distances where no Gyv voice could reach.

The first Gyv settlements on the plains fell quickly. Then more. Then the retreat became a rout.

**The Retreat**

The Gyv fell back to the forests, where their abilities still functioned. Dense trees provided cover for ambush. Close quarters let them get within speaking range. The forest itself became their weapon—not magically, but tactically.

But they'd lost the plains. Lost settlements their families had held for generations. Lost slaves, livestock, resources, everything that wasn't portable. The Gyv who escaped to the forests arrived as refugees, crowding into communities that barely tolerated each other in good times.

**The Stalemate**

For decades now, the war has ground on. The Silzar control the plains. The Gyv hold the forests. The border is written in blood—raids, ambushes, atrocities on both sides.

The Gyv are losing. Slowly. Inexorably. They can't replace losses as fast as the Silzar inflict them. They can't coordinate defense because they can't trust each other. They're bleeding out, and everyone knows it, and no one can agree on what to do about it.


### Relations

**Silwyn**: War. The Silzar raid constantly; the Gyv ambush what they can. Neither side negotiates—the Silzar don't trust Gyv words, and the Gyv can't agree on what to offer anyway.

**Eros**: Avoidance. The haunted forest lies north of Iylovia, but the Gyv ignore it. The Nemo are terrifying, and unlike the Silzar, they cannot be manipulated. Some desperate voices suggest reaching out to Eros, pointing the Nemo at the Silzar somehow. Most consider this insane.

**Gray Isles and Beyond**: Trade. The eastern ports connect Iylovia to the outside world. Merchants come for timber and textiles; they bring metal and news. These relationships are Iylovia's lifeline—and the east's leverage over the rest of the nation.

**Everyone Else**: Suspicion. The Gyv reputation precedes them. Everyone knows they're manipulators. Trust is impossible. Trade happens anyway, because money talks louder than reputation, but no one deals with a Gyv without counting their fingers afterward.


### Player Hooks

**Nothing They Say Is True**: Players entering Iylovia will be manipulated. Everyone has an angle. The question isn't whether to trust the Gyv—you can't—but whose manipulation serves your interests.

**The Informant Hunt**: Someone is selling secrets to the Silzar. Multiple factions want the traitor found—some to punish them, others to silence them, others to take over the operation. Players could be hired by any faction, set against each other, or caught in the crossfire.

**East vs. West**: The eastern Gyv might hire players to sabotage western defenses, hastening collapse so they can negotiate separately. The western Gyv might hire players to prevent eastern betrayal. Both sides are lying about their true goals.

**Cheykiov**: The fortress ruins hold secrets. What really happened there? Who opened the gates? Some say treasure lies buried in the collapse. Others say something worse than treasure was sealed away.

**The Reform Movement**: The Marked—Gyv without manipulation powers—are trying to build a different kind of society. They might seek outside help: protectors, witnesses, people who can verify that they're actually trustworthy. Or their whole movement might be an elaborate scheme by Speakers pretending to be reformed.

**The Nemo Option**: Some desperate Gyv are seriously considering contact with Eros. They need someone willing to enter the haunted forest and speak to things that should not be spoken to. They're offering everything they have. They're probably also lying about what "everything" means.
