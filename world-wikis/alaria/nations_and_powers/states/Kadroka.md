## Kadroka

Tags: state, nation, dragon-ruled

Kadroka is a savanna state in southwestern Central Aboyinzu, ruled by the paralyzed dragon Melekas from the capital city of Ponoigari. It is a land of contradictions: prosperous but besieged, well-governed but under the thumb of a dragon, connected to major trade routes but functionally landlocked by hostile orcs.

### Geography

Kadroka occupies the transitional zone between the dense forests of the northwest (Penor Syalki, Sokorgül) and the Ramakemizi Mountains to the east. The terrain is largely open savanna and grassland, punctuated by rivers draining toward the southwestern coast.

**Borders:**
- **North**: Penor Syalki forest and Phaerhom (fairy territory)
- **East**: Ramakemizi Mountains (beyond which lies the Dalizi Confederation)
- **South/Southwest**: Tythikerys (blood orc territory) and the Agony Stones
- **West**: Sokorgül forest and Bluesong Bay (coastal access blocked by Tythikerys)

Despite proximity to the coast, Kadroka has no functional maritime access. The Tytheri blood orcs control the entire coastline of Bluesong Bay, effectively landlocking the state.

### The Dragon-King

Kadroka is ruled by Melekas the Stillbound, an ancient dragon who has been paralyzed and fused to the bedrock beneath Ponoigari for nearly eight hundred years. The dragon was crippled by contact with the Agony Stones and now rules through cunning, information networks, and the cultivation of loyal agents rather than physical might.

This arrangement is unusual among dragon-ruled territories. Most dragons dominate through the threat of aerial assault and mobility. Melekas can do neither—but the dragon has had eight centuries to perfect the art of ruling without them.

### Population

Kadroka is home to a mixed population of humans and naga, with smaller numbers of other peoples drawn by trade or service to the dragon.

**Naga** hold significant influence, serving in Melekas's inner circle as advisors, administrators, and interpreters of draconic will. Dragons and naga share ancient connections, and many naga families have served the Stillbound for generations.

**Humans** form the majority of the common population—farmers, merchants, soldiers, and craftspeople. Some resent naga prominence; others have prospered under the stability that draconic rule provides.

### Major Settlements

**Ponoigari** (Capital): Built around and upon the immobilized body of Melekas. The palace complex incorporates the dragon's petrified form, and the living head serves as the center of government. Population concentrated here for protection and proximity to power.

**Sukinada** (City): Eastern city near the Ramakemizi Mountains, serving as the primary gateway for trade with the Dalizi Confederation. Mountain passes connect through to Chechol and the eastern territories.

**Ibasaka** (City): Northern city on the Noara River, positioned between the capital and the forest territories to the north.

**Dranabaru** (City): Southern city near the Bloodswamp, uncomfortably close to Tytheri raiding routes but strategically important for monitoring orc movements.

**Arigaska** (City): Southernmost major settlement, essentially a fortified frontier town that bears the brunt of Tytheri raids.

### Economy

Kadroka's economy is shaped by its geographic constraints:

**Agriculture**: The savanna supports extensive cattle herding and grain cultivation. Kadrokan beef and leather are traded eastward over the mountains.

**Mountain Trade**: With coastal access denied, virtually all external trade flows through the Ramakemizi passes to Dalizi and Chechol. This makes the eastern cities disproportionately wealthy and important.

**Dragon Taxes**: Melekas demands substantial tribute, siphoning significant wealth to maintain the apparatus of draconic rule. The dragon claims this is protection money, and given the alternative, few argue.

### Military

Kadrokan military forces are primarily defensive, organized to repel Tytheri raids rather than project power beyond the borders.

**The Stillwatch**: Elite soldiers who guard Ponoigari and the dragon directly. Fanatically loyal, well-equipped, and trained to coordinate with the dragon's fire in urban defense.

**Border Patrols**: Light cavalry and infantry that screen the southwestern frontier. They cannot prevent all raids but provide early warning and pursue retreating orc bands.

**Naga Units**: Specialized forces leveraging naga abilities. Particularly effective in the Bloodswamp region, where their affinity for water and swamp terrain provides advantages.

### The Tytheri Threat

Kadroka exists in a state of constant low-intensity warfare with Tythikerys. The blood orcs raid regularly—taking slaves, cattle, and supplies back to their territory. Kadrokan forces can defend major settlements and pursue raiders, but cannot eliminate the threat at its source.

The dynamic is simple: Melekas cannot fly, so Melekas cannot burn the orcs from the sky. Kadrokan ground forces struggle in the rough terrain of Tythikerys and dare not approach the Agony Stones that sustain the orc's Ichor addiction. The orcs know this and grow bolder each generation.

Melekas schemes constantly for a way to break this impasse. The dragon would pay almost any price for a solution—and adventurers willing to investigate the Agony Stones, disrupt Tytheri Ichor harvesting, or find some other lever against the orcs would find a powerful patron in the Stillbound.

### External Relations

**Dalizi Confederation** (East): Kadroka's primary trading partner and diplomatic contact. Dalizi merchants are common in Sukinada, and the confederation provides an economic lifeline that prevents Kadrokan isolation.

**Chechol** (Northeast): Closer than Dalizi proper, Chechol serves as an intermediary for some trade and communication. Relations are cordial but not close.

**Phaerhom** (North): The fairy enclave in the Morygun Mountains is officially neutral toward Kadroka. Unofficially, the fae find the situation amusing—a dragon trapped in stone, harassed by orcs—and have shown no interest in helping.

**Tythikerys** (Southwest): Open hostility. No diplomatic contact. The orcs raid; Kadroka defends; the cycle continues.

### Adventure Hooks

- **The Dragon's Offer**: Melekas seeks agents willing to investigate the Agony Stones—specifically, to find a cure for the stillbinding. The reward would be substantial. The risk is becoming part of the Dying One.

- **Ichor Disruption**: Can the Tytheri's addiction be weaponized against them? Someone who could poison or redirect the Ichor supply might break the orc threat permanently. Or create something worse.

- **Mountain Politics**: The eastern cities grow wealthy while the frontier bleeds. Some in Sukinada whisper about independence, or at least reduced obligations to a capital that cannot protect them.

- **Naga Intrigue**: Human resentment of naga influence creates opportunities for those willing to play factional politics under the dragon's watchful eye.
