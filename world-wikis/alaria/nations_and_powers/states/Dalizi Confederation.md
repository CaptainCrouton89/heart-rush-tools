## Dalizi Confederation

Tags: state, confederation

A sprawling political entity comprising over forty member states—some true nations, others mere city-states—bound together by ancient treaties, mutual defense obligations, and a bewildering tangle of marriages, debts, and grudges. The Confederation occupies the territories northwest, west, and southwest of Lake Tonactlet Chipe, making it one of the largest political entities in southern Aboyinzu.

On paper, the Confederation is a unified realm. In practice, it's a slow-motion civil war fought through trade agreements, marriage contracts, assassinations, and procedural manipulation in the Diet. Every generation or so, the cold war turns hot—two or three states openly clash before exhaustion or outside pressure forces a truce. The borders inside the Confederation shift more often than the borders outside it.

Outsiders find the Confederation maddening. There's no single authority to negotiate with. Treaties with one state mean nothing to its neighbor. Merchants must navigate dozens of different tariff regimes, legal systems, and currencies. Mercenaries can find work on any given day, because someone is always fighting someone.

And yet the Confederation endures. When external threats arise—and they do—the member states somehow manage to cooperate just long enough to survive. Then they go back to fighting each other.

### Government

**The Dalizi Diet**

The nominal governing body of the Confederation, the Diet meets in the city of Metato (in Samani state) during the dry season. Representatives from every member state gather to debate, vote, and—theoretically—make binding decisions for the whole Confederation.

In practice, the Diet is a theater of manipulation. Voting blocs form and dissolve. Bribes change hands openly. Procedural rules are weaponized to delay, obstruct, or ram through proposals. A skilled political operator can paralyze the Diet for seasons or force through legislation no one wanted.

The Diet's actual power is limited to:
- Declaring war on external enemies (requires two-thirds majority)
- Admitting or expelling member states (requires three-quarters majority)
- Electing the Paramount (requires Elector consensus)
- Adjudicating disputes between member states (routinely ignored)

**The Paramount**

The head of the Confederation—a ceremonial position with theoretical supreme authority and practical powerlessness. The Paramount presides over the Diet, commands the Confederate Army (which exists only when the Diet authorizes it), and represents the Confederation to foreign powers.

The Paramount is elected by the Seven Electors upon the previous Paramount's death. The position is not hereditary, which means every succession is a crisis. Electors trade their votes for concessions—territories, trade rights, marriages, debts forgiven. The candidate who wins is usually the one who promises the most.

The current Paramount is **Makisani III of Mpaso**, an aging woman who has held the position for thirty-two years. She's competent, respected, and visibly declining. Her impending death has already triggered succession maneuvering. Three candidates have emerged, and none commands majority Elector support.

**The Seven Electors**

Seven member states hold the hereditary right to elect the Paramount:
1. **Mpaso** — currently held by Paramount Makisani's house, but her heir is weak
2. **Chilala** — the largest state, aggressive expansionists
3. **Lanwadanzi** — wealthy from eastern trade, prefers stability
4. **Samani** — hosts the Diet in Metato, considers itself above politics (it isn't)
5. **Shunde** — the most militarized state, respects only strength
6. **Nikpato** — central location, constantly invaded by neighbors, wants protection
7. **Kafula** — ancient bloodlines, claims founding-family descent, votes based on genealogical grudges

Elector status is theoretically permanent, but the Confederation's history includes several wars fought specifically to strip or claim Elector seats. The current seven have held their positions for over three centuries, but everyone remembers that Dhabisa was once an Elector before the War of Broken Oaths (2891 SD).

**The Five Circles**

Regional groupings that coordinate policy among neighboring states. Circles have no formal constitutional authority, but they're where the real politics happen—states negotiate within their Circle before bringing proposals to the Diet.

**The Lakeshore Circle** — States bordering Lake Tonactlet Chipe
- Members: Mpaso, Chilala, Misanda Mulu, Samani
- Character: Wealthy from fishing and lake trade, dominated by the Mpaso-Chilala rivalry
- Current state: Paralyzed by succession maneuvering; Chilala wants the Paramount seat

**The Highland Circle** — States in the Dalizi Highlands northeast of the lake
- Members: Lanwadanzi, Daltimo, parts of Samani
- Character: Traders and scholars, prefer diplomacy to war, wealthy from eastern routes
- Current state: Nervous about the succession; Lanwadanzi backs stability candidate

**The Forest Circle** — States in or near the great eastern forests
- Members: Magayi, Kerikos, Wetu, Maruro, Kibuhanda
- Character: Frontier states, independent-minded, suspicious of central authority
- Current state: Mostly ignoring the succession fight; focused on local concerns

**The Border Circle** — States along the northern frontier with Central Aboyinzu
- Members: Nikpato, Turbuni, Daboni, Jowdo, Buti, Wodhuubo
- Character: Buffer states, frequently invaded, desperate for Confederate protection
- Current state: Terrified; the next Paramount's attitude toward northern defense matters enormously

**The South Wall Circle** — States near the Dragon's Spine mountains
- Members: Shemu, Taulo Magi, Kafula, Shunde
- Character: Martial cultures shaped by mountain threats, suspicious of lake-state softness
- Current state: Shunde is positioning its candidate for Paramount; Kafula holds a grudge

### The Succession Crisis

Paramount Makisani III is dying. She has perhaps two years, perhaps less. Her designated heir—her nephew Tobwani—is widely considered unfit: young, inexperienced, and visibly uncomfortable with politics. The Electors have begun positioning for what comes after.

**The Three Candidates**

**Shundari of Shunde** — The Martial Option
- Background: General who unified the South Wall Circle against mountain raiders
- Platform: Confederate Army reform, stronger central authority, northern expansion
- Support: Shunde (Elector), South Wall Circle, states that want a strong Paramount
- Opposition: States that fear strong Paramounts, specifically Chilala
- Weakness: Seen as a warmonger; many fear he'd use Confederate armies against internal enemies

**Mwenekazi of Chilala** — The Expansionist Option
- Background: Regent-Queen of the largest Elector state, brilliant politician
- Platform: Chilala dominance framed as Confederate unity; absorb smaller states
- Support: Chilala (Elector), allied city-states, states that have already submitted to Chilala influence
- Opposition: Everyone who isn't already aligned with Chilala
- Weakness: Too openly ambitious; other Electors don't want to create a monster

**Tumaini of Lanwadanzi** — The Stability Option
- Background: Wealthy merchant-prince, reputation for fairness and bribery in equal measure
- Platform: Status quo, trade agreements, avoid wars, let the Diet actually function
- Support: Lanwadanzi (Elector), Highland Circle, Forest Circle, states tired of conflict
- Opposition: States that want change, specifically Shunde and Chilala
- Weakness: Seen as weak; wouldn't defend the Border Circle if tested

**The Path to Victory**

To become Paramount, a candidate needs four of seven Elector votes. Currently:
- Shunde votes Shundari (1)
- Chilala votes Mwenekazi (1)
- Lanwadanzi votes Tumaini (1)
- Mpaso votes for Makisani's heir Tobwani, but he can't win (1)
- Samani is "neutral" (selling their vote)
- Nikpato is "neutral" (terrified of backing the loser)
- Kafula votes based on ancient genealogical grudges (currently favors Mwenekazi, but this could change)

The crisis will break when Makisani dies. If no candidate has four votes by then, the Confederation enters an interregnum—no Paramount, no Confederate Army, every state for itself. The last interregnum (2891 SD) lasted seven years and killed 40,000 people.

### Culture

**The Languages**

The Confederation has no single language. Dalizi Common (a trade pidgin) serves for commerce and Diet proceedings, but each state maintains its own tongue. Scholars count at least fifteen distinct languages within Confederate borders, plus dozens of local dialects.

This linguistic fragmentation reflects deeper cultural divisions. Lakeshore states share fishing traditions and water-worship. Highland states venerate ancestors and scholarly achievement. South Wall states prize martial honor. Forest states maintain animist practices their neighbors consider primitive.

**The Faiths**

Three major religious traditions compete within the Confederation:

**The Ancestors' Way** — Dominant in the highlands and most city-states. Believers venerate their direct ancestors, maintaining family shrines and seeking guidance through ritual communion. Politically organized through the Temple of Names in Metato, which maintains genealogical records and certifies legitimate descent—crucial for inheritance disputes.

**The Lake's Children** — Dominant around Lake Tonactlet Chipe. Believers worship the lake itself as a living deity, offering sacrifices for good fishing and safe passage. Priests claim to interpret the lake's will through dreams and signs. Politically powerful in Mpaso, Chilala, and Misanda Mulu.

**The Old Forest** — Dominant in the eastern Forest Circle. Animist tradition honoring spirits of individual trees, animals, and places. Decentralized, with no formal priesthood—each village maintains its own spirit relationships. Considered backward by other traditions but fiercely defended by its practitioners.

These faiths don't actively war, but they create cultural boundaries. A highland merchant conducting business in Chilala must perform lakeside offerings or risk being seen as impious. A forest-born soldier serving in Shunde must hide their animist prayers or face mockery.

**Marriage and Alliance**

Noble marriages are political instruments, carefully negotiated to create or cement alliances. The Confederation's aristocracy is so intermarried that succession disputes routinely involve claims from three or four different states.

This creates opportunities for intrigue. A disputed inheritance might be decided by which claimant has stronger allies—or by assassination, forged documents, or convenient "discoveries" of illegitimacy. The Temple of Names profits handsomely from both certifying and challenging bloodlines.

**Mercenary Culture**

The Confederation's constant internal conflicts have produced a thriving mercenary industry. Companies range from small bands of veteran soldiers to small armies with siege equipment and mages.

Notable companies include:
- **The Lake's Teeth** — Elite heavy infantry, loyal to whoever pays best
- **The Corpse Collectors** — Specialists in dirty work: assassinations, kidnappings, evidence destruction
- **The Painted Shields** — Cavalry company with a reputation for honoring contracts exactly as written (and exploiting any ambiguity)
- **The Smoke Walkers** — Infiltrators and saboteurs, rumored to employ dark magic

Hiring mercenaries is expensive but often cheaper than maintaining standing armies. Most city-states rely on mercenary contracts for defense, which means their security depends on their treasury.

### Economy

**The Lake Trade**

Lake Tonactlet Chipe is the Confederation's economic heart. Fish, freshwater pearls, and lake-bottom minerals flow out; grain, metal goods, and foreign luxuries flow in. Control of lakeside ports means control of revenue.

Mpaso and Chilala fight constantly over lake trade. Mpaso controls the best natural harbors; Chilala controls the largest population of fishers. Neither can dominate without the other, which produces endless tariff disputes, fishing-rights conflicts, and occasional naval skirmishes.

**The Eastern Trade**

The Highland Circle controls trade routes to the Elder Wilds and beyond. Exotic goods—rare woods, magical components, foreign spices—flow through Lanwadanzi's markets. This makes Lanwadanzi wealthy and politically cautious; war disrupts trade.

**The Northern Corridor**

Trade with Central Aboyinzu and the Deadloop inner sea passes through the Border Circle. Turbuni and Nikpato both claim to be the "Gateway to the North," competing for merchant traffic. Their rivalry occasionally benefits merchants (competitive tolls) and occasionally destroys them (trade wars).

**The Currency Chaos**

The Confederation has no single currency. Each member state mints its own coins, with wildly varying weights and metal content. Money-changers profit from the confusion; merchants lose sleep over it. Periodic attempts to establish a Confederate currency have failed—no state trusts the others to mint honestly.

### Military

**No Confederate Army (Usually)**

The Confederation maintains no standing military force. When the Diet authorizes a Confederate Army—usually in response to external invasion—each member state contributes troops proportional to its population. A Confederate General is appointed (usually after weeks of political fighting) to command the combined force.

This system is slow, fractious, and surprisingly effective when it finally mobilizes. Confederate Armies have defeated external threats multiple times. They've also dissolved into internal fighting when the external threat recedes.

**Member State Forces**

Each state maintains its own military:
- **Shunde** has the most professional army—15,000 disciplined infantry
- **Chilala** has the largest population and can field 25,000 militia
- **Lanwadanzi** relies on mercenaries and a small elite guard
- **Most city-states** maintain walls, a city watch, and mercenary contracts

**The Fortress Network**

Centuries of internal war have produced a landscape dotted with fortifications. Every state has castles, every city has walls, every major road has toll-fortresses. Sieges are common; decisive battles are rare. Wars tend to be slow, expensive, and inconclusive.

### History

**The Founding Wars** (800-900 SD)

The Dalizi Confederation emerged from a century of warfare among the lake-region states. Facing invasion from the giants of the southern mountains, the warring states formed a defensive alliance. The alliance held, the giants were driven back, and the temporary coalition became permanent.

The founding treaty established the Diet, the Paramount, and the Elector system. It also established the principle that member states would handle internal affairs independently—a principle that has produced centuries of "internal affairs" that look a lot like wars.

**The Golden Age** (900-1500 SD)

Six centuries of relative stability and growth. The Confederation expanded to its current borders, absorbing smaller states through conquest, marriage, or voluntary accession. Trade flourished. The Paramount institution gained prestige. Several strong Paramounts managed to impose temporary order.

**The War of Broken Oaths** (2891 SD)

The worst internal conflict in Confederate history. A disputed succession produced two rival Paramounts, each claiming legitimacy. The Confederation split roughly in half, with Dhabisa leading one faction and Mpaso the other. Seven years of war killed 40,000 people and devastated the Border Circle.

The war ended when both claimants died in the same battle (possibly arranged by exhausted neutrals). Dhabisa lost its Elector status as punishment for starting the conflict. The current constitutional order emerged from the post-war settlement.

**The Long Peace** (2891-3340 SD)

Fifty years of genuine peace, enforced by exhaustion and the memory of the war. States focused on rebuilding. Trade recovered. A series of competent Paramounts maintained stability.

**The Slow Unraveling** (3340 SD - present)

The last forty years have seen increasing instability. Border conflicts. Succession disputes. Trade wars. The current Paramount, Makisani III, has held things together through personal relationships, but she's dying. Her potential successors lack her skills.

The Confederation isn't collapsing—not yet. But the institutions that held it together are fraying. The next succession will test whether anything remains.

### Current Tensions

**The Chilala Problem**

Chilala is too big. Its population exceeds the next three states combined. Its economy dominates the Lakeshore Circle. Its ruler, Regent-Queen Mwenekazi, is openly positioning for the Paramount seat—and if she gets it, she'll have the power to make the position meaningful.

Other states are terrified. A strong Paramount backed by Chilala's resources could transform the Confederation from a loose alliance into a centralized state—with Chilala at its center. The other Electors are looking for anyone who can stop her.

**The Northern Vulnerability**

The Border Circle states are exposed and underfunded. They depend on Confederate protection that arrives slowly if at all. Nikpato has been invaded three times in the last century; twice, help came too late.

The next Paramount's attitude toward northern defense will determine whether these states remain loyal. If they decide the Confederation can't protect them, they might seek arrangements elsewhere—with Chechol, with Terrenia, with anyone who offers security.

No one in the Confederation knows about the Red Army building in Chechol. When that threat emerges, the Border Circle will be the first to burn.

**The Religious Tensions**

The three major faiths have coexisted uneasily for centuries. Recently, tensions have increased:
- The Temple of Names (Ancestors' Way) has begun challenging inheritance claims from Lake's Children families, citing "improper documentation"
- Lake's Children priests have declared certain highland practices "offensive to the lake"
- Forest Circle states have expelled Temple of Names missionaries, claiming cultural imperialism

None of this has turned violent yet. But in a succession crisis, religious divisions could provide another fault line.

**The Mercenary Dependency**

Too many states rely on mercenaries instead of maintaining their own forces. This works until it doesn't. If a mercenary company decides to switch sides mid-conflict, or if multiple states bid for the same company, or if companies decide to take a city for themselves instead of their employers...

The Painted Shields attempted exactly this in 3365 SD, seizing the city-state of Kerikos and holding it for ransom. A Confederate Army eventually dislodged them, but the precedent was set. Mercenaries are soldiers without loyalty. The Confederation is full of them.

### Notable Member States

**Chilala** (Elector) — The largest state, controlling the eastern lake shore. Regent-Queen Mwenekazi rules during her son's minority, and shows no intention of surrendering power when he comes of age. Capital: Kisro.

**Mpaso** (Elector) — The current Paramount's home state, controlling the northern lake shore. Wealthy, prestigious, and facing a leadership vacuum when Makisani dies. Capital: Misiwada.

**Lanwadanzi** (Elector) — The merchant state, controlling eastern trade routes. Prefers stability, willing to pay for it. Capital: Lanwadar.

**Samani** (Elector) — Hosts the Diet in Metato, considers itself the Confederation's neutral heart. In practice, sells its vote to the highest bidder. Capital: Metato.

**Shunde** (Elector) — The martial state, with the Confederation's best professional army. General Shundari has made himself the obvious strongman candidate. Capital: Bisaro.

**Nikpato** (Elector) — The nervous state, repeatedly invaded, desperate for protection. Will vote for whoever promises to defend them. Capital: Kampaga.

**Kafula** (Elector) — The ancient state, obsessed with genealogy and bloodlines. Votes based on grudges centuries old. Capital: Kyobale.

**Turbuni** — Border city-state, shares the School of Summoning with Chechol. Doesn't realize the threat next door. Capital: Turbuni.

**Dhabisa** — Former Elector, still bitter about the War of Broken Oaths. Would do almost anything to regain its seat. Capital: Sumda.

### Player Hooks

**The Succession**

- A candidate hires the party to secure an Elector's vote—through persuasion, bribery, blackmail, or removal of obstacles
- The Temple of Names has discovered a genealogical secret that could disqualify a candidate; multiple parties want to control or destroy the evidence
- An Elector dies unexpectedly; the party witnesses the death and knows it was murder, but proving it means navigating Confederate politics

**The Mercenary Life**

- A mercenary company offers the party membership—good pay, interesting work, and a front-row seat to Confederate conflicts
- Two states have hired the same company for opposing operations; the party must choose sides or find a third option
- The Painted Shields are planning another city seizure; the party has advance warning and must decide what to do with it

**The Border Crisis**

- Nikpato's ruler hires the party to investigate strange reports from Chechol—unusually militant Rentar, communities going silent, travelers who don't return
- A Rentar elder has fled south, seeking help; she has fragments of truth about Gynor's corruption but no one believes her
- The Red Army activates; the party is in Turbuni when the attack begins

**The Religious Conflict**

- The Temple of Names wants investigators to examine a noble family's genealogical claims—claims that would shift an Elector vote
- A Lake's Children priest has gone missing in the highlands; is this murder, kidnapping, or voluntary disappearance?
- Forest Circle states are forming their own alliance, potentially seceding from the Confederation; the party must assess whether this is serious

### Relations with Neighbors

**Chechol** — Seen as a quiet, pious backwater. Turbuni has the closest ties, sharing the School of Summoning. The Confederation doesn't watch Chechol closely, which will prove to be a catastrophic mistake.

**Terrenia** — Trade partners and occasional rivals. The Terrenia states are wealthier and more stable; the Confederation resents this. No serious conflicts currently.

**Elder Wilds** — Source of exotic trade goods and occasional monsters. The Forest Circle handles relations, mostly through Lanwadanzi's merchants.

**Dragon's Spine Mountains** — Source of threats: giants, monsters, and worse. The South Wall Circle exists to hold this frontier.
