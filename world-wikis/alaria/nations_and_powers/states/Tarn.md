## Tarn

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

A nation of orcs who are very difficult to kill—not because of armor or numbers, but because their souls refuse to leave their bodies. The Tarni control the most valuable stretch of the Grand Tolkarsus river and fight their wars with weapons that cut spirit as easily as flesh.

### Overview

The Tarni are called the Darkeyes for their solid black eyes that seem to look through flesh to the soul beneath. They've developed a unique understanding of the boundary between spirit and body, learning to anchor their own souls so firmly that death struggles to claim them. Their warriors fight on after wounds that would kill other orcs, and their spirit weapons bypass armor entirely to attack the essence within.

Tarn's territory is strategic—they control the middle reaches of the Grand Tolkarsus where the river passes through the Plenjorn Swamp, meaning they share claim to the healing waters with Glivornax. This makes them wealthy, dangerous, and perpetually at odds with their neighbors.

### Government

**Type:** Spirit Council

The Tarni are ruled by a council of elder spirit-seers—those who have learned to see beyond flesh and commune with the ancestors who linger. Political power comes from spiritual authority; military command follows spiritual rank.

**The Spirit Council:**
- **First-Seer Vurkoth** — Eldest of the council, over eighty years old. She speaks with ancestors three generations dead and has "died" twice herself, only to return.
- **War-Seer Gothnak** — Commands the warriors. His spirit-sight allows him to target enemy souls directly; he teaches the war-priests their craft.
- **River-Seer Thulmis** — Oversees the Tolkarsus trade and the healing waters. The most diplomatic of the council; handles negotiations with outsiders.
- **Shadow-Seer Yulthrek** — Youngest member. Responsible for intelligence and the spirit-scouts who observe enemy movements in ways conventional scouts cannot.

Decisions are made through ritual consensus. The council enters a trance state together, communing with ancestral spirits, and emerges with unified purpose. Outsiders find this process unnerving—the council members' eyes roll back, they speak in voices not their own, and sometimes the ancestors disagree.

### Culture

**The Tarni** have dark eyes with no visible whites—solid black orbs that seem to absorb light. Their skin ranges from deep gray to charcoal, and many bear pale ritual scars that mark their spiritual accomplishments. They're not physically larger than other orcs, but they carry themselves with unsettling certainty.

**Core Values:**
- **The Soul Is the Self** — The body is temporary; the soul is eternal. Physical scars mean nothing; spiritual wounds are everything.
- **Death Is a Door, Not a Wall** — The ancestors watch, guide, and sometimes return. Death is transition, not ending.
- **The River Carries All** — The Tolkarsus connects the living world to the spirit realm. Those who control the river control the boundary.
- **Strike the Essence** — Physical victory without spiritual victory is incomplete. True warriors kill souls, not just bodies.

**Society:** Tarni society revolves around spiritual rank. At the bottom are those who have never touched the spirit world—children and outsiders. Above them are those who have glimpsed beyond the veil. Higher still are the spirit-touched who can see and speak with the dead. At the top are the spirit-seers who walk between worlds.

Every Tarni undergoes a spirit-trial at age fifteen—a ritual ordeal that pushes them to the edge of death. Those who return with spirit-sight advance; those who return without it remain common warriors; those who don't return... sometimes come back later, changed.

### Economy

**Size:** Medium
**Tech:** Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports:**
- River passage (tolls for trade along the Tolkarsus)
- Healing water (controlled access to Plenjorn Swamp, in competition with Glivornax)
- Spirit-blessed items (weapons and talismans touched by ancestral power)
- Information (the spirit-scouts see things others cannot)

**Primary Imports:**
- Metal (the Tarni are not smiths)
- Food (the swamps don't farm well)
- Luxury goods (the spirit-seers have expensive tastes)

Tarn's position on the river makes them natural middlemen. Trade flows through their territory, and they extract tolls from everyone. The healing waters provide additional leverage—Tarn and Glivornax both control access, creating an awkward shared monopoly.

### Military

**Size:** Small
**Quality:** Extremely High
**Enrollment:** Volunteer (only the spirit-touched serve)

The Tarni don't field large armies. They don't need to. Their warriors are individually devastating—nearly impossible to kill and wielding weapons that ignore physical defenses.

**Spirit Warriors:** The core of Tarni military power. These orcs have trained their souls to cling to their bodies beyond normal limits. Where other warriors die, they keep fighting. Where other warriors heal slowly, they recover quickly because their spirit refuses to release the body. Each spirit warrior carries weapons blessed to cut essence as well as flesh.

**Spirit-Scouts:** The Tarni intelligence apparatus. These orcs can project their awareness beyond their bodies, observing distant locations, passing through walls, seeing in darkness. They're invaluable for reconnaissance and nearly impossible to detect.

**War-Priests:** Battlefield commanders who can see the spiritual state of everyone present. They direct spirit warriors to focus on enemies whose souls are wavering, target leaders whose death would shatter morale, and shore up their own warriors' flagging spirits.

**Weaknesses:**
- Small numbers. A Tarni warrior is worth ten ordinary soldiers, but they can still be overwhelmed.
- The spirit weapons don't work on the soulless—constructs, certain undead, creatures that have traded their spirits away.
- The Glivornaxi have learned that targeting spirit warriors with multiple attackers forces them to choose which soul to defend.
- Physical exhaustion still matters. The soul may be willing, but the flesh has limits.

### Geography

**Location:** North-central Wildwood, along the middle Grand Tolkarsus

**Biomes:** River valley, flood plains, edges of Plenjorn Swamp

**Key Locations:**
- **Tarns-Hollow** — The capital, built where the Tolkarsus widens into a series of lakes. The water is sacred here; the boundary between worlds is thin.
- **The Spirit Gates** — Stone pillars along the river where the ancestors are said to enter the mortal world. Major ritual sites.
- **The Contested Shore** — The stretch of Plenjorn Swamp that Tarn and Glivornax both claim. Fighting happens here regularly.

**Borders:**
- North: Grieb (the lakemen; minimal contact)
- Northwest: Uhionai (the tree-orcs; occasional border friction)
- West: Glivornax (hostile; the Water War)
- South: Hedroscobb (neutral; little interest in each other)
- East: Shazuihn (hostile; they raid everyone)

### Relations

**Glivornax:** The Water War. Both states claim Plenjorn Swamp and its healing waters. The Tarni spirit weapons can damage Glivornaxi souls directly—but the Glivornaxi can heal from physical wounds in the swamp. It's a brutal stalemate. Neither side can afford to lose.

**Shazuihn:** The boar riders raid Tarni territory too, though less successfully. Spirit warriors are hard to kill quickly, and the Shazuihni prefer quick raids. Still, they come.

**Uhionai:** Occasional friction over the border where Ryunimir Forest meets Tarni river territory. The tree-orcs are defensive; the Tarni don't particularly want their land. Skirmishes happen when young warriors need to prove themselves.

**Hedroscobb:** Minimal contact. The Tarni have nothing the Hedroscobbi want, and vice versa.

**Grieb:** Respectful distance. The Tarni spirit-seers can sense something old and powerful in the northern lakes. They don't fear the Griebi exactly—but they understand that some neighbors are better left alone.

**Vogenfeld:** No direct contact. The dwarves are too far south.

**The Orc Moot:** The Tarni attend and participate more than most. Their spirit-seers provide neutral ground for negotiations—they can tell when someone is lying.

### Conflicts

**The Water War:** The central conflict. Plenjorn Swamp's healing waters are priceless, and both Tarn and Glivornax claim them. The Tarni have the advantage in direct combat—spirit weapons are devastating—but the Glivornaxi have home-field advantage in the swamps. Neither side can win decisively.

**The Inheritance Question:** First-Seer Vurkoth is old, and the question of succession looms. Shadow-Seer Yulthrek is ambitious; War-Seer Gothnak is conservative. If the council fragments, Tarn's enemies will notice.

**The Fading:** Some spirit-seers whisper that the boundary between worlds is weakening. More spirits linger than before. More Tarni return from death. This sounds like good news until you ask: where are all these spirits coming from? What is pushing them into the mortal world?

### History

The Tarni discovered their spiritual gifts generations ago when a great shaman named Tarn (for whom the state is named) nearly died in battle and found his soul caught between worlds. Instead of passing on, he learned to cling to his body—and to see others' souls as they truly were.

Tarn taught his techniques to his children, and they taught theirs. Within generations, the Tarni had developed spirit-sight as a cultural inheritance. They claimed the river because Tarn had died beside it; they believe the Tolkarsus carries souls downstream to whatever comes after.

The Water War with Glivornax began when both states realized the healing waters existed. It has continued, on and off, for over sixty years.

### Player Hooks

- Seek a spirit-seer's help to contact a dead loved one
- Negotiate the Water War between Tarn and Glivornax
- Undergo the spirit-trial and gain Tarni abilities (or die trying)
- Investigate the Fading—why are so many spirits lingering?
- Steal a spirit-weapon (incredibly difficult; they're spiritually bound to their wielders)
- Use Tarn's position as neutral ground to negotiate between other orc states
