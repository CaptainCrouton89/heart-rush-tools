Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal, House of Nobles and House of Commerce

**Primary Inhabitants**: Belenstrope (Halflings)

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Wealth, prestige, intelligence, vision, entrepreneurship

- Erasnus is jointly ruled by two parliamentary houses—the House of Nobles and the House of Commerce. These consist of the highest-ranking members of society within the two most important areas of Erasnun life.
- Nearly every village, town, and city is home to multiple nobility, as well as their extended family. Practically everyone has at least a cousin who's distantly related to some noble family.
- Belenstrope halflings have transformed commerce into high art. They trade in influence, information, and favors with complexity that makes seasoned diplomats dizzy. Every Belenstrope maintains a mental ledger of social debts tracked across generations.

### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Textiles, trade services, financial instruments

**Primary Imports**: Everything

- Members of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance—and its most profitable member. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold the alliance together as it fractures.
- Home to the best overland merchants in Alaria. Their ability to haggle is unparalleled, their eye for a good deal uncanny.
- Lending, business, entrepreneurship, and traveling merchant are all extremely common professions.
- Super close trading partners with Watar, and strong relationships with all Aldriktch members.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Military enrollment is mandatory, but there are a thousand ways to wiggle out of it—meaning it consists primarily of the poor and less influential.
- Working in the military is seen as a job for idiots who can't turn a profit on their own.
- The population is largely non-violent. If threatened with a sharp stick, most Erasnuns would throw up their hands and hand over their money. Much easier to make money trading than risk getting hurt.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Middle Sea region, bordered by Camaran (east), Ubrik (southeast), Myorna (northeast), Hephake mountains (north), Anarak (west, barely), and the Crags of Geth (west)

**Biomes**: Rolling farmland, river valleys, temperate forests, trade roads everywhere

**Climate**: Temperate—good growing weather, mild seasons

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Erdene

**Cities**: Erdene, Minoz, Adnar, Traduci, Simonsor

**Towns**: Countless market towns and trading posts along the major routes

### Primary Conflicts

**The Alliance Collapse**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Camaran is isolating, Ubrik is collapsing under the silvertongue outbreak, Watar and Bestacia are fighting over the strait. Erasnus profits most from the alliance and is desperately trying to hold it together through diplomacy, trade incentives, and sheer nervous energy.

**The Myorna Problem**

Myorna, to the northeast, is a backstabbing mess of elven politics. They were barely let into the Trade Alliance—pushed through by Bestacian diplomats hoping it would deter war. Now Myorna's internal chaos is spilling outward, and Erasnus is caught dealing with unreliable partners and shifting alliances.

**The Novglim Displacement**

In the Novglim Forest (northeast, just south of Myorna), native gnome tribes have been displaced by expanding settlements and logging operations. The situation is uncomfortable—Erasnus benefits from the resources but knows the displacement is wrong. Mostly they try not to think about it.

**The Goblin Posturing**

West of Erasnus, across the Crags of Geth, lies Griselia—a collection of goblin city-states. The goblins are perpetually posturing, threatening invasion, and making dramatic proclamations. They will absolutely never actually invade. Everyone knows this. Trade continues regardless, punctuated by theatrical diplomatic incidents that both sides secretly enjoy.

**Military Resentment**

The military is disrespected, underfunded, and staffed by those who couldn't escape service. But military leadership does control real power, and some officers are tired of being scorned by nobles and merchants who've never held a sword. If things get bad enough, a military coup isn't impossible.

### History

Erasnus grew wealthy by being in the middle of everything. While other nations fought wars, the Belenstrope traded with all sides. While empires rose and fell, Erasnun merchants maintained their routes.

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance was largely Erasnun diplomacy—convincing rival states that open trade benefited everyone (especially Erasnus). For decades, it worked beautifully. The alliance made everyone richer and wars less likely.

Now the alliance is crumbling. Erasnus has no army worth mentioning, no walls that could stop a real invasion, and no plan for a world where trade doesn't solve every problem. The merchants are getting nervous.
