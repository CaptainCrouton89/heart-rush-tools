## Watar

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchy (trading families)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Dwarblin

**Population**: 40,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Commerce, innovation, self-reliance, ambition

- Watar is ruled by an oligarchy of powerful trading families. Three families dominate: the Soleri (capital), the Gravo, and the Madero. Each controls significant territory and competes fiercely for market share.
- Dwarblin culture is defined by rejection. Hated by both dwarves and goblins, they built their own nation from nothing. This shared experience of being outcasts has forged a scrappy, entrepreneurial people.
- Very forward-thinking, almost tech-bro energy. They're always looking for the next opportunity, the next innovation, the next market to corner. Some smugness has crept in as they've succeeded, but the scrappy underdog mentality remains.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Trade goods (everything—they're middlemen), practical craftsmanship, ships

**Primary Imports**: Raw materials, luxury goods, anything they can flip for profit

- Members of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though they're increasingly aggressive about controlling trade routes.
- Dwarblin are master traders, bridging markets that would never otherwise interact. A Dwarblin merchant can sell sand to desert dwellers.
- Their craftsmanship is practical rather than beautiful. Dwarblin-made tools aren't pretty, but they never break.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (mercenary-supplemented)

- Watar has a real navy—merchant vessels that double as warships, plus dedicated military ships protecting trade routes.
- Ground forces are adequate. They hire mercenaries when needed; why waste Dwarblin on fighting when you can pay someone else?
- The military exists to protect trade. Period.

### Geography

**Location**: Peninsula in the western Middle Sea, northwest of the Telphineas Strait, south of Erasnus, with Echea at the peninsula's tip

**Biomes**: Grassland, temperate forest, coastal regions, mountains to the west

**Climate**: Mediterranean—mild winters, warm summers, good sailing weather

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Solera

**Cities**: Solera, Gravo, Madero

**Towns**: Various port towns and trading posts along the coast

### Primary Conflicts

**The Telphineas Strait**

Watar wants control of the strait. It's the key to dominating Middle Sea trade—whoever controls passage can set tariffs and squeeze competitors. Bestacia also wants it, but they're on the wrong side of the mountains with no navy.

Watar has the ships and the willingness to use them. Tensions are escalating. The Trade Alliance technically prohibits members from blocking each other's shipping, but Watar is looking for loopholes or reasons to renegotiate.

**Family Politics**

The three great families—Soleri, Gravo, and Madero—cooperate when facing external threats but compete ruthlessly otherwise. Corporate espionage, market manipulation, and occasional "accidents" are all part of doing business. The oligarchy is stable because no single family can dominate the others, but the balance could shift.

**Alliance Strain**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Watar joined for the trade benefits but increasingly sees the alliance as a constraint on their ambitions. If they could control the strait independently, why share?

### History

The Dwarblin came to this peninsula as refugees—rejected by dwarf and goblin societies alike, with nowhere else to go. They found an empty stretch of coast and started trading.

Within a few generations, they'd built a merchant empire. What they lacked in magical aptitude or social acceptance, they made up for in relentless work ethic and shrewd dealing. The trading families emerged from the most successful early merchants, consolidating power through wealth rather than warfare.

Now Watar is an up-and-coming power. They've got ships, money, and ambition. The older powers of the Middle Sea are starting to notice—some with interest, others with concern.


Also just to clarify, the atlas files should focus more on high level stuff, interactions between regions, and geography, whereas the state files should be more about the actual inner workings of that state. There's lots of overlap, but the juicy specifics belong in the state file
