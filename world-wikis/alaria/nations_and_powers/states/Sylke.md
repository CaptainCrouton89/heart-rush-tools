## Sylke

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Oznak, Tikhaya

**Population**: 300,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Duty, privacy, minding one's own business, nihilism

- Ruled by Queen Alisandra the Merciful—a title dripping with irony. She's calculating, cruel, and has no qualms about massive human sacrifice to power Deoric magic for the throne.
- The population has learned not to ask questions. Eyes and ears are everywhere. Neighbors inform on neighbors. The queen knows everything, and then some.
- Sylke functions with brutal efficiency. Taxes are collected, roads are maintained, criminals are punished. The cost is freedom, privacy, and anyone who draws the queen's attention.
- Recently conquered Tornia in a swift, "fairly bloodless" war. Now Alisandra rules two of Ofrenia's three kingdoms—with Joswik clearly next on her list.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Lumber, manufactured goods, ships

**Primary Imports**: Grain, minerals, slaves (through intermediaries)

- Sylke's forests are legendary—dense, well-managed, and producing timber that builds ships across the Middle Sea.
- The economy runs on Deoric magic, which runs on human sacrifice. The Ivory Hand ensures a steady supply of victims, disguised as criminals, prisoners, and the inconvenient.
- With Tornia now under her control, Alisandra has access to Gem Crest Bay's trade routes and Besnoumeru's financial networks. She's moving quickly to integrate these assets.
- Myastor serves as Sylke's shipping hub and dumping ground for those who displease the crown but don't quite merit execution.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Every citizen serves. No exceptions, no bribes, no escape. The military reflects Sylke's values: dutiful, efficient, and unquestioning.
- The army that conquered Tornia was well-drilled and well-supplied. It faced minimal resistance and secured the kingdom in weeks.
- Now that same army occupies hostile territory, stretched thin across two kingdoms while watching Joswik's border.
- The navy is growing rapidly, incorporating captured Tornian vessels. Alisandra understands that controlling Ofrenia means controlling the surrounding waters.

### Geography

**Biomes**: Dense forests, river valleys, coastal lowlands, hilly interior

**Towns**: Shimmercreek Falls, Seavault, Cat Fell, Fool's Keep, Exralhorn, Mapleburg, Bridgeton

**Villages**: Numerous logging and fishing villages throughout

### Primary Conflicts

**Occupying Tornia**

Conquest was the easy part. Alisandra's armies hold Tornia's cities and patrol its roads, but the countryside burns with resistance. The rebels she once cultivated have turned against her. Every week brings ambushes, assassinations, and supply disruptions. The occupation is bleeding resources faster than expected.

**The Joswik Question**

One kingdom remains. Prince Edric of Joswik watches his sister's expansion with growing terror. He lacks the military strength to resist and the political cunning to negotiate. Alisandra could crush Joswik tomorrow—but she's learning from Tornia that rapid conquest creates lasting problems. Some advisors urge patience; others want to finish reunification while momentum holds.

**The Ivory Hand**

Alisandra is a member of the Ivory Hand, a secretive organization that maintains global slave trafficking networks to fuel Deoric magic. Her throne runs on human sacrifice. If this became public knowledge, even Sylke's cowed population might rebel. The Hand protects its own, but Alisandra's rapid expansion has drawn attention she'd prefer to avoid.

**Internal Surveillance**

The network of informants that keeps Sylke stable is expensive, paranoid, and occasionally wrong. Innocent people disappear. Useful people are denounced by rivals. The system works, but it breeds a sullen, fearful population that follows orders without initiative or loyalty. In a crisis, would they fight for their queen—or simply stop pretending to?

### History

Sylke was always the poorest of Ofrenia's three kingdoms. When the old king divided his realm, Alisandra received the western forests—valuable for lumber, but lacking Tornia's rich farmland or Joswik's mineral wealth. She was the middle child, overlooked and underestimated.

She made that everyone else's problem.

Within a year of her father's death, Alisandra had consolidated absolute power in Sylke. The nobility who opposed her vanished. The merchants who questioned her policies found their businesses destroyed. The common folk learned to keep their heads down and their mouths shut.

She discovered Deoric magic through the Ivory Hand—power fueled by suffering. The organization welcomed a queen willing to provide both victims and protection. In exchange, Alisandra gained access to magic that no legitimate ruler would touch.

For years she watched her brothers squander their inheritances. Aldric drowned Tornia in decadence. Edric let Joswik stagnate. Alisandra built her military, cultivated agents in both kingdoms, and waited.

When she finally moved against Tornia, the war lasted weeks. Now she rules two-thirds of Ofrenia, with the third clearly in her sights. The girl her father overlooked is becoming the queen who reunites the island—not through diplomacy or marriage, but through conquest, surveillance, and blood magic.
