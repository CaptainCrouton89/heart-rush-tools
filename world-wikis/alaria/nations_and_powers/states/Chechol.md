## Chechol

Tags: state

A landlocked state in Central Aboyinzu, wedged between the Deadloop inner sea to the north and the Dalizi Confederation to the south. Chechol is defined by its three river valleys, its significant Rentar minotaur population, and two sites of immense spiritual power: the Pyramid of Five Sides and the School of Summoning.

From a distance, Chechol appears unremarkable—a modest agricultural state, quieter than its neighbors, known for exporting grain and pious mercenaries. Visitors who stay longer notice something harder to name. The Rentar here move with unusual certainty. Decisions are made quickly, without debate, as if everyone already knows the answer. The human population has grown quieter over the past generation, deferential in ways that feel learned rather than natural.

Something is deeply wrong in Chechol. Most of its residents don't know it yet.

### Government

**The River Duchy**

Chechol is officially ruled by **Duke Yelen Vorotny** from the capital of Sevich, the fourth duke of the Vorotny line. The duchy predates the Rentar arrival by centuries, and the ducal institution remains formally supreme—the Duke commands the army, levies taxes, and represents Chechol to foreign powers.

In practice, Duke Yelen makes no significant decision without consulting the **Council of Elders**, a body of senior Rentar spiritual leaders. This has been true for three generations. The Vorotny dukes consider it wisdom—why wouldn't you seek divine guidance when it's available? The Rentar consider it proper—they are vessels of celestial truth, and secular rulers should acknowledge that.

The problem is that the Council's guidance has been subtly corrupted for decades. The Elders don't know this. Duke Yelen doesn't know this. The decisions they make feel right, feel divinely inspired, but they've been steering Chechol toward an end none of them would choose.

**The Three River Councils**

Below the duchy, each river valley maintains its own local council:
- **Chechik Council** (Sevich, Astopol, Pyadrov) — the political heart
- **Stulov Council** (Stulovka, Yeletity) — agricultural backbone
- **Riki Council** (Prozny and surrounding settlements) — closest to the School of Summoning

These councils handle local governance and traditionally sent representatives to the Duke. Now they increasingly defer to whichever Rentar monastery is nearest.

### Culture

**Two Peoples, One Faith (They Think)**

Chechol's population is roughly 60% human, 40% Rentar minotaur, but cultural influence doesn't track with numbers. Humans farm the river valleys and staff the towns. Rentar occupy the highlands between rivers, maintaining monasteries and temples. Over generations, the relationship has shifted from coexistence to hierarchy—humans defer to Rentar on matters of spirit, morality, and increasingly, politics.

This isn't resented, exactly. Most humans in Chechol grew up with Rentar neighbors and genuinely believe in their spiritual insight. The Rentar aren't cruel or exploitative. They simply... know things. They receive guidance. They share that guidance generously.

What the humans have begun to notice—without quite articulating it—is that the Rentar have changed. Their grandparents' generation was contemplative, patient, fond of long debates about theological nuance. Today's Rentar are certain. They know the right answer immediately. Disagreement makes them uncomfortable. Questions make them defensive.

The Rentar notice nothing wrong. This is simply what faith feels like when it matures.

**The Pyramid and the School: Two Paths**

Chechol hosts two centers of spiritual power, and understanding their distinction is essential to understanding the coming catastrophe.

The **Pyramid of Five Sides** is ancient, predating human settlement. It's a genuine gateway to Celestia—a four-sided pyramid whose fifth face exists only on the celestial plane. Those who meditate within its shadow can receive true divine inspiration. The Rentar who tend the Pyramid are the purest practitioners of their faith, and they are—so far—uncorrupted.

The **School of Summoning** is a mortal institution, founded centuries ago to study the Pyramid and other dimensional phenomena. It developed its own communion techniques—faster, more accessible, requiring less discipline than the Pyramid's demanding practices. Most Rentar learn the School's methods before (or instead of) making the pilgrimage to the Pyramid. The School's techniques are what Gynor has corrupted.

This creates a schism the Rentar don't recognize. Pyramid-path Rentar receive genuine celestial guidance. School-path Rentar receive Gynor's whispered lies, dressed up as divine truth. Both groups believe they're following the same faith. They share temples, debate theology, respect each other's insights. They have no idea they're receiving guidance from fundamentally different sources.

### The Hidden Threat: Gynor the Conqueror

**Who He Was**

Gynor was a human summoner at the School of Summoning, roughly 200 years ago. Brilliant, ambitious, and deeply interested in the nature of consciousness and will. He developed new communion techniques that allowed deeper contact with other minds—and eventually developed techniques to *influence* those minds during communion.

When the School's masters discovered what he was doing, they moved to expel him. Gynor killed three of them, stole foundational texts on celestial communion, and fled into the highlands. The School assumed he died in the wilderness.

He did die, eventually. But not before transforming himself into a lich—binding his soul to an anchor hidden somewhere in Chechol's highlands.

**What He's Doing**

For nearly two centuries, Gynor has been refining his techniques and slowly infiltrating Rentar spiritual practices. He can't corrupt the Pyramid—it's genuinely celestial, beyond his reach. But he can corrupt the School's communion methods, which most Rentar use.

His approach is patient. He doesn't issue commands. He offers *guidance*. During communion, corrupted Rentar receive visions that feel divine: a sense of righteous certainty, a conviction that they know the correct path, a subtle discomfort with doubt or questioning. Over generations, this has transformed the Rentar from contemplative mystics into confident zealots.

Gynor is building an army. Not through recruitment or conscription, but through faith. When he finally activates his control—when he shifts from subtle guidance to direct command—thousands of Rentar will march as his **Red Army**, utterly convinced they're fulfilling divine purpose.

**Where He Is**

Gynor's physical location is unknown. His phylactery is hidden somewhere in the highlands between the Stulov and Riki valleys. He himself may be there, or may be elsewhere—liches are patient, and he's had two centuries to establish contingencies.

The School of Summoning suspects *something* is wrong with the local psychic currents. They've detected anomalies for decades. But they haven't connected these anomalies to their expelled former student, who they believe long dead.

**How Close Is the Red Army?**

Not imminent, but not distant. Gynor is still refining his control, still testing how much direct influence he can exert before resistance emerges. The Rentar could be activated in years, not decades. If something forces his hand—discovery, a threat to his phylactery—he might move sooner, with a less complete army.

### Economy

Chechol's economy is modest and agricultural. The three river valleys produce grain, vegetables, and livestock. The Rentar monasteries are largely self-sufficient. Trade flows north toward the Deadloop ports and south into Dalizi.

The one unusual export is **summoners**. The School of Summoning produces trained practitioners who command premium fees across Aboyinzu. This gives Chechol disproportionate influence in regional politics—several major courts retain Chechol-trained summoners as advisors.

The Rentar also hire out as mercenaries and spiritual consultants. Their reputation for divine guidance makes them valuable (and expensive) advisors. Few clients realize that the advice they're paying for may originate with a lich.

### Military

The **Chechol River Guard** is a modest professional force of roughly 3,000 soldiers, primarily human, responsible for border security and internal order. They've seen little serious combat in generations.

The Rentar maintain no official military organization, but every adult Rentar has combat training. The monasteries practice martial disciplines as a form of meditation. In an emergency, Chechol could field 8,000-10,000 Rentar warriors.

This is the Red Army.

The Rentar don't think of themselves as a military force. They think of themselves as spiritual practitioners who happen to be combat-capable. But Gynor has spent two centuries ensuring they're ready—their training, their equipment, their organization, all shaped by "divine guidance" toward military effectiveness.

### Relations

**Dalizi Confederation**

The Dalizi city-states view Chechol as a quiet neighbor—useful for trade, not threatening, not interesting. Several Dalizi states hire Chechol summoners or consult Rentar advisors. None suspect the danger incubating next door.

Turbuni, the city-state bordering the School of Summoning, has the closest relationship. They share jurisdiction over the School's territory and maintain trade agreements. If the Red Army activates, Turbuni will likely be the first casualty.

**Terrenia and Northern States**

Chechol's northern neighbors (Grustos, Quintas, Chaal Nazzerox) barely think about Chechol at all. It's a backwater, too far south to matter. This neglect may prove catastrophic—no one is watching for the threat that's building.

**The Deadloop**

The Deadloop inner sea provides Chechol's primary trade access. Goods flow to the port city of Tenches and then across the sea. Chechol has no navy, no maritime ambitions, and treats the Deadloop purely as a trade route.

### Notable Locations

#### Sevich (Capital)

The seat of Duke Vorotny, located where the Chechik River widens before joining the Deadloop drainage. A modest city of 15,000, dominated by the ducal palace and the Grand Temple of Communion—the largest Rentar temple in Chechol.

The Grand Temple was built over an older human shrine. Its architecture blends Rentar meditation chambers with human ceremonial spaces. Duke Yelen visits weekly to receive spiritual counsel.

#### The Pyramid of Five Sides

Southeast of the capital, in the highlands between the Chechik and Stulov valleys. A stepped pyramid of unknown origin, its four visible faces oriented to the cardinal directions. The fifth face exists only in Celestia—those who enter the Pyramid during certain celestial alignments can cross between planes.

The Pyramid is tended by the **Keepers of the Fifth Face**, an order of Rentar monks who maintain the site and guide pilgrims. These monks are among the few Rentar whose communion practices remain uncorrupted—they use the Pyramid's direct celestial connection rather than the School's techniques.

They've noticed that their visions don't always match what other Rentar describe. They've attributed this to their greater proximity to celestial truth. They haven't considered that other Rentar might be receiving guidance from somewhere else entirely.

#### The School of Summoning

On the border with Turbuni, technically under shared jurisdiction. See the full entry for details.

The School is the unwitting source of Chechol's corruption—its communion techniques are what Gynor has infiltrated. The faculty suspects something is wrong with local psychic phenomena but hasn't identified the cause.

#### The Three River Valleys

- **Chechik Valley**: The most developed, containing the capital and primary agricultural lands. Human-majority.
- **Stulov Valley**: The breadbasket, rolling farmland with scattered Rentar monasteries. Mixed population.
- **Riki Valley**: The most rural, closest to the School of Summoning. Increasingly Rentar-dominated, increasingly zealous.

### Player Hooks

**The Warning Signs**

- A Pyramid Keeper approaches the party with concerns—her visions don't match what the Council of Elders describes, and she's starting to wonder why.
- The School of Summoning hires investigators to examine "psychic anomalies" they've detected. They don't know they're asking players to investigate their own corrupted techniques.
- Duke Yelen's chancellor (one of the few human officials left) quietly seeks outside help. He can't articulate what's wrong, but he knows *something* is.

**The Race Against Time**

- Someone has discovered evidence of Gynor's survival. Now it's a race—can the players find and destroy his phylactery before he activates the Red Army?
- A Rentar elder has begun to break free of Gynor's influence. She remembers what communion used to feel like, and she's terrified. She has days before her absence is noticed.

**The Aftermath**

- The Red Army has already activated. Turbuni is burning. The players must evacuate civilians, rally resistance, or find a way to break Gynor's control over thousands of zealots who genuinely believe they're doing divine work.

### History

**Pre-Rentar Era** (before ~1200 SD)

The three river valleys were settled by humans migrating south from Terrenia. The Pyramid of Five Sides was already ancient—a monument from a forgotten civilization. Early settlers avoided it, considering it haunted. The ducal line was established to unify the valleys against Dalizi expansion.

**Foundation of the School** (~1200 SD)

Human scholars established the School of Summoning to study the Pyramid and develop practical communion techniques. For centuries, it was a respected academic institution, producing summoners who served across Aboyinzu.

**Rentar Arrival** (~1600 SD)

Rentar minotaurs, seeking a genuine connection to celestial truth, discovered the Pyramid and recognized its power. They settled in the highlands, initially as pilgrims, eventually as permanent residents. The human dukes welcomed them—their spiritual insight was valuable, and they paid taxes.

**Gynor's Fall** (~1750 SD)

The summoner Gynor developed mind-influence techniques, was discovered, killed three faculty members, and fled. The School assumed he died in the wilderness. In fact, he became a lich and began his centuries-long corruption project.

**The Quiet Transformation** (1750 SD - present)

Over 200 years, Gynor's subtle influence transformed Rentar spiritual culture. Early Rentar were contemplative, patient, fond of doubt and debate. Modern Rentar are certain, confident, uncomfortable with questions. No one noticed the change because it happened across generations.

**Present Day** (3376 SD)

Chechol appears peaceful. Duke Yelen rules with Rentar guidance. The School produces summoners. The Pyramid draws pilgrims. Underneath, thousands of Rentar are primed to become the Red Army, awaiting only Gynor's command.
