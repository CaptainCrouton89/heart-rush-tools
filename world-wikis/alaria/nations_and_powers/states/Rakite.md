## Rakite

Tags: state, elven, tribal

The great plains of the eastern Farlands, where the grass grows taller than a man and the Rakiten elves hunt buffalo beneath an endless sky. This is not a kingdom in any conventional sense—there's no capital, no standing army, no tax collectors. Just a loose confederation of tribes bound by shared blood, shared custom, and an absolute refusal to bow to anyone.

The Rakiten are the tallest elves in the known world, bred over generations to see over the six-foot grasses that dominate their homeland. They dress in auburn and rust, colors that blend with the autumn plains. They hunt the great herds that migrate between Tyror Miig and Tyror Weklis with a patience and skill that makes other hunters look like amateurs.

And now strangers are burning their grasslands to plant farms, and the Rakiten are deciding whether to disappear or fight back.

### Overview

Rakite sprawls across approximately 50,000 square miles of grassland, bounded by the Vokas Enrisikna mountains to the west, the Vokas Pendi range to the south, and the sea to the east. The land is mostly flat—gentle swells hiding the horizon, river valleys cutting through the plains, occasional copses of trees where the land dips enough to shelter them from the constant wind.

The grass is the defining feature. Tyror grass grows six feet tall in summer, higher in wet years, and moves in waves like a golden ocean. From ground level, visibility extends maybe twenty feet. From atop a horse—or from the height of a Rakiten elf—you can see for miles, tracking herds by the wake they leave in the grass.

There are no cities. The Rakiten live in movable camps, following the buffalo and the seasons. The only permanent structures are sacred sites, the Palace of Flickering Lights, and—increasingly—the Roule colonial villages sprouting on the eastern peninsula.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Tribal confederation

**Primary Inhabitants**: Rakiten elves

**Population**: ~10,000

**Stability**: Very Stable (internally), Threatened (externally)

**Core Values**:

- Generosity as dominance—the greatest gift-giver commands the most respect
- Confrontation is shameful; disputes are resolved through competitive giving
- The land belongs to no one; the herds belong to everyone
- Outsiders are tolerated but never trusted

The Rakiten have no unified government. Each tribe—there are perhaps thirty, ranging from a few dozen to several hundred members—governs itself according to its own customs. Some follow hereditary chiefs, others elect leaders, others defer to their elders or their shamans.

Once a year, at the autumn equinox, tribal leaders gather at the **Kro Shiik Convocation**—a meeting on the shores of the central lake where matters affecting all Rakite are discussed. Decisions are made by consensus or not at all. In practice, this means most decisions aren't made, and each tribe handles its own affairs.

The gift-giving tradition is central to Rakiten culture. Disputes between individuals, families, or tribes are settled not by violence or arbitration, but by gift competition. Each party gives the other gifts of increasing value until one side presents something so generous, so self-sacrificing, that the other is obligated to accept it—and with it, the giver's position in the dispute.

This sounds peaceful. It is, mostly. But it can also be brutal: the pressure to give more than you can afford, the shame of accepting a gift you can't reciprocate, the slow impoverishment of a family that keeps losing gift-battles. The Rakiten avoid open conflict, but they're capable of destroying each other with generosity.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**:
- Buffalo hides and horn (highly valued for quality)
- Tyror grass rope (unusually strong and water-resistant)
- Bone carvings (ceremonial and decorative)

**Primary Imports**:
- Metal tools and weapons (they have no smithing tradition)
- Salt (essential for preserving meat)
- Occasionally, luxuries for gift-giving competitions

The Rakiten economy is fundamentally different from settled peoples. There's no currency; wealth is measured in horses, buffalo, and the quality of your crafts. Trade with outsiders happens at the margins—literally at the edges of Rakiten territory—and is handled by specific families who've specialized in dealing with foreigners.

Most Rakiten go their entire lives without using money. Everything they need, they make, hunt, or receive as gifts.

### Military

**Size**: Small (but can mobilize quickly)

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all adults are trained hunters and warriors)

The Rakiten have no standing army because they don't need one. Every adult is a hunter, and every hunter is a warrior. They fight from horseback with bows, javelins, and long knives. They don't form ranks or follow orders—each warrior fights as an individual, using the grass for concealment and the plains for maneuver.

In open battle, they would lose to any organized army. They never fight open battles. Rakiten warfare is about ambush, harassment, and attrition. They appear from the grass, strike, and vanish. They poison water sources. They stampede herds through enemy camps. They burn the grass behind advancing forces and wait for starvation to do their work.

No army has ever conquered Rakite. Several have tried. The grass swallowed them all.

### The Roule Problem

Twenty years ago, halflings from Roule began settling the eastern peninsula. They called the land empty because they couldn't see anyone using it. They burned the grass to plant crops. They built permanent villages. They named the land and claimed to own it.

The Rakiten watched. They are culturally averse to confrontation, and the strangers were far from the core grazing lands. When the buffalo avoided the burned areas, the tribes simply adjusted their migration patterns. When Roule settlers started finding old hearths and stone foundations beneath their fields, they dismissed them as ancient history.

But the burning continues. Each year, a little more grassland becomes farmland. Each year, the buffalo have less range. Each year, the Rakiten lose ground without ever fighting a battle.

The tribes are divided. Some argue for continued withdrawal—the plains are vast, and there's room to disappear. Others say the withdrawal will never end until they fight. A few have begun quiet acts of resistance: herds "accidentally" stampeding through Roule fields, fires "somehow" spreading to colonial buildings. So far, the Roule don't even know the Rakiten exist. They think the plains are haunted.

That ignorance won't last forever.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Roule Expansion**: The colonial villages are growing. The burning continues. Something will break.
- **Internal Division**: The tribes can't agree on whether to fight, flee, or ignore the problem. The annual convocation grows more tense each year.
- **The Palace Question**: The Sarakiel in the Palace of Flickering Lights have lived among the Rakiten for centuries without interaction. Recently, the angels have been seen at the palace windows, watching the plains. Watching the Roule. No one knows what they're thinking.
- **The Light Leyline**: A major leyline of light energy passes through eastern Rakite. The Roule villages sit directly on it. Some Rakiten shamans believe this isn't coincidence—that the halflings are drawn to the power without knowing why, and that waking the leyline could have consequences.

### History

The Rakiten have lived on these plains longer than anyone can remember. Their oral histories stretch back dozens of generations, describing a time before the Palace, before the elven kingdoms to the south, before the mountains had names. The plains were always here. The buffalo were always here. The Rakiten were always here.

They've weathered droughts, harsh winters, and occasional incursions from the Vokas Enrisikna. They've traded with Lenora to the south and occasionally raided the coastal settlements that existed before Roule. They've never been conquered because no one has ever wanted the plains badly enough to pay the cost of taking them.

The Sarakiel arrived perhaps a thousand years ago—a squadron of fallen angels who built their marble palace and retreated inside. The Rakiten left them alone. The angels left the Rakiten alone. It's been a comfortable arrangement.

Now, for the first time, something is changing. The Roule colonists don't understand the rules. They don't know about gift-giving or sacred territories or the old arrangements with the Palace. They just see empty land and opportunity.

The Rakiten are about to learn whether their culture can adapt—or whether their refusal to fight will be the end of them.

### Player Hooks

- **The Charcoal Discovery**: A Roule farmer in Kilik digs up charcoal and stone foundations in his field. He reports it to the mayor. Someone needs to investigate whether the land was occupied before—and what it means if it was.

- **The Gift-War**: Two Rakiten families are locked in a ruinous gift competition. They've beggared themselves and are now offering things that shouldn't be offered—sacred objects, family members, promises that will destroy them. A neutral party might be able to mediate, if they can understand the rules.

- **The Angel's Offer**: A Sarakiel from the Palace has broken the ancient prohibition and walked into the plains. She seeks outsiders—not Rakiten, not Roule—for a task the angels cannot do themselves. She won't say what. She'll pay in light.

- **The Leyline Waking**: Strange lights have been seen at night near Golyayla. The Roule colonists think it's ghost-fire. The Rakiten shamans know better: something is stirring in the leyline, and the villages are at the center of it.

- **The Buffalo War**: A Roule hunting party killed a sacred white buffalo, not knowing what it was. The Rakiten are divided between those who want blood payment and those who want to give the colonists gifts until they understand what they've done. Both approaches could end in disaster.
