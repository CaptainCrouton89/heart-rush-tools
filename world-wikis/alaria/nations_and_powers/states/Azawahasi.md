### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Independent nomadic tribes

**Primary Inhabitants**: Sharabha

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, duty, self-sufficiency, gift-giving

- Sharabha tribes function like lion prides—a strong male and his brothers lead a tribe of up to 50 people. Everyone knows their role, their place in the Pride Circle, and their obligations to the group.
- The Sharabha are descendants of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father who died fighting the titan Hykravones. His blood transformed the land and the people who settled upon it. This shared ancestry creates deep bonds across tribal lines.
- Honor is paramount. "My honor before my life" isn't a saying—it's how Sharabha actually live. Oaths are taken seriously, debts are remembered, and reputation matters more than wealth.
- The two major Sharabha cultures—Sharakari (Pride Guardians) and Sharadin (Oathspeakers)—both exist here, with different tribes following different traditions.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Very Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Beads, furs, animal products, ivory

**Primary Imports**: Furs, textiles, art, metal goods

- The Sharabha have little use for money. Within tribes, everything is shared. Between tribes, gift-giving establishes relationships—you don't trade with strangers, you give gifts to friends and receive gifts in return.
- Hunts occur every few weeks, targeting the massive game that roams Azawahasi: elephants, great cats, enormous antelope. The hunts are communal events involving multiple families working together.
- Outsiders who want to trade must first establish themselves as friends through gift exchange. Merchants who try to conduct business without this social foundation are viewed with suspicion or contempt.
- The Sharabha produce exceptional leather goods, bone carvings, and beadwork. These items are valued trade goods for the few merchants who've learned how to work with Sharabha customs.

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: N/A

- The Sharabha have no standing army because they don't need one. Every adult can fight. Every adult has trained since childhood. Every adult can transform into a lion-like form with fangs and claws.
- Tribal conflicts are resolved through ritual combat, negotiation, or (rarely) small-scale skirmishes. Full warfare between tribes is almost unknown—the shared honor code makes atrocities unthinkable.
- When external threats arise, tribes coordinate rapidly. The goblin broods learned long ago that raiding Sharabha territory invites devastating retaliation. A coordinated Sharabha response is terrifying—dozens of lion-warriors hunting as a single pride.
- Individual Sharabha warriors are among the most dangerous fighters in the region. The combination of honor-driven fearlessness and lion transformation makes them lethal opponents.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Generational Divide**

Young Sharabha increasingly leave their tribes to see the wider world. They return (if they return) with foreign ideas, foreign goods, and foreign attitudes. Elders view this as corruption—traditional ways being abandoned for flashy novelty. The young see it as growth and opportunity. The argument plays out in every tribe, with no resolution in sight.

**The Goblin Nuisance**

Scalawag goblins from the western plains occasionally raid Azawahasi territory. The raids are more annoying than threatening—the goblins can't stand against Sharabha warriors—but they disrupt hunts, steal supplies, and require responses that take warriors away from productive work.

**The Honor Paradox**

Sharabha honor code makes them excellent warriors but complicated diplomats. They struggle with societies that don't share their values—where oaths are broken, where gift-giving is seen as bribery, where reputation counts for nothing. Navigating the outside world without compromising their principles is an ongoing challenge.


### History

The Sharabha emerged on this land after Shara Bolasi's final battle against the titan Hykravones. The great lion father died, but his blood transformed the earth where it fell. Generations later, humans who settled this transformed land found themselves changing—becoming something new, something more.

The first Sharabha discovered their lion forms during times of great emotion—protecting loved ones, defending against predators, facing impossible odds. They learned to channel Shara Bolasi's legacy, to transform at will, to carry his courage in their blood.

For centuries, the Sharabha have lived as their ancestors did. Tribes follow the herds. Pride Circles define loyalty and obligation. Honor governs everything. The system works—Azawahasi has been stable while kingdoms rise and fall around it.

But stability isn't stagnation, and the Sharabha are changing whether the elders like it or not. Young warriors return from foreign lands with new ideas. Traders from the United Free Nations bring goods and concepts unknown to traditional culture. The world is getting smaller, and Azawahasi can't stay isolated forever.

The question isn't whether the Sharabha will change, but how—and whether they can preserve what matters while adapting to what's coming.
