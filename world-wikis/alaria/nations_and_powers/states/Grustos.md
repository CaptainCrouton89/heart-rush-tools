## Grustos

Tags: state

A mountainous state in Central Aboyinzu, notable for the three non-human populations that share its territory with the human majority: the isolationist Kryaaji sun elves of Enuau Kemjallb, the Aciabro blood-mechanist goblins of the Sunwing Peaks, and the nomadic giant herders who pass through seasonally via Giants' Corridor.

### Government

Grustos is governed from its capital Cañas by a council system designed to accommodate its unusual demographics. The ruling council includes human merchant representatives, giant clan-speakers (when migration brings them through), and a perpetually empty chair reserved for the Kryaaji—who have never acknowledged the invitation.

The Aciabro goblins are not represented and have never requested to be. They govern themselves in their mountain workshops and have no interest in lowland politics.

In practice, humans run Grustos, with the understanding that their authority doesn't extend into sun elf territory, goblin workshops, or the Giants' Corridor during migration seasons. This limited sovereignty is accepted as the cost of coexistence.

### Populations

**Humans**: The majority, concentrated in the central lowlands and southern regions. They farm, trade, and serve as intermediaries between the other populations.

**Kryaaji Sun Elves**: Residing in the independent city-state of Enuau Kemjallb within Grustos's claimed borders. The sun elves maintain strict isolation, trading only through boundary markets. Grustos claims them as citizens; the Kryaaji consider this fiction and ignore it.

**Aciabro Goblins**: Blood-mechanist goblins who replace their flesh with machinery powered by vital essence. They inhabit workshops in the Sunwing Peaks, have no interest in outside contact, and trade only in blood-soaked equipment no sane person wants.

**Giant Herders**: Nomadic pastoral giants who pass through twice yearly with their enormous flocks. They're not citizens—they predate Grustos and will outlast it—but they trade at designated stops and generally avoid causing problems.

### Economy

Grustos is not wealthy. The mountains limit agriculture; the sun elves don't share their craftsmanship; the goblins produce nothing tradeable. What prosperity exists comes from:

- **Giant migration trade**: Twice yearly, towns along the corridor transform into massive markets for giant-produced wool, leather, and exotic meats.
- **Mining**: Iron and copper from the Torulius Mountains feed modest metalworking industries.
- **Kryaaji boundary trade**: Sun elf craftsmanship commands premium prices, even through indirect exchange.
- **Transit fees**: The main road between Chaal Nazzerox (for those foolish enough to go there) and Qintas passes through Grustos.

### Military

Grustos maintains a small professional army supplemented by militia levies—enough to patrol roads and handle bandits, not enough to fight a real war. The state's defense relies more on geography (mountains on all sides) and the assumption that any invader would have to contend with sun elves, blood-goblins, and giants.

This assumption may be optimistic. If Chaal Nazzerox's undead break west, Grustos will be the first to fall.

### Relations

**Enuau Kemjallb**: Technically within Grustos's borders, practically independent. The relationship is one of mutual non-interference and carefully maintained fiction.

**Qintas**: Friendly neighbor to the east. Trade flows freely; borders are nominal. The Amverela high elves consider Grustos slightly uncouth; Grustani consider Qintas slightly pretentious.

**Chaal Nazzerox**: The undead empire to the west. No diplomatic relations. Grustos watches the border nervously and hopes the Crystal Mountains hold.

### What Will Go Wrong

- **The undead will come**: Grustos is the buffer between Chaal Nazzerox and the civilized east. Buffers get ground down.
- **The sun elves know something**: The Kryaaji have lived on the Light leyline for millennia. Their isolation may be hiding more than religious purity.
- **Skyloft Castle**: Whatever destroyed it is still there. Eventually, it may wake up.
- **The giants are changing routes**: Climate shifts or something else is altering migration patterns. Towns built around giant trade may find themselves abandoned.
