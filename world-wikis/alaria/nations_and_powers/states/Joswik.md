### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, mixed

**Population**: 250,000

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Tradition, community, resilience

- Ruled by Prince Edric, the youngest of the three siblings who inherited Ofrenia. He's kind, well-meaning, and completely out of his depth.
- Edric inherited the southern kingdom—rich in minerals and farmland, but lacking Tornia's trade networks or Sylke's ruthless efficiency. He's tried to rule fairly and has mostly succeeded in pleasing no one.
- The population is fiercely independent, descended from miners and farmers who carved their living from difficult land. They don't love Edric, but they don't hate him either.
- With Alisandra now controlling Tornia, Joswik is the last independent kingdom on Ofrenia. Everyone knows what's coming.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Iron, copper, stone, grain, livestock

**Primary Imports**: Manufactured goods, timber, luxury items

- The Gnomestone Mountains yield iron and copper that once supplied all of Ofrenia. Now those minerals flow to whoever will buy them—and increasingly, Alisandra's agents are the only buyers offering fair prices.
- The Oshkensi Plateau supports sheep and cattle in numbers that feed both Joswik and its neighbors. The herders there answer to no one but themselves.
- Trade has suffered since the war. Merchants fear traveling through occupied Tornia, and the route through Myastor adds weeks and costs.
- Joswik could be prosperous, but prosperity requires stability that Edric can't provide and peace that Alisandra won't allow.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Joswik has never maintained a large standing army. The population is spread thin across mining towns and farming villages, and pulling workers away disrupts everything.
- What military exists is poorly equipped, poorly trained, and knows it can't stop Sylke if Alisandra decides to invade.
- The one bright spot: the terrain. The Gnomestone Mountains and the interior hills favor defense. An invader would need to fight through passes and valleys where numbers matter less.
- Some nobles have begun hiring mercenaries, but there aren't enough gold and there aren't enough mercenaries to make a real difference.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Coming Storm**

Everyone in Joswik knows Alisandra is coming. The question is when, not if. Edric has tried diplomacy—his sister won't negotiate. He's tried building alliances—no one wants to challenge Sylke. He's tried preparing defenses—there isn't enough money or time. The kingdom waits for the axe to fall.

**The Refugee Crisis**

Tornian refugees have been flooding into Joswik since the occupation—nobles who fled with their wealth, soldiers who refused to serve Alisandra, common folk who saw which way the wind was blowing. They bring skills and gold, but also mouths to feed and resentments to manage. Some want Edric to lead a liberation; others just want safety.

**The Mountain Lords**

The mining towns of the Gnomestone Mountains have always been semi-independent, paying taxes but governing themselves. With Joswik's central authority weakening, some are asking why they should pay taxes at all. Edric needs their minerals for any hope of defense, but he can't afford to antagonize them.

**The Oshkensi Question**

The herders of Oshkensi Plateau care nothing for lowland politics. They've weathered regime changes before and expect to weather this one. If Alisandra conquers Joswik, the plateau folk will simply retreat into their grasslands and wait. This attitude infuriates Edric's advisors but might actually be the wisest response.

### History

Joswik was the old king's favorite project—the troubled southern province he'd spent decades developing. When he divided Ofrenia among his children, he gave Joswik to Edric, his youngest, believing the gentlest son needed the most guidance and the kingdom with the most potential.

He was half right. Edric is gentle, thoughtful, and genuinely cares about his people. He's also indecisive, easily manipulated, and lacks the ruthlessness that ruling requires. His father's advisors have mostly died or retired; the replacements serve their own interests first.

For the first years after the division, Joswik muddled along. The mines produced, the farms yielded, and Edric presided over a kingdom that functioned despite rather than because of his rule. He maintained cordial relations with both siblings, hoping the family could eventually reconcile.

That hope died when Alisandra invaded Tornia. Now Edric rules the last free kingdom on Ofrenia, surrounded by his sister's territory, watching refugees pour across his borders, and knowing he lacks the strength to stop what's coming.

His one advantage: he hasn't given Alisandra a reason to invade. No insults, no provocations, no alliances with her enemies. If she moves against Joswik, she'll be the naked aggressor—and even her cowed subjects might balk at conquering a brother who offered nothing but peace. Edric is betting that shame, at least, might slow her down.

He's probably wrong. But he doesn't know what else to do.
