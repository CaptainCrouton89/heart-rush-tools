## Flurin

Tags: state, kendrel

The northernmost of the three Kendrel Kingdoms, Flurin occupies a chain of barrier islands and submerged reef-cities along the eastern edge of the Agreben Sea. Where its sister kingdoms turn inward, Flurin faces outward—toward Atriik, toward trade, toward the surface world that most Kendrel regard with patient condescension.

### Overview

Flurin stretches roughly 120 miles north to south, a scattered constellation of coral atolls, volcanic islets, and the deeper reef-fortresses where most of its population actually lives. The surface settlements serve as interface points—places where air-breathing traders can do business without drowning. Beneath the waves, Flurin's true cities sprawl across the continental shelf in lattices of cultivated coral and bioluminescent gardens.

The kingdom's position makes it the natural gateway between the Kendrel realms and the surface nations. Atriik's coast lies just thirty miles east; Mueras's Darkened Coast curves along the northern horizon. This geography has shaped Flurin's character: more cosmopolitan than Glador, more commercially-minded than Pelaria, and considerably more tolerant of surface-dweller vulgarity than either.

### Government

**The Tidal Court** governs Flurin from the underwater palace-complex of **Azulora**, a spiral of coral towers that rises from a submerged volcanic cone. The court operates on rotating primacy—three noble houses take turns holding the **Chair of Currents** in eleven-year cycles, ensuring no single lineage accumulates too much influence.

The current Chair-holder is **House Velanith**, known for aggressive expansion of surface trade. Their rivals in House Coralynn advocate for stricter isolation, while House Pelarond (distantly related to Pelaria's ruling family) push for deeper military cooperation with their southern kin.

Unlike the other kingdoms, Flurin grants formal standing to a **Merchant Assembly**—a council of successful traders, both Kendrel and (controversially) surface-born, who advise on commercial matters. Traditional Kendrel find this arrangement distasteful. Flurin's coffers find it profitable.

### Culture

Flurin is Pelaendor territory. The wanderer subrace dominates here, their practical pragmatism better suited to constant dealings with surface folk than the refined sensibilities of Court Kendrel or the secretive nature of the Cendoriln. That said, all three subraces are present—the Court Kendrel run the noble houses, the Cendoriln handle matters that require... discretion.

**Surface Accommodation**: Flurin has developed extensive infrastructure for air-breathers. Floating platforms anchored above the reef-cities. Pressurized guest chambers in the upper levels of coral towers. Specialized guides (called **tide-walkers**) who escort surface visitors through underwater passages via bubble-helms and enchanted breathing apparatus. It's all very expensive, and Flurin likes it that way.

**The Vulgarity Tax**: Violence remains as taboo here as in all Kendrel society, but Flurin has found creative workarounds. Surface traders who cause disruptions—fights, theft, "discourteous commerce"—face the Vulgarity Tax: punitive fines calculated to extract maximum wealth while stopping just short of provoking actual conflict. Repeat offenders find themselves socially exiled from all three kingdoms, their names circulated on the **Tide of Shame**.

**Festival of First Contact**: Every three years, Flurin hosts a grand celebration commemorating the first formal trade agreements with surface nations (roughly 400 years ago). Surface merchants are invited to underwater exhibitions, rare goods are auctioned, and young Kendrel compete in elaborate courtship displays meant to demonstrate their sophistication. It's part trade fair, part mating ritual, part propaganda exercise.

### Economy

**Primary Exports**: Pearls (Flurin's are considered second only to Glador's), coral jewelry, preserved seafood delicacies, navigational charts of the Agreben's underwater topography, and **tideweave**—a fabric woven from specially cultivated kelp that's waterproof, lightweight, and absurdly expensive on surface markets.

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods (Kendrel don't smelt), surface textiles, preserved foods that survive underwater storage, and information. Flurin pays well for news from distant lands.

**The Translation Trade**: Flurin's most lucrative service isn't a good—it's expertise. Kendrel translators, negotiators, and cultural intermediaries hire out to surface merchants attempting to do business anywhere in the Greenwater Isles. A Flurin-trained guide can navigate not just underwater passages but the labyrinthine social expectations of dealing with their more insular southern kin.

### Military

Flurin maintains the smallest military of the three kingdoms—a conscious choice reflecting both their commercial priorities and their philosophical discomfort with organized violence. The **Reef Watch** patrols the kingdom's borders, but their primary function is observation and warning rather than combat.

When genuine threats emerge (primarily Bfaspeen raids from the deeper Agreben), Flurin's response is to retreat to fortified positions and call for aid from Glador and Pelaria. This dependency is a source of ongoing political tension; the southern kingdoms resent playing protector while Flurin profits from surface trade.

**The Quiet Arrangement**: What Flurin lacks in martial strength, it compensates for in intelligence networks. Cendoriln agents throughout the Agreben track Bfaspeen movements, surface fleet positions, and political developments in neighboring nations. This information flows to all three kingdoms, making Flurin indispensable despite its military weakness.

### Relations

**Glador**: Correct but cool. Glador's traditionalists view Flurin as culturally compromised—too willing to accommodate surface vulgarity for profit. Flurin views Glador as ossified and naive about external threats. They cooperate because they must, and compete in everything else.

**Pelaria**: Warmer than with Glador, despite the greater distance. Pelaria respects Flurin's pragmatism, and House Pelarond maintains strong ties to their southern relatives. When Pelaria needs surface goods, they go through Flurin. When Flurin needs military backing, they call Pelaria first.

**Atriik**: The primary surface trading partner. Flurin maintains permanent embassies in three of Atriik's four city-states and has cultivated generations of relationships with Atriik's merchant families. The Atriik see Flurin as exotic but reliable; Flurin sees Atriik as useful but culturally exhausting.

**The Bfaspeen**: Like all Kendrel, Flurin refuses to negotiate with the brood mothers. Unlike the other kingdoms, this refusal costs them—Bfaspeen raids on surface shipping hurt Flurin's commercial interests directly. Some whisper that House Velanith has considered... accommodation. If true, it would be the greatest scandal in Kendrel history.

### Settlements

**Azulora** (capital): The Tidal Court's seat, built into a submerged volcanic cone. Population ~8,000 Kendrel, plus transient surface visitors in the floating districts above.

**Watalina**: Surface-accessible trade port on the northeastern edge, where most commerce with Atriik occurs. Dominated by Pelaendor and foreign merchants.

**Ashenia**: Small fishing village on the northern frontier, notable mainly for its proximity to the Darkened Coast. Residents report strange currents and darker-than-normal waters drifting south from Mueras.

**Voltunis**: Southern border town, serving as the customary crossing point for Kendrel traveling between Flurin and Glador. Features the famous **Passage Gardens**—coral sculptures maintained by both kingdoms as a symbol of unity.

### Player Hooks

- A surface merchant needs escort through Flurin to reach Glador for a rare pearl auction. The journey requires navigating underwater passages, social expectations, and possibly Bfaspeen-infested waters.
- House Velanith is rumored to be secretly negotiating with a Bfaspeen brood mother. Someone needs to investigate—and decide what to do with the truth.
- The Tide of Shame has wrongly listed a player's contact. Clearing their name requires navigating Kendrel social politics without resorting to violence.
- A Festival of First Contact approaches, and a young Kendrel noble has hired surface adventurers to help them win a courtship competition against rivals who are definitely cheating.
