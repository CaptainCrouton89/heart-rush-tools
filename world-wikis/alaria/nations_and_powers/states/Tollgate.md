## Tollgate

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary autocracy (the Gatemaster)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (the Gatekeepers)

**Population**: ~5,000

**Stability**: Very stable (wealth and fortifications maintain control)

**Core Values**: Control, collection, self-sufficiency, the toll

Tollgate is a city-state built on one principle: whoever controls the strait controls the wealth flowing through it. For three centuries, the Toll family has held that control, charging every ship that passes through Phyndarr Sound's northern entrance.

The inhabitants call themselves Gatekeepers, and they take the role seriously. The entire population is dedicated to three functions: collecting tolls, defending the fortress, and providing services to ships that have paid their way. There is no agriculture, no manufacturing beyond what's needed for the fleet—Tollgate exists to collect.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (but wealthy per capita)

**Tech**: Standard, specialized in fortifications and patrol vessels

**Primary Exports**: Nothing (Tollgate produces nothing)

**Primary Imports**: Everything (food, materials, goods—all purchased with toll revenue)

Tollgate's economy is the toll. Ships pay based on cargo value; Tollgate uses the revenue to import everything the island needs. The system has made the Toll family enormously wealthy and created a population entirely dependent on maintaining the collection system.

Secondary income comes from services: repairs, resupply, and entertainment for sailors who've stopped (voluntarily or otherwise).

### Military

**Size**: Small but effective

**Quality**: Excellent at pursuit and boarding

**Enrollment**: Professional (~1,500 soldiers and sailors)

Tollgate maintains a garrison for fortress defense and a patrol fleet for toll enforcement. The patrol vessels are built for speed; their captains are experts at pursuit and boarding.

The fortress itself is the primary defense. Stone walls, artillery positions, and chokepoints make the island nearly impossible to assault. Blockades have been tried; Tollgate's stored supplies outlast them.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern entrance to Phyndarr Sound

**Biomes**: Rocky island, heavily fortified

**Climate**: Temperate maritime

**Named Features**: The Gate Towers, the Toll House, the Lookout

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tollgate (the only settlement on the island)

### The Toll Family

The Toll family has ruled Tollgate for three centuries, since the first Gatemaster established the toll system. The name wasn't original—they took it when they claimed the strait, and it's been their identity ever since.

**Current Gatemaster**: **Lord Brennan Toll**, age sixty-two. Practical, focused entirely on maintaining revenue, with no ambitions beyond holding what his family built.

Succession passes within the family, usually to the most competent candidate. "Most competent" is determined by the current Gatemaster, creating occasional succession disputes that are resolved quietly and sometimes violently.

### Primary Conflicts

**Universal Resentment**

Everyone who uses the strait hates paying Tollgate's tolls. Sheîr, Tarkhon, Knova—they've all considered eliminating the problem. So far, the cost of conquering a fortified island has exceeded the benefit of eliminating the tolls.

**Bypass Attempts**

Ships try to run the strait without paying. Tollgate's patrol fleet exists to catch them. The chase-and-capture game is constant, and Tollgate wins more often than not.

**Sheîr Competition**

Sheîr controls the eastern shore of Phyndarr Sound and considers Tollgate an upstart competitor. They've proposed joint administration; Tollgate refuses to share.

### Notable Figures

**Lord Brennan Toll** — Gatemaster for twenty-eight years. A practical man focused entirely on maintaining the system his ancestors built.

**Captain Vess Ironchain** — Commander of the patrol fleet. The best pursuit captain in the Western Isles, responsible for catching more toll-runners than anyone else alive.

**Steward Mira Toll** — Lord Brennan's niece and likely successor. More ambitious than her uncle; she's been quietly building relationships with powers who might support Tollgate's expansion.

### History

**The Founding** (~300 years ago): The first Toll established a checkpoint at the strait's narrowest point and began collecting from ships that passed. Early resistance was crushed; the toll became established.

**The Fortress Era**: Revenue funded fortification. Each generation expanded the walls, added towers, improved the harbor. Tollgate became nearly impregnable.

**The Present**: Tollgate at its height—wealthy, fortified, hated by everyone who pays and protected by the value of the trade route they control.
