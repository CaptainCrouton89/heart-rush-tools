## Kerwin

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Immortal monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Halflings

**Population**: 45,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Contentment, tradition, pastoral simplicity, quiet endurance

- Kerwin is ruled by **Ulyas the Immortal**, a halfling who has sat the throne for 898 years. He is, by any reasonable definition, a lich—though he maintains a living appearance and his subjects prefer not to think too hard about what sustains him.
- The halflings of Kerwin are agrarian and pastoral. They farm, they herd, they craft modest goods. They have no great ambitions. They want to live peaceful lives, raise families, and die in the same villages where they were born.
- Ulyas is, by all accounts, a good king. He settles disputes fairly, keeps taxes low, maintains roads, and asks little of his people. In return, they don't ask questions about his yearly journey to the Fireknife Mountains.
- Kerwin is nominally part of the Tarkhon Empire, but this is a polite fiction. Ulyas agreed to fealty five centuries ago when Tarkhon expanded, but he has outlived every emperor since. He pays modest tribute, allows Tarkhon merchants to operate freely, and in exchange, Tarkhon pretends they conquered him.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Simple

**Primary Exports**: Grain, wool, copper, modest crafts

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, luxury items, wine

- Kerwin's economy is subsistence-plus. The halflings grow more than they need, so they trade the surplus for things they can't make themselves.
- The **Copper Hills** provide modest mining income—enough to trade for iron and steel, which Kerwin cannot produce.
- Kerwin merchants are pleasant but unambitious. They want fair deals, not fortunes.
- Tarkhon traders pass through regularly, taking advantage of Kerwin's position on overland routes, but the halflings themselves rarely travel far.

### Military

**Size**: Tiny

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Volunteer militia

- Kerwin has no standing army. Villages maintain small militias for bandit problems and wild animal attacks.
- Ulyas himself is the kingdom's true defense. Whatever dark power sustains him has made him extraordinarily dangerous when roused. In 898 years, three armies have invaded Kerwin. None succeeded.
- The halflings don't like to talk about what happened to those armies.

### Tarkha

The capital of Kerwin—and once, long ago, the capital of the entire Tarkhon Empire.

Tarkha is a quiet city now, its grand avenues too wide for its current population, its ceremonial plazas hosting weekly markets instead of imperial processions. The old palace still stands, and Ulyas rules from it, but much of the building is closed off, dusty halls echoing with centuries of silence.

The halflings don't seem to mind living in the bones of a fallen capital. They've converted imperial granaries into community halls, turned the old mint into a brewery, and let wildflowers grow in the cracks of the processional way. Tarkha is comfortable, if melancholy.

Visitors from Nektuna sometimes weep when they see what Tarkha has become. The halflings offer them tea and wonder what the fuss is about.

### The Fireknife Mountains

The volcanic range along Kerwin's northwestern border. Unstable, dangerous, and largely avoided. Smoke rises from vents, hot springs bubble in unexpected places, and the peaks occasionally glow red at night.

Every year, King Ulyas travels into the Fireknife Mountains. He takes a small retinue and a larger group of "volunteers"—criminals, prisoners, and occasionally people who simply weren't missed. He returns alone.

The halflings don't ask what happens in those mountains. They've learned not to.

### The Copper Hills

Low, scrubby hills west of Tarkha, rich with copper ore. The town of **Chykum** serves as the mining center—halflings and a smattering of dwarven advisors extract enough copper to meet Kerwin's modest needs and trade the surplus.

The hills are dotted with ancient mine shafts, some predating halfling settlement. What the original miners were looking for—and whether they found it—is unclear.

### Da Sharma

The southern region of Kerwin, where the land grows drier and the farms give way to sheep pastures. Da Sharma halflings are considered rustic even by Kerwin standards—insular, traditional, and deeply superstitious about the old ways.

They maintain shrines to spirits that predate Tarkhon, Kerwin, and perhaps the halflings themselves.

### Ulyas the Immortal

Ulyas has ruled Kerwin for 898 years. He appears as an elderly halfling, weathered but hale, with bright eyes and a gentle manner. He settles disputes, blesses weddings, and remembers every citizen's grandparents.

He is almost certainly a lich.

Ulyas does not rot, does not wither, does not age. Whatever sustains him requires yearly renewal—a journey to a forgotten shrine in the Fireknife Mountains, where something ancient and hungry waits. The price is blood. Ulyas has paid it for nearly nine centuries.

He tells himself it's justified. The people he sacrifices are criminals, enemies, the forgotten. He's a good king. His people are happy. Surely that's worth a few dozen lives a year?

The math has grown uncomfortable over the centuries. Ulyas tries not to add it up.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Weight of Centuries**

Ulyas is tired. Nine hundred years is a long time to rule, a long time to make the same compromises, a long time to watch everyone he loves die while he continues. He's considered stopping—letting the yearly sacrifice lapse, letting himself finally rest. But who would rule Kerwin then? His people need him. Don't they?

**Tarkhon's Shadow**

Kerwin's nominal allegiance to Tarkhon is stable but hollow. Ulyas has outlived every attempt to integrate Kerwin more fully into the empire. But King Selron II is ambitious, and some in Nektuna whisper that it's time to remind Kerwin who's really in charge. Ulyas has heard these whispers before. He's buried everyone who acted on them.

**The Old Capital**

Tarkha was once the heart of Tarkhon. The Evertorch burned here before it was moved to Tarkhetan. Some in Kerwin—and some in the wider empire—believe the torch should return, that Tarkha's decline is a wound that festers. Ulyas finds this sentiment exhausting. He liked Tarkha better when it was quiet.

### History

Kerwin was settled by halflings long before Tarkhon existed as an empire. They farmed, they traded, they lived modest lives. Ulyas became king through means he no longer discusses, and he has ruled ever since.

When Tarkhon expanded five centuries ago, Ulyas negotiated rather than fought. He recognized the empire's strength but also its limits—Tarkhon wanted the strait, not the hinterlands. Ulyas offered fealty, tribute, and open roads. In exchange, Tarkhon left Kerwin alone.

The arrangement has held. Ulyas has watched Tarkhon's capital move from Tarkha to Tarkhetan, watched the Evertorch carried away, watched his city fade from imperial heart to provincial backwater. He doesn't seem to mind. The halflings certainly don't.

Kerwin endures. Ulyas endures. The shrine in the mountains waits for its yearly offering. Nothing changes, and perhaps nothing ever will.
