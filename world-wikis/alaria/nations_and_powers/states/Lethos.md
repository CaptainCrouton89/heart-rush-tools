## Lethos

Tags: state, shacklands

A waterlogged jungle peninsula that exists in the shadow of Gorath—and in the shadow of something older, something the jungle itself remembers.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: The Vigil (open council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Faeja, Darklings, Gillykin, Druids

**Population**: ~5,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**:
- Secrecy: What happens in Lethos stays in Lethos
- Maintenance: The Binding must be tended, always
- Consensus: No single voice can speak for all seven villages
- Memory: The dead must be remembered, lest they remember themselves

The Vigil is less a government than a coordination mechanism. Representatives from each of Lethos's seven villages meet at Xyrionn twice yearly—more often during Hollownight or times of crisis—to ensure the Binding remains stable. Decisions require consensus from at least five villages, making Lethos slow to act but nearly impossible to subvert from within.

Each village handles its own internal affairs. There are no laws that apply across all of Lethos, no shared taxation, no unified justice system. What binds the villages together is not politics but necessity: if the Binding fails, everyone dies.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Rare herbs, poisons, certain jungle hardwoods

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, preserved foods, salt

Lethos has almost no economy in the conventional sense. The villages are largely self-sufficient, living on fish, jungle game, cultivated roots, and gathered plants. What trade exists happens at Altimarloch, the village closest to the Gorathi border, where a few brave merchants bring metal tools, salt, and other goods unavailable in the deep jungle.

In return, Lethos exports rare medicinal plants and poisons that grow nowhere else—perhaps because of the Binding's influence on the local flora. These command high prices among Gorathi alchemists and physicians, creating a small but consistent flow of trade. The Faeja village of Mangaone specializes in this cultivation.

The Gillykin of Qlyp Augo participate in no trade at all.

### Military

**Size**: None (formal); Very Small (informal)

**Quality**: Very High (asymmetric)

**Enrollment**: None (voluntary specialists)

Lethos has no army. It doesn't need one.

The closest thing to a military force is the hunters of Ohoka, a Darkling village deep in the jungle. When threats arise—bandits who think they can prey on isolated villagers, Gorathi deserters seeking to disappear, occasionally something worse—Ohoka's hunters move through the supernatural darkness to eliminate them. They are very good at this. Bodies are rarely found.

But Lethos's true defense is the Binding itself. An invading army would face a jungle that actively resists them: paths that change, water that poisons, darkness that conceals enemies and disorients allies. Soldiers who die in Lethos do not stay dead—they become part of what they were fighting. The longer an occupation lasts, the stronger the jungle's resistance grows.

Gorath learned this three centuries ago. They have not forgotten.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern peninsula extending into the Sea of Sighs, eastern Shacklands

**Biomes**: Flooded jungle, mangrove swamp, brackish wetlands

**Named Entities**: Xyrionn (sacred stump), Qlyp Augo (ruins)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Multiple unnamed waterways; the land is more water than earth

**Adjacent Waters**: Sea of Sighs (south, east); Sherivreen Jungle coast (northeast)

Lethos is barely land at all. The jungle grows from standing water; paths between villages are canoe routes; buildings are constructed on stilts or floating platforms. Seasonal floods reshape the terrain constantly. Only a few areas of solid high ground exist, and these are significant—Erua is built on one, Xyrionn rises from another.

The climate is hot, humid, and oppressive. Rain falls almost daily. Insects are constant companions. Outsiders find the environment exhausting even before accounting for the Binding's effects.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (Xyrionn serves as meeting place)

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None

**Villages**:
- Tanekala (south, fishing)
- Altimarloch (west, trade/contact)
- Mangaone (interior, herbalism)
- Erua (east, druids)
- Ohoka (deep jungle, Darklings)
- Mintai (center, memory-keepers)
- Eptos (northeast, Gillykin monitors)

### Primary Conflicts

**Internal**:
- Gradual weakening of the Binding (requires increasing effort to maintain)
- Tension between isolation and survival (some argue for more outside contact)
- The Gillykin's increasing silence (they've grown more withdrawn recently)
- Succession at Erua (the druids are finally dying; who will anchor the Binding?)

**External**:
- The Binding may be spreading into the Sea of Sighs (ships disappearing)
- Gorathi interest is stirring (descendants of the Fourth Legion seek answers)
- Unknown pressure from beneath Qlyp Augo (the Gillykin warn of something awakening)

### History

**412 PR** — Gorath's Fourth Legion crosses into Lethos; occupation begins

**414 PR** — Provincial capital established at Qlyp Augo; garrison of 3,000

**~420 PR** — Druids begin the Binding ritual; first Gorathi dead woven into jungle

**452 PR** — Night of Roots; Qlyp Augo consumed; Gillykin emerge; Gorath withdraws

**453 PR** — Gorathi archives sealed; "tribute exemption" established

**~550 PR** — Village of Eptos founded to monitor Qlyp Augo

**Present** — Binding weakening; Veleth (druid of Xyrionn) aging; Gillykin increasingly withdrawn

### Relations

**Gorath**: Cold non-interference. Gorath maintains the "tribute exemption" and forbids military operations in Lethos. Most Gorathi officials don't know why. Those who do don't ask.

**Other Shacklands States**: Minimal contact. Lethos participates in no regional politics, signs no treaties, and asks nothing from its neighbors.

**The Sea of Sighs**: Complicated. Something in the water around Lethos is dangerous, and it may be getting worse.
