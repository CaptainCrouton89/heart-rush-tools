The island-state of Movasi is a theocratic society governed by the Velwey—dwarves who've built their entire civilization around the Dream Jungle's psychedelic properties and the Pool of Names at their capital. While technically a nation, Movasi functions more like a sacred institution: its economy, laws, and culture exist to facilitate the ritual that reveals pilgrims' true names.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic Council

**Primary Inhabitants**: Velwey (dwarves), with significant human, elf, and halfling minorities

**Population**: ~19,000 permanent residents, plus 500-2,000 transient pilgrims at any time

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**:
- Sacred hospitality toward those who seek truth
- Absolute confidentiality regarding what is learned in ritual
- The Pool's mystery is to be served, not solved

The **Council of Guides** governs Movasi—a body of senior priest-guides who've conducted thousands of rituals and demonstrated both spiritual authority and administrative competence. There is no single ruler; decisions require consensus among the seven council members. Succession happens through recognition rather than election: when a seat opens, the remaining council members identify who among the priests has earned it through decades of service.

The Velwey make up roughly two-thirds of the permanent population and hold nearly all religious and governmental authority. Non-Velwey residents serve in supporting roles: dock workers, merchants, harvesters, laborers. They're treated fairly—the Velwey need them—but full citizenship and participation in governance requires being Velwey.

**Religious Structure**: The priest-guides form a hierarchical order with ranks based on experience and demonstrated ability. Junior priests assist with preparation rituals; only those who've undergone decades of training conduct Pool rituals. The highest-ranked guides are said to have glimpsed truths beyond mere names during their own journeys—though what those truths might be, they don't discuss.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**:
- Pilgrimage services (revelation of true names)
- Refined psychoactive preparations (heavily regulated)
- Clarity tonics and preparation compounds
- Crystallized dream-matter (rare, expensive)

**Primary Imports**:
- Food (the jungle isn't particularly edible)
- Construction materials
- Luxury goods for wealthy pilgrims
- Skilled labor

Movasi's economy runs on pilgrimage. The ritual to learn one's true name is expensive—the preparation alone costs more than most commoners earn in a year, and the full process can take weeks of supported stay. The Velwey don't apologize for this. The service they offer is literally invaluable: eternal survival versus permanent annihilation.

**The Pilgrim Trade**: Wealthy nobles, paranoid mages, dying merchants, ambitious heirs—anyone with enough resources and enough need makes the journey. The pilgrims bring gold, and that gold pays for everything Movasi can't produce itself.

**Regulated Exports**: The psychoactive compounds from the Dream Jungle are valuable beyond the island, but the Velwey control their distribution carefully. Sacramental preparations are never sold—they're only used in authorized rituals. Lesser preparations and clarity tonics can be purchased, but export quantities are limited. The Velwey have no interest in competing with recreational drug markets; they're protecting a sacred industry.

**The Harvest**: Banguna village processes the raw materials, and this work employs a significant portion of the non-Velwey population. The labor is skilled but dangerous, and workers are compensated well enough that volunteers continue arriving despite the known risks.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

The Velwey maintain no standing army. They don't need one.

**The Jungle Defense**: Any force attempting to invade Movasi would have to march through the Dream Jungle. Without Velwey guidance and preparation, the psychedelic effects would shatter unit cohesion within days. Soldiers would turn on each other, wander off into the deep jungle, or simply sit down and stop responding. The jungle itself is the island's primary defense.

**The Pilgrim Shield**: Movasi's clientele includes the wealthy and powerful from every nation in the known world. An attack on the island would be an attack on the interests of nobles, merchants, and rulers who've invested heavily in their own true names—or plan to. No one wants to be the kingdom that interrupted the sacred pilgrimage of a dozen other nations' elite.

**Temple Guards**: The Velwey do maintain a small force of trained guards to handle disputes, protect the Pool, and occasionally deal with pilgrims who become dangerous during bad trips. These guards are equipped with clarity tonics that let them function at full capacity in the jungle's influence—a significant advantage over anyone else on the island.

### Geography

**Location**: Southeastern Greenwater Isles, between the Gulf of Norag and the Sea of Spiders

**Biomes**: Tropical psychedelic forest (Dream Jungle), coastal mangroves, swampy meadows

**Named Entities**: The Dream Jungle, The Pool of Names, Telugai Bay

**Rivers & Lakes**: The Pool of Names (depth unknown), various small streams

**Adjacent Waters**: Gulf of Norag (northeast), Sea of Spiders (southeast), Telugai Bay (south)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Moura
**Cities**: None (Moura is the only major settlement)
**Towns**: Holik
**Villages**: Banguna, Kung, Dreftwaf, Trusiin

The island's political geography follows the pilgrim circuit rather than conventional settlement patterns. Holik serves as the entry point, Dreftwaf as preparation grounds, Moura as the sacred center, and Trusiin as the integration site. Banguna exists to support the harvest; Kung exists in deliberate separation from the system.

### Relations

**Trade Partners**: Movasi trades with anyone who comes to trade. Ships from across the Greenwater Isles, from Upoceax, from Rimihuica—all dock at Holik. The Velwey maintain strict neutrality in external conflicts; they serve anyone who can pay.

**Protected Status**: No nation openly threatens Movasi. Too many powerful people have too much invested in maintaining access. This isn't formal diplomacy—it's the natural result of building a service that the elite of every nation desperately want.

**Roule**: The nearest neighbor, the halfling island to the southwest. Roule handles much of the shipping that connects Movasi to the wider world. Relations are cordial and commercially valuable to both sides.

**The Wider Greenwater Isles**: Movasi participates minimally in regional politics. They attend councils when invited, maintain diplomatic courtesies, and otherwise stay out of the archipelago's conflicts.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Solis Question**: The ruins on the northeast peninsula predate the Velwey. Something there understands true names differently—or was the original source of the Pool's power. The Council of Guides doesn't discuss Solis, but younger priests increasingly ask questions. What did the Velwey really find when they came to Movasi? What did they take? What did they disturb?

**The Kung Heresy**: The skeptics in Kung practice older methods of seeking true names—longer, harder, without Velwey intermediaries. They claim the Pool ritual has been corrupted, optimized for throughput rather than truth. The Council dismisses them as reckless mystics, but their existence is an ongoing challenge to Velwey authority. If names can be found without the Pool, what does that mean for the system built around it?

**The Confidentiality Paradox**: The ritual is designed so priests never learn pilgrims' true names. But some pilgrims suspect this is a comforting lie. The paranoid ones speak their revealed name to no one—defeating the purpose of learning it. Others wonder: if the Pool itself "knows" every name ever revealed in it, what would happen if someone found a way to ask it?

**The One-in-Fifty**: The Pool claims approximately one in fifty pilgrims. Their bodies are never recovered. The Velwey call these deaths "acceptable risk" and point out that pilgrims are warned. But families sometimes want answers. Where do the lost ones go? Are they dead, or somewhere else?

### History

The Velwey arrived on Movasi roughly 1,200 years ago, though their own records are vague about where they came from or why they left. Their founding stories speak of being "called" to the island, of discovering the Pool and recognizing its sacred purpose.

What the founding stories don't explain is Solis—the ruins on the northeast peninsula that predate the Velwey by unknown centuries. Someone or something was here before. The Velwey either don't know what happened to the original inhabitants, or don't discuss it.

The modern ritual developed over centuries of experimentation. Early attempts were more dangerous—the one-in-fifty rate was once one-in-ten. The Velwey refined their preparations, their guidance techniques, their understanding of how to navigate the Pool's depths safely. Or as safely as such a thing can be.

Movasi has never been successfully invaded. The three attempts—by Upoceaxan treasure hunters in 412 SD, by Rimihuican expansionists in 891 SD, and by unknown parties in 1,744 SD—all ended the same way: the invading forces entered the jungle and never emerged.

### The Pilgrim's Journey

A complete pilgrimage to Movasi follows a traditional structure:

1. **Arrival at Holik** (3+ days): Acclimation to the island's ambient effects. Registration with brokers, selection of a priest-guide, preliminary medical and psychological evaluation.

2. **Journey to Dreftwaf** (1-2 days): Guided travel through the jungle to the preparation grounds.

3. **Preparation at Dreftwaf** (5-10 days): Fasting, lesser journeys, confession of known names, mental and spiritual preparation for the Pool.

4. **Travel to Moura** (1 day): The final approach to the capital.

5. **The Ritual** (1 night): Consumption of the sacrament, submersion in the Pool, the revelation (or not).

6. **Recovery and Speaking** (1-3 days): Physical recovery, first speaking of the name in the Speaking Houses.

7. **Integration at Trusiin** (3-30 days): Processing the implications, deciding who to tell, possibly commissioning protective bindings or oaths.

8. **Return to Holik and departure**: Exit through the jungle, departure by ship.

The entire process takes a minimum of two weeks; many pilgrims stay for a month or more. Rushing is dangerous and discouraged.

### What Pilgrims Should Know

**The Cost**: Full pilgrimage services start at approximately 500 gold crowns—equivalent to several years' wages for skilled laborers. Luxury accommodations, extended stays, and additional services increase the price significantly. The Velwey offer no discounts, but they do operate on a strict pay-what-you-can basis for those who can demonstrate genuine need and pure intention. These subsidized pilgrimages are rare.

**The Risk**: One in fifty pilgrims doesn't return from the Pool. This is not hidden. Every pilgrim signs acknowledgment of this risk. The Velwey maintain that the Pool takes only those who weren't ready—but they can't explain how to be ready, or what "ready" means.

**The Choice**: Learning your true name creates a paradox. Keep it secret, and you're safe from Deoric control but condemned to eventual oblivion. Share it, and you might survive death forever—but anyone who knows it can puppet you while you live. The Velwey help pilgrims think through this, but the choice is always the pilgrim's own.

**The Change**: Many pilgrims report that the ritual changed them in ways beyond the name itself. Some describe enhanced perception, persistent visions, or a lingering sense of connection to the jungle. Others experience personality shifts, altered priorities, or the feeling that they left something behind in the Pool and brought something else back. The Velwey don't promise that you'll return unchanged. They promise that you'll return knowing who you really are.
