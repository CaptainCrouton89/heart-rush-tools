### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Tribal confederation with war-chiefs

**Primary Inhabitants**: Danaki (minotaurs)

**Population**: ~35,000

**Stability**: Somewhat Stable (internally); perpetual external conflict

**Core Values**:

- Strength and martial prowess
- Suppression of emotion
- Communal child-rearing—no family bonds
- Berserk rage as controlled weapon

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Mercenaries, leather goods, bone crafts

**Primary Imports**: Metal weapons, armor, grain

- The Danaki economy is centered on war. When not fighting the Enti, Danaki hire out as mercenaries across northern Clueanda
- Crafting focuses on practical military goods—the Danaki have no tradition of art for art's sake
- What little trade exists comes through occasional merchants brave or foolish enough to visit, or through raids

### Military

**Size**: Large (relative to population)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory—every Danaki is trained for combat

- Children are raised communally with combat training beginning before literacy
- The Danaki berserk state makes them devastating shock troops
- Organization is loose—war-chiefs lead through proven ability, not inherited authority
- The entire adult population can be mobilized for defense or major offensives

### Geography

**Location**: Northwestern Frostmarch Peninsula

**Biomes**: Rolling highlands, sparse forest, tundra

**Named Entities**: Valley of Thagrund, Chinayaqax Munaga (forest)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Tottokzin River, Ganek River, Lakiat River

**Adjacent Waters**: Iron Strait, approaches to Northern Isles

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None—the Danaki have no permanent capital, only seasonal gathering sites

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None in the traditional sense—Danaki live in fortified villages

**Villages**: Enasshi, Yeszhi, Zerqollo, Rikki, Anno, Ildano, Vinesso, Orokabo

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Eternal War**: Generations of conflict with the Enti of Atyeska. Neither side remembers why it started; neither side will stop.
- Raids and counter-raids across the border claim lives every season
- Captured enemies are either killed or enslaved (the Enti do the same)
- Occasional pressure from Kyorda to cease hostilities, always ignored

### History

The Danaki have occupied these lands since before recorded history. Their culture evolved around the harsh realities of northern life—communities that couldn't fight together died together.

The abandonment of family bonds is ancient, practical wisdom: in a society where death in battle is common, attachment to specific parents or children is a vulnerability. Children are raised by the village, taught by whichever adults have the skills to teach, and grow up knowing their loyalty is to their people, not to any individual.

The berserk rage is both blessing and curse. In battle, it makes the Danaki nearly unstoppable. Outside battle, it makes them distrustful of their own emotions—any strong feeling might trigger the fury. This has created a culture of deliberate stoicism, where displaying emotion is seen as weakness and loss of control.

### The Valley of Thagrund

The western border of Danak is marked by the Valley of Thagrund—a defensible position where the Danaki have repelled Enti incursions for centuries. The valley floor is littered with the bones of the fallen from both sides, never collected, serving as a permanent memorial to the cost of the endless war.
