## Anarak

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Dictatorship

**Primary Inhabitants**: Anori, Oznak, Tikhaya (Humans)

**Population**: 300,000

**Stability**: Very Stable (through oppression)

**Core Values**: Patriotism, might, revenge

- Anarak is ruled by the black dragon Tepheranos, brother of Rothogomos. He is manipulative, greedy, and patient.
- The population has been brainwashed over a century to see Tepheranos as a savior rather than a tyrant. People are proud citizens; few choose to leave despite poor living conditions.
- The culture emphasizes martial prowess, loyalty to the state, and hatred of Argysis.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- The Anarak economy is largely self-contained. Tepheranos restricts travel in and out of the country.
- Heavy taxation funds the military while most people live in poverty.
- The basin produces enough food to sustain the population, barely.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Anarak military is brutally strict, powerful, and filled with some of the cruelest, most ferocious soldiers anywhere.
- Everyone serves. The military is the path to status and escape from poverty.
- The army is ready for war—Tepheranos just needs a target he can hit without Rothogomos striking while he's exposed.

### Geography

**Location**: Great basin between the Crags of Geth (south) and the Kharvorn Mountains/Argysis (north)

**Biomes**: Basin grasslands, farmland, the Black Hills

**Climate**: Continental—harsh winters, hot summers

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tephrakus (at the base of the Black Hills, near Tepheranos's lair)

**Cities**: Tephrakus, Nidzhoni (center of the basin)

**Towns**: Scattered agricultural settlements across the basin

### Primary Conflicts

**The Argysis Standoff**

Tepheranos and his brother Rothogomos are locked in a generations-long feud. Long ago, they came together to conquer Argysis and steal the dwarven treasure. Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, taking everything for himself. Tepheranos retreated to Anarak, built it into a regional power, and has plotted revenge ever since.

Neither dragon can commit forces elsewhere while the other lives. Argysis is weaker but fortified in the mountains; Anarak is stronger but has hundreds of miles of burnable farmland. The standoff continues.

**Expansionist Hunger**

Tepheranos is greedy. He wants more wealth, more territory, more everything. Anarak will invade whoever they can reach—Erasnus, Hephake, anyone who looks weak. But the Argysis situation ties their hands.

**The Goblin Raids**

Griselian goblins from the Crags of Geth terrorize southern villages. Whether genuine aggression or theatrical spillover is unclear. Either way, villagers suffer and the military can't fully respond while watching the northern border.

**Underground Dissent**

Not everyone believes the propaganda. Resistance cells exist, fragmented and frightened. Tepheranos's agents hunt them constantly, but dissent spreads anyway.

### History

Anarak used to be a free nation—unremarkable but peaceful. A century ago, Tepheranos arrived, secretly killed the king, and subjugated the people. Over the following decades, he brainwashed the population, transforming their understanding of history until they believed he was their savior, not their conqueror.

Now Anarak is a military state waiting for war. The only question is who Tepheranos can attack without leaving himself vulnerable to his brother's revenge.
