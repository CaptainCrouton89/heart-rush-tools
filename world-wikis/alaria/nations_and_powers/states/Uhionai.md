## Uhionai

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

A nation of orcs who become trees when they die—and sometimes wake again. The Uihonaii control the ancient Ryunimir Forest in the far northwest of the Wildwood, where the groves of their ancestors stand silent and watchful, and weapons carved from sacred wood carry the spirits of those who came before.

### Overview

The Uihonaii are the oldest of the Wildwood orcs in a literal sense: their elders have lived for centuries, dying and being reborn from their tree-forms in cycles that span generations. They call themselves the Wooden Men, and their connection to the Ryunimir Forest is not metaphorical. Their bloodline is bound to the trees. When a Uihonaii dies, they become a tree. When the time is right, they may wake again.

This makes Uhionai society profoundly different from other orc states. They take the long view because they have no choice—the same leaders, the same ancestors, the same conflicts echo across centuries. They're defensive because their sacred groves cannot be moved. They're patient because time means something different when you've already lived three lives.

### Government

**Type:** Grove Council

The Uihonaii are governed by a council of the Reborn—those who have died, become trees, and awakened again. Political authority flows from accumulated wisdom; those who have lived longest and remembered most guide the nation.

**The Grove Council:**
- **First Root Yorunax** — Has been reborn four times across seven centuries. Speaks rarely; when he does, others listen. His memories stretch back to before the other orc states existed.
- **Second Root Vethani** — Three lives, four centuries. The most active voice on the council; handles day-to-day governance while Yorunax contemplates deeper matters.
- **Third Root Sulthek** — Two lives, two centuries. The youngest Reborn. Still adjusting to his accumulated memories; sometimes forgets which life he's in.
- **The Waking Grove** — A collective voice representing trees that are stirring but not yet fully awakened. Their semi-conscious input is channeled through ritual.

Below the Grove Council are the Living Elders—Uihonaii who have not yet died and been reborn. They manage practical affairs and will eventually take their place among the trees.

### Culture

**The Uihonaii** have bark-like patches on their skin that grow more prominent with age. Their eyes are amber or deep brown, and their hair often takes on the color of autumn leaves. In tree form, they're indistinguishable from ancient oaks or ironwoods until you notice the faint outline of a sleeping face in the bark.

**Core Values:**
- **The Grove Is Eternal** — Individual lives are temporary; the grove endures forever. All decisions must consider centuries, not years.
- **Memory Is Sacred** — The Reborn carry memories across lifetimes. Forgetting is worse than death.
- **The Soil Remembers** — Only specific soil can support the transformation. Protecting these sacred sites is the highest duty.
- **Blood and Sap Are One** — The trees are not metaphors for ancestors; they are ancestors. Harming a tree is harming family.

**Society:** Uihonaii society is divided into the Reborn (who have died and returned), the Elders (who are nearing their first death), the Living (ordinary adults), and the Seedlings (children). Social mobility is inevitable—everyone eventually becomes a tree. Status comes from accumulated wisdom, not wealth or martial prowess.

Death is not mourned but celebrated. When an Elder feels their time approaching, they journey to a sacred grove and take root. Their family tends the new tree until they wake—which might take years or centuries.

**The Weapons:** Blades carved from Uihonaii sacred wood carry the spirits of those trees. A sword made from Third Root Sulthek's first-life tree would carry echoes of his memories and personality. These weapons are sentient, powerful, and deeply personal. They're never sold—only gifted to those who have earned the right.

### Economy

**Size:** Small
**Tech:** Somewhat Developed (in woodcraft), Undeveloped (in everything else)

**Primary Exports:**
- Sacred wood artifacts (extremely rare, only traded in exceptional circumstances)
- Herbal medicines from the deep forest
- Wisdom (the Reborn sometimes consent to advise outsiders, for a price)

**Primary Imports:**
- Metal (the Uihonaii don't mine)
- Food during lean seasons
- Nothing else—they're remarkably self-sufficient

The Uihonaii don't trade much. They don't need to. The Ryunimir Forest provides everything they require, and they've learned over centuries to live within their means. When they do trade, they prefer services and knowledge to goods.

### Military

**Size:** Very Small
**Quality:** High
**Enrollment:** Universal (but only when the groves are threatened)

The Uihonaii military doctrine is simple: don't start fights, but finish them. Their warriors carry weapons of sacred wood—swords that whisper advice, spears that remember where enemies are vulnerable, shields that warn of incoming attacks. A Uihonaii warrior with an ancestral blade is worth five ordinary soldiers.

**The Grove Guard:** Standing defenders of the sacred groves. Small in number, but they know every tree in the forest and can disappear into the woods like ghosts. They don't fight conventional battles; they ambush, harass, and wait for invaders to make mistakes.

**The Awakening:** In times of true crisis, the grove can wake. Trees that were once warriors can temporarily animate, fighting alongside the living. This hasn't happened in two centuries, but the threat alone deters most attackers.

**Weaknesses:**
- Tiny numbers. The Uihonaii cannot sustain prolonged conflict.
- Immobile assets. The sacred groves cannot be moved; if enemies destroy them, the Reborn are lost forever.
- Fire. The forest burns. The ancestors burn.
- They're terrible at offense. Defending the forest is one thing; projecting power beyond it is nearly impossible.

### Geography

**Location:** Far northwest Wildwood, the Ryunimir Forest

**Biomes:** Ancient temperate forest, unusually dense, with clearings where the sacred groves stand

**Key Locations:**
- **The First Grove** — The oldest sacred site, where Yorunax and the earliest Reborn took root. Forbidden to outsiders.
- **Waking Hollow** — Where trees on the verge of reawakening are tended. A place of strange whispers and half-heard voices.
- **The Boundary Oaks** — Ancient trees along the southern border that mark where Uhionai territory begins. Crossing them without permission is considered an act of war.
- **The Speaking Glade** — Where the Grove Council meets and where outsiders may petition for audience.

**Borders:**
- South/Southeast: Tarn (occasional friction)
- East: Grieb (distant, minimal contact)
- North: Unclaimed wilderness, eventually the Northlands
- West: More forest, eventually the Walking Forest

### Relations

**Tarn:** Occasional border conflicts. The Tarni want access to certain forest resources; the Uihonaii refuse to let them cut trees. Neither side seeks war, but young warriors from both nations sometimes clash. The Spirit Council and the Grove Council have maintained an uneasy peace through mutual respect—both cultures revere the dead, just differently.

**Hedroscobb:** Almost no contact. The Black Orcs are too far south, and they have nothing the Uihonaii want.

**Glivornax:** Distant respect. The Glivornaxi understand guardianship of sacred places. Occasional diplomatic contact.

**Shazuihn:** The boar riders don't attack Uhionai. The forest is too dense for boars, and the Uihonaii have made it clear that entering Ryunimir means war. After one disastrous raid three generations ago, the Shazuihni learned to leave the Wooden Men alone.

**Grieb:** Distant neighbors. The Uihonaii and Griebi have little reason to interact—and the Grove Council's ancient memories suggest the lakemen are best left alone.

**The Orc Moot:** The Uihonaii send representatives but rarely advocate for anything. Their concerns are local; what happens in the southern Wildwood matters little to them as long as the Ryunimir remains safe.

### Conflicts

**The Long Memory:** The Reborn remember old grudges across centuries. Conflicts that other orcs have forgotten still simmer in Uhionai memory. First Root Yorunax remembers when the Tarni were raiding tribes, before they developed spirit-sight. Some grievances never truly heal.

**The Fading Groves:** Some sacred groves are producing fewer viable transformations. Trees die but don't awaken. Is the magic fading? Is the soil exhausted? Or is something darker happening?

**The Outsiders' Interest:** Word is spreading that Uihonaii weapons are extraordinarily powerful. Adventurers, mercenaries, and foreign powers are becoming more interested in Ryunimir. The Grove Council debates whether isolation can be maintained.

### History

The Uihonaii were the first orcs to settle the Wildwood, long before the other tribes arrived. They discovered the tree-bond by accident—an elder who should have died instead woke years later from an oak that hadn't been there before.

Over centuries, they refined the bond, identified the sacred soils, and built a society around the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. When the other orc nations formed, the Uihonaii withdrew into their forest and made it clear that their borders were not to be crossed.

They've watched empires rise and fall. They've seen the Wildwood change hands a dozen times. They endure because they take the long view—and because their ancestors are always watching.

### Player Hooks

- Seek an audience with the Reborn to learn forgotten history
- Commission a sacred wood weapon (requires proving yourself worthy across years)
- Investigate the Fading Groves—why are some trees refusing to awaken?
- Mediate the ancient grudge between Uhionai and Tarn
- Protect a sacred grove from mercenaries seeking to harvest weapons
- Accompany an Elder on their final journey to take root
