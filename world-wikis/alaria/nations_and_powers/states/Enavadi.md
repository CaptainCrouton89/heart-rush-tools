## Enavadi

Tags: state, fishing, human

A poor nation of fishermen along the Seacleft Coast, Enavadi is remarkable for two things: the skill of its people on the water, and their absolute disinterest in anyone who isn't one of them. The Enavadi are not hostile to outsiders—merely indifferent. They will trade, they will provide harbor in storms, they will even be polite. But they will never consider you one of them, and they will never explain how they do what they do.

### Government

Enavadi has no king, no council of lords, no formal constitution. The closest thing to a central authority is the **Tide Council**, which meets in Edkovic when the tides are at their highest. This schedule is deliberate: only working fishermen can reliably attend meetings timed to the sea's rhythms. Anyone whose life isn't built around the water finds the schedule impossible, which is exactly the point.

The Tide Council handles matters that affect all Enavadi—disputes between villages, responses to external threats, the rare diplomatic contact with foreign powers. Its members are senior fishermen from each village's **net-councils**, the local bodies that govern daily life. Net-council membership is informal: the respected elders of each fishing family, gathering to settle disputes and coordinate the fleet. No votes are taken. Consensus emerges through discussion, and those who cannot build consensus find their opinions carry less weight over time.

This system appears chaotic to outsiders. In practice, it works because everyone shares the same values, the same rhythms, the same deep knowledge of what matters. Enavadi governance is invisible because it rarely needs to be visible.

### Culture

The Enavadi are human, with the same range of appearance found throughout the Seacleft Coast. What distinguishes them is attitude: a bone-deep certainty that their way of life is correct, complete, and in no need of outside input.

Children are on boats before they can walk. They learn the names of currents and fish before they learn to read—indeed, many Enavadi never learn to read at all, finding the skill unnecessary for a life on the water. Literacy is for record-keepers and merchants; a fisherman needs only to know the sea.

Marriage happens within the community, almost exclusively. An Enavadi who marries an outsider faces no formal sanction, but their spouse will never be fully accepted. The couple's children might be, after a generation or two, if they prove themselves on the water. Bloodlines matter less than belonging.

Religion is private and unnamed. The Enavadi acknowledge no foreign gods. They have their own understanding of the sea—its moods, its hungers, its gifts—but they do not discuss it with outsiders. Offerings are left on certain rocks. Songs are sung at certain tides. No temples are built, no priests are ordained. When a missionary arrived three centuries ago and built a temple in Edkovic, the Enavadi let him. They simply never entered it.

### The Gift of the Waters

Outsiders who visit Enavadi return with stories of impossible luck. Fish that swim into nets unprompted. Storms that split around Enavadi boats. Catches so reliable that failure seems impossible.

Ask an Enavadi fisherman about this, and they'll credit skill. Generations of training, intimate knowledge of local waters, techniques refined over centuries. This is true—the Enavadi are genuinely masterful fishermen, their knowledge accumulated and passed down with religious devotion.

But the Enavadi themselves know it's not the whole truth. Their luck is *too* good. They don't discuss it openly, but among themselves, they acknowledge that something responds to their offerings, their songs, their careful observation of taboos. They call it "respecting the sound."

What they're respecting, exactly, no one living can say with certainty. The arrangement predates memory. The terms come due so rarely that most Enavadi live their whole lives without seeing the cost. The ones who have seen it don't speak of it. The fish keep coming. The storms keep splitting. And the deep waters east of the Floss Islands remain unfished, by tradition older than any record.

### Economy

Fish. Enavadi's entire economy is fish.

The catches from Edko Sound and Prince's Bay feed markets across the Seacleft Coast. Fresh fish goes to nearby ports; preserved fish—salted, smoked, or dried by the specialists in Dijana village—travels further. Enavadi boats work year-round, varying their targets with the seasons, their techniques refined for each species and condition.

The Enavadi do not trade directly with most foreign merchants. Outsiders buy from the Stranger's Quarter in Edkovic, dealing with designated traders who serve as intermediaries. These traders are Enavadi, but ones willing to dirty their hands with foreign contact—respected for their sacrifice, slightly pitied for their burden.

### Relations

**With Linas**: Cold indifference. Linas wants shellfish from the Starfish Isles, not fish from Enavadi waters. Their interests rarely overlap, and when they do—in the northern fishing grounds—the Enavadi consider Linas harvesters clumsy amateurs who mistake money for skill.

**With Mirko**: Official disgust, practical cooperation. Mirko represents everything Enavadi culture rejects—noise, chaos, foreigners, crime. But Dijana village does quiet business with Mirko smugglers, and Enavadi preserved fish travels far through Mirko's distribution networks. The Tide Council pretends not to know. Everyone benefits.

**With Everyone Else**: Enavadi deals with the outside world through its Stranger's Quarter, accepting what trade is necessary and ignoring everything else. Foreign titles impress no one here. Foreign threats are met with polite confusion—why would anyone want to conquer a stretch of poor coastline?—followed by a quiet demonstration of how unpleasant occupation would be for the occupiers. Enavadi has never been conquered. Not because it's strong, but because conquering it would gain nothing worth the trouble.

### Notable Locations

- **Edkovic**: The capital, such as it is. A sprawling fishing port with the Great Docks, the Smoking Halls, and the Stranger's Quarter.
- **Vukaden**: Northern village known for boat-building.
- **Krizan**: Central village known for net-making and maintaining the ancient tide-charts.
- **Dijana**: Southern village known for fish preservation and quiet Mirko connections.
- **Prince's Bay**: The large southern bay, named for either a shipwrecked noble or the local slang for a big catch.
- **Edko Sound**: The sheltered waters where most fishing happens, protected by the Floss Islands.

### Player Hooks

- **The Tide-Charts**: Krizan's ancient records contain more than fishing knowledge. Patterns in the charts hint at something deeper—cycles that match no known astronomical phenomena, annotations in archaic script that speak of "the arrangement." Someone wants to study them. The Enavadi would prefer they didn't.

- **The Empty Temple**: Three centuries abandoned, the temple in Edkovic might still hold traces of whatever the missionary tried to establish. Or perhaps it holds something else now—something that moved in when the building was forgotten.

- **Prince Aldric's Heir**: A Veldoraine noble has rediscovered the old claim to "Prince Aldric of the Enavadi Shore." They want their ancestor's remains returned. They want acknowledgment. They might even want territory. The Enavadi find this amusing, for now.

- **The Deep Taboo**: What lives in the waters east of the Floss Islands? Why do the Enavadi never fish there? Someone foolish, desperate, or curious enough might try to find out.
