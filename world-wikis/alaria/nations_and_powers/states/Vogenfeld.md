## Vogenfeld

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council of Thanes (dwarven elders)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Uline Dwarves (Chain Dwarves)

**Population**: ~12,000

**Stability**: Stable internally, increasingly resentful of Tarkhon

**Core Values**: Duty, tradition, defense, memory, the old oaths

- Vogenfeld is governed by the **Council of Thanes**—the eldest and most respected dwarves from each of the three settlements. Major decisions require consensus. Minor decisions fall to local authority.
- The Uline of Vogenfeld are "chain dwarves"—underground dwellers who use elaborate systems of chain-operated air vents to survive in the deep. They're rough, tough, pragmatic, and stubborn beyond measure. They've done things the same way for thousands of years. Change is not welcome.
- Every Uline child learns to fight. The monsters of the deep—shadereavers and worse—are a constant threat in the tunnels. Iron blades and hammers are part of daily life.
- The Vogenfeld dwarves consider themselves Tarkhon's shield. For centuries, they've watched the northern passes, sending patrols into the Wildwood, keeping vigil against the orcish hordes of Hedroscobb. This duty defines them.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (mining, metallurgy, fortification)

**Primary Exports**: Iron, weapons, armor, gems

**Primary Imports**: Food, cloth, luxuries

- Vogenfeld's economy is based on mining and metalwork. The mountains are rich in iron and gems; the dwarves extract both and trade the surplus.
- Most trade goes south to Tarkhon—iron for Nektuna's shipyards, weapons for its armies, gems for its nobles. In return, Vogenfeld receives food (the mountains don't support agriculture) and manufactured goods.
- The trade is necessary but insufficient. Vogenfeld survives; it doesn't prosper. The dwarves remember when Tarkhon paid properly for their service.

### Military

**Size**: Medium (for population)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all adults trained)

- Every Uline is a warrior. Children train from young ages to wield the heavy iron blades and hammers that are the dwarven signature. By adulthood, every dwarf can fight.
- The **Vogenfeld Guard** is the professional force—~2,000 warriors who do nothing but patrol, train, and watch. They rotate through the surface patrols that scan the northern forests.
- In emergencies, the entire adult population can mobilize—perhaps 8,000 warriors, armed with dwarf-forged iron and fighting from prepared positions in mountain tunnels.

### Geography

**Location**: The mountains between Tarkhon and Hedroscobb, north of the Wurn Mountains

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, underground caverns, fortified passes

**Climate**: Alpine on the surface; controlled underground

**Named Features**: The three settlements, the Pass of Oaths, countless unnamed tunnels

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (council rotates between settlements)

**Settlements**: Atlangsow, Kaisa, Glashof

### The Three Settlements

**Atlangsow**
The westernmost and largest settlement, home to perhaps 5,000 dwarves. Built into a mountain that overlooks the main pass between Tarkhon and the Wildwood. This is where the Council of Thanes most often meets.

**Kaisa**
The central settlement, smaller but strategically vital. Kaisa's tunnels extend furthest north—scouts from here can emerge in the Wildwood itself, watching orc movements without being seen.

**Glashof**
The easternmost settlement, controlling the approaches from the Wurn Mountains. Glashof maintains the closest ties to the Stone Men who live in the Wurns—not friendship exactly, but mutual respect between mountain peoples.

### The Vogenfeld Pact

Centuries ago, when Tarkhon was young and the orcish threat was real, the empire made a pact with the Uline of Vogenfeld.

The terms were simple:
- The dwarves would hold the northern passes
- They would patrol the Wildwood's edge
- They would warn Tarkhon of any orcish movement
- They would fight and die if the orcs came south

In exchange:
- Tarkhon would pay tribute—gold, food, supplies
- Tarkhon would honor the dwarves as defenders of civilization
- Tarkhon would remember the sacrifices made

For centuries, the dwarves kept their oath. Generations lived and died on the northern watch. The stone tablets in Atlangsow list every dwarf who fell fighting orcs—thousands of names, carved in iron-hard tradition.

The orcs stopped coming. The great invasions ended. The tribal states of Hedroscobb turned inward, fighting each other instead of pushing south.

And Tarkhon forgot.

### The Broken Promise

The tribute payments have dwindled over generations. What was once substantial is now insulting. What was once paid with respect is now paid with resentment.

Young humans in Tarkhetan ask: "Why are we paying dwarves to sit in mountains and drink?"

The dwarves have a different question: "Why have we held this watch for centuries while Tarkhon grows rich and forgets?"

The current Council of Thanes is divided:
- **Thane Gorveth of Atlangsow** (eldest) counsels patience. The pact is the pact. The dwarves swore to hold the passes, and they will hold them.
- **Thane Brunhild of Kaisa** argues for renegotiation. Tarkhon should be reminded what the dwarves do and why it matters.
- **Thane Keldris of Glashof** (youngest) speaks what others only think: Why should Vogenfeld keep an oath that Tarkhon has already broken?

### The Northern Threat

The orcs of Hedroscobb are not gone. They've merely turned their violence inward.

Six great tribal states dominate the Wildwood:
- **Glivornax** — directly north of Vogenfeld
- **Tarn** — northeast, around the central lakes
- **Grieb** — east, near the swamps
- **Uhionai/Ryunimir** — northwest, in the deep forest
- And others whose names the dwarves track carefully

These states war constantly among themselves. Territory, resources, honor—the reasons shift but the fighting never stops. This is why they haven't pushed south in centuries. They're too busy killing each other.

But the dwarves remember. They remember when the orcs stopped fighting each other and turned south. They remember the battles in the passes, the tunnels filled with dead, the desperate stands that held the line.

If the orcs ever united—if one warlord rose powerful enough to forge them into a single force—they could sweep south with hundreds of thousands of warriors. Tarkhon, grown soft and complacent, would fall in months.

Only Vogenfeld stands in the way. And Vogenfeld is asking why it should bother.

### The Secret Tunnels

The Uline have dug tunnels for thousands of years. The official maps show the main passages—the routes used for trade and travel. The unofficial maps show much more.

Secret tunnels extend deep into the Wildwood. Emergency passages connect the three settlements. Hidden exits emerge in unexpected places throughout the mountains.

Some of these tunnels could serve a darker purpose. If Vogenfeld decided to stop defending Tarkhon—decided instead to help the orcs—the secret passages could guide orcish armies through the mountains, bypassing the defended passes entirely.

No dwarf speaks of this possibility openly. But Thane Keldris has been spending time in the deep tunnels lately. And some of the younger dwarves have been asking questions about the northern exits.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Tribute Question**

The Council of Thanes has sent three delegations to Tarkhetan in the past decade, requesting restoration of proper tribute. Each delegation has been treated politely, promised consideration, and ultimately ignored.

Patience is running out. If Tarkhon doesn't respond meaningfully soon, the Council will have to decide: Do they continue serving an empire that has forgotten them? Or do they withdraw to their caverns and let the north take care of itself?

**The Succession Crisis**

Thane Gorveth is old—even by dwarven standards—and will not live forever. When he dies, the balance of the Council shifts. Brunhild's caution and Keldris's radicalism will no longer be moderated by Gorveth's patience. What happens then depends on whether Tarkhon has remembered its obligations.

**The Orcish Stirring**

Reports from the northern patrols are concerning. The usual tribal warfare has paused in some areas. Unusual gatherings have been observed. Someone or something is moving among the orcish states, meeting with chiefs, speaking of unity.

It might be nothing. The orcs have had would-be unifiers before, and they've always failed.

But the dwarves are watching. Because if they're wrong, and the orcs are finally uniting, the passes of Vogenfeld will be the only thing between Hedroscobb and Tarkhon.

And right now, the dwarves are asking themselves: Why should that be our problem anymore?

### History

**The Deep Past**: Uline dwarves settle in the mountains, building the first tunnels, fighting the monsters of the deep.

**The Pact** (~500 years ago): Tarkhon, facing orcish raids, negotiates with Vogenfeld. The dwarves agree to defend the passes in exchange for tribute and honor.

**The Great Invasions** (~500-200 years ago): Multiple orcish incursions test the passes. Thousands of dwarves die holding the line. Tarkhon survives because of Vogenfeld's sacrifice.

**The Quiet Centuries** (~200 years ago - present): The orcs turn inward. The invasions stop. Tarkhon slowly forgets. The tribute dwindles.

**The Present**: Vogenfeld keeps the watch, but resentment builds. The Council debates whether the Pact still binds them. In the north, something stirs among the orcs.
