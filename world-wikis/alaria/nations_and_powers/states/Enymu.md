## Enymu

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (majority), Craven (substantial minority)

**Population**: ~350,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, hard work, loyalty, simplicity, the old ways

- Enymu is ruled by **King Aldric IV**, the latest in a dynasty that has held the throne for over four hundred years. The Aldric kings are known for two things: their honor and their naivety. They keep their word, treat their subjects fairly, and somehow never quite understand that others don't share these values.
- The population is predominantly human farmers, with a substantial Craven minority. Unlike Nektuna, where Craven often face discrimination, Enymu has a long tradition of treating Craven as equals—a policy that began centuries ago when a Craven saved an Aldric king's life.
- Enymu is the breadbasket of Tarkhon. Its farms feed Nektuna's cities, its grain fills Tarkhetan's warehouses, its wool clothes the empire's soldiers. The Enymese do the work. Nektuna takes the profit. This has always been the arrangement.
- The Enymese are proud of their honesty, their work ethic, and their king. They're also quietly resentful of Nektuna's wealth, Tarkhetan's arrogance, and the sneaking suspicion that they're being exploited. But they're loyal. For now.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Simple (agricultural)

**Primary Exports**: Grain, wool, livestock, timber

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, luxury items, manufactured products

- Enymu's economy is almost entirely agricultural. Vast farms spread across the central lowlands, producing grain, vegetables, and fodder. Sheep graze the northern hills. Timber comes from the eastern forests (carefully managed—the Enymese remember what happened to the Stone Forest).
- The wealth flows out. Enymu sells cheap and buys dear. Nektuna's merchants pay what they want for Enymu grain, then charge what they want for Enymu's imports. The Enymese know they're being squeezed. They accept it because the alternative is worse.
- There are no leylines in Enymu, no magical resources, no strategic chokepoints. The land is all they have. They work it hard.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Conscription with professional core

- Enymu maintains a respectable army—not as professional as Nektuna's, but larger than its wealth would suggest. The Enymese take defense seriously.
- The core is a professional force of ~5,000 soldiers, supplemented by militia that can raise another 15,000 in emergencies. Every village maintains a trained band. Farmers drill during the slow seasons.
- This military tradition stems from Enymu's position: bordered by the Stone Forest (which must be guarded), the Wurn Mountains (which occasionally produce trouble), and Nektuna (which must be reminded that Enymu is not helpless).
- Enymu also provides conscripts for Ekfusy fortress on Midton Island—a duty the Enymese resent but fulfill.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Tarkhon, east of Nektuna, south of the Wurn Mountains

**Biomes**: Fertile farmland, rolling hills, managed forests, the Stone Forest (forbidden)

**Climate**: Temperate continental—warm summers, cold winters, reliable rainfall

**Named Features**: The Stone Forest (western border), Wurn Mountains (northern border), the Greenway (main road to Tarkhetan)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Aldrichold

**Major Cities**: None (Aldrichold is barely a city)

**Towns**: Numerous farming communities, none particularly large

### Aldrichold

The capital of Enymu is less a city than a large town that happens to contain the king's residence.

Aldrichold sits at the junction of the Greenway (the main road to Tarkhetan) and the river that waters the central farmlands. Perhaps 15,000 people live here—merchants, craftsmen, administrators, and the royal household.

The palace is modest by Tarkhon standards—a fortified manor house that has been expanded over centuries, comfortable rather than grand. The Aldric kings have never seen the point of ostentation. The money is better spent on roads, granaries, and the army.

Visitors from Nektuna often find Aldrichold quaint. The Enymese find Tarkhetan vulgar. Neither opinion changes anyone's behavior.

### King Aldric IV

The current king is forty-one years old and has ruled for eighteen years. He is, like his ancestors, honorable, hardworking, and dangerously naive.

Aldric genuinely believes that people generally mean what they say. He trusts written agreements. He assumes that if he treats others fairly, they will treat him fairly in return. This makes him an excellent ruler for his own people and a terrible negotiator with Nektuna.

**Appearance**: Tall, weathered, with the calloused hands of someone who still works his own fields occasionally. Brown hair, honest eyes, a face that can't hide what he's thinking.

**Family**: Married to Queen Sera (a minor Enymese noble). Three children: Prince Aldric (the heir, 17), Princess Maren (14), Prince Tomlen (11).

**Governing style**: Aldric rules personally, meeting with subjects, settling disputes, and generally trying to be the king he thinks his ancestors were. His advisors handle the details he finds boring—which unfortunately includes most diplomacy with Tarkhetan.

**Greatest weakness**: He believes King Selron II is his friend. Selron finds this useful.

### The Royal Advisors

**Lord Councillor Beren Thatch** — The king's chief advisor, an elderly man who has served three Aldric kings. Wise, cautious, and quietly terrified of what happens when Aldric IV dies and the untested prince takes over. He handles most negotiations with Tarkhetan and has learned to mistrust everything Nektuna's envoys say.

**Marshal Kira Stoneheart** — Commander of Enymu's forces, a Craven woman who rose through the ranks on pure merit. She's the reason Enymu's military is as good as it is. Fiercely loyal to the Aldric dynasty, which gave her opportunities no Craven would have in Nektuna.

**High Warden Gellert** — Keeper of the Stone Forest. His family has held this position for generations, maintaining the pact that keeps people out. He knows more about the forest than anyone living—and he's deeply worried about recent interest from Tarkhetan scholars.

### The Stone Forest

On the western border between Enymu and Nektuna stands one of Alaria's great mysteries: an entire forest turned to stone.

Every tree, every branch, every leaf has been petrified—transformed into gray stone that preserves perfect detail. Animals caught in the transformation remain frozen mid-step, mid-flight, mid-hunt. The forest is silent, motionless, eternal.

**The Pact**: Entry to the Stone Forest is forbidden by ancient agreement between Enymu and Nektuna. The pact is "long forgotten" in the sense that no one remembers the exact terms or who made it—but everyone knows the rule: stay out.

**The Titan Crystals**: In the roots of the stone trees lie strange formations called titan crystals. These crystals, when touched by sentient beings, ring out at a frequency only titans can hear—a sound that may cause **Hykravones** (slumbering titans buried deep in the earth) to stir.

**The Wardens**: Enymu maintains a force of Stone Wardens who patrol the forest's borders, turning away the curious, the greedy, and the foolish. They don't enter the forest themselves. They just make sure no one else does either.

**Recent Concerns**: Scholars from Tarkhetan have shown increased interest in the Stone Forest. They want to study it, catalog it, perhaps extract samples. High Warden Gellert has refused all requests, citing the pact. Lord Councillor Beren backs him. But the scholars have King Selron's ear, and Selron has been hinting that perhaps the pact is... outdated.

### The Craven of Enymu

Unlike in Nektuna—where Craven are second-class citizens at best—Enymu has a long tradition of equality between humans and Craven.

The tradition began four centuries ago, when a Craven farmer saved King Aldric I from assassins. The king declared that any people who would risk their lives for the crown deserved full citizenship. His descendants have honored this decree.

Today, Craven hold positions throughout Enymese society: farmers, merchants, soldiers, even nobility (the Stoneheart family was ennobled two generations ago). Marshal Kira Stoneheart is the most prominent example, but she's not unique.

This equality makes Enymu unusual in Tarkhon and creates interesting dynamics:
- Craven from Nektuna sometimes emigrate to Enymu for better treatment
- Nektuna's human nobility finds Enymu's policies distasteful
- Enymu's Craven are among the crown's most loyal supporters

### Primary Conflicts

**The Exploitation**

Enymu feeds Tarkhon but sees little of the wealth. Nektuna's merchants set the prices, Nektuna's ships carry the goods, Nektuna's banks collect the profits. The Enymese work, and Nektuna takes.

This has always been true. What's changed is awareness. Younger Enymese are asking questions their parents didn't: Why do we accept these terms? What would happen if we demanded better? The king's advisors worry about where these questions lead.

**The Stone Forest Pressure**

Tarkhetan scholars want access to the Stone Forest. They've written papers about the "scientific value" of studying the petrification effect. They've proposed "carefully controlled expeditions" to extract titan crystals for research.

High Warden Gellert and Lord Councillor Beren have refused, citing the ancient pact. But King Selron has been pressuring King Aldric, suggesting that surely old superstitions shouldn't stand in the way of knowledge. Aldric, who trusts Selron, is wavering.

If someone enters the Stone Forest and touches the titan crystals... the consequences could be catastrophic.

**The Succession**

Prince Aldric is seventeen, untested, and not obviously suited to rule. He has his father's honesty but perhaps not his father's character. Lord Councillor Beren worries that the prince might be easier to manipulate than the king—and that Nektuna knows it.

**The Northern Border**

The Wurn Mountains occasionally produce trouble—bandits, monsters, and sometimes organized raids from the Stone Men who live in the high peaks. Enymu's army handles these threats, but resources are stretched. Every soldier watching the mountains is a soldier not watching the Stone Forest.

### History

**The Founding** (~400 years ago): The Aldric dynasty established Enymu as a distinct state within the growing Tarkhon Empire. They negotiated favorable terms—or what seemed favorable at the time.

**The Craven Decree** (~400 years ago): King Aldric I granted full citizenship to all Craven after one saved his life. This policy has continued ever since.

**The Stone Forest Pact** (date unknown, predates Enymu): At some point, Enymu and Nektuna agreed to forbid entry to the Stone Forest. The exact terms and reasons have been lost. The prohibition remains.

**The Long Peace**: Enymu has never fought a war against Nektuna or any other Tarkhon state. The Aldric kings have always preferred negotiation. Whether this represents wisdom or weakness depends on who you ask.

**The Present**: King Aldric IV maintains the dynasty's traditions of honor, hard work, and loyalty to Tarkhon. But pressures are building—economic exploitation, Stone Forest interest, succession concerns—that may force choices his ancestors never faced.

### The Turning Question

The note in the old records says Enymu "could be persuaded to turn on Nektuna, but only with some difficulty."

What would it take?

- **Proof of betrayal**: If Aldric learned that Selron had been deliberately deceiving him for years, his sense of honor might demand response.
- **Stone Forest violation**: If Nektuna violated the pact and caused a catastrophe, Enymu would never forgive.
- **Craven persecution**: If Tarkhetan tried to impose Nektuna's anti-Craven policies on Enymu, the crown would resist.
- **The right manipulator**: Someone who understood Aldric's honor might be able to twist it against Nektuna—making him believe that loyalty required defiance.

For now, Enymu remains loyal. But loyalty built on naivety is fragile. And someday, Aldric IV will learn what Selron II really thinks of him.
