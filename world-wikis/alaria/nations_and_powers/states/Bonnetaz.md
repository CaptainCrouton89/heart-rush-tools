## Bonnetaz

Tags: state, city-state, sandreach, kuzagt

The city of salt and bone. Bonnetaz rises from the blinding white of the Salt Flats like a fever dream—towers of crystallized salt reinforced with ancient fossils, their surfaces carved in geometric patterns that catch the light. Beautiful from a distance. Up close, visitors notice the ornamentation is human bone.

The Kuzagt have ruled here for over a thousand years, since before humans arrived in significant numbers on this continent. They do not consider themselves cruel. They consider themselves practical. Humans breed quickly, die easily, and make excellent raw material. The Flats demand labor. The Kuzagt provide it.

To outsiders, Bonnetaz is a nightmare made functional—a slave state so methodical in its brutality that it has achieved a kind of terrible efficiency. To the Kuzagt themselves, they are simply harvesting a renewable resource.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchical council

**Primary Inhabitants**: Kuzagt (Bone Elves), humans (enslaved)

**Population**: ~12,000 Kuzagt; ~3,000 humans (city proper); ~40,000 humans (camps)

**Stability**: Extremely stable (unchanged for centuries)

**Core Values**: Efficiency, hierarchy, self-sufficiency, tradition

#### The Council of Thirteen

Thirteen bloodlines share power in Bonnetaz, each holding a hereditary seat on the ruling council. Succession within bloodlines varies by family tradition—some practice primogeniture, others allow siblings to assassinate each other for position, a few hold internal votes. The council itself operates by consensus; deadlocks are rare because Kuzagt take the long view. A matter that cannot be resolved today may resolve itself in a decade.

The council meets in the Pale Spire, the tallest structure in Bonnetaz. Sessions are closed to non-Kuzagt, and decisions are announced rather than debated publicly. Outsiders attempting to observe council proceedings have historically not been seen again.

The current council has remained stable for nearly a century—unusually long even by Kuzagt standards. Some attribute this to prosperity. Others whisper that certain elder members have discovered methods of extending their already considerable lifespans beyond natural limits.

#### Rank and Display

Kuzagt society is rigidly hierarchical, and rank is literally embedded in the face. All Kuzagt possess distinctive bony protrusions from their cheekbones—the source of their common name. These protrusions serve as mounting points for gems that denote status:

- **Unadorned**: Common citizens, laborers, craftspeople
- **Garnets, amber, jade**: Minor nobility, successful merchants, professional overseers
- **Sapphires, rubies**: Council families and their close relatives
- **Diamonds**: Council members themselves, arranged in patterns denoting specific lineages

Attempting to wear gems above one's station is punishable by death. The Kuzagt take hierarchy seriously.

#### The Human Population

Humans in Bonnetaz fall into three categories:

**The Camps**: Approximately forty thousand slaves labor in the underground warrens radiating outward from the city. They extract salt, maintain tunnels, process raw materials, and die. Life expectancy in the camps averages eight to twelve years.

**City Servants**: Perhaps three thousand humans work within Bonnetaz proper—domestic servants, skilled craftspeople, entertainers, and specialists too valuable to waste on camp labor. Their status falls between slave and citizen: permitted certain freedoms, even paid wages, but never permitted to leave. Many were born in this role; their parents were too useful to send to the camps, and they inherited that usefulness.

**Outsiders**: Foreign merchants, sailors, and traders pass through on business. They are housed in designated quarters, permitted access to trading halls, and forbidden from most of the city. Those who violate the rules are... reassigned.

### Religion & Culture

#### The Long Perspective

Kuzagt live for centuries. This shapes everything about their culture.

They do not rush. A decision that will matter in fifty years receives fifty years of consideration. Their art emphasizes permanence—bone and salt and lacquered stone, materials that endure. Their grudges endure similarly. A Kuzagt offended today may wait three human generations before seeking revenge.

This patience makes them profoundly alien to shorter-lived species. Kuzagt find human urgency amusing, dwarven grudge-keeping amateurish, and elven detachment insufficiently practical. They alone, in their view, have achieved the correct balance: passionate enough to act, patient enough to act correctly.

#### Blood and Bone

The Kuzagt drink fermented blood—not for sustenance but for ritual and pleasure. The best vintages are aged for decades in bone vessels, developing complex flavors that younger races cannot appreciate. Sharing blood wine signifies trust; refusing it signifies either insult or wisdom, depending on context.

Human leather appears throughout Kuzagt material culture: robes for the elite, book bindings, decorative elements. The Kuzagt see nothing wrong with this. Humans die; their materials remain useful. Waste offends them more than death.

#### The Calendar of Bones

The Kuzagt maintain their own calendar independent of Alarian standard, though they are aware of external dating for trade purposes. Their year is divided by the ossification of specific creatures—a cycle based on how long various bones take to properly cure. This makes their ceremonies incomprehensible to outsiders and precisely timed for them.

Major observances include:

- **The Harvest Festival**: Celebrating the annual intake of new slaves, held when the camps' population reaches its annual peak
- **The Rendering**: A ceremony of death and transformation, where the previous year's deceased (Kuzagt and significant humans alike) are processed into materials
- **The Pale Dawn**: A three-day period when the Salt Flats' reflected light creates unusual optical effects, considered auspicious for major decisions

### Economy

**Size**: Medium (regionally significant)

**Tech**: Developed (specialized)

**Primary Exports**: Salt (numerous specialized grades), bone crafts, alchemical compounds, preserved goods

**Primary Imports**: Slaves, food, water, metals, luxury goods

#### The Salt Trade

Not all salt is equal. The Kuzagt have identified dozens of distinct varieties based on mineral content, crystal structure, and depth of excavation:

- **White Salt**: Common table salt, the bulk of exports
- **Preservation Salt**: High mineral content, extends food freshness significantly
- **Ritual Salt**: Specific grades used in magical practices, commands premium prices
- **Poison Salt**: Toxic to specific creatures—fae, certain undead, particular demon types
- **Blood Salt**: Produced through proprietary processes involving human blood; used in Deoric rituals

This specialization represents centuries of accumulated expertise. Competitors can produce salt; they cannot produce the *right* salt for specific purposes. This knowledge base is Bonnetaz's true wealth.

#### The Ivory Hand

Bonnetaz does not acquire slaves directly. The Kuzagt consider such work beneath them—hunting, capturing, transporting, all terribly undignified. Instead, they purchase through the Ivory Hand merchant network.

The Hand maintains permanent representatives in the city, handling logistics while the Kuzagt focus on "productive employment." Several Bonnetaz merchants hold Ivory Hand membership themselves, participating in the organization's broader activities—including supplying sacrificial subjects for Deoric rituals across Alaria.

The Kuzagt officially disapprove of Deoric magic. They accept payment for "specialized inventory" without asking questions.

### Military

**Size**: Small (defensive focus)

**Quality**: High (specialized)

**Enrollment**: Professional only

#### The Salt Guard

Bonnetaz maintains no standing army in the traditional sense. Why would they? The Flats themselves are defense enough. Any invading force must cross a hundred miles of salt—no water, no shade, no shelter—while the Kuzagt simply wait.

The Salt Guard instead focuses on internal security: controlling the slave population, protecting trade routes, and enforcing the council's will. Approximately two thousand Kuzagt serve in this capacity, organized into specialized units:

- **The Pale Watch**: City security and camp oversight
- **The Bone Wardens**: Elite enforcers who handle "sensitive" problems
- **The Salt Sailors**: Naval forces protecting maritime approaches

#### Defensive Doctrine

If enemies somehow reached Bonnetaz, the city would descend into its tunnels. The underground network extends for miles, stocked with supplies sufficient for years. The Kuzagt would wait out any siege while the Flats killed the besiegers.

No one has tested this doctrine. The Kuzagt consider this proof of its effectiveness.

### Geography

**Location**: Salt Flats, northeastern Sandreach

**Biomes**: Salt flat, coastal desert

**Named Regions**: Salt Flats, Bone Hills

**Adjacent Waters**: Gindrik Sea

The city itself stands on the coast where the Salt Flats meet the Gindrik Sea—the only reliable water access in the region. The harbor is modest by continental standards but essential for trade.

Behind the city, the Flats extend south and west for a hundred miles before rising into the Bone Hills and eventually the Luquihn Desert proper. This terrain provides natural defense and natural resources: salt from the Flats, fossils and minerals from the Hills.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Bonnetaz (city-state, sole settlement)

**Major Facilities**: The Camps (distributed underground network)

**Key Locations**: The Pale Spire (council seat), the Harbor Quarter (trade), the Bone Hills (mining operations)

### Relations

**Ethadia**: Primary trading partner. Ethadian ships carry Kuzagt salt to markets that would never deal with Bonnetaz directly. Both parties profit. Neither discusses the moral implications.

**Gorath**: Mutual contempt. The Kuzagt view Gorathi slavery as crude, wasteful, and vulgar. Gorath views Bonnetaz as too distant and too entrenched to be worth conquering. They ignore each other.

**The Ivory Hand**: Essential partnership. The Hand supplies slaves; Bonnetaz supplies specialized goods and asks no questions about their ultimate use.

**The Free Isles**: Occasional trading, carefully managed. Many Isles populations include escaped slaves, which creates awkwardness. Bonnetaz merchants visiting the Isles do not discuss their city's economy.

### History

The Kuzagt arrived on the Salt Flats over a thousand years ago, fleeing some catastrophe in their original homeland that they do not discuss with outsiders. They found the Flats hostile but habitable—brutal summers, flooding winters, and no competition for resources.

For centuries they were a minor settlement, harvesting salt for their own use and trading small quantities with passing ships. The arrival of humans on the continent changed everything. The Kuzagt recognized a resource: abundant, replaceable, and useful.

The slave camps expanded gradually. First dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of humans labored beneath the salt. Bonnetaz grew wealthy. The council ossified into its current form. The Kuzagt achieved what they consider their ideal state: stable, prosperous, and permanent.

They see no reason to change.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Council's Secret**: How have the eldest council members survived so long? Rumors suggest the Weeping Vein—a preservative substance from the Bone Hills—can extend elven lifespans indefinitely when properly applied. But the process may require... fresh materials.

**The Underground Railroad**: Slaves occasionally escape despite impossible odds. Someone is running an escape network through the camps. The council wants them found—and made an example.

**Castle Alexandr**: The mysterious fortress on the promontory has defeated every attempt at occupation. The Kuzagt know something about what lies beneath it. They are not sharing.

**The Ivory Hand's Request**: The Hand wants something the council hasn't provided before—a specific type of "inventory" for a specific ritual. The council is debating whether the price is worth the implications.

**The Walking Bones**: Excavations in the Bone Hills sometimes uncover fossils that resist extraction. Bones that move when unobserved. The Kuzagt have learned which sites to avoid. Lately, the avoidance zones are growing.
