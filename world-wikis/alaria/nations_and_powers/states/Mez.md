## Mez

Links: States

Mez is not a nation in any sense the surface world would recognize. It is a territory—a claimed domain beneath the southwestern Widebarrow Mountains where the Lyzine hold absolute sway. To call it a "state" insults the concept; to ignore it would be suicide. The spider-folk have ruled these depths for millennia, and they consider the entire surface world a temporary inconvenience on land that is rightfully theirs.

The Lyzine are fallen nobility, or so they insist. Their origin myths speak of vast surface kingdoms, elegant courts, and a glorious civilization brought low by jealous lesser races who conspired to drive them underground. Whether any of this is true—scholars outside Ve have never heard of these supposed kingdoms—matters less than the Lyzine belief in it. They consider themselves exiled royalty, and they intend to reclaim their throne. Every raid is a step toward restoration. Every human they kill or enslave is a correction of historical injustice.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Anarchy (Competing Queendoms)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Lyzine

**Population**: 20,000 (estimated; actual numbers unknown)

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Supremacy, revenge, pleasure, legacy

- There is no central authority in Mez. Power rests with the spider queens—breeding females who command absolute loyalty from their respective hordes. Each queen rules her own domain within the warren complex, competing with rivals for territory, resources, and males.
- Succession is violent. A queen holds power until a challenger defeats her—either through combat, assassination, or the slower method of starving out her horde. The average reign lasts perhaps fifty years; some queens have endured for centuries.
- Males exist to serve. They fight, they build, they raid—and the most successful are rewarded with the privilege of attempting to mate with a queen. This is not the honor it sounds like; the process kills most participants. Those who survive contribute their bloodline to the next generation and are granted status as "consort-elect," a protected class with limited authority.
- Lyzine society is rigidly hierarchical beneath its chaotic surface. Within a horde, ranks are absolute. The strong dominate the weak. The clever exploit the foolish. Movement between ranks is possible—through combat, through cunning, through proving value—but the hierarchy itself is never questioned.

### Economy

**Size**: None (raid-based)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Lyzine silk (involuntary)

**Primary Imports**: Slaves, surface goods (taken by force)

- The Lyzine have no economy as surface dwellers understand it. Wealth exists—silk, captured treasures, slaves—but it circulates through gift-giving, tribute, and theft rather than trade.
- Lyzine silk is the most valuable substance to leave Mez, and the Lyzine hate that it does. The silk is harvested from abandoned webs and slain Lyzine by Dernish hunters; no living Lyzine would sell it. The silk is extraordinarily strong, lighter than cotton, and takes dye beautifully. Fashion houses in Shyona pay fortunes for it. The Lyzine consider the trade a desecration.
- Slaves are the true currency of Mez. Captured surface dwellers—humans, primarily, taken in raids—serve as laborers, entertainment, and food. A queen's power is measured partly by the size of her slave pens. Well-treated slaves can survive for years; poorly treated ones last weeks. The Lyzine don't particularly care either way.
- Some inter-horde trade occurs: silk for ore, slaves for breeding rights, information for future considerations. These transactions happen through intermediaries and are always temporary alliances rather than permanent arrangements.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (but refusal is death)

- Every adult Lyzine is a warrior. Their exoskeletons provide natural armor equivalent to mail; their venom paralyzes; their web glands allow them to control terrain in ways no surface army can match. A single Lyzine is worth three human soldiers. A coordinated horde is a nightmare.
- Raids are the primary military activity. A queen sends her warriors to the surface to capture slaves, seize resources, and remind the humans above who the true masters are. Raids follow seasonal patterns—heavier in winter when Dernish patrols are thinner, lighter in summer when the surface is more vigilant.
- Large-scale assaults happen every few decades, when a particularly ambitious queen unites multiple hordes for a major push. These are the events that reshape borders and fill the Boneswamps with new dead. The last major offensive was forty years ago; the next could come tomorrow.
- Lyzine fight with natural weapons—venom, claws, webs—supplemented by captured or crafted arms. Their weapons tend toward the elegant: thin rapiers, curved daggers, weighted nets. Heavy armor is rare; their exoskeletons suffice, and mobility matters more than protection in tunnel fighting.

### Geography

**Location**: Beneath the southwestern Widebarrow Mountains, extending under Dern's territory and parts of the Blood Mountains

**Biomes**: Subterranean caverns, artificial warrens, fungal forests

**Named Entities**: The Deep Warren (primary Lyzine territory), various queen-claimed domains

**Rivers & Lakes**: Underground rivers and lakes (named in Lyzine tongue; no common translations)

**Adjacent Waters**: None (subterranean)

- The true extent of Mez is unknown. Dernish maps show sealed tunnels and known passages, but the Lyzine dig constantly, and their domain certainly extends far beyond what surface cartographers have charted.
- The upper levels, closest to the surface, are contested ground—the zone where Lyzine raids launch and Dernish patrols venture. Below that, the tunnels open into vast cavern systems where the Lyzine have dwelt for millennia.
- Fungal forests light the depths with bioluminescence. The Lyzine cultivate certain species for food; others grow wild in conditions no surface crop could survive. These forests are beautiful in a terrible way—soft glowing lights, delicate formations, and always the sense of being watched.
- Each queen claims a territory within the warren complex. Borders are marked with pheromones and web-patterns that surface dwellers can't perceive but Lyzine read like maps. Crossing another queen's territory uninvited is war.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Glik (primary queen's domain)
**Cities**: None (the concept doesn't translate)
**Towns**: Tnu Kiin
**Villages**: Tsuicht

*Note: These "settlements" are not equivalent to surface towns. They are domains—territories claimed by specific queens or powerful subordinates, with populations that shift as allegiances change.*

**Glik** — The domain of Queen Thessivara, currently the most powerful spider queen in Mez. Glik is less a city than a vast cave system draped in silk, its chambers connected by web-bridges and tunnel-warrens that would drive a human mad trying to navigate. Perhaps 8,000 Lyzine dwell here, along with several hundred slaves.

Thessivara has held power for 180 years, an extraordinary span. She's survived seven assassination attempts, three succession wars, and countless minor challenges. Her longevity comes from ruthless cunning: she plays rivals against each other, keeps her consorts weak, and maintains the largest slave population in Mez as both labor force and hostage pool. Other queens hate her; none have managed to bring her down.

The great silk-halls of Glik are said to be magnificent—vast chambers lined with woven tapestries depicting Lyzine history, lit by phosphorescent fungi, and centered on the Queen's Throne where Thessivara receives supplicants. Survivors who've escaped Glik speak of terrible beauty.

**Tnu Kiin** — A secondary domain controlled by Queen Vexara, Thessivara's most dangerous rival. Tnu Kiin occupies a warren complex in the southern reaches of Mez, closer to the Blood Mountains and further from human interference. Perhaps 5,000 Lyzine call it home.

Vexara is younger than Thessivara—a mere 90 years—but ambitious beyond measure. She's been cultivating alliances with lesser queens, building a coalition that could challenge Glik's dominance. The politics are complex: some queens ally with Vexara from genuine ambition; others do so hoping to weaken Thessivara enough to create opportunity for themselves.

Tnu Kiin is more militaristic than Glik, focused on raids and warfare rather than silk-weaving and court intrigue. Vexara's warriors are the most feared in Mez—better trained, better equipped, and driven by their queen's burning desire to prove herself. If a major offensive comes, Tnu Kiin will likely lead it.

**Tsuicht** — A minor domain, almost a footnote. Controlled by Queen Mylassia, an old queen who has retreated from active competition. Tsuicht is where aging Lyzine go when they've lost the strength to fight and the cunning to scheme—a quiet backwater by Lyzine standards.

Perhaps 2,000 Lyzine live here, including a disproportionate number of elderly. Mylassia tolerates them; she has no ambition left except survival, and a large population of dependents discourages rivals from bothering to conquer her. The domain produces nothing of value and launches no raids of consequence.

Curiously, Tsuicht maintains the closest thing Mez has to contact with the surface. A handful of humans—former slaves who earned freedom through unknown service—dwell in the outer tunnels, serving as intermediaries for the rare occasions when Lyzine and surface dwellers must communicate. The Dernish know these "tunnel-speakers" exist but officially deny it.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Dern and the Surface**: The eternal war of reclamation. The Lyzine will never stop. The surface, they believe, belongs to them. Every raid is a step toward restoration.
- **The Thessivara-Vexara Rivalry**: The two most powerful queens in Mez are heading toward confrontation. When it comes—not if—it will reshape Lyzine politics for generations. The question is whether they'll fight each other first, or unite for a surface offensive that allows both to prove themselves.
- **The Blood Mountains Question**: Beneath the Blood Mountains dwell the Bloodlings—vampiric gnomes with their own subterranean realm. The Lyzine and Bloodlings have skirmished for centuries. Neither has gained lasting advantage. Some queens advocate alliance against the surface; others see the Bloodlings as prey.
- **Succession Instability**: Thessivara is 180 years old. By Lyzine standards, that's ancient. Her death—by assassination, by challenger, by simple time—will throw Mez into chaos. Every ambitious queen is positioning for the aftermath.

### History

The Lyzine claim their exile happened in an age before human memory—that they ruled great surface kingdoms when the current races were still learning to walk upright. Shyonan historians dismiss this as myth. Chimean legends, interestingly, speak of "spider-lords" who ruled parts of Ve in the distant past before being driven underground by a coalition of gods and heroes. Which version is true—or whether either is—remains unknown.

What's certain: the Lyzine have dwelt beneath the Widebarrow for at least 3,000 years. Archaeological evidence from ancient mines shows Lyzine webbing in strata predating human settlement by millennia. They were here first. They intend to be here last.

The First Breach (approximately 380 years ago) marked the beginning of sustained Lyzine-human conflict. Before that, surface dwellers and Lyzine existed in a state of mutual ignorance—the Lyzine in their depths, the humans on their mountains, neither particularly aware of the other. Deep mining changed that. Human prospectors tunneled into Lyzine territory; the Lyzine responded.

The centuries since have seen countless raids, several major offensives, and no resolution. The pattern is consistent: the Lyzine attack, the humans fortify, the attacks grow until a major offensive either succeeds or breaks against Dernish defenses. Then follows a period of relative quiet while the queens rebuild their strength, until the cycle begins again.

The last major offensive, the Silk War (40 years ago), saw three queens unite for a coordinated assault that briefly captured the Dernish mining town of Greyvein. They held it for two months before Dernish reinforcements drove them back underground. Greyvein was never rebuilt; its ruins are now considered cursed ground.

### Hooks

- **The Thessivara Succession**: The old queen is weakening. Every power in Mez—and some on the surface—has an interest in who replaces her. Players could be hired to assassinate her, protect her, or manipulate the succession for outside interests.
- **The Tunnel-Speakers**: The human intermediaries in Tsuicht know more about Lyzine society than any other surface dwellers. What would it take to meet one? What do they know? What do they want?
- **Vexara's Offensive**: Intelligence suggests Tnu Kiin is preparing something big. The Dernish want to know what—and if possible, to stop it before it starts. They're hiring specialists.
- **The Bloodling Alliance**: Rumors suggest a faction of Lyzine and a faction of Bloodlings are negotiating. If the subterranean powers unite, the surface world is in serious trouble. Someone needs to confirm or deny—and if true, to disrupt.
- **Escaped**: A group of slaves has made it to the surface, claiming knowledge of Lyzine defensive weaknesses that could change the war. The Tunnel Watch wants to debrief them. The Lyzine want them silenced. The players are in the middle.
