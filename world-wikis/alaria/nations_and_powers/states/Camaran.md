## Camaran

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Purity, law, order

- The High Camarik Council makes all laws and determines policy. Council seats are technically elected, but in practice controlled by wealthy manufacturing families.
- Camarans are industrious, educated, and deeply suspicious of anything they cannot control—particularly magic that comes from within rather than from the elements.
- Protestant work-ethic culture: idleness is shameful, debt is sin, and success is proof of moral worth. The flip side is a rigid class system where poverty implies moral failing.

### Magic Laws

All varieties of Deoric magic are banned in Camaran. It is seen as corrupting—magic that comes from within the self rather than channeled from external elements is considered spiritually polluting.

- **Hand magic**: If caught practicing, your hand is cut off. Repeat offenders lose the other hand.
- **Elemental magic**: Permitted with a license. Must register at Rathscar or voluntarily quarantine upon arrival by ship until approved.
- **Unlicensed magic**: Enormous fines, or jail time if you cannot pay.

The licensing system is bureaucratic nightmare—forms in triplicate, inspections, annual renewals, restrictions on where and when you can practice. Many mages simply avoid Camaran entirely.

### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Very developed

**Primary Exports**: Manufactured goods, textiles, precision instruments, clockwork

**Primary Imports**: Raw materials, ore, timber, food

- Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though becoming increasingly isolationist—threatening the alliance's stability.
- Camaran has a highly educated and industrious population. They produce non-magical manufactured goods used across Alaria: tools, furniture, textiles, clockwork mechanisms, weapons.
- Some of the best schools in the world are located here—strict and rigorous, producing skilled craftsmen, engineers, and bureaucrats.
- Vetoed Echea's membership in the Trade Alliance (reasons unclear, likely political).

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Camarik military is not particularly powerful, but their population is substantial and they can raise a large army quickly if needed.
- Military service is seen as civic duty—another form of productive labor for the state.

### Geography

**Location**: Northwest of Adron, south of the Kharvorn Mountains, west of the Breidlheiss Basin

**Biomes**: Temperate farmland, rolling hills, river valleys, mountain foothills

**Climate**: Temperate continental—cold winters, warm summers, reliable rainfall

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Rathscar

**Cities**: Rathscar, several manufacturing towns along the rivers

**Towns**: Scattered agricultural and mining settlements

### Primary Conflicts

**The Giant Question**

East of Camaran lies the Breidlheiss Basin, home to giants. The Camarik position is that giants are dangerous, unpredictable, and must be contained. In practice, this means Camaran runs mining operations in the basin's foothills—technically giant territory—extracting ore while insisting the giants have no legitimate claim to land they "aren't civilized enough to develop."

When giants object (sometimes violently), Camaran retaliates with punitive military expeditions. The cycle continues: Camaran encroaches, giants push back, Camaran calls it "unprovoked aggression" and takes more territory as "security buffer."

Some Camarans—particularly those who trade with the Ngül Mountain communities where Kimril and Güli giants coexist peacefully—understand the giants aren't inherently hostile. But acknowledging this would mean admitting Camaran's mining expansion is the problem, which would threaten powerful economic interests.

**Internal Tensions**

- Council members who want to relax or repeal the magic bans, arguing they put Camaran at a competitive disadvantage.
- Massive wealth disparity between manufacturing families and workers. The rhetoric of "moral success" keeps the lower classes blaming themselves rather than the system.
- Growing isolationism straining the Aldriktch Trade Alliance—some council members want to leave entirely.

### History

**The Deoric Ban**

Three centuries ago, Camaran was ruled by a Deoric sorcerer-king named Valdric the Beloved. He was genuinely popular—charismatic, generous, seemingly benevolent. For forty years, he guided Camaran to prosperity.

Then the truth emerged: Valdric had been using psy-magic to manipulate the entire population. Every citizen's loyalty, every feeling of contentment, every memory of his "benevolent" rule—manufactured. When a foreign mage broke the enchantment, Camaran experienced collective psychological trauma on a national scale. People couldn't trust their own memories. Families discovered their relationships had been artificially constructed. The suicide rate spiked for a generation.

The revolution that followed was brutal. Valdric was executed (slowly), and the new republic instituted absolute bans on Deoric magic—any magic that comes from within, that could touch the mind or soul. Elemental magic, which channels external forces, was deemed acceptable because it cannot directly manipulate a person's inner self.

Three hundred years later, the trauma has faded into cultural assumption. Most Camarans don't know *why* Deoric magic is evil—they just know it is. The bureaucratic licensing system has become self-perpetuating, a jobs program for inspectors and a revenue stream from fines.
