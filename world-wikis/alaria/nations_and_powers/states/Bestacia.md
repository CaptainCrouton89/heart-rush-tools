## Bestacia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Democratic republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Goshwen (Hill Gnomes)

**Population**: 30,000

**Stability**: Stable (deteriorating)

**Core Values**: Freedom, invention, independence, gratitude

- Bestacia boasts one of the happiest populations on Alaria. Plentiful food, rewarding lifestyles, and a culture of gratitude and contentment.
- Notable for producing great scholars in art, philosophy, history, medicine, literature, and law. Education is widely valued; institutions here are among the finest.
- Goshwen are clever, inventive, good-natured. They've never built empires or started wars—they'd rather tinker and abstain from violence.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Research, inventions, trained scholars, legal expertise

**Primary Imports**: A little bit of nearly everything

- Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. Bestacian diplomats helped secure Myorna's membership, hoping it would deter war.
- The economy runs on intellectual output rather than raw materials or manufacturing.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Bestacian military is pitiful. Most Goshwen want nothing to do with war and would rather stay home working on inventions.
- What Bestacia lacks in military strength, it makes up for in intrigue. They have sharper minds than their neighbors and play the diplomatic game well—spies, information brokers, legal manipulation, and quiet influence.

### Geography

**Location**: Middle Sea coast, between Ubrik (east) and Watar (west), with mountains along the southern border

**Biomes**: Temperate forests, rolling hills, mountain ranges to the south

**Climate**: Mild and pleasant—good growing weather

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Petra

**Cities**: Petra, Kisoy

**Towns**: Pastrova (home to one of the best law schools in Alaria), various small settlements

### The Ghoul Problem

Bestacia's forests are infested with ghouls. These soulless undead—created by ancient wizards, driven by eternal hunger for flesh and magic—lurk in the woodlands and prey on travelers.

The gnomes barely tolerate this. They can't deal with it effectively—their military is too weak, and ghouls are difficult to kill without elemental mages. Ghoul hunters pass through occasionally, but the problem persists. Most Bestacians simply avoid the deep forests and hope the ghouls stay there.

This is not coexistence. Ghouls are monsters. But the gnomes lack the martial strength to exterminate them.

### The Southern Mountains

The mountain range along Bestacia's southern border separates the country from the Telphineas Strait. Kisoy sits just north of these mountains.

The mountains are home to all sorts of interesting creatures—the Goshwen have a fondness for exotic fauna, and the peaks have become something of a menagerie. Some creatures were brought here deliberately; others simply found the mountains hospitable and stayed.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Telphineas Strait**

South of the mountains lies the Telphineas Strait—a crucial trade chokepoint. Whoever controls it can impose tariffs on shipping and effectively win the economic game. Bestacia wants control but has limited access; the mountains block easy passage, and their military can't project force.

Watar also wants the strait. Tensions are escalating. Bestacia is playing the intrigue game—diplomatic pressure, trade agreements, legal maneuvering—while Watar has actual ships.

**The Ubrik Crisis**

Silvertongue incursions from Ubrik are hitting Bestacia's eastern border. Refugees are flooding in. The gnomes are sympathetic but overwhelmed—their tiny military can't stop the silvertongues, and their communities can't absorb unlimited refugees.

**Intellectual Sabotage**

Even in good times, competition for academic acclaim leads to theft and sabotage. Scholars steal research, claim credit for others' work, and undermine rivals. It's ugly, but contained.

**Alliance Strain**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Bestacia helped build it, but Camaran is isolating, Ubrik is collapsing, and the Watar tensions are worsening. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold things together.

### History

Bestacia was founded by Goshwen who wanted a peaceful place to think, invent, and live well. They succeeded—for centuries, it's been a quiet, prosperous republic where clever gnomes could pursue their interests without interference.

They never built a military because they never needed one. Neighbors fought each other; Bestacia stayed out of it. The forests acquired a ghoul problem at some point, but the gnomes learned to avoid the deep woods.

Now the peace is ending. Ubrik is vomiting refugees and monsters across the eastern border. Watar is pushing for control of the strait. The alliance is crumbling. Bestacia's greatest asset—its minds—may not be enough to navigate what's coming.
