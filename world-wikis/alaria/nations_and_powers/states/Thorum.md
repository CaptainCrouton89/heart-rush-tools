## Thorum

Links: States

The smallest of Ve's mountain states, Thorum clings to the Steadfast Mountains with the obstinacy of lichen on granite. Six settlements, one lake, endless pride. The Thorumni are a people apart—their language shares no roots with Shyona's elegant syllables, their gods answer to different names, and their customs strike lowlanders as either charmingly archaic or barbarously stubborn, depending on who's asked.

Shyona could conquer Thorum. Everyone knows this. The Thorumni know it best of all. But the Steadfast Mountains earned their name—every pass is a killing ground, every valley a trap, and the Thorumni have spent generations ensuring that any invasion would cost more than it could ever gain. Shyona's generals have done the math. The numbers don't work. So Thorum endures: too poor to covet, too fortified to break, too proud to bend.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Elective Voivodeship

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (Thorumni)

**Population**: 8,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, hospitality, independence, ancestral tradition

- The Voivode is elected for life by the heads of the six major clans, one from each settlement. Upon a Voivode's death, the clans convene at Churup Lake to select a successor—a process that has occasionally taken years.
- Clan allegiance matters more than settlement residence. Marriages between clans require elaborate negotiations, and blood feuds can simmer for generations.
- Hospitality law is sacred. A guest under your roof is inviolate; harming them brings shame upon your entire clan. This extends even to enemies—if a Shyonan soldier stumbles wounded to a Thorumni door, custom demands he be fed, healed, and released unharmed. Then you may hunt him again.
- The Thorumni calendar diverges from Shyona's. They mark time by the Auris moon alone, considering Nyxara ill-omened. Hollownight is spent indoors with doors barred; they believe the dark moon draws hungry spirits from the peaks.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Iron ore, copper, furs, mercenaries

**Primary Imports**: Grain, salt, manufactured goods, weapons

- Thorum survives on three pillars: mining, tolls, and blood.
- The southern slopes of the Sunrise Mountains hold iron and copper deposits that Thorum works with grim determination. The ore quality is decent, the conditions brutal. Mines operate only in summer; winter buries them entirely.
- The mountain passes between Shyona and the southern states funnel through Thorum's territory. Officially, the passes are "neutral." In practice, Thorum extracts tolls from any merchant foolish enough to travel without Shyonan military escort—and sometimes from those with one.
- Thorumni mercenaries command premium rates across Ve. They're not the most skilled fighters on the continent, but they're among the most reliable: a Thorumni sellsword who breaks contract brings shame on their entire clan. Employers trust that.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all adults)

- There is no standing army. There is no need for one. Every adult Thorumni trains from childhood in mountain warfare—ambush, rockfall, the patient art of making an invader bleed for every step.
- The Steadfast Guard, a rotating militia of roughly 200 warriors, patrols the passes and maintains the border watchtowers. Service is mandatory: one year in five for every able-bodied adult.
- Thorum's defensive doctrine is simple: make conquest prohibitively expensive. The passes are studded with prepared positions, hidden caches, and terrain features that turn deadly with minimal effort. Thorumni children learn which boulders are load-bearing before they learn to read.
- In living memory, no one has tested this doctrine seriously. The Thorumni consider this proof of its effectiveness.

### Geography

**Location**: Northeastern Widebarrow Mountains, bordered by Shyona (north), Dern (south), and Meadow Sound coastline (southeast)

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, highland valleys, mixed forest

**Named Entities**: Steadfast Mountains, Dappled Forest (shared border zone)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Churup Lake, Torokovo River, Kremisch River

**Adjacent Waters**: Whisper Bay (Meadow Sound)

- The Steadfast Mountains dominate everything. Jagged peaks, treacherous passes, valleys that see sun for only hours each day in winter.
- Churup Lake sits in a highland bowl west of Dorlev, fed by snowmelt and drained by the Torokovo River. The Thorumni consider it sacred—clan councils meet on its shores, and the old Voivodes are buried in cairns along its western edge.
- The Dappled Forest marks the southwestern border with Shyona. Neither state claims it; both use it. Secret meetings happen here, duels are fought, and a hermit community tends a shrine to Melera that predates either nation.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Dorlev
**Cities**: Pichor
**Towns**: Winiza, Kiten
**Villages**: Stefanovo, Gorskiy

**Dorlev** — The capital perches in a mountain valley at the heart of the Steadfast range. More fortress than city, its stone buildings cluster around the Voivode's hall. Population perhaps 2,000. The architecture is practical: thick walls, steep roofs to shed snow, small windows to conserve heat. Visitors note the absence of inns—hospitality law means travelers stay in private homes, which locals consider more civilized anyway.

**Pichor** — The largest settlement and Thorum's window to the world. Pichor sits in the western lowlands where the mountains begin to flatten toward Shyona. Most trade passes through here; most Thorumni mercenaries depart from here. The city has grown almost cosmopolitan by local standards, which means foreigners can now find a tavern that serves something other than fermented mare's milk.

**Winiza** — A mining town on Churup Lake's southern shore. Iron and copper come down from the slopes; processed ore goes out to Pichor. The work is hard, the winters long, and the Winizani have a reputation for dour fatalism even by Thorumni standards.

**Kiten** — Guards the eastern passes toward Meadow Sound. A strategic chokepoint that has changed hands between Thorum and Shyona three times in recorded history. The current arrangement leaves it Thorumni, but Shyonan patrols watch the roads closely.

**Stefanovo** — A shepherding village in the southwestern valleys. Known for wool, cheese, and a fierce local variety of dog bred to fight wolves.

**Gorskiy** — A village below Dorlev, existing primarily to support the capital. Farms the limited arable land in the central valley.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Shyona**: The eternal tension. Contested passes, competing patrols, generations of border incidents that never quite escalate to war. Shyona's size makes them the existential threat; Thorum's terrain makes them the perpetual irritant. Both sides maintain the fiction of neutrality while preparing for the day it fails.
- **Dern**: Relations are cool but functional. Dern has its own problems (the Mez, the Lyzine raids) and no interest in adding Thorumni mountain warfare to the list. Trade flows; diplomacy is minimal.
- **Internal**: Clan rivalries simmer constantly. The current Voivode, Aleksar Gorovich, has held power for eighteen years by carefully balancing clan interests—but he's aging, and no clear successor has emerged. The next election could fracture the nation.

### History

The Thorumni origin is disputed. They claim descent from refugees who fled a great catastrophe in the distant past, finding shelter in the Steadfast Mountains when no one else would have them. Shyonan historians dismiss this as myth, suggesting the Thorumni are simply a splinter population from an older, now-vanished lowland culture.

What's certain: Thorum has been independent for at least eight centuries. Multiple Shyonan expansion attempts failed in the passes. The most serious, the War of Three Winters (approximately 400 years ago), saw a Shyonan army of 12,000 enter the mountains. Fewer than 3,000 left. Since then, Shyona has pursued diplomatic containment rather than military conquest.

The current détente dates to the Treaty of Dappled Stones, signed 200 years ago. The treaty established the neutral passes, formalized the border, and created the Dappled Forest buffer zone. Both sides have violated its spirit countless times while maintaining its letter.

### Hooks

- **The Succession Crisis**: Voivode Aleksar is dying. The clans are positioning. An outsider who wins favor with the right clan head could shape Thorum's future—or become a pawn in someone else's game.
- **The Melera Shrine**: The hermits in Dappled Forest know things. They've watched both nations for generations from their neutral ground. What secrets have they accumulated? What would they trade them for?
- **The Lost Mine**: Rumor speaks of a sealed mine in the high peaks, closed after something was found that the old Voivodes decided was better left buried. The Winizani know where it is. They won't say.
- **Shyonan Overtures**: A faction in Shyona's court is pushing for renewed expansion. They need an incident to justify military action. Someone in Thorum might be willing to provide one—for the right price.
