## Kura

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Aristocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Nuun, Yngli

**Population**: 200,000

**Stability**: Very stable

**Core Values**: Divine approval, justice, eye for an eye

- Kura must always be controlled jointly between one blue-eye, and one golden-born. Together, they balance each other out, and provide equilibrium to the country. Each has a paragon level in fire or water.
- The Nuunish blue-king wears a crown granting him the ability to produce drinkable water with his attunement.
- The Nuunish gold-king wears a crown granting him the ability to moderate the heat in a 100 mile radius.


### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Glass, information

**Primary Imports**: Animal products, wood

- The glass trade is Kura's lifeblood. The Ley Line of Fire provides the intense, consistent heat needed for exceptional glasswork—Kuran glass is prized across Alaria for its clarity and the unique colors achieved through fire-attunement techniques.
- "Information" as an export refers to Kura's reputation as a neutral ground where secrets are traded. The dual monarchy's isolation and stability make it a safe place for spies, merchants, and diplomats to meet.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Kura relies heavily on its extreme climate to deter invaders. This has been successful in the past.

### History

The dual monarchy of Kura was established centuries ago when Nuun and Yngli settlers discovered they could only survive the harsh desert by combining their abilities. The Nuun could conjure water, essential for life; the Yngli could moderate the killing heat that made the desert impassable to others. Neither could thrive alone, but together they claimed territory no one else wanted.

The discovery of the Ley Line of Fire transformed Kura from a marginal survivor-state into a prosperous kingdom. The ley line's power enabled the glass industry that now sustains the economy, and the midnight fire academy at Tul Azreitnok has made Kura a destination for mages seeking dangerous knowledge.

Kura has never been successfully invaded. The desert itself serves as the nation's primary defense—armies die of thirst and heat exhaustion long before they reach the settlements. The few attempts have ended in disaster for the invaders, their bones still occasionally uncovered by shifting sands.
