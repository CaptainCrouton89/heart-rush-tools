## Jüt

Tags: state, port, westwilds

A trading city of roughly twenty thousand people positioned on Kettle Bay, where the Westwilds coast meets the sea. Jüt is the region's window to the outside world—the only significant port on this stretch of coastline.

### Overview

Jüt survives by being useful to everyone. The city doesn't produce much itself; instead, it serves as a crossroads where the Westwilds' strange goods meet the broader markets. Seyiki gnomes bring crystal fragments and dragonfly chitin from the desert pillars. Melodians arrive with resonant wood and rare botanicals. Lacirean caravans carry spring water and Grayl-amber. Ships from the Western Isles bring metal, textiles, and everything the land-locked interior can't produce.

The city is built into the base of the Cliffs of Shondromos—dramatic pale limestone riddled with caves. The harbor is carved from a natural inlet where the cliffs recede, providing shelter from storms and a natural barrier against landward attack.

### Government

The Jüt Council consists of representatives from the twelve most powerful trading houses, rotating through leadership positions annually. Decisions require majority agreement; controversial matters need supermajority.

The system is corrupt, factional, and inefficient—but stable. The trading houses have too much to lose from instability to let disputes escalate beyond economic warfare. Deadlocks resolve through negotiation, bribery, or occasionally strategic assassination (considered gauche but not unprecedented).

Citizenship ties to property ownership or guild membership. Non-citizens can live and work freely but have no political voice—which suits most traders, since they're not staying anyway.

### Culture

**Pragmatism:** Jüt's defining virtue. The city exists to move goods between people who'd otherwise never interact. That requires tolerance, flexibility, and a willingness to overlook inconvenient details.

**Polyglot:** Half a dozen languages echo through the streets. Gnomes bargain with orcs bargain with human sailors bargain with elven merchants. Everyone learns at least two languages; many speak five or six badly.

**Rough Edges:** Jüt isn't beautiful or cultured. The architecture is functional—stone and timber built to withstand salt air, not to impress. The wealthy live in fortified compounds; everyone else makes do. Crime is managed, not eliminated; the Council considers it a cost of doing business.

### Economy

Jüt is pure trade:

**From Seyiki:** Twyl crystal fragments, dragonfly chitin, locust products, occasional Postronamas artifacts

**From Melodia:** Pipe-willow wood, unique botanicals, Melodian crafts

**From Lacire:** Waters of Vyowehr, Grayl-amber, Walking Forest herbs

**From the Western Isles:** Metal (especially iron and steel), textiles, spices, luxury goods, weapons

**From the Orc States:** Furs, worked leather, gemstones (sometimes cursed), mercenary contracts

The fishing fleet is substantial; salted fish is one of the few things Jüt actually produces rather than just handles.

### Military

Being the only port makes Jüt everyone's target.

**The Militia:** Well-funded, well-equipped, experienced. Service is prestigious—one of the few paths to citizenship for outsiders.

**The Walls:** Solid if not massive. The cliffs at the city's back limit approach angles.

**Protection Payments:** Jüt pays tribute in multiple directions—to orc states that could overwhelm them if united, to Western Isles captains who guarantee safe passage, to whoever else needs paying this year. Expensive, but cheaper than war.

**The Fleet:** Small but capable. Enough to discourage casual piracy and escort valuable shipments.

### Relations

**The Seyiki:** Primary trading partners from inland. Relations are commercial and cordial; neither side has reason to make trouble.

**The Orc States:** Complicated. Some trade; some raid; some do both depending on the season. The protection payments help, but tensions are never entirely absent.

**Western Isles:** Vital maritime connection. Pirates are a constant problem; legitimate traders are essential.

**Lacire:** Valuable but distant. The caravans are irregular, and the Lacireans are strange, but their goods command premium prices.

### The Cliffs

The Cliffs of Shondromos are riddled with caves at waterline—thousands of them, forming a honeycomb that smugglers have used for generations. The militia plays endless cat-and-mouse with operators who know the cave systems better than any guard. Officially, the caves belong to the city. Unofficially, they're ungovernable.

### Notable Locations

**The Harbor:** The city's heart—always busy, always noisy, always dangerous after dark.

**The Cliff Warrens:** Where the poorest citizens live, in structures built against or into the limestone.

**The Trading Houses:** Fortified compounds where the wealthy conduct business behind walls.

**Kettle Bay:** The broad, sheltered inlet—excellent anchorage surrounded by smuggler-riddled caves.
