## Gondurak

Tags: state, fengruk, dragons-spine-coast, forges

A dwarven kingdom carved into the Bellowing Mountains at the far southern reach of the Dragon's Spine. Gondurak is home to the Fengruk—the Forgewarden dwarves who inherited the titan-built forges and have spent millennia mastering their use. The kingdom is cold, isolated, and defined by three things: fire, metal, and an ancient debt they believe they still owe.

Roughly forty thousand Fengruk live within Gondurak's borders, concentrated in three mountain cities and the fortress of Azanfrain. The population has never fully recovered from the collapse of the titan-era support system, and the Fengruk have adjusted their ambitions accordingly. They don't seek expansion or conquest. They seek perfection—in metalwork, in craft, in the endless refinement of techniques their ancestors learned from beings far greater than themselves.

### The Three Families

Gondurak's government descends from King Gondur, a Fengruk leader who united the scattered forge-clans approximately four thousand years ago. Upon his death, his three children—Sildraz, Morgrun, and Durkarn—each claimed one of the great forges, establishing the tripartite structure that persists today.

The families rule their respective cities with near-absolute authority, while a **Council of Embers** handles kingdom-wide matters. The Council meets in Sildraz (the capital by tradition and population), with each family sending three representatives. Decisions require consensus, which makes the Council slow but stable. Major disagreements are rare; the families learned long ago that civil conflict serves no one when existential threats lurk to the south.

The current family heads:
- **Theldris Sildraz** (female, 340 years) — Cautious, traditionalist, obsessed with maintaining the World Forge's reputation
- **Kornath Durkarn** (male, 285 years) — Ambitious, experimental, pushing dragon-bone techniques into new applications
- **Yeva Morgrun** (female, 310 years) — Secretive, scholarly, rumored to communicate with entities through Malstaric ash rituals

Succession within each family follows complex rules involving craft-testing, Council approval, and demonstrations of leadership during the winter watch rotations. Political marriages between families are common but don't merge the lines—children belong to their mother's family.

### Geography and Climate

The Bellowing Mountains occupy the southeastern Dragon's Spine, rising between the Hills of Sarrow to the north and the Pale Peaks to the south. The climate is polar—winter darkness lasts for months, summer barely reaches freezing at the lower elevations, and the upper peaks are permanently snow-covered.

The Fengruk live almost entirely underground, their cities warmed by forge-heat and geothermal vents. Surface structures are limited to watchtowers, gate-houses, and the fortress of Azanfrain. Visitors expecting impressive dwarven architecture on display find only ice-crusted rock and carefully hidden doorways; the real architecture is inside, where the heat allows it.

The mountains are volcanic in origin, providing both the heat that powers the forges and the exotic minerals that make Fengruk metalwork unique. The titans chose this location deliberately. The Fengruk have simply maintained what their predecessors built.

### The Titan Legacy

The Fengruk didn't build the great forges—they inherited them. During the Second Eon, titans walked these mountains and constructed facilities capable of working metal at scales no mortal race could achieve. The World Forge in Sildraz was designed to cast pieces the size of buildings. The titans used it to create weapons, armor, and devices whose purposes the Fengruk can only guess at.

When the titans fell—including Vorukar, who died fighting something from the Pale Peaks—the Fengruk were left with infrastructure they barely understood and a support population they couldn't feed. The famine that followed devastated the Hills of Sarrow and reduced the Fengruk themselves to a fraction of their former numbers.

The survivors made two decisions that define Gondurak to this day. First, they would master the forges, learning every technique the titans had used and developing new ones suited to dwarven scale. Second, they would remember what happened in the Hills of Sarrow—the people who died because the Fengruk couldn't save them.

This combination of inherited greatness and inherited guilt shapes Fengruk culture. They are master craftsmen who believe they're still learning. They are isolationists who maintain a frontier fortress because they remember what happens when threats from the south go unwatched.

### Economy

Gondurak exports metalwork—specifically, metalwork of qualities no other forge can match. The three cities specialize in different techniques, and the combination covers virtually any commission a buyer might imagine.

**Sildraz** produces large-scale work: ship anchors, fortress gates, siege engine components, architectural metalwork. The World Forge can cast pieces that would require assembly anywhere else, and the resulting structural integrity is unmatched.

**Durkarn** produces dragon-enhanced items: weapons that hold edges longer, armor that resists elemental damage, jewelry with subtle magical properties. The dragon graveyard beneath the city provides materials that have been absorbing draconic essence for millennia.

**Morgrundar** produces shadow-touched work: items with connections to Malstaris, blades that drink light, armor that muffles sound beyond physical explanation. The market for such items is smaller but willing to pay extraordinary prices.

Trade flows primarily through the eastern passes to the Dalizi lowlands, with a secondary route to Sweivyon in the Silver Slopes. Gondurak imports food (the mountains produce almost nothing edible), timber, textiles, and raw materials the local geology doesn't provide. The trade balance consistently favors Gondurak; their exports are worth more than their imports by a significant margin.

The kingdom maintains no currency of its own. Trade operates on barter for small transactions and letters of credit (often backed by Sweivyon banks) for larger ones. Fengruk craftsmen are notoriously difficult to hire for outside work—most refuse to leave the forges for any price.

### Military

Gondurak's military exists for one purpose: defending against threats from the Pale Peaks. The kingdom maintains no standing army in the conventional sense, but every adult Fengruk trains with weapons and serves rotating duty at Azanfrain. The total military-capable population is roughly eight thousand, though mobilizing all of them would halt the forges.

The **Frostwatch** is the professional core—approximately six hundred Fengruk who serve full-time at Azanfrain and patrol the southern approaches. They specialize in fighting frostwalkers and ice wyrms, using equipment developed specifically for these threats: vibration-dampened boots, thermal lances, harpoons designed to anchor in ice-wyrm hide.

In a full emergency—a major incursion from the Pale Peaks—the Frostwatch coordinates a general mobilization. Every city maintains armories with equipment for its population, and every Fengruk knows where to report and what to do. The system has been tested three times in recorded history. It worked each time, though the casualties were significant.

Gondurak has no navy, no cavalry, and no interest in projecting power beyond its borders. The military exists to hold the line. Everything else is someone else's problem.

### Culture

Fengruk culture centers on craft, memory, and the forge-philosophy that treats metalworking as a model for all of life.

**Craft** is identity. Every Fengruk learns a trade—usually related to metalwork, but not always—and advancement comes through demonstrated skill. Social status correlates with craft mastery rather than wealth or birth. Even the ruling families maintain their positions partly through proving they can work the forges their ancestors claimed.

**Memory** is obligation. The Fengruk maintain extensive records—stonescripts carved into the mountains themselves—documenting their history, their techniques, and their failures. The famine in the Hills of Sarrow features prominently; every Fengruk child learns what happened to those who depended on their ancestors. The lesson is that power carries responsibility, and failure to protect the vulnerable is unforgivable.

**Forge-philosophy** provides the conceptual framework. Just as raw metal must be heated, hammered, and tempered to become useful, so too must individuals be shaped by hardship and discipline. Comfort is suspect. Ease is weakness. The path to excellence runs through struggle, and those who avoid struggle remain forever untempered.

Religious practice is minimal. The Fengruk acknowledge the daemons but don't emphasize worship. Their closest thing to a patron is Azus, the primordial of law—not because they worship him, but because they respect what he represents: order, structure, and the principle that things should work the way they're supposed to work.

### Relations

**Sweivyon** is Gondurak's primary trading partner. The Silver Slopes provide raw metal that the Fengruk transform into finished goods, and the economic relationship benefits both parties. Cultural relations are cooler—the Fengruk consider Sweivyon's wealth-obsessed culture shallow, while Sweivyon considers Fengruk traditionalism stifling.

**The Dalizi Confederation** to the north provides food, timber, and access to broader trade networks. Relations are practical rather than warm; the Dalizi find the Fengruk grim, and the Fengruk find the Dalizi chaotic.

**Kanzekill** and the western Dragon's Spine are deliberately ignored. The Fengruk know the dragon exists; they don't interact with her territory, don't discuss Mountainveil, and don't offer opinions on the surface kingdoms' accommodations with their predicament. Gondurak's position is that Kanzekill is not their problem unless she makes herself their problem.

**The Pale Peaks** represent the eternal enemy—not a political rival but an existential threat. Whatever lives in the south has been probing north for as long as the Fengruk have records. The Frostwatch exists because the alternative is eventual annihilation.

### The Forge Cities

#### Sildraz

Population approximately 15,000. The capital, built around Sildraz's Crown—the central peak of the Bellowing Mountains. The World Forge occupies the mountain's heart, a titan-built facility capable of operations no other forge can match.

The city spirals inward and downward from multiple surface gates, with residential quarters in the outer rings and the forge complex at the center. Temperature increases as one descends; the deepest levels are uncomfortably warm even for Fengruk. The forge itself requires teams of dozens to operate, with specialized roles for every aspect of the process.

Sildraz hosts the Council of Embers and serves as the kingdom's diplomatic face. What few foreign visitors Gondurak receives usually see only Sildraz—and only its outer levels.

#### Durkarn

Population approximately 10,000. The northwestern city, built on an ancient dragon graveyard that predates Fengruk settlement. The bones have been absorbing trace magic for longer than anyone can calculate, and the forges here specialize in incorporating this material into metalwork.

Dragon-bone crafting is difficult and dangerous. The material resists normal working techniques; it must be coaxed rather than forced. Durkarn's smiths have developed specialized methods over centuries, and they guard these techniques jealously. A Durkarn-forged dragon-bone blade can fetch prices that would buy a small estate elsewhere.

The city's atmosphere is slightly morbid—bones are everywhere, from structural supports to decorative elements. Visitors either find it fascinating or deeply uncomfortable.

#### Morgrundar

Population approximately 8,000. The northeastern city, built on massive deposits of Malstaric ash—material that fell from the shadow plane during some ancient catastrophe and has been slowly contaminating the local geology ever since.

Working with Malstaric ash requires precautions. Prolonged exposure causes psychological effects; the forges maintain strict rotation schedules to limit individual contact time. The products are valuable precisely because they're dangerous to make—items with subtle connections to Malstaris, blades that seem to drink light, armor that muffles sound beyond physical explanation.

Morgrundar has a reputation for secrecy even by Fengruk standards. The Morgrun family controls access tightly, and rumors persist about experiments conducted in the deep levels. The Council of Embers officially monitors Morgrundar's activities; how effective this monitoring is remains unclear.

### Azanfrain

The fortress at the southern edge of Fengruk territory, built into a spur of rock overlooking the Shrapnel Strait. Azanfrain exists for one purpose: watching the Pale Peaks and responding when things cross north.

See the [Azanfrain](../../atlas_of_alaria/dragons_spine_coast/Azanfrain.md) entry for full details.

### Hooks

**The Deep Sounds**: Something in the sealed lower levels of the Bellowing Mountains has begun making noise—rhythmic pulses that don't match the forge patterns. The Council wants to know what it is without opening the seals. They're hiring experts who can investigate without breaking containment.

**The Morgrundar Question**: A Morgrundar smith has defected to Sildraz, claiming the family is communicating with entities through the Malstaric ash—not just using the material, but establishing actual contact. The Council is paralyzed by the political implications of investigating.

**The Ice Bridge**: An unusually cold winter has frozen the Shrapnel Strait earlier and more completely than anyone remembers. The Frostwatch reports unprecedented movement on the Pale Peaks slopes. Something is massing for a crossing.

**The Vorukar Expedition**: A scholar believes they've found evidence of the titan's tomb beneath the Shrapnel Strait—and evidence that he wasn't entirely killed, merely contained. Gondurak's official position is that some things should stay buried. Not everyone agrees.

**The Lost Technique**: A stonescript fragment suggests the titans taught the Fengruk something they've since forgotten—a technique that could revolutionize forge-work or, depending on interpretation, destroy it. Multiple factions want the fragment, and its current owner is playing them against each other.
