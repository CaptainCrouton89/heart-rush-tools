Tags: state

pronounced "at-try(spanish "r")-**ike**"

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederation of monarch city-states

**Primary Inhabitants**: Kor, Sharabha

**Population**: 70,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Courtesy, policy, law, appearances, calmness

- Four royal families rule Atriik, each governing a different city-state
- Kor culture dictates politeness to levels viewed as absurd by outsiders—elaborate greeting rituals, indirect speech, and elaborate formal titles for every social interaction
- Social capital and one's standing in society is everything; public loss of face can end political careers
- Three city-states are Kor monarchies; one (Byonowidi) is Sharabha, and despite cultural similarity, is the source of persistent tension

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Furs, animal products, hardwoods from Sprenwood and Fatiik Forest

**Primary Imports**: Metal, weapons, finished goods from desert traders

- Forest industries dominate the west (Sprenwood, Fatiik Forest); hunting and animal husbandry in the central savanna
- Trade routes run north to Kura's glass markets and east toward the Kunagi Desert caravans

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Each city-state maintains its own militia; no unified Atriik army exists
- Sharabha cavalry from Byonowidi are considered the finest mounted warriors
- Chronic border skirmishes with Naruaghin raiders from the south

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Westrim, between the Milras Forest (north), the Dunes of Kunagi (east), the Bloodlands/Ishnit Jungles (south), and Shark Bay (west)

**Biomes**: Savanna-woodland transition, coastal forests, semi-arid scrubland

**Named Entities**: Milras Forest, Sprenwood, Fatiik Forest, Kunagi Hills, Mykala (colossal tree ruin)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Sha Puniki, Sha Ulokoni, Sha Kariki, Sha Sonisst

**Adjacent Waters**: Shark Bay (west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (confederation of equals)

**City-States**:
- **Lupuno**: Northwestern city-state near Milras Forest, controls Sha Puniki river trade
- **Byonowidi**: Western city-state, the Sharabha monarchy, major fur trading hub
- **Shinii**: Eastern city-state, gateway to desert trade, borders Kunagi Hills
- **Wykakas**: Southern city-state, controls Sha Sonisst, buffer against Bloodlands

**Notable Sites**:
- **Mykala**: Ruined fortress at the base of a colossal tree (30-mile canopy, 2-mile trunk diameter), sacred site for all city-states, contested by a druid and an Elnor

### Primary Conflicts

- Three Kor city-states versus one Sharabha monarchy (Byonowidi): despite shared values, racial tensions occasionally flare into trade disputes and border arguments
- Naruaghin raids from the south across the Bloodlands keep southern cities on constant alert
- The Mykala situation: an Elnor attempting to take control of the sacred tree from its resident druid threatens the religious stability of all four city-states
