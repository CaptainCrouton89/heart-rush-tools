## Zelidia

Tags: state

The jungle has teeth, and they are crimson-winged.

Zelidia is a theocratic matriarchy of Zelle pixies, nestled within the Kameesi Jungle on Urok's northwestern peninsula. To outsiders, it is a death sentence. The Zelle view all non-pixies as either threats to be eliminated or offerings to be sacrificed—and they have perfected both arts over centuries of isolation.

The kingdom's power flows from its High Priestesses, who commune with the jungle itself through blood-magic and ritual sacrifice. Every Zelle is raised from emergence as both predator and protector, trained in the arts of ambush, poison, and the sacred rites that keep their realm hidden from those who would conquer it. They have survived countless invasion attempts through ruthless cunning and the divine wards that shroud their territory.

Zelidia does not trade. It does not negotiate. It does not explain itself. It simply endures, feeding its hungry gods and waiting for the next fool to wander into its domain.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic Matriarchy

The High Priestesses rule absolutely, their authority derived from direct communion with the jungle-spirits. There is no formal council, no system of laws—only the priestesses' interpretation of divine will. What the jungle wants, Zelidia does.

The current hierarchy includes seven High Priestesses, each responsible for a different aspect of Zelidian life: war, sacrifice, agriculture, prophecy, warding, judgment, and memory. They convene in the Temple of the Hungry Canopy to settle disputes, interpret omens, and determine which outsiders live and which die.

Succession is by demonstration. When a High Priestess dies (or is killed), any Zelle may attempt to commune with the jungle in her place. Those who succeed inherit the title. Those who fail rarely survive the attempt.

**Primary Inhabitants**: Zelle pixies

**Population**: Perhaps eight thousand Zelle across all settlements. Exact numbers are impossible to determine—the Zelle do not conduct censuses, and outsiders cannot count what they cannot see.

**Stability**: Stable

The theocracy has maintained its essential form for centuries. Internal power struggles exist—the High Priestesses compete for influence, and the temple factions have their own agendas—but the system itself is unquestioned. The jungle demands blood, and the Zelle provide it.

**Core Values**:

- The jungle is god; it must be fed
- Outsiders are either threats or offerings
- Survival justifies any cruelty
- The blood-debt must be paid

### Religion

The Zelle do not worship personified gods. They worship the jungle itself—an entity they experience as raw, impersonal hunger. Predation, rot, venom, growth: these are not metaphors but literal divine forces that the High Priestesses channel through blood-magic.

Every sacrifice feeds the jungle. Every death strengthens the wards. The Zelle believe they exist in a covenant: they provide blood, and the jungle provides protection. This covenant has held for centuries. The one time they tried to transcend it—the Great Working at Iirmos—the results were catastrophic.

The jungle-spirits themselves rarely manifest directly. Instead, they speak through omens: the pattern of falling leaves, the behavior of venomous creatures, the dreams that visit High Priestesses during ritual communion. Interpreting these signs is the priestesses' sacred duty.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

Zelidia's economy is largely internal. The Zelle cultivate the jungle's bounty—sacred fungi, prophetic fruits, ritual materials—and craft what they need from local resources. They have no currency; goods flow according to need and religious duty.

**Primary Exports**: Technically none. However, through the shadow-market at Nox, certain goods reach the outside world: jungle venoms, alchemical ingredients, preserved specimens, and occasionally... services. The Zelle are exceptional assassins, and there are whispers that certain deaths in distant lands were arranged through intermediaries.

**Primary Imports**: Metal (the jungle provides little), glass, certain textiles, and captives. The last is the most important. Zelidian blood-magic requires blood, and the Zelle prefer not to spill their own.

### Military

**Size**: Small (by external standards); the entire population (by internal ones)

**Quality**: Extremely High

**Enrollment**: Universal

Every Zelle is trained from emergence to be a warrior. There is no distinction between civilian and soldier—only between those currently fighting and those preparing to fight. The jungle teaches: every Zelle knows which frogs are poison, which vines conceal ambush points, which calls summon allies and which warn of danger.

Formal military units do not exist. Instead, the Zelle fight as the jungle fights: through ambush, poison, psychological warfare, and overwhelming local force. Invading armies find themselves picked apart by enemies they never see, their supplies spoiled, their water poisoned, their sleep denied. The few who reach Zelidian settlements find them empty—the population simply vanishes into the canopy until the threat passes.

The wards are the greatest defense. Blood-magic has woven protection throughout Zelidian territory: concealment that makes paths loop back on themselves, confusion that scrambles compasses and memories, and worse things that trigger when invaders persist.

### Geography

**Location**: Northwestern Urok, within the Kameesi Jungle

**Biomes**: Tropical rainforest

**Named Entities**: Kameesi Jungle, Iirmos (ruined former capital)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Sovia River (central waterway connecting all settlements)

**Adjacent Waters**: Shamerei Bay (west, technically outside Zelidian control but within their reach)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Glezamos

**Cities**: None (Glezamos is more a large town than a true city by external standards)

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Nox (shadow-market), Katat (agricultural), Sookap (fishing), Yift (artisan)

### Relations

**Pyonokraus**: The cursed city-state in the Phalkrene Mountains is the closest thing Zelidia has to a neighbor. The relationship is one of mutual wariness and complete non-interference. The Zelle have no interest in entering a city from which none can leave, and whatever dwells in Pyonokraus has no interest in the jungle. Occasionally, Zelle hunters spot Ayblek at the forest's edge, watching with too many arms and inscrutable purpose. They do not approach each other.

**Outsiders**: All outsiders are presumed hostile until proven otherwise—and proving otherwise is nearly impossible. The few exceptions are traders who have spent decades building trust through the Nox shadow-market, and even they are never permitted beyond the eastern fringe. Any outsider found in Zelidian territory without authorization is captured for sacrifice.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Sealed City**: Iirmos remains a wound in Zelidian consciousness. The wards contain what emerged from the botched ritual, but they require constant maintenance, and some priestesses argue they are weakening. Others whisper that what dwells in Iirmos could be bargained with, used as a weapon against Zelidia's enemies. The faction that controls Iirmos—or survives its opening—would control Zelidia.

- **The Blood Debt**: The jungle's hunger grows. Each generation, the sacrifices must increase to maintain the wards at their current strength. Some High Priestesses advocate expansion—claiming new territory to find new sources of blood. Others argue for deeper communion with the jungle-spirits, seeking more efficient sacrifices. The tension is theological, but the stakes are existential.

- **The Outside World**: Zelidia's isolation cannot last forever. Ships pass closer each decade. Explorers probe deeper. Somewhere, someone is mapping the peninsula, counting the Zelle's defenses, looking for weaknesses. The High Priestesses know invasion will come eventually. They disagree on how to prepare.

### History

The Zelle have inhabited the Kameesi Jungle since before human memory. They claim to have always been here—that they emerged from the jungle itself, born from moonlight and flower-nectar when the world was young. Other races dispute this; the Zelle do not care.

**The Founding of Iirmos**: The first capital was established in the jungle's heart, where the Sovia River's sources converge. For generations, Iirmos served as the center of Zelle civilization—such as it was. The Temple of the First Hunger stood at its center, and the High Priestesses conducted their rites in what they believed was perfect safety.

**The Great Working**: Centuries ago, faced with yet another invasion attempt, the High Priestesses decided to end the threat permanently. They would work a ritual so powerful that no outsider could ever enter Zelidia again—a ward powered by more blood than had ever been offered. They gathered captives by the thousands. They sacrificed entire villages in a single night.

Something answered. It was not the jungle.

What came through the tear in reality consumed Iirmos in hours. The survivors—barely a third of the population—fled eastward, eventually founding Glezamos. The High Priestesses sealed Iirmos behind wards of a different kind, and forbade any Zelle from ever returning.

**The Present Era**: Glezamos has been the capital for centuries now. The trauma of Iirmos has hardened Zelidian isolationism into religious doctrine. The jungle's hunger has grown; the sacrifices have increased; the wards have strengthened. Zelidia is more dangerous now than at any point in its history—and more paranoid, more xenophobic, more certain that every outsider represents an existential threat.

The High Priestesses watch the outside world through omens and the reports of the few traders permitted at Nox. They see the great powers rising and falling beyond the jungle. They prepare for the day when someone comes for them again.

When that day arrives, the jungle will be hungry.
