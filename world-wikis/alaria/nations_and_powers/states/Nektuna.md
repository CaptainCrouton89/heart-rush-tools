## Nektuna

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal monarchy with merchant influence

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (dominant), Craven (massive population)

**Secondary Inhabitants**: Dwarblin, Trollkin, Ayblek

**Transient**: Weblin traders

**Population**: ~400,000 (Tarkhetan alone: ~120,000)

**Stability**: Stable but tense

**Core Values**: Wealth, power, prestige, naval supremacy, the eternal flame

- Nektuna is the imperial heartland of Tarkhon, ruled by **King Selron II** from the capital of **Tarkhetan**. His authority is theoretically absolute, but in practice he navigates a web of noble factions, merchant interests, and military commanders.
- The state is dominated by humans, but Craven make up perhaps a third of the population—laborers, sailors, soldiers, and increasingly merchants in their own right. Tensions between human and Craven communities simmer constantly but rarely boil over.
- Smaller populations of dwarblin (dwarven-goblin hybrids), trollkin, and even ayblek add to Nektuna's cosmopolitan character. Weblin traders pass through regularly, their caravans a common sight in Tarkhetan's markets.
- Nektuna is wealthy beyond measure but also paranoid. Everyone wants what they have. Every ally is a potential enemy. Every smile hides a knife.

### Economy

**Size**: Massive

**Tech**: Advanced (maritime, financial, magical)

**Primary Exports**: Services (shipping, banking, insurance), fire magic, luxury goods

**Primary Imports**: Everything (as intermediary)

- Nektuna doesn't produce much—it *taxes* production. Every ship through the strait pays tariffs. Every merchant using Tarkhon roads pays tolls. Every trader wanting access to Tarkhon markets pays fees.
- The great merchant houses of Tarkhetan have made fortunes not by making things but by financing those who do. They insure ships, lend money to kingdoms, and take a cut of every transaction they touch.
- **Besnoumeru**, Nektuna's second city, sits on a time leyline. Its merchants can anticipate market changes before they happen—a massive advantage that has made the city almost as wealthy as the capital.
- This economy is entirely dependent on controlling the strait. If an alternative route opened, Nektuna would collapse within a generation.

### Military

**Size**: Large (navy-focused)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Professional with conscription reserves

- Nektuna maintains the most powerful navy in the region. Ships that refuse to pay are sunk. Pirates are hunted relentlessly. The sea lanes are safe—for those who pay.
- The **Firemage Corps** is Nektuna's elite military asset. Born on the fire leyline that runs through Tarkhetan, these mages can burn ships from a mile away. A single firemage on the walls can destroy an entire fleet.
- The army is smaller but professional, used primarily to garrison fortresses and project power into troublesome territories.
- Conscription can raise large reserves in emergencies, drawing from the Craven population especially.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Tarkhon, controlling both shores of the Needle (the strait's narrowest point)

**Biomes**: Temperate coastland, Mediterranean hills, island territories

**Climate**: Warm Mediterranean—mild winters, hot summers

**Named Features**: The Needle (narrowest strait point), Tarkhetan (capital), Besnoumeru (time-leyline city), Pyris Island

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tarkhetan

**Major Cities**: Besnoumeru

**Controlled Territories**: Pyris Island, Astrelle (vassal state)

**Fortresses**: Torsnerhun (across the Needle), Fort Tenze (Pyris, ruined)

### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire and seat of King Selron II.

Tarkhetan is a city of extremes. Gleaming palaces rise beside rotting slums. Merchant princes who could buy kingdoms walk streets where beggars die unnoticed. The harbor never sleeps—ships arrive and depart at all hours, their cargoes taxed, inspected, and sent onward.

The city is built on a series of hills overlooking the Needle, the narrowest point of the strait. From the palace walls, you can see clear across to Torsnerhun fortress on the opposite shore. Between them, nothing passes without Tarkhetan's permission.

**The Old City** occupies the highest hills—noble estates, the royal palace, the great cathedral where the Evertorch burns. Here the wealthy live behind high walls, attended by servants and protected by private guards.

**The Middle City** spreads across the lower slopes—merchant houses, guild halls, respectable taverns, the homes of successful craftsmen. This is where business happens, where deals are made, where fortunes rise and fall.

**The Waterfront** sprawls along the harbor—warehouses, shipyards, sailor's taverns, brothels, and the cramped tenements where workers live. Craven make up the majority here. The smell of fish, tar, and humanity mingles with salt air.

**The Undercity** exists in the spaces between—tunnels, cellars, forgotten passages. Smugglers, thieves, and those who want to disappear find their way here. The city guard doesn't patrol the Undercity. Some say things live down there that have never seen the sun.

### The Evertorch

In the great cathedral at Tarkhetan's heart burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting over six centuries ago.

The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing eternal dominion and unbroken continuity. Emperors are crowned in its light. The most binding oaths are sworn before it. Ritual magic of time and fire occurs at its shrine.

What most humans have forgotten—or choose not to remember—is that the Evertorch is a **Neferati creation**. The same tradition of eternal flames that burns in the Kingdoms of Fire. Lit by Neferati hands, sustained by Neferati magic.

The Neferati remember.

### The Fire Leyline

A leyline of fire runs directly through Tarkhetan, its power concentrated beneath the Old City. Children born here sometimes manifest fire attunement—and those who do are claimed by the **Firemage Corps**.

The Corps is both military asset and political faction. Firemages are trained from childhood in the Citadel of Flames, emerging as weapons of terrifying power. A single trained firemage can burn a ship to the waterline from the city walls. A squad of them can destroy a fleet.

This makes the Corps essential to Nektuna's defense—and dangerously influential in its politics. The **Pyremaster**, who commands the Corps, holds a seat on the king's council. Wise rulers keep the firemages loyal. Foolish ones learn why the previous dynasty fell.

### Besnoumeru

Nektuna's second city, built where a **time leyline** surfaces. Besnoumeru is almost as wealthy as Tarkhetan—not from controlling trade, but from predicting it.

Merchants born on the time leyline sometimes develop a peculiar gift: they sense market changes before they happen. Not prophecy exactly—more like an instinct for when to buy and when to sell, when ships will arrive, when prices will shift. The **Oracle Merchants** of Besnoumeru have made fortunes from this gift.

The city is quieter than Tarkhetan, more orderly, with an almost eerie sense of calm. The merchants here don't rush—they already know what's coming.

### Pyris Island

A moderate-sized island southwest of the strait, technically part of Nektuna. Pyris is home to an old population—humans who've interbred with dwarves over centuries, producing a stocky, hardy folk who mostly want to be left alone.

The Pyrisi are farmers and fishers, content with their simple lives. They pay their taxes, send their young to serve in the navy, and try not to attract attention from the capital.

**Fort Tenze**, on the island's eastern coast, guards a secondary chokepoint—not as critical as the Needle, but significant. The fortress has been in ruins for nearly three centuries, ever since the Severance.

### Fort Tenze: The Cursed Fortress

Fort Tenze was a functioning fortress until the **Severance**—the event that ended direct Neferati rule of Tarkhon.

When the last Neferati-blooded emperor died without clear heir, the succession war that followed was brutal. Fort Tenze's garrison chose the wrong side. When the victors came to take the fortress, something went wrong.

The details are disputed. Some say the garrison's firemages lost control during the final assault. Others say Neferati loyalists performed some desperate ritual. What's certain is that the fortress burned—not normal fire, but something that left the stones themselves wrong. Twisted. The flames were extinguished, but the wrongness remained.

Three times since, the crown has ordered Fort Tenze rebuilt. Three times, the workers suffered: accidents, disappearances, madness. Equipment failed. Stones wouldn't set properly. Workers reported whispers, figures in their peripheral vision, dreams of burning.

Now the fortress sits empty. The Pyrisi avoid it. The crown has stopped trying. Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, though even they don't stay long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

### King Selron II

The current ruler of the Tarkhon Empire, forty-three years old and in the seventeenth year of his reign.

Selron is intelligent, cautious, and deeply aware of how precarious his position is. He inherited a stable empire and has worked to keep it that way—managing the noble factions, maintaining the trade relationships, avoiding the wars that would drain the treasury.

His critics call him weak, indecisive, a king who rules by compromise rather than command. His supporters call him wise, patient, a king who understands that Tarkhon's strength is wealth, not war.

**Appearance**: Average height, running to fat in middle age. Brown hair going gray. Shrewd eyes that miss nothing. Dresses simply by royal standards—he prefers to seem approachable.

**Family**: Married to Queen Vethira of Astrelle (a political match that secured the vassal state). Three children: Prince Hathan (19, the heir), Princess Lyselle (16), Prince Doran (12).

**Governing style**: Selron rules through his council, balancing factions against each other. He rarely makes dramatic pronouncements, preferring to let decisions emerge through negotiation. This makes him seem weak but keeps anyone from becoming strong enough to threaten him.

**Greatest fear**: That the Kingdoms of Fire will remember they have a better claim to the Evertorch than he does.

### The Royal Council

Selron governs through a council of powerful figures, each representing a major interest:

**Lord Gavren Holt** — Master of Coin. Controls the treasury and has the merchant houses' ear. Fat, jolly, and ruthless about money.

**Admiral Kessa Thorn** — Commander of the Fleet. The navy is her domain. Respected by sailors, feared by pirates, and dangerously popular with the common folk.

**Pyremaster Valdros Kaine** — Commander of the Firemage Corps. Gaunt, intense, speaks rarely. When he does speak, people listen. The Corps' loyalty to him is absolute.

**Lord Armund Castor** — Warden of the Marches. Responsible for land defenses, including the fortresses. Old military family, traditional values, suspicious of anything that smells like change.

**High Priestess Salenne** — Keeper of the Evertorch. Leads the cathedral clergy. Her authority is religious, but in Tarkhon, the Evertorch is politics. She knows more secrets than anyone.

**Duchess Ysmera of Astrelle** — Speaks for the vassal state. Also the queen's aunt. Navigates the awkward position of representing Astrelle while her niece is married to its overlord.

### The Neferati Legacy

Six centuries ago, Tarkhon was founded by **Neferati conquerors** who understood that controlling the Needle meant controlling trade. They brought fire magic, the tradition of eternal flames, and the military power to seize the strait.

For nearly three centuries, Tarkhon was ruled by Neferati emperors or their descendants. They lit the Evertorch. They established the Firemage Corps. They built the foundations of everything that makes Tarkhon powerful.

But the Neferati line diluted over generations. Marriages to local humans, the practicalities of ruling a diverse population, the slow drift of blood and culture. By the end, the "Neferati" emperors were mostly human—fire-touched, perhaps, but not truly of the flame.

The **Severance** came when Emperor Valdric III died without legitimate heir. His children by his Neferati mistress were passed over for his nephew—fully human, with no fire in his blood. The Neferati faction resisted. The war that followed was brief but vicious.

The human faction won. The remaining pure Neferati withdrew to the Kingdoms of Fire. The Evertorch stayed—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish. But its keepers changed.

This is why the Kingdoms of Fire stay in the empire despite having the power to leave. They don't see themselves as tributaries—they see themselves as founders in exile. The Evertorch is theirs. Tarkhon is theirs. The humans just haven't realized it yet.

And someday, perhaps, the fire will remember who lit it.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Succession Question**

Prince Hathan is heir, but he's untested and some say weak. Princess Lyselle is sharper, more ambitious—and some whisper she'd make a better ruler. Selron is healthy, but he's not young. The factions are already positioning for what comes next.

**The Firemage Problem**

Pyremaster Valdros is loyal—for now. But the Corps' power has grown over generations, and some fear what happens when a less scrupulous Pyremaster takes command. The firemages could make or break any succession crisis.

**The Neferati Shadow**

The Kingdoms of Fire have been patient for three centuries. But patience isn't infinite. If the right opportunity arose—a succession crisis, a military defeat, a weakened throne—they might remember their claim. High Priestess Salenne has noticed certain Neferati ambassadors spending a lot of time in the cathedral, studying the Evertorch's flames.

**The Naval Rivalry**

Admiral Kessa is popular. Too popular. Selron needs the navy, but he also fears what happens if Kessa decides she wants more than command of a fleet. For now, she seems content with her ships. But ambition has a way of growing.

**Fort Tenze**

The cursed fortress is embarrassing. A functional Fort Tenze would significantly strengthen the western approaches. But every attempt to rebuild has failed. Some on the council want to try again. Others say the cost isn't worth the risk. And some whisper that certain parties benefit from the fortress staying ruined...

### Vassal: Astrelle

Astrelle was absorbed into Nektuna's orbit two centuries ago—peacefully, through a combination of marriage alliances and economic pressure. The current arrangement makes Astrelle a vassal state: self-governing in internal matters but subordinate to Tarkhetan in foreign policy and defense.

Astrelle hosts two critical fortresses: **Torsnerhun** (directly across the Needle from Tarkhetan) and **Sharvatunis** (watching the eastern approach). This makes Astrelle strategically vital—and gives its duchess leverage she wouldn't otherwise have.

Duchess Ysmera walks a careful line: loyal enough to keep Tarkhetan happy, independent enough to maintain Astrelle's dignity. Her niece's marriage to the king complicates things. Is she family or subject? Both, and the tension never quite resolves.

### History

**The Founding (~600 years ago)**: Neferati warlords seize the Needle, establishing control over the strait. The Evertorch is lit in what will become Tarkhetan.

**The Neferati Era (~600-300 years ago)**: Neferati emperors rule from Tarkhetan, expanding the empire through trade dominance rather than conquest. The Firemage Corps is established. Besnoumeru rises on its time leyline.

**The Dilution (~400-300 years ago)**: Neferati bloodlines mix with human through generations of political marriages. The ruling family becomes increasingly human—fire-touched perhaps, but not truly of the flame.

**The Severance (~300 years ago)**: The last fire-blooded emperor dies. Succession war between human and Neferati factions. Humans win. Pure Neferati withdraw to the Kingdoms of Fire. Fort Tenze is destroyed in the conflict. The Evertorch stays—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish.

**The Human Era (~300 years ago - present)**: Human dynasties rule, maintaining the traditions and symbols of Neferati founders while slowly forgetting their origins. Emperors become kings. The Kingdoms of Fire remain within the empire, waiting.

**The Present**: King Selron II maintains stability through careful balance. But the old tensions remain—Neferati legacy, naval ambitions, firemage power, and the eternal question of succession.
