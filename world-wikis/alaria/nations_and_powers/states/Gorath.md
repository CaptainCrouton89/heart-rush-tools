## Gorath

Tags: state, empire, shacklands

The jungle empire. Six hundred miles of canopy, three great rivers, and a million souls bound by blood, glory, and the lash. Gorath is the largest state on Alaria by territory and the most aggressive by temperament—a conquest machine that has spent three centuries swallowing its neighbors and shows no sign of stopping. The Gorathi believe the gods placed them in the most hostile environment on the continent as a trial, and every acre wrested from the jungle proves their worthiness to rule.

To outsiders, Gorath is terrifying: a militaristic slave-state that treats war as sacrament and weakness as sin. To the Gorathi themselves, they are simply the only people brave enough to do what must be done. The jungle would consume civilization if left unchecked. Someone must tame it. Someone must rule.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Elected military dictatorship

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, Shapers, Skaag

**Population**: 1,000,000+

**Stability**: Stable (internally); perpetually at war (externally)

**Core Values**: Glory, discipline, duty, conquest, strength, assimilation

#### The Empirial Council

Gorath's emperors are not born—they are chosen. The Empirial Council, a body of sixty patricians drawn from the wealthiest families and most decorated military veterans, convenes upon an emperor's death to select a successor. By law, candidates must be generals who have commanded at least one victorious campaign. In practice, the selection process involves weeks of political maneuvering, bribery, and occasionally assassination.

Emperors serve for life, but "life" in Gorath is often shorter than one might hope. Of the last twelve emperors, only three died of natural causes. The rest fell to war, poison, or "hunting accidents." This brutal turnover keeps the empire vital—stagnant rulers don't last long.

The current emperor, **Veramus the Unyielding**, has held power for seventeen years, the longest reign in a century. His survival is attributed to two factors: genuine military brilliance, and a network of Shaper spies so extensive that no conspiracy forms without his knowledge.

#### The Assimilation Doctrine

When Gorath conquers a people, it absorbs them. Defeated armies become auxiliary legions. Conquered nobles become provincial administrators (if they cooperate) or slaves (if they don't). Within two generations, the grandchildren of the conquered speak Gorathi, worship Gorathi gods, and fight in Gorathi legions. The empire grows not just in territory but in population and military strength with every victory.

This doctrine makes Gorath uniquely dangerous. Most empires weaken as they expand—supply lines stretch, garrisons thin, local resistance festers. Gorath gets *stronger* as it expands, feeding on the armies it defeats.

#### The Three Peoples

**Humans** form the majority and dominate the upper ranks of society. Gorathi humans tend toward darker complexions and stocky builds—generations of jungle living have bred a people resistant to disease and heat. They form the core of the legions and hold most political power.

**Shapers** occupy a strange position: simultaneously invaluable and deeply mistrusted. Their silver eyes mark them as shapeshifters capable of perfectly mimicking any humanoid form, making them peerless spies and infiltrators. The Imperial Intelligence operates almost entirely through Shaper agents. But no Shaper has ever been permitted to serve on the Empirial Council, and they are forbidden from owning land. The empire uses them ruthlessly while keeping them politically powerless.

**Skaag** dwell in the undercities—the vast tunnel networks beneath Gorathi cities. The rat-folk maintain their own parallel society below ground, emerging to trade, labor, and occasionally serve as scouts in the endless jungle campaigns. Most Gorathi barely acknowledge their existence, but the Skaag know secrets: forgotten tunnels, buried treasures, and which noble families have skeletons hidden in their cellars.

### Religion & Culture

#### The Eternal March

The Gorathi faith has no temples. It has monuments.

At the center of every Gorathi city stands a **Pillar of Conquest**—a towering obelisk covered in carved names. Every soldier who dies in victory has their name added. Every acre claimed from the jungle, every enemy city burned, every campaign concluded successfully earns new inscriptions. The pillars grow taller with each generation. Azantir's central pillar is over two hundred feet high, maintained by teams of stone-carvers who work year-round.

The gods, in Gorathi belief, do not want worship. They want *proof*. They placed humanity in a jungle that breeds disease, spawns monsters, and swallows the weak. To survive is to prove worth. To conquer is to prove favor. The Eternal March is not a metaphor—it is the literal, endless expansion of Gorathi civilization against everything that would destroy it.

This theology has convenient implications. Slavery is natural—the weak serve the strong, as the gods intended. Conquest is holy—spreading Gorathi civilization is divine work. Failure is sin—a general who loses a campaign has demonstrated that the gods have withdrawn their favor.

#### Blood and Names

Gorathi mark their achievements on their bodies. A soldier's first kill earns a small tattoo on the forearm. Promotions, victories, and honors accumulate as ink across skin until veteran centurions are covered in elaborate patterns telling their entire military history. To meet a heavily tattooed Gorathi is to meet someone who has seen much death—and survived.

Names follow a similar logic. A Gorathi is born with a family name, earns a personal name at majority, and may be granted additional names for great deeds. Emperor Veramus the Unyielding was born simply "Veramus Corvallo." He earned "the Unyielding" after holding the Esteves Pass against a giant assault for forty-three days without reinforcement.

#### Festival of Chains

Held at midsummer, the Festival of Chains commemorates Gorath's first great slave raid on Tamadrez three centuries ago. For three days, the empire celebrates with feasting, gladiatorial combat between slaves, and ceremonial auctions where wealthy families purchase the year's finest captives. The festival is deliberately grotesque to outside observers—the Gorathi see it as honest acknowledgment of what their prosperity costs.

### Economy

**Size**: Colossal—the largest on Alaria

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Exotic hardwoods, tropical dyes, rare alchemical ingredients, slaves

**Primary Imports**: Enslaved peoples (primarily Drasnian dwarves), metals, finished goods

#### The Jungle's Bounty

The Jungles of Titania contain resources found nowhere else: **bloodwood** that never rots and takes dye perfectly, **witchbark** used in high-end alchemy, **azure orchids** whose essence is worth its weight in gold to perfumers and poisoners alike. Gorathi merchants have made fortunes shipping these goods north through the Divinity Passage.

But the true engine of Gorathi wealth is labor. The jungle demands workers: loggers, farmers, miners, builders. Free citizens serve in the legions—they don't clear brush. That work falls to the enslaved.

#### The Tamadrez Pipeline

The Drasnian dwarves of Tamadrez have become Gorath's primary labor source. Three centuries ago, Gorath established the **Slaver's Coast** on Pesalolo's southern shores, operating with the grudging consent of the northern Tamadrez government. The arrangement is simple: Gorath takes slaves from the south; the north remains independent. Any violation—such as harboring escaped slaves—results in fire from the sky. One northern city learned this lesson permanently.

The slaves flow north through the **Divinity Passage**, Gorath's great maritime highway. At any given time, dozens of slave ships work this route. The passage's name is bitterly ironic to those in chains.

#### The Domestic Economy

River cities along the Lucenia, Droaz, and Torga handle most internal trade. The jungle is too dense for overland commerce at scale—everything moves by water. This makes river control politically crucial. The families that control the docks control the wealth.

### Military

**Size**: Colossal

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory service, volunteer career path

#### The Legions

Every Gorathi citizen serves two years in the legions starting at age sixteen. Most return to civilian life afterward; the dedicated remain as career soldiers. This system creates an enormous trained reserve while maintaining a professional core.

The legions are organized simply:

- **Legion** (5,000 soldiers): The primary strategic unit, each named and bearing distinct colors. Famous legions include the **Jade Serpents** (jungle specialists), the **Iron Tide** (siege warfare), and the **Pillar Guard** (capital defense).
- **Cohort** (500 soldiers): Tactical units within legions, each led by a **Tribune**.
- **Century** (50 soldiers): The basic fighting unit, led by a **Centurion**.

#### Auxiliaries

Conquered peoples serve in **auxiliary cohorts**—units attached to legions but not part of them. Auxiliaries receive lower pay, worse equipment, and more dangerous assignments. However, twenty years of auxiliary service earns full citizenship for a soldier and their descendants. This creates powerful loyalty among the conquered: serve Gorath well, and your grandchildren will be Gorathi.

#### The Path to Power

Military success is the only path to political power in Gorath. The progression runs: soldier → centurion → tribune → commander → general → candidate for emperor. A man born to nothing can become emperor if he wins enough battles. This meritocratic brutality keeps the military sharp—advancement requires proven competence, not family connections.

#### Current Campaigns

Gorath fights on four fronts simultaneously:

- **The Nashua Front** (northeast): A bloody stalemate against the Ix'Vasyla lizardfolk. The jungle-to-jungle warfare suits neither side, and the conflict has ground on for decades.
- **The Giant March** (northwest): A slow push into the Thunder Plains, where hill giants and their kin resist with frustrating effectiveness.
- **The Moon Wilds** (west): An attempted expansion into Gorath's most dangerous interior region. The Vexlings have made this campaign a nightmare.
- **Maintaining Tamadrez** (south): Constant patrol and enforcement along the Slaver's Coast.

### Geography

**Biomes**: Tropical rainforest (dominant), hill country, river valleys

**Named Regions**: Jungles of Titania, Moon Wilds, Poison Hills, Purlin Hills, Bata Nujo Hills, Deserted Hills

**Rivers**: Lucenia River, Droaz River, Torga River, Myublin River

**Adjacent Waters**: Divinity Passage, Sea of Selegos

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Azantir

**Major Cities**: Esteves, Carvalhais, Pereiro, Ageito, Pombares, Velorasa, Bougado, Ranholas

**Regional Centers**: Fresta, Recarci (Poison Hills)

#### City Character

Gorathi cities rise from the jungle like stone fists. Architecture favors massive stepped pyramids, broad plazas, and walls thick enough to resist both siege and jungle alike. Every city maintains its Pillar of Conquest, military barracks, and slave markets. The wealthy live in upper levels; the poor crowd lower; the Skaag burrow beneath.

**Azantir**, the capital, sprawls where the Lucenia River empties into the Divinity Passage. It is the largest city in the Shacklands, a maze of pyramids, canals, and markets where anything can be bought. The Emperor's Palace crowns the city's highest pyramid, looking down on a million subjects.

**Esteves** guards the northern frontier, a fortress-city where the Lucenia emerges from the Myjornis Mountains. Soldiers outnumber civilians. The city exists to project power into the passes beyond.

**Carvalhais** dominates the upper Droaz, a logging and lumber center that strips the surrounding jungle for export. The city smells of sawdust and industry.

**Ageito** anchors the southeast, where the Torga River meets the sea. Newer than the western cities, Ageito grows rapidly as Gorath pushes toward Nashua.

### Relations

**Nashua**: Active war. The Ix'Vasyla lizardfolk have proven impossible to subjugate, and the conflict has become a bleeding wound for both sides.

**Tamadrez**: Exploitative treaty. Gorath operates freely in the south in exchange for not invading the north. Both sides know this arrangement exists only as long as it benefits Gorath.

**Trømgar**: Cold war turning hot. The dwarven kingdom objects to Gorath's treatment of their distant Drasnian kin. Skirmishes increase yearly.

**The Giants**: Active war. The Thunder Plains tribes resist Gorathi expansion with brutal effectiveness.

### History

The Gorathi tell their history in conquests.

**The Founding (circa 700 years ago)**: Refugees from a forgotten northern war settled the Lucenia River valley. They found hostile jungle, hostile natives, and no mercy. Those who survived became the first Gorathi.

**The First March (circa 600 years ago)**: Under the legendary Emperor Talhas the Conqueror, Gorath unified the scattered river settlements and began expanding into the Jungles of Titania. This campaign established the Eternal March as official theology.

**The Tamadrez Contact (circa 300 years ago)**: Gorathi explorers discovered Pesalolo and the Drasnian dwarves. Within a generation, the slave trade had transformed Gorath's economy.

**The Present Day**: Emperor Veramus oversees an empire stretched across four fronts, bloated with conquest, and hungry for more. How long the Eternal March can continue is a question the Gorathi refuse to ask.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Shaper Conspiracy**: Rumors suggest Shapers have infiltrated the Empirial Council despite the prohibition. If true, who are they, and what do they want?

**The Moon Wilds Mystery**: Something in the Moon Wilds is organizing the Vexlings. The creatures were once scattered and animalistic—now they fight with disturbing coordination.

**The Escape Networks**: Despite Slavewatch, slaves keep escaping north. Someone is running an underground railroad through the jungle. The Emperor wants them found.

**The Old Emperor**: Veramus is sixty-three. When he dies, the succession crisis will be spectacular. Smart players are already positioning themselves.

**The Skaag Secrets**: The rat-folk beneath the cities know things. Old tunnels lead to older places. Some Skaag whisper of ruins predating Gorath—ruins the empire has built over and forgotten.
