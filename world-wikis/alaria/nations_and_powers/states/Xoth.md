## Xoth

Tags: state

Xoth is not a nation in the traditional sense. It is a covenant—a religious contract between mortals and the daemons of Celestia that became a state. What makes someone Xothic isn't blood or ancestry; it's faith. Dwarves, humans, gnomes, and others live side by side in Xoth, bound not by ethnicity but by shared worship of the Seven Patrons.

The result is one of the most formidable powers on Urok: wealthy, disciplined, and backed by divine forces that other nations can only envy or fear.

### Overview

Centuries ago, the peoples of southeastern Urok lived in scattered communities—dwarven mining camps, human farming villages, gnomish trading posts—competing and warring in the usual fashion. Then came the Covenant.

The details are sacred history now, embellished by generations of priests. What's certain is that a prophet (whose name is spoken only in temple) claimed the daemons of Celestia would protect any who worshipped them properly. Skeptics laughed. Then the faithful started winning battles they shouldn't have won. Crops flourished where they should have failed. Plagues turned aside at village boundaries.

Word spread. More joined. Those who refused were conquered or fled. Over generations, the covenant became a nation.

Today, Xoth spans the southeastern third of Urok—plains, forests, desert, and coast. Its population is diverse: you'll find dwarven smiths working alongside human farmers, gnomish merchants in the same temple as orcish soldiers, children of mixed heritage everywhere. Race matters less than observance. The question isn't "what are you?" but "do you keep the covenant?"

### The Seven Patrons

Xoth practices henotheistic daemon worship—acknowledging many daemons exist but organizing around seven who answered the original covenant. Each patron governs an aspect of life, and each demands constant worship.

**Theros, the Blazing Eye**
Daemon of the sun, truth, and revelation. The first to answer the prophet's call and chief among the Seven. Theros sees all deception and burns away falsehood. His temples face east; his rituals occur at dawn. The Hierophant of Theros is the closest thing Xoth has to a head of state.

**Kethros, the Shaper**
Daemon of craft, creation, and the work of hands. Kethros blesses forges, workshops, and artisans. Items made with proper ritual carry his minor enchantments—Xothic metalwork and stonework commands premium prices across Alaria. His temples smell of smoke and ring with hammers at all hours.

**Makhros, the Iron Voice**
Daemon of war, discipline, and righteous violence. Makhros does not love slaughter for its own sake; he loves *victory*—the precise application of force to achieve divine purpose. His priests lead soldiers in battle, and his blessings make Xothic armies terrifyingly effective.

**Nestros, the Rememberer**
Daemon of ancestors, oaths, and the honored dead. Nestros ensures that the fallen are not forgotten and that promises are kept across generations. His temples house genealogies stretching back centuries; his priests conduct funerals and witness contracts. Breaking an oath sworn before Nestros is spiritual suicide.

**Dikros, the Scale**
Daemon of law, hierarchy, and proper conduct. Dikros defines what is permitted and what is forbidden. His priests serve as judges, and his temples double as courthouses. Xothic law is harsh but consistent—everyone knows the rules and the consequences.

**Petranos, the Foundation**
Daemon of endurance, patience, and the earth itself. Petranos is the slow god, the one who waits. He blesses farmers, miners, and builders. His temples are the sturdiest structures in any Xothic settlement, often doubling as storehouses and shelters.

**Lykanos, the Guide**
Daemon of journeys, trade, and safe passage. Lykanos protects travelers, blesses merchants, and ensures that goods flow. His shrines stand at crossroads and harbor entrances. Xothic caravans carry his symbol, and bandits who rob them tend to meet unfortunate ends.

### The Covenant's Price

Daemons are not gods in the traditional sense. They are spirits sustained by belief—literally fed by worship. The Seven are powerful because Xoth feeds them constantly. Dawn prayers, dusk rituals, weekly observances, seasonal festivals, life-event ceremonies. The entire nation is a belief-engine, generating the faith that keeps the daemons strong.

This creates mutual dependency. If Xoth fell, the Seven would fade—not die, perhaps, but diminish into shadows of their current power. If the Seven faded, Xoth would lose the divine protections that make it formidable. Neither side can afford to let the other weaken.

The Xothic understand this arrangement clearly. They are not naive worshippers hoping for divine favor; they are partners in a contract. They give belief; they receive power. The relationship is transactional, even mercenary—but it works.

### The Hierophancy

Xoth is governed by the **Hierophancy**—a council of seven High Priests, one for each patron. Religious and civic authority are identical; there is no secular government.

**The Hierophant of Theros** serves as spiritual leader and final arbiter in disputes between the other six. In practice, this makes them the head of state, though the title is never used.

**The Hierophant of Makhros** commands the military. All soldiers answer ultimately to this office, and military strategy is as much religious doctrine as tactical planning.

**The Hierophant of Dikros** administers justice. The courts are temples; judges are priests; trials are rituals.

**The Hierophant of Kethros** oversees craft guilds, workshops, and production. Quality standards are religious standards—shoddy work offends the Shaper.

**The Hierophant of Lykanos** manages trade, diplomacy, and foreign relations. Ambassadors are priests; trade agreements are sacred contracts.

**The Hierophant of Petranos** controls agriculture, mining, and infrastructure. The roads, the granaries, the mines—all fall under this office.

**The Hierophant of Nestros** maintains genealogies, cemeteries, and the temples themselves. This hierophant also oversees the Rite of Binding for new converts.

The Hierophancy meets in **Umlas**, the holy capital, in the **Hall of Convergence** at the center of the seven great temples. Decisions typically require consensus among at least five of the seven, though the Hierophant of Theros can break ties.

### Conversion and Citizenship

Anyone can become Xothic.

The **Rite of Binding** is open to any adult who seeks it. The process takes seven days—one for each patron. The convert fasts, receives instruction in doctrine and ritual, and undergoes purification ceremonies. On the seventh night, they hold vigil in a temple until dawn, when a priest brands or tattoos the **Seven Marks** on their forearms: one symbol for each patron.

Once bound, you're Xothic. Full rights, full obligations. Your previous identity doesn't vanish—Xothic dwarves still have dwarven customs, Xothic humans still celebrate human holidays—but your primary identity is now the covenant. You will worship. You will serve. You will belong.

Children of Xothic citizens undergo a simpler version of the Rite at adolescence, confirming the covenant their parents made on their behalf at birth.

**Apostasy** is the worst crime in Xoth. Those who abandon the faith aren't merely exiled—they are **unmade**. Their names are stricken from genealogies, their families forbidden to speak of them, their existence erased from official records. Property reverts to the temples. Former friends and family must treat them as strangers—or risk being investigated for sympathies.

The punishment isn't death. It's worse: nonexistence. To the Xothic, an apostate literally stops being a person.

### The Daemon-Aided Military

Xoth's military advantage is real and terrifying. The army is large, well-equipped, and professionally trained—but so are other nations' armies. What makes Xoth different is divine support.

**The Theophoroi** ("god-bearers") are priest-soldiers who channel daemon power in battle. Every Xothic military unit includes at least one Theophoros, often more. Their role is to maintain constant communion with the patrons while their comrades fight.

The blessings are tangible:
- **Makhros** grants enhanced strength, reflexes, and coordination to faithful soldiers nearby
- **Theros** provides clarity—resistance to illusions, fear, and confusion
- **Petranos** offers endurance, reducing fatigue and helping soldiers hold positions longer
- **Lykanos** aids movement, helping units navigate terrain and maintain supply lines

In extremis, a Theophoros can invoke **manifestation**—channeling so much divine power that the daemon briefly takes physical form through them. This is devastating but dangerous; many Theophoroi die from the strain.

**The cost**: These blessings only work for the faithful. Mercenaries, allies, and conscripts from outside the covenant receive nothing. And if the Theophoroi are killed or their rituals disrupted, the blessings end immediately. Savvy enemies target the priests—but the Theophoroi are trained soldiers themselves, and Xothic units protect them ferociously.

**Mandatory service**: Every Xothic citizen serves two years in the military between ages 18 and 25. This isn't just defense—it's religious formation. Soldiers learn to fight *and* to pray. They witness the blessings firsthand. Veterans return to civilian life as true believers, having seen the covenant's power with their own eyes.

### Economy

Xoth is wealthy, and the wealth comes from multiple sources:

**Agriculture**: The central plains are fertile and well-managed. Petranos's blessings help, but so does simple competence—Xothic farmers are organized, their irrigation maintained, their harvests stored properly.

**Timber**: Kumi Wood produces exceptional lumber. Every tree felled requires ritual permission, which sounds like an obstacle but actually ensures sustainable harvesting. Xothic hardwood is prized across Alaria.

**Craft goods**: Items made in Kethros's name carry minor enchantments—tools that don't dull as quickly, armor that fits more comfortably, jewelry that catches light strangely. The premium isn't huge, but it's consistent.

**Religious services**: Xothic priests can petition the Seven on behalf of outsiders. Healing, divination, blessings for journeys or business ventures—all available for a price. Desperate people across Alaria pay for Xothic intercession, and the coin flows back to the temples.

**Trade position**: Xoth controls the Gulf of Xoth and significant portions of Urok's eastern coast. Lykanos blesses commerce, and Xothic merchants have a reputation for honoring contracts—Nestros ensures it.

### Culture and Daily Life

Life in Xoth is structured around observance. Dawn prayers. Dusk prayers. Weekly temple attendance. Seasonal festivals. Blessing meals before eating. Invoking the appropriate patron before beginning work. The rituals aren't optional; they're the fabric of society.

This sounds oppressive to outsiders, and it can be. But most Xothic don't experience it as burden—it's simply how life works. The rituals are familiar, even comforting. They provide structure. They connect you to your neighbors (who are performing the same rituals) and to the divine (who notice when you skip).

**Race relations** in Xoth are complicated. In theory, all faithful are equal. In practice, old prejudices linger—a dwarven family might look down on their human neighbors, or vice versa. But these prejudices must remain private. Public discrimination based on race is both illegal (Dikros forbids it) and impious (the covenant transcends blood). Intermarriage is common and unremarkable; mixed-heritage children are ordinary.

**Social status** derives from piety and service. The most respected Xothic aren't the wealthiest—they're the most devout. Veterans are honored. Priests are revered. Those who've made major temple donations or performed exceptional service gain status that wealth alone cannot buy.

**Art and architecture** in Xoth tends toward the monumental. Temples dominate every settlement. Public buildings are built to last centuries. Art depicts the Seven, scenes from sacred history, and abstract representations of divine concepts. Private art exists but rarely challenges religious themes—the patrons are watching.

### Relations with Neighbors

**Xi Chin** maintains correct diplomatic relations. The Chroniclers' Compact requires Xi Chin to serve all nations equally, and Xoth is a signatory. This means Xoth receives calendrical services despite making Xi Chin's other clients nervous. Some Xi Chin scholars privately question whether serving a daemon-worshipping theocracy violates the Compact's spirit; the official position is that neutrality means neutrality.

**Maun and Wisgarrd** are wary. The dwarven city-states don't share Xoth's faith and have no interest in joining. The three maintain trade relations—Xothic grain and timber for Maun's instruments and Wisgarrd's jewelry—but there's always tension. Xothic missionaries occasionally appear in both cities; they're tolerated but watched. The Shattered Court beneath the mountains concerns Xoth's Hierophancy less than it concerns the city-states; whatever's down there doesn't threaten the covenant.

**The Order of the Falling Leaf** is a wound that hasn't healed. When Xoth demanded the Order's submission centuries ago, they weren't asking for political allegiance—they were demanding the monks worship the Seven. The Order refused. They saw what happens when daemons are fed too much belief: they grow demanding, jealous, potentially dangerous. The Order's philosophy was self-mastery; the covenant requires perpetual submission.

The monks chose death-in-armor over spiritual slavery. Xoth still wants the Order's texts destroyed—they contain arguments against daemon-worship and techniques for resisting daemonic influence. Those ideas are dangerous to a society built on daemon-dependence.

### History

**The Scattering** (ancient): Before the covenant, southeastern Urok was a patchwork of competing communities—dwarven mining camps, human farming villages, gnomish traders, and others. No unity. Constant small wars.

**The First Covenant** (centuries ago): A prophet whose name is now sacred claimed the daemons of Celestia offered protection to those who would worship them properly. The first followers were few, desperate, and mocked. Then they started winning. Battles turned. Harvests flourished. The faithful grew.

**The Unification** (generations): As the covenant spread, it absorbed communities through conversion and conquest. Those who wouldn't join were defeated; their children often converted anyway. What began as a religious movement became a territorial power.

**The Order's Rejection**: When Xoth encountered the Order of the Falling Leaf—Uline Dwarven warrior-monks who had rejected their own people's growing interest in daemon-pacts—they demanded submission. The Order refused. Rather than fight a losing war or accept spiritual slavery, the masters bound their souls to their armor and sent their students away. Xoth has never forgotten this defiance.

**The Modern Era**: Xoth is secure, wealthy, and patient. The Hierophancy doesn't need to conquer—the faith spreads on its own. Converts trickle in from neighboring regions, drawn by Xoth's prosperity and protection. The covenant grows. The Seven grow stronger. The cycle continues.

### Player Hooks

- **The Binding**: A player character considers conversion—or is pressured into it. The Rite of Binding is genuine; the Seven are real; the blessings work. But the covenant is forever. Is divine power worth eternal obligation?

- **The Apostate**: Someone has fled Xoth after abandoning the faith. The Hierophancy wants them returned—not for punishment, but for *unmakng*. The apostate knows something dangerous, and the temples want them silenced before they can spread it.

- **The Missionary**: Xothic priests have arrived in [neighboring location], offering healing and blessings. They're gaining converts. Local authorities are concerned but unsure how to respond—the missionaries aren't breaking any laws. Yet.

- **The Seventh Text**: Rumors persist of an eighth daemon who was part of the original covenant but was somehow excised. Finding proof would shake Xothic theology to its foundations—or reveal something the Hierophancy desperately wants hidden.

- **Beneath Tithonius**: The Dunes of Tithonius hide ruins older than the covenant. Something's been uncovered—something that predates the Seven. The Hierophancy is mobilizing scholars and soldiers, and they're not explaining why.

- **The Order's Legacy**: Evidence suggests that students of the Falling Leaf escaped to Maun, carrying their masters' philosophy. Some of that philosophy—techniques for resisting daemon influence—may have survived in the School of Music's martial traditions. Xoth would pay well to recover or destroy it. Maun would pay well to protect it.
