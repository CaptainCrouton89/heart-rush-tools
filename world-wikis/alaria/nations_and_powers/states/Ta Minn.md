### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Oznak (Humans)

**Population**: 40,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Pride, personal life and secrets, horses, speed, courage, exploration

- Small, dispersed settlements each controlled by a local priest, who report to the Kazigh—the chief horse shaman ruling from the great temple in Büüli Umén.
- The Kazigh is attended by a select group of servants who spend their lives in servitude and are killed when they turn 30.
- **Selection ritual:** Each year, eligible teenagers stand in a ring with outstretched hands full of grass. A blindfolded horse walks among them and eats from one child's hand, selecting the next servant to be sent to the temple.
- When the Kazigh is deemed unable to survive another week, they declare their successor, who is immediately appointed. The old shaman is then killed.
- Many Ta Minn develop an attunement with the winds that whip across the plains.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Middle Sea coast, west of the Crags of Geth (Griselia), south of the Browthiel Hills

**Biomes**: Grassy steppe, prairie, occasional hills, river valleys

**Climate**: Continental steppe—harsh winds, hot summers, cold winters

**Named Features**: Kanüli Daha Plains (north), Cercesa Plains (southeast)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Büüli Umén (central plains, site of the great temple)

**Cities**: Büüli Umén, Ta Akikis (west), Toh Hural (north), Avar Sonnon (east), Limoste (southwest coast)

### The Coastline

Ta Minn's southern border is a jagged coastline along the Middle Sea, with several inlets and natural harbors. The Chedwin Strait lies along the southwestern coast. Limoste is the main coastal settlement.

### The Northern Plains

The Kanüli Daha Plains in the north are flat, fertile ground—and contested territory. A river flows from Anarak through a gap in the mountains between the Kharvorn and Griselia, providing a route for Anarak forces to reach Ta Minn. The northern plains are where the two nations clash.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Anarak War**

Ta Minn and Anarak are locked in increasingly violent skirmishes over the northern plains. Anarak's forces come through the mountain gap via the river route; Ta Minn cavalry meet them on the open steppe. Neither side has achieved decisive victory, but the fighting grows bloodier each season.

Tepheranos wants Ta Minn's territory. The Ta Minn refuse to yield their ancestral plains. The war will likely escalate.

**Expansion Halted**

The Ta Minn once aggressively expanded across the plains, their cavalry unstoppable in open terrain. They've since run into other civilizations—Griselia to the east, Thespia to the southwest, Anarak to the north—and been forced to pause. The proud horse warriors chafe at the constraint.

### History

The Ta Minn arrived from the West, speaking Ashakri like many western peoples. They found the windswept plains and made them home, bonding with the horses and the winds. For generations, they expanded freely, their cavalry sweeping across the steppe.

Then they hit the mountains, the sea, and other nations. The expansion stopped. Now they hold their territory against Anarak's encroachment and dream of the days when the plains had no borders.
