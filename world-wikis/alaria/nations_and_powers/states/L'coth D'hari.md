## L'coth D'hari

Tags: state, elves, gamori

The northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds—a multi-lobed landmass of dense jungle surrounded by the South Sea. L'Coth D'hari is the territory of the **Gamori**, an elven people who have developed a culture centered on death, transformation, and the sacred hunt.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gamori (elves)

**Population**: Unknown (the Gamori do not census themselves for outsiders)

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:
- **Death and rebirth cycles** — The Gamori view death not as ending but as transformation. Funerals are massive, elaborate affairs celebrating the transition.
- **Body modification** — Scarification, bone-shaping, implants of natural materials, rings, piercings, paint, and extensive tattoos. Modification marks status, achievement, and spiritual growth.
- **Sacred hunting** — Rituals involving the pursuit and consumption of specific prey. You drink the blood of what you kill to gain its strength.
- **Territorial isolation** — Outsiders are rarely welcome. The Gamori consider the wider Elder Wilds their hunting grounds and have been known to dismantle settlement attempts beyond their borders.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped (by choice—they have access to trade goods but prefer traditional methods)

**Primary Exports**: Rare jungle herbs, bloodwood timber (limited), ritual components

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, worked glass, alchemical compounds

The Gamori trade reluctantly and only when necessary. Most contact occurs at the edges of their territory or through intermediaries in Urzula.

### Military

**Size**: Medium (relative to population)

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Cultural (all Gamori participate in hunts, which serve as military training)

Every Gamori is a hunter. The distinction between "civilian" and "warrior" doesn't exist in their culture. Their knowledge of the jungle terrain, combined with body modifications that often include enhanced senses or natural weapons, makes them deadly defenders of their territory.

They do not field armies in the conventional sense. Instead, the jungle itself becomes the weapon—ambushes, traps, poison, and psychological warfare.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds, eastern Aboyinzu

**Biomes**: Dense tropical rainforest

**Named Entities**:
- **Breathless Bay** — Western inlet, fog-shrouded and unnaturally still
- **Paradise Inlet** — Central waterway dividing the main peninsula lobes
- **Farthing Inlet** — Southern boundary separating L'Coth D'hari from the Apelands

**Adjacent Waters**: South Sea (north and west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Eriyen (ceremonial gathering place rather than permanent city)

**Cities**: None in the conventional sense

**Towns**: Multiple scattered communities throughout the peninsula

**Villages**: Numerous, hidden, deliberately difficult to find

### Internal Complications

**Thorne**: In the interior of the peninsula dwells an ancient druid who predates the Gamori arrival—possibly by millennia. The Gamori have an understanding with Thorne, the terms of which they do not discuss. The grove called Thorne is a place where the forest has become alien, and even the death-obsessed Gamori give it wide berth.

### Primary Conflicts

- Occasional friction with Urzula over hunting grounds in Seyiy
- Rare conflicts with ape incursions from the south
- Internal disputes between communities over territory and prey

### History

The Gamori arrived in L'Coth D'hari at an unknown point in history—likely during the early Third Eon. They found the peninsula already inhabited by the druid Thorne and reached an accommodation that persists to this day. The nature of this agreement shapes Gamori culture in ways they do not explain to outsiders.

They have no written history. Their past is preserved through ritual scarification, where major events are carved into the bodies of those who experienced them and passed down through generations of modification.
