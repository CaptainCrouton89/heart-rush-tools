## Pelaria

Tags: state, kendrel

The volcanic kingdom. The warrior court. The embarrassing cousins the other Kendrel don't discuss in polite company. Pelaria occupies the southern reaches of the eastern Agreben Sea, where underwater volcanic vents have created an environment that would kill ordinary Kendrel—and forged a people adapted to thrive in it.

### Overview

Pelaria stretches across the volcanic ridge that marks the southern edge of the Agreben's continental shelf. Here, the seafloor fractures into a maze of thermal vents, lava tubes, and superheated caverns. The water itself runs warm to scalding depending on proximity to active vents. Mineral-rich plumes color the currents in reds and oranges. The environment is hostile, beautiful, and entirely unlike the cultivated reef-gardens of the northern kingdoms.

The Kendrel who settled here—or were exiled here, depending on which history you believe—adapted over generations. Where most Kendrel require cool, clear water, Pelarians tolerate temperatures that would cook their northern cousins. Where most Kendrel practice violence only through Cendoriln intermediaries, Pelarians have developed a martial tradition that horrifies traditionalists.

The other kingdoms call Pelaria "the Ember Court" with varying degrees of affection and contempt. Pelarians have adopted the name proudly.

### The Fire Attunement

Pelaria's defining characteristic is its population's widespread fire attunement—a phenomenon that shouldn't exist in aquatic beings and that scholars have spent centuries failing to explain adequately.

**The Thermal Adaptation**: Pelarian Kendrel possess internal thermoregulation far beyond their northern kin. They can survive in waters up to near-boiling temperatures, tolerate brief exposure to actual volcanic heat, and maintain comfort in the geothermal chaos of their homeland. This isn't merely physical—it's magical, tied to genuine elemental fire attunement.

**Steam Magic**: Where surface fire mages throw flames, Pelarian mages work with steam and superheated water. They can flash-boil the water around enemies, create scalding pressure blasts, and survive in environments of mixed water and volcanic gas that would kill anything else. The **Steam Shapers** are Pelaria's most formidable magical tradition, and other Kendrel find them deeply unsettling.

**The Price**: Fire attunement in an aquatic species creates physiological tension. Pelarians require more food than other Kendrel, burn hotter when stressed, and sometimes literally steam when agitated. Their scales trend toward darker reds and oranges rather than the iridescent pastels of northern Kendrel. Some traditionalists argue they're not really Kendrel anymore—a claim Pelaria answers with pointed silence and carefully maintained military superiority.

### Government

**The Ember Throne** rules from Saphinia, Pelaria's capital built into and around an ancient volcanic cone. Unlike Glador's hereditary monarchy or Flurin's rotating primacy, Pelaria practices **trial succession**—when the throne falls vacant, qualified candidates compete in a series of challenges testing combat skill, magical ability, political acumen, and (this being Kendrel) social grace.

The current monarch is **King Therros Valakar**, a Steam Shaper who won his crown forty-seven years ago by surviving a trial that killed two competitors and permanently scarred three others. His reign has seen Pelaria's military power reach its historical peak, which makes the northern kingdoms nervous.

**The War Council**: Where other Kendrel kingdoms pretend they don't have military leadership, Pelaria openly maintains a War Council of seven generals who advise the throne on defense, offense, and the ongoing Bfaspeen conflict. The Council's existence scandalized Glador when it was formalized three centuries ago. Glador has since requested Council assistance against Bfaspeen raids on seventeen separate occasions.

**The Heat Houses**: Pelarian nobility organizes around thermal vents rather than coral reefs. The seven **Heat Houses** each control a major vent system, deriving wealth and power from the unique resources each produces. Inter-house competition is fierce—and occasionally violent, though Pelarians maintain elaborate fiction that their "ritual duels" aren't really fighting.

### Culture

Pelaria has diverged significantly from traditional Kendrel culture, though they insist the core values remain intact. Violence is still taboo—but Pelarians define violence more narrowly than their northern kin.

**The Distinction of Intent**: Pelarian ethics distinguish between **aggression** (attacking the unwilling) and **contest** (combat between consenting parties). Aggression remains shameful; contest is honorable, even admirable. This semantic distinction allows Pelarians to maintain standing militaries, conduct ritual duels, and wage defensive war while technically adhering to Kendrel values.

The northern kingdoms consider this sophistry. Pelaria considers it evolution.

**The Forge Tradition**: Pelaria is the only Kendrel kingdom that practices metalwork. Using the volcanic heat of their homeland, Pelarian smiths produce weapons and tools from metals imported through Flurin. The quality is... variable (underwater forging presents challenges surface smiths don't face), but the symbolic significance is enormous. Kendrel with swords. The traditionalists have never recovered.

**Steam Festivals**: Pelaria's major celebrations center on volcanic activity—the **Vent Opening** when new thermal sources emerge, the **Deep Boil** marking the anniversary of Saphinia's founding, and the **Cooling** ceremony honoring those who died defending the kingdom. These festivals incorporate martial displays, Steam Shaper performances, and considerably less courtship ritual than northern equivalents.

**The Exile Memory**: Pelarian oral tradition holds that their ancestors were exiled from ancient Glador for the crime of violence—defending their homes against Bfaspeen when the nobility counseled retreat. Whether historically accurate or not, this narrative shapes Pelarian identity: they are the Kendrel who chose survival over propriety, and they've never apologized.

### Economy

**Primary Exports**: Volcanic minerals (sulfur, rare metals from deep vents), geothermal power crystals (stones charged with thermal energy, used in heating systems throughout the Greenwater Isles), obsidian and volcanic glass, and mercenary services. Yes, Pelaria hires out its warriors. The northern kingdoms officially disapprove while quietly employing them.

**Primary Imports**: Food (the volcanic waters don't support the same agriculture as northern reefs), metals for the forges, and luxury goods. Pelaria is wealthy but harsh; comfort must be imported.

**The Thermal Monopoly**: Just as Glador controls pearls, Pelaria controls geothermal resources. The power crystals that heat noble homes in Glador come from Pelarian vents. The volcanic minerals that surface alchemists prize come through Pelarian hands. This gives Pelaria economic leverage that partially offsets its smaller population and cultural isolation.

**The Mercenary Trade**: Pelaria provides military assistance to parties throughout the Greenwater Isles—escorting merchant convoys, defending settlements against Bfaspeen raids, occasionally handling problems that require violence but can't be officially acknowledged. Payment is good. Discretion is guaranteed. The northern kingdoms pretend not to know where their hired defenders come from.

### Military

Pelaria maintains the only professional military among the Kendrel kingdoms—the **Ember Guard**, a standing force of approximately 2,000 warriors trained from youth in underwater combat. By Kendrel standards, this is an enormous army. By surface standards, it's a modest garrison. But underwater, quality matters more than quantity, and the Ember Guard is very good at what it does.

**The Steam Shapers**: Pelaria's elite magical corps, specializing in thermal warfare. They can superheat water around enemies, create pressure waves that rupture internal organs, and survive environments that would kill any other Kendrel. In defensive operations, they're nearly unstoppable. In offensive operations... well, Pelaria doesn't officially conduct offensive operations.

**The Vent Fortresses**: Pelaria's settlements are built into volcanic formations that serve as natural defensive positions. The superheated waters around active vents create barriers that non-Pelarian Kendrel (and Bfaspeen) cannot easily cross. Attacking Pelaria means fighting through environments that favor the defenders absolutely.

**The Bfaspeen War**: Unlike Glador's purely defensive posture, Pelaria conducts active operations against Bfaspeen broods. Ember Guard units patrol the deep trenches, raid brood-mother lairs, and occasionally exterminate entire populations. This is technically defensive (protecting Kendrel territory from future threats) but walks right up to the line of prohibited offensive warfare. The northern kingdoms officially disapprove and unofficially provide intelligence and logistical support.

### Relations

**Glador**: Mutual wariness masking mutual dependency. Glador needs Pelarian military power; Pelaria needs Glador's trade networks and political legitimacy. Neither wants to acknowledge this, so relations proceed through elaborate diplomatic fiction. Queen Thessaly and King Therros have met exactly twice in forty-seven years, each time briefly, each time surrounded by enough protocol to prevent actual conversation.

**Flurin**: Surprisingly warm. Flurin's pragmatism meshes well with Pelaria's directness, and House Pelarond maintains strong ties between the kingdoms. When Pelaria needs surface goods, they go through Flurin without the pretense that other kingdoms maintain. When Flurin needs protection, they call Pelaria first and pay fairly for the service.

**The Surface World**: Pelaria has more direct contact with surface nations than it admits—mercenary contracts, mineral trade, and occasional diplomatic exchanges. King Therros has expressed interest in formal relations with Atriik, which would bypass Flurin's traditional intermediary role. This hasn't happened yet. The political implications are significant.

**The Bfaspeen**: Active enemies, regularly fought, occasionally negotiated with (another scandal the northern kingdoms pretend not to know about). Pelaria has achieved local truces with specific brood mothers, trading guaranteed safe passage for tributary payments of shiny objects. These arrangements are temporary, transactional, and deeply pragmatic. The Bfaspeen aren't friends. But they can be managed.

### Settlements

**Saphinia** (capital): Built into an ancient volcanic cone, with districts ranging from the warm shallows of the Outer Ring to the near-boiling depths of the Ember Core where only the most heat-adapted Pelarians can survive. Population ~12,000 Kendrel. The Ember Throne sits in a chamber heated by active magma flows, a dramatic setting that doubles as a security measure—assassins would cook before reaching the king.

**Brilina**: Northern border village, relatively cool by Pelarian standards, serving as the transition zone where northern Kendrel can safely visit.

**Osirey**: Western settlement controlling the most productive mineral vents. House Therros (the king's family) holds this territory, making it both wealthy and politically significant.

**Purine**: Eastern village near the deepest and hottest vents, Cendoriln-dominated, handling Pelaria's most dangerous mining and military operations.

**Levirus**: Central town, home to the largest concentration of Steam Shapers and the kingdom's premier magical training facility.

**Naurey**: Southern outpost at the edge of Pelarian territory, facing the open Agreben and the Bfaspeen-infested waters beyond. Heavily fortified, perpetually on alert, and considered a hardship posting even by Pelarian standards.

**Coralona**: Southernmost settlement, existing primarily as an early warning station against Bfaspeen incursions. Small permanent population, large rotating garrison.

### Player Hooks

- The Ember Guard is recruiting surface warriors for a raid on a Bfaspeen brood mother's lair. The pay is excellent. The survival rate is not discussed.
- A northern Kendrel noble has fled to Pelaria seeking asylum after committing violence in Glador. Extradition negotiations offer opportunities for diplomatic manipulation—or extraction.
- One of Pelaria's truces with a Bfaspeen brood mother is breaking down. Someone needs to renegotiate, which means diving into brood territory with tribute and hoping the matriarch feels like talking.
- King Therros seeks surface allies for a potential war with Glador. He's not ready to commit, but he's testing the waters. Literally and figuratively.
- A Steam Shaper has gone rogue, using thermal magic to attack merchant shipping. Pelaria needs the problem solved quietly—hiring surface adventurers provides deniability.
