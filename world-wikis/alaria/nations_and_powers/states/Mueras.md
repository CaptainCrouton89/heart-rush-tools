### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchy (Council of Merchant-Kings)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Drachma, Yngli

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Stable (through mutual deterrence)

**Core Values**: Style, instincts, cunning

Mueras is governed by merchant-kings who hold powerful monopolies over different aspects of trade—not goods themselves, but the means of moving them. The true currency of power in Mueras is navigation: control of the pilot guilds that guide ships through Labyrinth Sound, the treacherous waterway that defines the coast. Without licensed pilots, ships wreck. The merchant-kings who control the pilots control the trade.

Seven major houses hold seats on the Council, which meets in chambers carved into the highest cliff of Bazz. Assassination between houses is common but rarely successful—the merchant-kings are wealthy enough to afford extensive protections. More effective is killing a rival's pilots, sabotaging their navigation charts, or bribing their harbor masters. The competition is constant, vicious, and conducted with impeccable style.

The Drachma dominate the upper echelons of Mueran society—their cultural emphasis on panache, instinct, and personal style aligns perfectly with merchant-king values. The Yngli occupy a more complicated position: their magical silence makes them ideal for keeping secrets, and many serve as pilots, dock workers, and navigators. Some houses treat their Yngli well; others exploit them ruthlessly. The Yngli communities of the Taflex Forest maintain independence from all houses, trading forest products but answering to no merchant-king.

#### The Seven Houses

**House Hammren** (Hammer Coast): Controls the northern sea approach via the twin fortress-ports. The oldest house, predating even Kasper's rise. Conservative, militaristic, closest thing to old nobility.

**House Vethros** (Kelwin): Controls the Kelwin Throat, the most technically demanding passage. Their pilots are the finest in Mueras. Also controls most of the Taflex Forest logging operations.

**House Marsova** (Hennipin): Controls the southern passage into Corpse Bay. Eternal rivals to Vethros. Extensive warehousing operations that undercut Bazz's storage monopoly.

**House Korreth** (Bazz): Controls the Council Chambers and the central markets of Bazz. No navigation monopoly, but their position at the junction of Sound and Bay makes them the natural meeting point for all trade.

**House Velani** (Bazz): Specialists in insurance, banking, and contract enforcement. No ships of their own, but every ship that trades in Mueras eventually needs Velani services.

**House Dreth** (Port Perith): Controls trade with the haunted zone—Kaspion salvage, Cliffdrop pilgrimage fees, and the darker commerce that flows from death-touched regions.

**House Yoros** (Grimreach): The newest house, elevated to the Council only two generations ago. Controls the shadow-touched trade from the Darkened Coast. Other houses consider them barely civilized.

### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Fish, sea products, pilot services, shadow-touched materials, timber

**Primary Imports**: Everything else

The Mueran economy reaches across the world despite—or because of—the region's treacherous waters. Ships must pass through Mueran-controlled channels to access the Agreben Sea and the southern trade routes. The pilot fees alone generate enormous wealth, and the warehousing, insurance, and support services multiply it further.

Mueras lacks astral airways, cutting it off from the fastest magical trade routes. The merchant-kings have turned this into advantage: goods that can't be trusted to astral transport (fragile, perishable, politically sensitive, or simply too large) flow through Mueran ports instead.

The shadow-touched trade from Grimreach and the Darkened Coast adds a darker revenue stream. Void-eel oil, shadow-ray leather, ghost-touched artifacts from Kaspion—these command premium prices in markets that don't ask questions about provenance.

**The Pilot Guilds**: The true engine of Mueran wealth. Each major passage through Labyrinth Sound requires pilots who know the specific currents, rocks, and hazards. These pilots are bound to specific houses through guild contracts, oaths, and sometimes more coercive measures. A pilot who betrays guild secrets faces consequences that don't end with death.

### Military

**Size**: Medium (state forces) / Large (combined house fleets)

**Quality**: Medium (state) / Variable (houses)

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (state) / Contractual (houses)

The official Mueran military is deliberately modest—the Council fears any force strong enough to threaten merchant-king autonomy. State forces maintain coastal defense, suppress piracy, and occasionally intervene when house conflicts threaten trade.

The real military power lies in the individual house fleets. Each merchant-king maintains private naval forces, marines, and shore garrisons. House Hammren's forces are the most conventionally military; House Yoros fields specialized monster-hunters; House Dreth employs practitioners comfortable with death magic. Combined, the house fleets could challenge any navy in the region—but they will never combine.

**The Compact of Bazz**: An ancient agreement prevents house forces from operating within Bazz itself or attacking the Council Chambers. Violations are punished by the combined action of all other houses. This creates the one neutral zone in Mueras where merchant-kings can negotiate without fear of assassination.

### Geography

**Location**: Western coast of Rimihuica, Westrim region

**Biomes**: Coastal cliffs, arid plateau, temperate forest, shadow-touched coast

**Named Entities**: Labyrinth Sound, Corpse Bay, Walker Depths, Dustwind Plateau, Mueras Highlands, Taflex Forest, Grimreach, Darkened Coast, The Tarns, Beak of Mueras, Sal'emri Bay, Watchkeep Isles, Brunas Inlet

**Rivers & Lakes**: The Tarns (highland lakes), seasonal streams from Dustwind Plateau

**Adjacent Waters**: Agreben Sea (south/southwest), Walker Depths (west)

The geography created the politics. Mueras occupies roughly 400 miles of coastline, but the actual navigable waterway through Labyrinth Sound stretches over 200 miles of treacherous channels. The interior Dustwind Plateau isolates the coast from the eastern reaches. The Darkened Coast in the southeast adds supernatural hazard to natural difficulty.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Bazz (de facto; no formal capital designated)

**Cities**: Bazz (40,000), Kelwin (12,000), Hennipin (10,000)

**Towns**: Kaspion (abandoned/haunted), Port Perith (5,000), Port Echo (4,000), Al Khamilah (5,000), Cursius (3,000), Fulon (3,000), Eddiwood (2,500), Yorx (2,000), Indus (2,000)

**Villages**: Hickton, Saron, Sha'ra, Blof Point, Freed, Giorga, Sherly, Lieler, Al Muqlib, Am Batr, N. Hammer Point, S. Hammer Point (fortress-garrisons)

**Special Zones**:
- **The Haunted Zone**: Kaspion and surroundings, officially forbidden, unofficially exploited
- **Sal'emri Bay**: Tarkhon trading enclaves, nominally under House Hammren protection but effectively autonomous
- **Deep Taflex**: Yngli territory, no house authority recognized

### Primary Conflicts

**House Vethros vs. House Marsova**: The eternal rivalry. Control of the central Sound passages means control of the most profitable trade routes. Both houses constantly probe for advantage through price wars, pilot sabotage, and political maneuvering in the Council.

**The Haunted Zone**: House Dreth profits from Kaspion's curse; other houses want the ghost-city cleansed or at least contained. The curse may be spreading—the Darkened Coast has deepened since Kasper's death, and some blame the unresolved spiritual damage.

**Yngli Rights**: The Yngli cannot speak to advocate for themselves. Some houses treat them fairly; others exploit their silence. The free Yngli of the Taflex Forest occasionally act against the worst offenders, but they lack the organization for sustained resistance.

**Tarkhon Relations**: The Sal'emri Bay enclaves are useful but also potential Tarkhon footholds. House Hammren profits from protecting them; other houses wonder if the Tarkhon presence will eventually threaten Mueran independence.

**The Succession Problem**: Merchant-king families rise and fall. House Yoros joined the Council only recently; older houses resent their presence. If a house falls, who claims their seat? The Compact of Bazz doesn't address this clearly, and the ambiguity creates tension.

### History

**The Age of Petty Lords**: Before Kasper, Mueras was fragmented among dozens of minor lords, each controlling a single cove or passage. Trade was nearly impossible; piracy was endemic.

**Kasper's Consolidation** (approximately 150 years ago): A merchant named Kasper of Kaspion began unifying the coast through conquest, assassination, and forced marriage. Over three decades, he eliminated or absorbed nearly all rivals, establishing himself as the sole ruler of Mueras.

**The Tyranny** (32 years): Kasper ruled from his palace at Kaspion, demanding absolute loyalty. Those who displeased him were thrown from Cliffdrop. He centralized all pilot guilds under royal control and taxed trade heavily to fund his court and military.

**The Rebellion** (approximately 118 years ago): A coalition of surviving merchant families, funded partly by Tarkhon interests, raised forces against Kasper. The rebellion succeeded in breaching Kaspion's defenses—but Kasper had prepared.

**The Death-Curse**: Rather than surrender, Kasper triggered a curse that killed every living person in Kaspion instantly—approximately 12,000 souls. The curse bound the dead to the city, creating the haunted zone that persists today.

**The Compact of Bazz** (shortly after the curse): The surviving rebel leaders, horrified by what their victory had unleashed, negotiated the Compact—an agreement to share power through a Council, to maintain Bazz as neutral ground, and to prevent any single house from accumulating Kasper-like authority.

**The Modern Era**: 118 years of Council rule. Houses have risen and fallen; House Yoros joined the Council 40 years ago after their shadow-trade operations became too profitable to ignore. The curse has not faded. The Darkened Coast has deepened. And some say the merchant-kings secretly prefer it this way—the danger keeps outsiders from competing.

### Culture & Customs

**Style as Virtue**: Drachma influence permeates Mueran culture. How you do something matters as much as what you do. A merchant-king who wins through clumsy methods loses face; one who loses gracefully may gain respect.

**The Salt Greeting**: Visitors to a Mueran home are offered salt and water—symbols of the sea that sustains the nation. Refusing is a grave insult; accepting creates a limited guest-right that prohibits violence until the visitor leaves.

**Pilot Oaths**: Pilots swear complex oaths binding them to their house and guild. Breaking these oaths is believed to curse the oathbreaker's navigation sense—a superstition that may have magical truth.

**The Cremation Custom**: Bodies are cremated in Mueras, never buried. The reason is practical: buried bodies in cursed ground may rise. Crematoriums burn constantly in major ports.

**Silence as Trust**: Due to Yngli influence, Muerans are comfortable with silence in negotiation. A Mueran who fills every pause with words is considered untrustworthy—someone hiding something.

### Player Hooks

**Pilot Guild Intrigue**: A house wants to poach pilots from a rival. The party must recruit, bribe, or extract pilots while avoiding retaliation.

**Kaspion Salvage**: Something valuable lies in the ghost-city. House Dreth will pay well for retrieval—but the dead don't appreciate visitors.

**Yngli Liberation**: Free Yngli from the Taflex want to rescue kin from an abusive house. The party must infiltrate, extract, and escape without starting a house war.

**The Deepening Shadow**: The Darkened Coast is expanding. Someone needs to investigate why—and whether Kasper's curse is to blame.

**Tarkhon Tensions**: A Sal'emri merchant has been murdered. House Hammren wants it solved quietly before Tarkhon takes notice. The killer may be from another house—or from Tarkhon itself.

**Succession Crisis**: A merchant-king has died without clear heir. Multiple claimants are preparing for conflict. The party can tip the balance—for the right price.
