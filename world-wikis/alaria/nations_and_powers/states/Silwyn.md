### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council of Herd-Chiefs

**Primary Inhabitants**: Silzar (plains ogres)

**Population**: ~4,000

**Stability**: Somewhat Stable

**Core Values**: Kindness, strength, toughness, grit, connection to the plains

The Silzar have no permanent leadership. When the mammoth herds converge at seasonal watering grounds, the herd-chiefs meet in council to decide matters affecting all Silwyn. Decisions require broad consensus—but any chief who disagrees strongly enough can simply leave with their herd. This makes Silzar politics slow and frustrating to outsiders, but it has kept them unified through decades of war.

The entire culture rests on the Mammoth Covenant: a spiritual pact formed generations ago between the Silzar and the great mammoth herds. The mammoths are not beasts of burden or war animals—they are partners. A Silzar who mistreats a mammoth is exiled. One who kills a mammoth without dire need is killed in turn. In exchange, the mammoths carry the Silzar to war, share their strength, and grant them dominion over the open plains.

This covenant defines what the Silzar are. It also limits what they can become.


### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Mammoth ivory, cured leather, bone-craft

**Primary Imports**: Metal, timber, rope and fiber

The Silzar economy runs on three things: what the mammoths provide, what the plains provide, and what they take from Iylovia.

Mammoth ivory, leather, and bone form the basis of Silzar craftsmanship. They're skilled workers—their bone carvings and leather goods are prized by traders willing to make the journey. But they have no metal deposits, no forests, no fiber crops. Everything that isn't meat, milk, leather, or bone must come from outside.

Timber and rope come from Iylovia, taken in raids. Metal is harder. The Silzar trade with merchants who travel up from the southern desert routes—exchanging ivory and leather for iron and bronze. It's never enough. Every ballistae bolt represents precious metal that can't be replaced easily.

This scarcity shapes everything. The Silzar don't waste. They don't build permanent structures. They repair and reuse until nothing remains. And they raid Iylovia not from cruelty but from genuine need—the forests have what the plains lack.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

The Silzar field perhaps 800 warriors at full muster—a tiny force by any standard. But those 800 ride war mammoths carrying ballistae platforms, and on open ground, nothing in the region can stand against them.

A mammoth charge breaks formations. The ballistae—massive torsion crossbows firing bolts the length of a man's arm—shatter shield walls and fortifications from range. And the trumpeting... the coordinated trumpeting of a mammoth war-line drowns out commands, drowns out thought, drowns out the whispers of the Gyv forest-magic.

The Silzar don't fight in organized ranks. Each mammoth is a mobile fortress crewed by three to five warriors—a driver, a ballistae operator, and flankers with bows or javelins. They coordinate through horn signals and generations of shared instinct. On the plains, they're unstoppable.

In the forests, they're helpless. Mammoths can't maneuver between dense trees. Ballistae can't aim through canopy. The whispers creep in despite the trumpeting. Every attempt to push into Iylovia's forests has ended in disaster—warriors stumbling out days later, half-mad, having killed their own companions in the confusion.

This is the heart of the Silzar dilemma. Their greatest strength is useless against the enemy they most need to defeat.


### Geography

**Location**: Landlocked plains in northwestern Rimihuica

**Biomes**: Temperate grassland, savanna

**Named Entities**: The Thundering Way, Grandmother's Rest, The Scar, Avil Lakes, seasonal gathering grounds

**Rivers & Lakes**: The Silwyn River (flows north through the plains into Iylovia), Avil Lakes (southern plains, trade meeting point)

**Adjacent Waters**: None (landlocked)

Silwyn occupies a pocket of grassland surrounded by impassable barriers. To the north lies Eros—the haunted forest of the Nemo, which no Silzar will enter under any circumstances. To the east stretches Iylovia, enemy territory, dense forest where mammoths cannot go. To the south and west, desert—death for any creature the size of a mammoth.

The Silzar are trapped in their own homeland. They dominate everything they can reach and can reach nothing worth dominating.

The Silwyn River flows from springs in the southern highlands, running north through the heart of the plains before crossing into Iylovia. This river is the lifeblood of the region—and a source of bitter internal debate. The Silzar could dam it, poison it, use it as a weapon against the Gyv. Some younger warriors argue they should. The elders refuse. Water is sacred under the Mammoth Covenant; it belongs to all living things. To weaponize it would be to become something less than Silzar.

The argument continues. The river flows on.


### Political Geography

**Capital**: None

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: None (seasonal gathering grounds only)

The Silzar build nothing permanent. They follow the mammoth herds along the Thundering Way—the ancient migration route that loops through the plains with the seasons. Where the herds stop, the Silzar stop. Where the herds move, the Silzar move.

Seasonal gathering grounds serve as temporary centers of Silzar life. The largest is where the river bends sharply east—here, in summer, as many as half the Silzar converge when multiple herds come to drink. Chiefs meet, disputes are settled, young people from different herds meet and marry, and traders from outside know they can find customers.

Grandmother's Rest is different—a lone rocky hill rising from the plains where, according to tradition, the first mammoth to accept the Covenant died of old age. The Silzar leave offerings here: carved bone, braided grass, small treasures. No one camps at Grandmother's Rest. It is for the dead.


### Primary Conflicts

**The War with Iylovia**

For forty-odd years, the Silzar have been driving the Gyv back. What was once Gyv territory from the forest to the desert is now Silwyn—plains that the Silzar took field by field, settlement by settlement, until the Gyv retreated into forests too dense to follow.

Now the war has stalled. The Silzar control everything they can reach. The Gyv hold everything the Silzar can't take. Raiding continues along the forest edge—the Silzar take timber, rope, food, whatever they can carry. The Gyv ambush anyone who pushes too deep. Neither side can end it.

**The Internal Schism**

The real threat to Silwyn isn't the Gyv. It's the question of what the Silzar are willing to become to win.

Traditionalists—mostly older chiefs who remember the days before the Covenant made them strong—insist that victory means nothing if it costs them their souls. The Covenant has rules. Water is sacred. The mammoths must be honored. There are lines that cannot be crossed.

Progressives—mostly younger warriors who have never known anything but war—argue that rules are luxuries. Dam the river. Send warriors in on foot. Burn the forest if necessary. End this, whatever it takes, and worry about the Covenant afterward.

This schism cuts through every herd, every family. Chiefs who were allies for decades now eye each other with suspicion. The next council gathering may not end in consensus. It may end in blood.

**The Water Question**

The river flows from Silwyn into Iylovia. The Gyv need it. The Silzar could take it.

Every few years, someone proposes damming the river. Every few years, the elders refuse. But the pressure grows. The war grinds on. Young warriors ask why their friends are dying in forest ambushes when they could end the Gyv in a single season by turning off the water.

The elders say: because we are not monsters. Because the mammoths would know. Because some victories cost more than defeat.

The young warriors say: the mammoths don't care about Gyv children. The Covenant is about us and them, not us and the enemy. Stop hiding behind tradition and win this war.

No one has acted. Yet.


### History

**The Old Days**

Before the Covenant, the Silzar were nothing. Scattered bands of plains ogres, hunted by predators, raided by the Gyv, barely surviving in the grasslands no one else wanted. The Gyv controlled the entire region—plains and forest both—and considered the ogres vermin to be culled when their numbers grew troublesome.

Silzar elders still tell stories of those days. Hiding in gullies while Gyv hunting parties rode past. Watching children starve because the Gyv had burned the grasslands for sport. Being captured and made to work until they died. The Silzar remember. They will never forget.

**The Mammoth Covenant**

How the Covenant began is sacred knowledge, shared only in certain ceremonies. What outsiders know is this: somehow, the Silzar formed an alliance with the great mammoth herds. Not domestication—partnership. The mammoths accepted Silzar riders in exchange for protection, guidance, and respect.

Within two generations, everything changed. Mammoth-mounted Silzar could cross the plains in days instead of weeks. They could carry supplies, shelter behind mammoth bodies, strike and retreat before enemies could respond. And when they learned to mount ballistae on mammoth platforms...

The Gyv didn't understand the threat until it was far too late.

**The Turning**

The first Silzar victories were small. A Gyv outpost overrun. A hunting party slaughtered. The Gyv sent punitive expeditions; the Silzar ambushed them on open ground and left no survivors.

Then the Silzar stopped hiding. They rode in force against Gyv settlements on the plains—and the settlements fell. One after another. Year after year. The Gyv retreated toward the forests, burning what they couldn't carry, but the Silzar just kept coming.

In a single generation, the Silzar took the plains. Gyv who had owned this land for centuries fled east or died where they stood.

**The Stall**

And then the Silzar reached the treeline, and everything stopped.

The first assault into the forest was a disaster. Two hundred warriors went in. Thirty came out, raving about trees that moved and voices that came from everywhere and friends who turned on friends. The mammoths had refused to enter at all.

The second assault went worse. The Silzar tried to cut paths, to burn clearings, to force the forest open. The forest fought back. Warriors vanished. Supply lines collapsed. Chiefs died to their own warriors' hands, driven mad by whispers they couldn't escape.

Now the Silzar raid the forest's edge and go no deeper. They've won everything the mammoths can reach. They've lost every battle the mammoths can't fight.

The war continues. Neither side can end it.


### Relations

**Iylovia**: Active war. The Silzar raid constantly; the Gyv defend desperately. Neither side negotiates. Both sides hate.

**Eros**: Terror. The Silzar will not enter the haunted forest under any circumstances. They don't speak of the Nemo. They pretend the northern border doesn't exist.

**Southern Traders**: Wary commerce. Merchants from the desert routes trade metal for ivory and leather. They don't stay long.

**Everyone Else**: Silwyn is too isolated for most nations to care about. Those who know of the Silzar know only that they're dangerous mammoth-riders in a distant grassland, fighting some forest people for reasons no one bothers to understand.


### Player Hooks

**The Schism**: The next council gathering could tear Silwyn apart. Both sides might seek outside help—mercenaries, advisors, assassins. Players could tip the balance either way.

**The Water Decision**: Someone might actually try to dam the river. What happens then? Do the players help, stop them, or deal with the consequences?

**Breaking the Stalemate**: Either side might hire outsiders to do what they cannot. The Silzar might want specialists who can fight in forests. The Gyv might want someone to sabotage the mammoth herds. Players could end this war—for better or worse.

**The Mammoth Plague**: A sickness spreading through the herds. The Silzar are desperate for a cure. Without the mammoths, they're nothing—prey again, like in the old days.

**What Lies North**: Someone needs to go into Eros. The Silzar won't do it. They'll pay anything—anything—for someone else to face what they cannot.
