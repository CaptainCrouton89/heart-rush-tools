### Primary Conflicts

- Managing the Wytrolape moon-curse during Hollownight—every month brings the risk of rage-induced violence
- Protecting the Bank of Infindior, a planar institution of immense importance
- Maritime threats from the Denrik Sea, including whatever dwells in the Darkstone Caves beneath the waters
- Isolation—Kyorda is far from other civilized lands, making supply chains precarious and outside aid slow to arrive

### History

Kyorda was founded centuries ago by Tikhaya settlers who recognized that the region could support civilization if properly managed. The integration of the Wytrolape came later—the giant apes were already present, and rather than conflict, the Tikhaya chose coexistence.

The moon-curse has shaped Kyordan society profoundly. Every aspect of life accounts for the periodic madness that affects the Wytrolape population. Buildings are reinforced, contingency plans exist for Hollownight, and both peoples have developed rituals and practices to minimize casualties during the dangerous days.

### The Bank of Infindior

East of Xandur, where void and time leylines cross, stands the Bank of Infindior—a planar institution where time does not pass. Depositors can store possessions here with perfect security; items remain exactly as they were when deposited, regardless of how long they remain. The bank serves clients from across Alaria, and protecting it is one of Kyorda's most important duties.
