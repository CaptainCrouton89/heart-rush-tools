Located in the Seyiy region of the Elder Wilds. A city built beneath massive waterfalls where climbers hang from the cliffside rocks, harvesting the plants that grow in the perpetual mist. Dense rainforest surrounds the settlement, and the ruins of an ancient titan city lie beneath the modern structures.

Further south lie the Archfalls, the perilous waterfall confluence.
