## Hedroscobb

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

The largest of the six orc states and the one that gives the Wildwood its name to outsiders. Hedroscobb controls the southern forest from Vogenfeld's mountain passes to the Yugurbas Dyos marshes, and its warriors in their terrible corrosive armor are what Tarkhon imagines when they think of "orc."

### Overview

Hedroscobb is a military state built around a single advantage: algae-iron. The Hedroscobbi have mastered the art of forging iron combined with specific swamp algae to create armor so heavy and corrosive that only their own naturally adapted skin can withstand wearing it. This armor—black, dripping, and caustic—provides extraordinary protection and destroys the weapons of anyone who strikes it.

Everything in Hedroscobb society serves the forges. The constant wars aren't about glory or territory; they're about securing the algae that keeps the armor coming. Without it, they're just orcs. With it, they're nearly unstoppable.

### Government

**Type:** Forge Council

The Hedroscobbi are ruled by a council of five Forge-Masters—the greatest smiths and war-leaders combined. Political power flows from the ability to produce armor; military command follows from the ability to wear it well.

**The Five Forges:**
- **Forge Vraketh** — The Black Anvil. Oldest and most productive forge, controls the main ironwood groves. Forge-Master Kethros has held his seat for forty years.
- **Forge Drul** — The Acid Gate. Controls the southern passes and first contact with Vogenfeld. Forge-Master Grusha is the primary voice for war with the dwarves.
- **Forge Ystok** — The River Forge. Controls the southeastern territory bordering Shazuihn; constantly fighting off raiders. Forge-Master Thokk has buried three children to boar-rider axes.
- **Forge Morul** — The Northern Reach. Controls the border with Yugurbas Dyos. Forge-Master Velka leads the algae expeditions.
- **Forge Sulth** — The Hidden Forge. Smallest, most secretive. Rumored to experiment with new algae combinations. Forge-Master unknown to outsiders.

Decisions require majority agreement. War requires unanimous consent. The council meets in the Slag Halls—a vast underground complex beneath the central Wildwood where the great forges never cool.

### Culture

**The Hedroscobbi** have dark, leathery skin that resists the corrosive properties of their own armor and weapons. They're larger than most orcs—the constant labor of the forges and the weight of the armor have bred them strong over generations. Acid scars are marks of honor; a smith who hasn't burned themselves hasn't worked hard enough.

**Core Values:**
- **The Forge Above All** — Personal glory means nothing. The forge-clan is everything.
- **Weight Is Strength** — The heavier the burden you can bear, the more respect you command.
- **Iron Remembers** — Every piece of armor carries the memory of its maker. Disgrace the armor, disgrace the smith.
- **The Algae Must Flow** — Without the swamp algae, there is no armor. Without armor, there is no Hedroscobb.

**Society:** Hedroscobb is rigidly hierarchical. Forge-clans control all production; warriors serve the forges; gatherers, hunters, and laborers support the warriors. The only social mobility is through exceptional smithing or exceptional killing—preferably both.

Children are tested at age ten. Those who can withstand the touch of algae-iron without screaming become smith-apprentices. Those who cannot become warriors. Those who flinch become laborers.

### Economy

**Size:** Medium
**Tech:** Developed (in metallurgy), Undeveloped (in everything else)

**Primary Exports:**
- Algae-iron weapons (extremely valuable, rarely sold)
- Ironwood timber
- War captives (to Shazuihn, ironically—the raiders trade for what they can't take)

**Primary Imports:**
- Swamp algae (the limiting factor—never enough)
- Food (Hedroscobb's focus on smithing means they don't farm well)
- Healing supplies (they can't make armor without getting hurt)

The economy is command-driven. The Forge Council controls all production and distribution. There is no currency; goods are allocated by status and need. Trade with outsiders is conducted through designated intermediaries and is heavily regulated.

### Military

**Size:** Large
**Quality:** Very High
**Enrollment:** Universal (all adults serve in some capacity)

The Hedroscobbi military is terrifying. Warriors in full algae-iron armor are nearly immune to conventional weapons—the armor provides extraordinary protection, and anyone who lands a hit finds their weapon corroding from the contact. A Hedroscobbi shield wall is a nightmare to face.

**The Black Tide:** The elite heavy infantry. Full algae-iron plate, tower shields, short stabbing swords. They advance slowly—the armor is enormously heavy—but nothing stops them.

**The Gatherers:** Lighter-armored raiders who secure algae from Yugurbas Dyos and defend against Shazuihni attacks. More mobile, less protected, but still dangerous.

**Weaknesses:**
- The armor is slow. Fast enemies who won't engage directly can bleed them.
- The armor is heavy. Long marches exhaust them. They can't pursue fleeing enemies.
- The armor requires maintenance. Without fresh algae, it loses its corrosive properties.
- They're terrible at naval warfare. The armor sinks.

### Geography

**Location:** Southern Wildwood, directly north of Vogenfeld's mountain passes

**Biomes:** Dense temperate forest with ironwood groves; rocky ravines and hidden valleys

**Key Locations:**
- **The Slag Halls** — Underground forge complex beneath central Hedroscobb; seat of the Forge Council
- **Ironwood Grove** — Ancient forest of iron-hard trees; essential for forge-fuel and weapon handles
- **The Acid Gate** — Fortified position overlooking the passes to Vogenfeld
- **Gatherer's Camp** — Seasonal encampment in Yugurbas Dyos during algae-harvesting season

**Borders:**
- South: Vogenfeld (the dwarves watch, but rarely cross)
- North: Glivornax (hostile; the War of the Marshes)
- Northeast: Tarn (neutral; little contact)
- East: Shazuihn (hostile; constant raiding)
- West: Plains of Oblivion (no one goes there)

### Relations

**Glivornax:** Open warfare. The Glivornaxi claim the Yugurbas Dyos marshes and try to prevent algae harvesting. Hedroscobb sends armed expeditions every season. People die.

**Shazuihn:** Constant low-level conflict. The boar riders attack from the east without warning, take what they want, and vanish. Hedroscobb has never been able to stop the raids completely—the Shazuihni are too fast, and the armor is too slow.

**Tarn:** Minimal contact. The Tarni control river territory; Hedroscobb doesn't care about rivers. Occasional trade through intermediaries.

**Uhionai:** Almost no contact. The tree-orcs are far to the northwest; Hedroscobb has no reason to go there.

**Grieb:** No contact. The lakemen are too far north, and nobody wants to fight aquatic orcs in their home waters anyway.

**Vogenfeld:** Cold hostility. The dwarves watch the passes; Hedroscobb watches back. Neither side has attacked the other directly in generations, but both know war could come. The dwarves trade metal to Glivornax—Hedroscobb considers this a provocation.

**The Orc Moot:** Hedroscobb sends representatives but rarely cooperates. They don't need allies; they have armor.

### Conflicts

**The War of the Marshes:** The defining conflict. The Yugurbas Dyos contains the richest algae beds outside Glivornax proper. Hedroscobb needs that algae to survive; Glivornax says the marshes are sacred. Neither side can afford to lose.

**The Eternal Raid:** Shazuihni attacks drain resources and kill people constantly. Hedroscobb can't stop them and can't ignore them.

**The Dwarven Question:** Vogenfeld controls the only practical passes into Tarkhon. If Hedroscobb ever decided to expand south, the dwarves would be first. Some Forge-Masters whisper that the time is coming.

### History

The Hedroscobbi were once just another orc tribe—larger than most, but unremarkable. Everything changed when a smith named Vraketh discovered that certain swamp algae, when properly treated and combined with iron, created metal with extraordinary properties.

Within a generation, the Hedroscobbi conquered their neighbors and established the Forge Council. Within three generations, they controlled the entire southern Wildwood. They might have conquered more, but the algae limits them. Without access to the marshes, they can't produce enough armor to expand.

The War of the Marshes has been ongoing for over a century. Both sides have bled, but neither has broken.

### Player Hooks

- Infiltrate the Slag Halls to learn the secret of algae-iron smithing
- Negotiate a ceasefire between Hedroscobb and Glivornax (good luck)
- Survive the Acid Gate as a Vogenfeld diplomat
- Join a Gatherer expedition into Yugurbas Dyos during algae season
- Investigate why Forge Sulth is so secretive—what new weapons are they developing?
- Convince the Forge Council that the Shazuihni raids could be stopped with better tactics
