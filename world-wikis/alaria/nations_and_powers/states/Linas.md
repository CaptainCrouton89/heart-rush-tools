## Linas

Tags: citystate, state, trade, dye

The dye capital of Alaria, built on a coast that would otherwise be unremarkable. Linas exists because a shipwrecked merchant discovered that the local shellfish—starfish, snails, and clams—contained pigments of extraordinary brilliance. That merchant built a fortune, and that fortune became a city.

Today, hundreds of ships leave Linas harbor each morning, heading for the Starfish Isles to harvest the shellfish that sustain the city's economy. The dye they produce—a brilliant orange-gold that holds its color through washing, sunlight, and years of wear—commands premium prices across Alaria. Nobles, merchants, and anyone who wants to signal wealth and taste pays handsomely for Linas pigments.

### Government

Linas is ruled by the **Dye Guilds**—the major merchant houses that control harvesting rights, processing facilities, and export networks. The guild masters collectively form a council that handles city governance, though "governance" mostly means protecting the dye trade and ensuring no single house gains too much advantage over the others.

The current balance of power involves five major guilds and perhaps a dozen minor ones. The major guilds control the best harvesting territories in the Starfish Isles, the largest processing facilities, and the most lucrative export contracts. The minor guilds fight for scraps—secondary harvesting grounds, subcontracting work, niche markets the majors don't bother with.

Guild politics are cutthroat but rarely violent. Reputation matters too much for open warfare. Instead, houses compete through quality, efficiency, and careful manipulation of harvesting quotas and trade agreements. The occasional poisoning or convenient accident happens, of course, but discreetly.

### The Starfish Isles

The foundation of Linas's wealth lies in the shallow waters north of the city. The Starfish Isles—a maze of sandbars, reefs, and tidal flats—contain the richest shellfish beds on the Seacleft Coast. The creatures that live there have shells saturated with pigment, concentrated in ways found nowhere else.

Linas claims exclusive harvesting rights to the isles, enforced by armed guild vessels that patrol the major channels. The dye guilds divide the harvesting grounds among themselves according to ancient agreements and more recent negotiations. Poaching is constant—the waters are too vast for complete control—but the guilds catch enough interlopers to make the risks real.

The harvesting season runs from late spring through early autumn. During peak months, the harbor empties each morning as the fleet heads out, and fills each evening with boats heavy with shellfish. The processing facilities run day and night, extracting pigment before the catch spoils.

### The Tide-Singers

On the outer reaches of the Starfish Isles, where the harvesting grounds give way to the Walker Depths, a small religious order maintains weathered shrines. The **Tide-Singers** perform ceremonies for the drowned dead who walk the seafloor below—singing names into the water to release trapped ancestors.

Most Linas harvesters consider the Singers harmless eccentrics. The guilds tolerate them because they provide shelter to boats caught in storms and seem to calm the waters near their shrines. A few old captains speak of them with genuine respect, claiming the Singers know things about the isles that no chart records.

The Singers accept no payment in coin. Families seeking their services must bring objects that belonged to the deceased, which the Singers weight with stones and drop into the depths. Whether the rituals work is a matter of faith.

### Economy

Dye dominates everything. The pigment extracted from Starfish Isles shellfish accounts for the vast majority of Linas's exports and tax revenue. Secondary industries exist—boat-building, net-making, barrel production, food services for the harvesting fleet—but all of them ultimately serve the dye trade.

The finished product travels across Alaria through legitimate trade networks and less legitimate ones. Linas merchants sell directly to textile producers in the Middle Sea states, to luxury goods traders in Tarkhon, to anyone with coin and a desire for color. The dye guilds maintain offices in major ports across the continent.

What the guilds don't openly acknowledge is how much of their product moves through Mirko. The lawless city-state to the south provides access to markets that respectable merchants can't reach—smuggling routes, black markets, customers who prefer not to leave paper trails. Linas dye ends up in places the guilds officially disapprove of, and everyone involved profits.

### Relations

**With Enavadi**: Cold indifference, occasionally warming to cold irritation. Enavadi fishermen work the northern edges of Linas's claimed waters, and the two groups have different ideas about where the boundaries lie. Conflicts are rare but sharp when they occur. The Enavadi consider Linas harvesters clumsy amateurs who mistake money for skill; Linas considers the Enavadi primitive isolationists with an inflated sense of their own importance.

**With Mirko**: Officially proper, practically intimate. Mirko's criminal networks distribute Linas dye to markets that guild merchants can't or won't touch directly. The guilds pretend their product ends up only in legitimate hands; Mirko pretends they're simple merchants. Everyone makes money.

Mirko's guilds also provide "protection" for Linas harvesting ships in the Starfish Isles—for a fee. This protection is remarkably effective, primarily because the main threat to harvesters is Mirko-affiliated pirates who know which ships have paid.

**With Everyone Else**: Linas trades with anyone who has coin. The dye guilds maintain commercial relationships across the Seacleft Coast and beyond, sending their product wherever there's demand. Politically, Linas prefers to stay neutral in regional conflicts—war is bad for business, and the city has no territorial ambitions beyond protecting its harvesting grounds.

### Culture

Linas is a merchant city, and merchant values dominate. Success is measured in coin, status in guild standing, respectability in the quality of one's business relationships. The city is cosmopolitan by necessity—traders from across Alaria pass through, and the guilds hire talent wherever they find it.

The dye trade shapes everything, including fashion. Wearing Linas orange is a statement of wealth across Alaria, but in Linas itself, the color is common enough to be unremarkable. The truly wealthy distinguish themselves through *other* colors—blues, purples, greens that must be imported at great expense—or through the subtle quality differences that mark master-grade dye from standard production.

The city smells of salt, shellfish, and the chemical tang of pigment extraction. New visitors find it overwhelming. Residents stop noticing within a week.

### Player Hooks

- **Harvesting Rights**: A minor guild wants to expand into waters claimed by a major house. They need evidence that the major house's charter doesn't actually cover the disputed area—evidence that might be found in old records, or might need to be manufactured.

- **The Vermilion Legacy**: Aldos Vermilion's fortune was supposedly distributed to the families of the Birthday Wreck victims. Some of it was. Not all. Someone knows where the rest went, and someone else wants to find out.

- **Tide-Singer Secrets**: The Singers know something about the Walker Depths—something the guilds would pay well to learn, or pay well to suppress. A dying Singer wants to pass on knowledge to someone outside the order.

- **Mirko Complications**: A Linas guild's Mirko contacts have become liabilities. The criminals know too much, want too large a cut, or have attracted attention the guild can't afford. The problem needs to be solved quietly, far from Linas, by people who can't be traced back.
