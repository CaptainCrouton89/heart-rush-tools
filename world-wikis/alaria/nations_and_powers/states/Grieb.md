## Grieb

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

The lakemen control the great lakes of the northeastern Wildwood—Cykravikus and the smaller lakes scattered through the surrounding hills. They're aquatic orcs who can breathe underwater and rarely speak above the surface, ruled by a hag queen who has dwelt in the deepest waters for centuries.

### Overview

Nobody attacks the Griebi because fighting them costs more than anyone is willing to pay.

The lakes in the hills are valuable—fresh water, fish, defensible terrain. Other orc states would happily take that land. But taking it means fighting aquatic orcs who can breathe underwater indefinitely, who hide in murky depths for days waiting to ambush, who have rows of needle-like teeth that tear flesh as easily as they catch fish.

Attack a Griebi settlement and they simply sink beneath the surface. Follow them and you're in their world—blind, gasping, flailing in cold dark water while shapes with too many teeth circle below. The Griebi don't need to win battles. They just need to make every battle so costly that invaders give up.

The other orc states tried, generations ago. The survivors decided it wasn't worth it.

### Government

**Type:** Absolute Monarchy (The Hag Queen)

The Griebi have no councils, no competing factions, no succession crises. There is the Queen, and there are her subjects. Her word is law. Her silence is also law. When she wants something done, it happens. When she is satisfied, the lakes are peaceful.

**The Hag Queen:**

No one knows her true name. She is simply the Queen, or the Deep Mother, or in whispered moments, She-Who-Knows. She dwells in the deepest part of Cykravikus Lake, in underwater caverns that no air-breather has ever seen. The Griebi commune with her through representatives who descend into the depths and return—sometimes days later, sometimes weeks—with her commands.

She is ancient. She is patient. She has outlived empires.

**The Silent Court:** A handful of Griebi elders who interpret the Queen's wishes and manage daily affairs. They meet in the shallows where air-breathers can survive, speaking in the minimal, gesture-heavy communication that the Griebi prefer above water. They do not explain the Queen's decisions. They implement them.

### Culture

**The Griebi** have blueish-gray skin that shimmers in certain lights. Their eyes are large and dark, adapted for murky depths. Most distinctively, they have multiple rows of long, needle-like teeth designed for catching fish underwater—a feature that makes encounters with them deeply unsettling for surface dwellers.

**Core Values:**
- **Silence Is Wisdom** — Words above water are wasted breath. Communication should be efficient, minimal, necessary.
- **The Deep Provides** — The lakes give everything the Griebi need. They want nothing from the surface world.
- **The Queen Knows Best** — Questioning her is not forbidden; it simply doesn't occur to anyone. She has been right for centuries.
- **What Happens Below Stays Below** — The depths are private. Surface dwellers do not need to understand.

**Society:** Griebi society is remarkably simple by orc standards. There are hunters and fishers, there are those who tend the underwater kelp gardens, there are the Queen's servants who communicate with her, and there are the rare individuals who interact with the surface world. No warrior caste, because no one attacks them. No smiths, because they don't use metal. No hierarchy beyond service to the Queen.

They are not hostile to visitors. They're simply... absent. A traveler passing through Griebi territory might see nothing but empty shores and still water. The Griebi are below, watching, and they will remain below unless they have reason to surface.

**Communication:** The Griebi speak rarely above water and use a complex language of hand signals, body positions, and facial expressions. Underwater, they produce a range of clicks and tones that travel perfectly through the lake. Surface dwellers describe Griebi verbal speech as halting, reluctant, and unsettling—each word seems to cost them something.

### Economy

**Size:** Small (possibly)
**Tech:** Unknown (underwater technology is hard to assess)

**Primary Exports:**
- Fish and lake products (traded minimally through intermediaries)
- Safe passage across the lakes (available to those who ask politely)
- Nothing else

**Primary Imports:**
- Nothing regular
- Occasionally, specific items—a particular type of glass, a rare metal, a book—requested through intermediaries with no explanation given

The Griebi economy is almost entirely internal. The lakes provide food. Underwater kelp provides material for tools and clothing. They need nothing from the surface world, and the surface world cannot easily take anything from them.

Trade happens, but it's strange. A Griebi representative will appear at a market town, purchase exactly what they came for, and leave without negotiating or socializing. They pay in freshwater pearls that they seem to have in abundance. They don't explain where they're going or why they need what they're buying.

### Military

**Size:** Small
**Quality:** Unknown (rarely tested)
**Enrollment:** As needed

The Griebi don't maintain a standing army because they've never needed one. When threats arise, the lake communities organize defense, but this hasn't happened in generations.

What's known about their fighting capability:
- They can breathe underwater, giving them escape routes and tactical options others lack
- Their needle-teeth make them dangerous in close quarters
- They know their lake terrain intimately
- They're patient—if threatened, they can simply wait in the water until attackers give up

**The Real Defense:** The lakes themselves. Any invasion force faces the same problem: the Griebi can retreat underwater and stay there indefinitely. Siege them out? They have the entire lake to fish. Storm the shores? They drag you into the shallows and tear you apart. The math never works for the attacker.

The Hag Queen presumably has power of her own, but no one's tested it in living memory.

### Geography

**Location:** Northeastern Wildwood, in the lake-dotted hills north of Tarn

**Biomes:** Freshwater lakes surrounded by forested hills; rocky shorelines

**Key Locations:**
- **Cykravikus Lake** — The great lake, deep and cold, where the Hag Queen makes her home. Multiple inlets extend into the surrounding hills.
- **The Shore Villages** — Griebi settlements along the lakeshores, built half on land, half extending into the shallows.
- **The Gathering Stone** — A flat rock near the lake's western edge where the Griebi occasionally meet with outsiders.
- **The Lesser Lakes** — Smaller lakes scattered through the hills, each with its own fishing communities.

**Borders:**
- South/Southwest: Tarn (distant, minimal contact)
- West: Uhionai (mutual wariness)
- North: Unclaimed wilderness
- East: The Steppe of Aziirn (no orcs there; just emptiness)

### Relations

**Every Other Orc State:** The same pattern. They leave the Griebi alone. The Griebi leave them alone. It's not friendship—it's practical. Why attack territory you can't hold against people you can't catch?

**Tarn:** The Tarni spirit-seers can sense the Hag Queen's power. They describe it as "old" and "deep" and "patient." They respect it the way one respects a sleeping dragon.

**Uhionai:** The Grove Council has memories that stretch back centuries—and those memories include reasons to avoid the lakes. First Root Yorunax has reportedly said, "Some bargains should not be broken." He does not elaborate.

**Shazuihn:** Even the boar riders learned. Two generations ago, a war-chief led fifty riders against the Griebi. They charged the shore villages. The Griebi retreated into the water. The raiders followed into the shallows. Three survivors made it back. They don't talk about what happened in that lake.

**Symonair the Dragon:** The dragon Symonair claims Symonair Lake to the south of Cykravikus. The two bodies of water are connected. The relationship between the Hag Queen and the dragon is unknown—but neither has attacked the other, and that alone is notable.

**The Orc Moot:** The Griebi send a representative. They listen. They rarely speak. When they do speak, everyone else listens.

### The Hag Queen

The Queen is ancient—older than the other orc states, possibly older than the orcs' arrival in the Wildwood. She rules the Griebi absolutely, and they serve her without question. What she wants, what she plans, what she thinks about the endless wars to the south—no outsider knows.

She doesn't need mysterious leverage to maintain peace with the other states. She just needs to be more trouble than she's worth, and she is.

### Conflicts

**None active.**

The Griebi have no ongoing conflicts because no one wants to start one. Their territory is valuable, but not valuable enough to justify the casualties. The other orc states have learned: pick fights you can win at acceptable cost. Fighting the Griebi isn't one of them.

### History

The Hag Queen was here before the orc states formed. Whether she created the Griebi, attracted them, or transformed ordinary orcs into aquatic forms is unknown. They serve her. They have always served her.

The other orc states tried attacking Grieb in the early days, before they understood what they were dealing with. Those attacks failed—not through magic or curses, but through the simple reality of fighting underwater enemies in their home territory. The lesson stuck.

### Player Hooks
