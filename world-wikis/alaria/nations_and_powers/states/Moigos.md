## Moigos

Tags: state, kappa, crime

A state ruled by criminals who don't bother pretending otherwise. Moigos occupies the swampy northern reaches of Petrona Septia Island, where the Kappa — massive, toad-like crime lords — have built an empire of debts, favors, and quiet violence. The official government exists on paper; real power flows through the counting houses and backroom deals where the Kappa conduct their business.

The arrangement works, after a fashion. Moigos is stable, prosperous by regional standards, and safe enough for those who understand the rules. The rules are simple: the Kappa get their cut, debts are paid, and no one asks questions about matters that don't concern them. Those who follow the rules live comfortable lives. Those who don't... don't.

### The Kappa

The toad-folk who dominate Moigos are not numerous — perhaps a few hundred in the entire state — but they don't need numbers. They have patience, intelligence, and an institutional memory that spans generations. A Kappa never forgets a debt. A Kappa never forgives a slight. And a Kappa never acts hastily when slow, methodical destruction will serve better.

The Kappa operate through networks of obligation. They lend money, provide services, solve problems — always at a price, always creating debts that can be called in later. Over generations, they've woven themselves into every aspect of Moigos commerce and politics. The merchant families who sit on Thetin's council owe their positions to Kappa backing. The river captains who move goods owe their boats to Kappa loans. Everyone owes something, and the Kappa keep meticulous records.

Violence is rare because it's rarely necessary. When a debtor fails to pay, the Kappa don't send thugs — they call in other debts, arrange for business to dry up, ensure that the defaulter's reputation is destroyed. By the time the process is complete, the target has lost everything without a single blow being struck. The occasional example is made, of course, pour encourager les autres. But the Kappa prefer financial ruin to physical violence. It's more profitable and less messy.

### Government

Moigos has a council of merchant families that meets in Thetin, deliberates on matters of policy, and issues decrees that everyone politely ignores. The council exists because states are supposed to have governments, and the Kappa find it useful to have a body that can sign treaties, receive ambassadors, and handle the tedious business of appearing legitimate.

The merchant families who serve on the council are not puppets, exactly. They have genuine interests, genuine wealth, and genuine influence within their spheres. But they hold their positions because the Kappa permit it, and they make decisions that the Kappa have already approved. The system works because everyone understands the arrangement and no one has any interest in disrupting it.

Real governance happens through the Kappa networks. Disputes are settled by whichever Kappa has the strongest claim on the parties involved. Infrastructure is maintained by whoever profits from it. Order is kept by the shared understanding that disorder is bad for business.

### Economy

Moigos produces timber from the Alegheim forest, agricultural products from the river valleys, and various goods processed in its towns. None of this is remarkable. What makes Moigos economically significant is its position as a hub for less legitimate commerce.

The Kappa networks extend far beyond Petrona Septia. Goods that can't be sold openly elsewhere find buyers in Moigos. Services that can't be procured legally can be arranged through the right contacts. Information flows through Kappa channels, and secrets are bought and sold like any other commodity.

The Isle of the Night adds another dimension. The Kappa don't control Blackpoint's supernatural darkness, but they control access to it. Treasure hunters seeking the island's rumored wealth must outfit their expeditions in Moigos, hire guides through Kappa-connected brokers, and often finance the whole venture with Kappa loans. Most expeditions fail. The Kappa profit either way.

### Culture

Life in Moigos is ordinary for those who stay within the rules. Farmers farm, merchants trade, craftspeople practice their crafts. The Kappa presence is felt but not seen — a background awareness that certain people are not to be crossed, certain questions are not to be asked, certain debts must always be paid.

The human and other non-Kappa inhabitants of Moigos have adapted to their situation. They're practical, cautious, and skilled at reading the subtle signs that indicate which way power is flowing. They don't resent the Kappa, exactly — the arrangement provides stability and opportunity for those who work within it. But they don't love them either. The relationship is transactional, and everyone knows it.

Religion is muted. The Kappa have no use for gods, and the faiths that flourish elsewhere find less purchase in a society built on earthly debts rather than divine ones. People observe the forms, mark the festivals, and keep their spiritual lives private.

### Relations

**With Ios**: Limited contact across the Screech Peaks. Ios has little that Moigos wants, and Moigos has little that Ios can afford. The mountain passes see some trade, handled through Calentia, but neither state has significant interest in the other.

**With Rilyn**: The Splinkreen city-state is too small and too strange to be worth the Kappa's attention. Rilyn's woodland people keep to their forest; the Kappa keep to their swamps. Occasional trade happens, but no significant relationship exists.

**With the Tuktuk**: Complicated. The turtle-folk of the Tyvern Isles are fierce, honorable, and not easily intimidated — qualities that make them poor targets for Kappa manipulation. But they're also practical, and some commerce flows between Moigos and Vitruk village. The Kappa treat the Tuktuk with more respect than they show most outsiders, recognizing that these are not people who can be safely exploited.

**With everyone else**: The Kappa networks extend wherever trade reaches. Moigos has contacts, agents, and debtors across the Seacleft Coast and beyond. The state itself is unimportant; the networks are everything.

### Player Hooks

- **Debt Collection**: The players owe a Kappa — or someone they care about does. The debt isn't money; it's a service, a secret, or something worse. The Kappa is patient. The Kappa can wait. But eventually, the debt comes due.

- **Blackpoint Expedition**: Someone wants to reach the lightless island and is willing to pay well. The Kappa will arrange everything — guides, equipment, financing. All they ask is a percentage of whatever's found. And if the expedition fails, well, the debt passes to the survivors. Or their families.

- **Network Disruption**: Someone powerful wants the Kappa networks damaged. Not destroyed — that's impossible — but disrupted enough to create opportunities. The players are deniable assets, and the target is a Kappa operation that's grown too ambitious.

- **The Honest Merchant**: A trader in Calentia has managed to operate outside Kappa influence for years. Now they want to expand to Thetin, and they need protection. The Kappa have noticed. Everyone's about to learn whether independence is possible in Moigos.

- **Don't Dig Too Deep**: A debtor escaped the Urun mining camps and made it to the players with a wild story — something in the upper peaks, something the Kappa are afraid of. The toad-folk want the escapee back, badly. They're offering to clear substantial debts, no questions asked. What did the debtor see that's worth that much silence?
