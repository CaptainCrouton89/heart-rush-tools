## Lenora

Tags: state, elves, confederation

The agricultural heartland of the elven confederation. Lenora occupies the fertile lowlands of the southern Farlands, bounded by the Ocean of Elorinia to the west, the Kelder Mountains to the east, and the Amholia Greras forest to the south. Of the three elven kingdoms, Lenora is the most populated, the most productive, and—its neighbors would say—the most ambitious.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Landsmeet (council of landholders)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Elves

**Population**: ~400,000 (largest of the three kingdoms)

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:
- Productivity and stewardship of the land
- Respect for ancestral holdings
- Confederation loyalty (contested)
- Ritual and seasonal observance

The **Landsmeet** governs Lenora—a council of every elf who holds productive land. In theory, this is democratic. In practice, the ancient families who settled the river valleys generations ago control most of the good territory. The Landsmeet convenes in Jien Asari four times yearly, aligned with the solstices and equinoxes.

#### The Succession Question

The Landsmeet has always been led by a **High Steward**—a position that rotates among the twelve founding families according to a schedule set nearly 3,000 years ago. The rotation made sense then: twelve families, twelve positions in the cycle, each ruling for a century before passing the mantle.

But time has complicated matters. Three of the original families have died out entirely. Two others merged through marriage five centuries ago. Meanwhile, families that were minor landholders at the founding now control vast territories through shrewd acquisition and favorable harvests.

The current schedule no longer reflects reality. Families that no longer exist still have their turn "reserved." Living families argue over who inherits the empty slots. The families enriched by recent centuries demand inclusion in the rotation. Those who benefit from the old schedule refuse to renegotiate.

This is not a class conflict—everyone involved is traditional, respects the ancestors, and believes in the old ways. They simply disagree about which old ways apply. The dispute has simmered for two centuries without resolution. Every Landsmeet spends at least a day arguing about it before moving to other business.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Grain, preserved foods, timber, Elorshianod hardwoods, river fish, cultural goods

**Primary Imports**: Titan-bone ritual objects (from Deo Esari), mountain herbs, metals

Lenora feeds the confederation. The kingdom's three great rivers—Kilgre Kevi, Kilgre Apnuk, and Kilgre Thovrys—water vast agricultural lands. The eastern plains between Elorshianod forest and the Kelder foothills are among the most productive farmland on the continent.

Grain barges travel constantly between the interior farms and the coastal ports. Eilren Thalas and Jien Asari handle most of the trade; Imyena Edhil operates independently (see below).

The Lenorans also harvest Elorshianod's hardwoods—carefully, ritually, with appropriate offerings. The lumber is prized throughout the known world, though the elves sell relatively little of it. Most goes to confederation shipyards or internal construction.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Traditional levy system

Lenora maintains a small professional guard for the major cities and relies on levy obligations for larger conflicts. Every landholder must provide soldiers proportional to their holdings—another ancient rule that causes friction when new-wealth families are assessed at rates set for their ancestors' tiny plots.

The Lenoran military has not fought a serious external war in over a millennium. Their most recent conflicts have been minor border disputes with Rakite herders and occasional bandit suppression. The soldiers are well-trained but untested.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Farlands, between Ocean of Elorinia and Kelder Mountains

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, fertile plains, river valleys

**Major Geographic Features**:
- **Elorshianod**: The great coastal forest, running north-south along the western shore. Unlike Illron's sacred forest, Elorshianod is settled and worked—river towns dot both banks of the Kilgre Kevi and Kilgre Apnuk.
- **Starluck Hills**: Southern hill country separating Lenora proper from the Amholia Greras. Named for the phosphorescent fungi that bloom on autumn nights.
- **Vokas Pendl**: The northern mountain spur where the Kilgre Kevi originates.

**Rivers & Lakes**:
- **Kilgre Kevi**: Northern river, flows from Vokas Pendl through Elorshianod to the coast
- **Kilgre Apnuk**: Central river with many tributaries, feeds the capital at Jien Asari
- **Kilgre Thovrys**: Southern river, feeding the isolated port of Imyena Edhil

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Jien Asari (inland, on the Kilgre Apnuk)

**Major Cities**:
- **Eilren Thalas**: Primary port, southwestern coast. Handles most foreign trade.
- **Imyena Edhil**: Southern port on Kilgre Thovrys. Deliberately isolated—see below.

**Coastal Settlements**: Galaena Ancalen, Imsegroth, Ufa Caelora (along Kilgre Kevi from Vokas Pendl to ocean)

**Forest Settlements**: Numerous towns within Elorshianod along both major rivers

**Eastern Settlements**: Agricultural villages in the fertile plains before the Kelder foothills

### Imyena Edhil — The City of the Grieving

Imyena Edhil has no roads connecting it to the rest of Lenora. The only access is by river (Kilgre Thovrys) or sea. This is deliberate.

The city is home to the **Grieving**—elves who have committed the sin of forgetting a true name. In elven belief, when you forget someone's true name, their spirit is lost forever to the void beyond Celestia. The most permanent death possible. If you are responsible for this loss—through negligence, malice, or simple failure of memory—you have committed something unforgivable.

The Grieving are exiled to Imyena Edhil. They may never leave. The walls around the city aren't to keep enemies out—they're to keep the Grieving in. These elves are considered spiritually contaminated. Prolonged contact with them might cause others to forget.

But Imyena Edhil is still a city, not a prison camp:
- The Grieving have children, and those children inherit the stain
- The city has existed for millennia; thousands of elves live there now
- They've built their own society—fishing, river trade within limits, crafts
- Ships can dock at the river mouth, but outsiders rarely enter the walls

The city is not a hellhole. The Grieving have festivals, families, art, love. But there's a weight to the place. Everyone knows why they're there. Everyone knows they'll never leave. Visitors describe Imyena Edhil as beautiful but heavy—like the whole city is holding its breath.

Anyone who flees Imyena Edhil is hunted. Not killed—returned. The other cities don't want the Grieving among them.

### Relations

**Illron**: Tense. Lenora has the population and wealth; Illron has tradition and the sacred forest. The confederation's one-kingdom-one-voice voting structure favors Illron, and Lenora resents it. But neither side wants to break the alliance—the ancestors who signed the Three Kingdoms Treaty are still watching at Laeroth Esori.

**Deo Esari**: Cordial but distant. Lenora needs Deo Esari's titan-bone ritual objects for certain ceremonies; Deo Esari needs Lenora's food. Neither particularly likes the other. Deo Esari views Lenora as vulgar and too concerned with growth; Lenora views Deo Esari as hidebound and self-righteous.

**Rakite**: Formal trade relations with the buffalo-herding elves to the east. The Rakiteans don't participate in the confederation, but they're still kin. Trade is regulated, ritualized, and generally peaceful.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Succession Question**: Which families control the High Steward rotation? No resolution in sight.
- **Confederation Representation**: Should Lenora's larger population mean more votes at Laeroth Esori? The ancestors said no. But the ancestors didn't anticipate Lenora growing to four times Illron's population.
- **Imyena Edhil**: Some younger Lenorans question whether the Grieving truly deserve eternal exile. This is considered a dangerous opinion to hold publicly.

### History

The elves of what would become Lenora arrived in the Farlands roughly 5,000 years ago, part of a larger migration from the east. They settled the river valleys, cleared portions of Elorshianod for farming, and gradually pushed the forest's original inhabitants—various fae creatures—southward into what is now Amholia Greras.

The Three Kingdoms Treaty, signed at Laeroth Esori approximately 4,000 years ago, established the confederation and ended centuries of border warfare between the elven polities. Lenora has honored the treaty since, though not always happily.

The founding of Imyena Edhil is not recorded in official histories. The city simply exists, and always has, in the memories of living elves. Some scholars believe it predates the confederation itself—that the Grieving were being exiled even before the three kingdoms formally united.
