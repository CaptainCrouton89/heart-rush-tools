## Ios

Tags: state, decline, constructs

A civilization running out of time. Ios built its society around the stone dolls — animated servants of stone and porcelain that handled all manual labor, freeing the human population for leisure, art, and governance. For generations, this arrangement worked beautifully. The dolls farmed the fields, hauled the goods, built the buildings, and asked nothing in return.

Then the dolls started breaking. And no one remembered how to make new ones.

The art of creating stone dolls was lost generations ago — how, exactly, is a matter of bitter debate among Ios scholars. Some say the last craftmasters died in a plague without passing on their knowledge. Others claim the secrets were deliberately destroyed to prevent the dolls from being weaponized. A few whisper that the dolls themselves somehow arranged for the knowledge to be lost. Whatever the cause, the result is the same: Ios has hundreds of stone dolls, they break down at a steady rate, and there will never be more.

### The Stone Dolls

The dolls are humanoid figures of stone and porcelain, ranging from three to seven feet tall depending on their function. They move smoothly, respond to simple commands, and perform physical labor with tireless precision. They don't speak, don't eat, don't sleep. They simply work until they break.

No one knows exactly how they function. The craftmasters who created them understood the animating principles; modern Ios citizens understand only that the dolls exist and must be maintained. Repairs are possible — broken limbs can be reattached, cracked surfaces can be sealed — but fundamental failures cannot be fixed. When a doll's animating core fails, it becomes a statue. Nothing anyone has tried can restore it.

The dolls are treated with a strange mixture of casual use and anxious care. They're tools, worked hard because the work must be done. But they're also irreplaceable, and every citizen knows that each broken doll brings Ios closer to a future where humans must do the labor themselves.

### The Crisis

The mathematics are simple and merciless. Ios has perhaps three hundred functioning stone dolls. They break down at an average rate of five to ten per year. In a generation, there will be none left. In two generations, Ios will be indistinguishable from any other state where humans do their own work.

The ruling families understand this. They've spent fortunes trying to rediscover the lost art — hiring scholars, sponsoring expeditions to find lost texts, offering rewards for anyone who can repair a failed doll. Nothing has worked. The closest anyone has come was a scholar who identified the rare stone from which the dolls were carved; the quarries at Petras were supposedly exhausted long ago, and no new deposits have been found.

The population is slowly adapting. Young people learn trades their grandparents never practiced. Fields that were maintained by dolls are being abandoned or converted to less labor-intensive uses. The terraced city of Todakres is contracting downward as the upper levels become impractical without doll labor. It's not catastrophic — Ios will survive — but the graceful society of generations past is already gone.

### Government

Ios is ruled by a council of noble families — the descendants of those who first established the stone doll tradition. Their authority was once based on control of the dolls; now it's based on tradition, wealth, and the absence of any alternative.

The council meets in Todakres, in halls that were built to showcase the dolls' capabilities. The architecture is impressive and increasingly impractical — grand staircases that strain human bearers, high ceilings that require scaffolding to maintain, elaborate mechanisms that only doll strength can operate. The noble families maintain these spaces out of pride, even as practical governance moves to more accessible locations.

Decision-making is slow and conservative. The families are paralyzed by their situation, unable to imagine a future without the dolls but equally unable to prevent it. Bold proposals are rejected because they're too risky; cautious proposals are rejected because they're too slow. The council debates while the dolls continue to break.

### Economy

Ios was once wealthy — the dolls enabled production that would be impossible with human labor alone. Now that wealth is eroding. Agricultural output has fallen as fields are abandoned. Manufacturing has declined as doll-powered workshops stand idle. Trade has shrunk as Ios has less to offer and more difficulty getting goods to market.

The shallow harbor at Methons compounds the problem. Ios can't easily import the labor-intensive goods it once produced domestically, and it can't easily export what it still makes. The state is slowly becoming self-sufficient by necessity, retreating from the broader economy as its capabilities diminish.

What remains valuable: the dolls themselves. Other states have noticed Ios's predicament and offered to purchase functioning dolls. The council has refused — selling the dolls would accelerate the decline — but as the situation worsens, the temptation grows. Some have been stolen. Some may have been sold quietly. The council doesn't discuss it.

### Culture

Ios culture was shaped by abundance — generations of humans who never performed manual labor, who grew up watching dolls handle every physical task, who developed arts and philosophies suited to lives of leisure. This culture persists even as its foundations crumble.

The noble families still maintain elaborate households, still observe complex social rituals, still patronize artists and scholars. But the rituals feel hollow now, the patronage is constrained by shrinking resources, and everyone knows that the next generation will live differently. Some families have adapted, training their children in practical skills. Others refuse, insisting that their way of life will somehow continue.

The common people are more practical. They've already begun the transition to working society, taking up trades and agriculture that their ancestors never practiced. There's resentment toward the nobles who delayed this adaptation, but also a surprising resilience. Ios citizens have survived harder things than learning to carry their own water.

### Relations

**With Moigos**: Minimal. The mountain passes are difficult, and neither state has much to offer the other. The Kappa have shown no interest in Ios — a declining state with no significant trade connections is not worth infiltrating.

**With Rilyn**: Occasional contact through the eastern passes. The Splinkreen find Ios fascinating — a culture built around artificial servants, now learning to serve itself. Some Splinkreen scholars have visited Todakres to study the dolls. Whether they learned anything useful, they haven't shared.

**With everyone else**: Ios is increasingly isolated. The state that once traded throughout the Seacleft Coast now struggles to get goods to market. Foreign merchants still visit, but their numbers decline each year as Ios has less to buy and sell.

### Notable Locations

- **Todakres**: Mountain capital, terraced city slowly contracting downward
- **Methons**: Coastal city with shallow harbor, limited maritime access
- **Petras**: Quarry town, source of the stone used for dolls
- **Rhodanos**: Agricultural center, fields shrinking as doll labor fails
- **Tolosa**: Market town, adapting better than most
- **Capsa**: River confluence town with defensive walls
- **Koilos**: Southern forest, largely unexplored, rumored ruins

### Player Hooks

- **The Last Craftmaster**: Rumors persist of a surviving craftmaster — or their notes, or their apprentice, or something that could restore the art of doll creation. The noble families will pay handsomely for any lead. So will foreign powers who want the secret for themselves.

- **Doll Theft**: Functioning dolls are being stolen from Ios estates, appearing later in foreign markets. Someone is running an operation, and the council wants it stopped — but some council members might be involved.

- **The Petras Deposits**: A prospector claims to have found new deposits of the specialized stone used for doll construction. If true, it could save Ios — or spark a war for control of the resource. If false, it's a scam. Either way, someone needs to investigate.

- **Koilos Expedition**: The ruins in the Koilos forest might hold secrets from before the stone doll tradition — including, possibly, alternative forms of magical labor. A noble family is funding an expedition. The forest has killed previous explorers, but desperation makes people brave.

- **The Awakening**: A stone doll has started behaving strangely — responding to commands differently, moving when not instructed, perhaps even attempting to communicate. Is it malfunctioning, or is something else happening? And what does it mean for the other dolls?
