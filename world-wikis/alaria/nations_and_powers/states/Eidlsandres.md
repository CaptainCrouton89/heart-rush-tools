## Eidlsandres

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hidden magocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gnomes

**Population**: 15,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Secrecy, knowledge, self-sufficiency, privacy

- Eidlsandres is ruled by a council of master illusionists—the most skilled handmagic practitioners among the gnomes. Succession is based purely on demonstrated magical ability.
- The city-state doesn't officially exist. No maps show it. No trade routes lead to it. Visitors aren't welcome because visitors don't know there's anywhere to visit.
- The gnomes here have maintained total isolation for centuries. They grow their own food in the hidden valleys of the Bygone Hills, craft their own goods, and want nothing from the outside world.
- Every citizen learns the basics of illusion magic. The children's games involve creating false paths and phantom obstacles. By adulthood, most can sustain minor illusions indefinitely.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- Eidlsandres is completely self-sufficient. The Bygone Hills contain everything the gnomes need—arable land, fresh water, timber, stone, and the air leyline that powers their illusions.
- Internal economy exists but operates differently than outsider systems. Status comes from magical skill and contribution to the collective deception, not wealth.
- The gnomes produce sophisticated magical items—primarily illusion-based—but these never leave the city. The knowledge of how to make them is considered the city's most precious resource.
- No currency from outside is accepted because no outsiders are allowed to exist within the borders.

### Military

**Size**: None (traditional)

**Quality**: Extremely High (magical defense)

**Enrollment**: Universal (illusory training)

- Eidlsandres has no standing army. It doesn't need one.
- The entire region is laced with layered illusions of staggering complexity. False paths lead in circles. Phantom cliffs appear over safe ground. Real hazards are hidden behind images of meadows. The Bygone Hills themselves are one continuous trap.
- Goblins from the surrounding plains know only that their people who enter the hills never return. They don't know why—they've never found bodies, never found evidence of what killed them. They simply vanish.
- The truth is simpler and more elegant: they get lost. They walk in circles until they starve, fall into hidden ravines, or simply wander back out with no memory of where they were trying to go. The illusions don't kill; they redirect.
- In the rare event that someone penetrates the outer defenses, the gnomes can deploy more aggressive magic. But it's never been necessary.

### Primary Conflicts

**Maintaining the Veil**

The illusions that protect Eidlsandres require constant maintenance. The air leyline provides power, but the spells must be tended, adjusted, updated. As generations pass, some young gnomes question whether total isolation is worth the effort. So far, the elders' answer has been emphatic: yes.

**The Occasional Penetrator**

Every few decades, someone gets further into the hills than they should. A particularly perceptive traveler, a mage who senses the illusions, an accidental stumble onto a real path. When this happens, the gnomes must decide what to do. Usually, they simply erase the intruder's memory and redirect them outward. Occasionally, the situation is more complicated.

**The Air Leyline**

The leyline that runs through Eidlsandres is the source of their power—and a potential vulnerability. If it were disrupted, damaged, or drained, the illusions would fail. The gnomes guard the leyline's physical manifestation sites jealously, and study constantly to ensure they understand every fluctuation in its flow.

**The Outside World's Encroachment**

The goblin plains are chaotic but stable. The forests are steady. But the world beyond is changing—wars, migrations, magical catastrophes. Eidlsandres has survived by being irrelevant, not worth finding. If the region ever becomes strategically important, isolation may become harder to maintain.

### History

Eidlsandres was founded by gnomes fleeing persecution—the specific details lost even to them, so many generations ago that the original threat has probably ceased to exist. They found the Bygone Hills and its air leyline, recognized the potential, and began the great work of vanishing.

The first generation built the physical city. The second mastered the leyline. The third perfected the outer illusions. Each generation since has refined the techniques, adding layers, patching weaknesses, extending the protected zone further into the surrounding hills.

The gnomes remember that they came from somewhere, that they had enemies, that they chose to disappear. They've preserved this history as a warning: the outside world is dangerous, unpredictable, and best avoided. Better to tend your gardens, practice your craft, and let the chaos pass by unnoticed.

For centuries, the system has worked. The goblins of the plains treat the Bygone Hills as cursed, avoiding them instinctively. The Eloweir to the west know something strange exists to their east but have never investigated seriously. The rest of the world doesn't know the Bygone Hills contain anything more interesting than rocks and scrub.

Eidlsandres intends to keep it that way.
