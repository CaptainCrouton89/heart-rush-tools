### Primary Conflicts

- Argysis is locked in a currently bloodless war of vengeance with Anarak. Neither can commit to a full war against any other neighbor till the other is removed, but neither is strong enough to remove the other. Argysis is weaker, but is fortified in the mountain, so cannot be pried out. Anarak is stronger, but hundreds of miles of burnable farmland.
- Argysis wants to take over Hephake, which used to be its sibling kingdom, but cannot leave Argysis ungaurded.
