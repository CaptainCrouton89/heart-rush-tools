## Eloesi

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Democratic republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Eloweir (Sea Elves)

**Population**: 80,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Freedom, tradition, excellence, community

- Eloesi is governed by elected councils—a system the Eloweir brought with them when they first settled these shores, long before human memory. The councils are notoriously deliberative, but their decisions carry weight.
- The culture blends apparent contradictions: sailors who party through the night and fishermen who observe strict protocols about when, where, and how to harvest. Freedom within structure.
- Outsiders often mistake Eloweir casualness for softness. The sea elves are skilled soldiers and masters of poison—their relaxed demeanor comes from confidence, not weakness.
- The Eloweir have lived here longer than anyone can remember. They say their ancestors followed the tides from somewhere else, fleeing a calamity they don't name, and found this coast waiting. Whether that's history or myth, none can say.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Pearls, fish, ships, poisons, dyes, salt

**Primary Imports**: Timber, grain, metals, luxury goods

- Oyster Bay's pearls are legendary—thousands harvested each season, each one valuable, the finest worth small fortunes. The Eloweir guard the bay jealously and have refined pearl cultivation to an art form.
- Fishing and shipping form the economic backbone. Eloweir ships are built to last, designed for the unpredictable coastal waters, and command premium prices.
- Poison-craft is a respected trade here, not a shameful secret. Eloweir alchemists produce venoms for hunting, warfare, and medicine with equal skill.
- Trade flows through Kair to the goblin plains, the United Free Nations, and the wider Middle Sea. Eloesi serves as the gateway between Ofrenia and the southern interior.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Eloweir maintain a professional military of exceptional quality. Every soldier trains for years before active duty, and the standards are unforgiving.
- Naval power is paramount. The Eloweir fleet patrols the coast, protects trade routes, and can project force across the region when needed.
- Land forces are smaller but elite—skilled with spear, bow, and the traditional curved blades the Eloweir favor. Many carry poisoned weapons as a matter of course.
- The military serves the councils, not individual commanders. Political ambition among officers is viewed with deep suspicion.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Goblin Chaos**

The Shiverplains and Jinxz Plains to the east and south are home to Scalawag goblin broods locked in perpetual, chaotic conflict. The goblins occasionally raid Eloweir settlements, more for sport than strategy. The Eloweir respond with punitive expeditions that accomplish little—the goblins simply scatter and regroup. It's an annoyance rather than a threat, but a persistent one.

**The Urchin Bay Question**

Urchin Bay, south of Oyster Bay, is too dangerous to harvest safely. Giant urchins and worse lurk in its waters, and ships that enter rarely return intact. Rumors persist of treasure in the depths—wrecks accumulated over centuries. Every few years, someone organizes an expedition. Most fail.

**Old Talaria's Shadow**

The fallen empire to the southwest radiates strangeness. Wild magic seeps across the border, and creatures that shouldn't exist occasionally wander into Eloweir territory. The councils maintain a standing watch along the Glass Forest border, but containment is difficult when the threat is so unpredictable.

**The Bygone Hills Mystery**

Goblins who wander into the Bygone Hills east of Glidwyn Forest never return. The Eloweir know something lurks there but have never investigated seriously—the hills aren't their territory, and whatever kills goblins efficiently is doing them a favor. Still, some councillors worry about what might emerge if it ever decides to expand.

### History

The Eloweir came to these shores in an age before human record, following currents and tides from somewhere across the sea. They speak of a homeland lost to catastrophe—some say flood, others say war, still others say both—but the details have faded into myth. What remains is the journey: generations of sea elves sailing toward a coast they'd never seen, guided by currents they trusted to lead them right.

They found a good land. Rocky coasts full of sheltered harbors. Forests for timber. Hills for grazing. And Oyster Bay, with its wealth waiting to be harvested. The Eloweir built Kair on a natural harbor, established their councils as they had in the old country, and began the slow work of making this place home.

For most of recorded history, Eloesi has been stable, prosperous, and largely uninvolved in the wars that wrack other nations. The councils prefer trade to conquest, diplomacy to battle. When threats arise—goblin raids, pirates, the occasional ambitious neighbor—the Eloweir respond with precise, professional force, then return to their nets and ships.

The fall of Old Talaria, centuries ago, changed the neighborhood permanently. Where once a powerful magical civilization bordered Eloesi to the southwest, now there's only the Glass Forest and the wild things within it. The Eloweir watched the cataclysm from a safe distance, grateful their ancestors had never trusted Talarian magic. Whatever the wizards attempted, it ended badly for everyone except the fae.
