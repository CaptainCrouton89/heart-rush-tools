### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Kritarchy (tribal council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gozi (Goshwen variant)

**Population**: 3,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Universal goodness, afterlife, kindness

- Tribal society—each village is sovereign, but tribes come together for celebrations, trade, and diplomacy.
- No formal laws. Issues are brought before a tribal council and decided collectively. The worst punishment is banishment from the tribe.
- They fly on **large raptors** that hunt the gorges. Tribes are oriented around the breeding and training of these birds.
- The most honored position in society is **raptor pilot**—those who bond with and ride the great birds.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Very Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- Very little trade with the outside world. The Gozi are deeply isolated and prefer it that way.
- The raptors are sacred—not for sale. To hunt them is strictly forbidden and would bring the wrath of all tribes.
- Internal trade happens at **Rompur Liko**, the winter bazaar.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- No formal military, but the raptors make for devastating aerial cavalry when the gorges need defending.
- The terrain itself is the best defense—outsiders who enter the canyons without guides rarely survive.

### Geography

**Location**: South of Stipen, north of Kazül, in a region of deep gorges and stone spires

**Biomes**: Canyon country—red rock gorges, stone spires, mesas, sparse desert scrubland

**Climate**: Arid high desert—hot days, cold nights, little rainfall

**Named Features**: Sighing Canyons (central), Clay Hills (east), The Lizard's Back (northern border), Tootby Hills (northwest), Dzobi Lands (southwest)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (tribal—no central authority)

**Cities**: None

**Villages**: Nod, Tilik, Pil, Kilam, Shraz, Fimli, Hechaw, Shyat, and others scattered through the canyons

### Rompur Liko

A temporary winter bazaar where all the tribes of Zintacas gather to trade with one another. The entire fair takes place on a small island cliff connected to its surroundings via long rope bridges. For one week each winter, the isolated tribes become a single community—then scatter back to their gorges until next year.

### Primary Conflicts

**Isolationism**

Zintacas has massive prejudice against outside cultures and technology. They don't understand the outside world, don't want to understand it, and violently reject attempts to change their ways. Outsiders who enter uninvited are driven out—or worse.

**The Raptors**

Occasionally, outsiders try to capture or kill the great raptors. This unites all tribes in furious retaliation. Several would-be poachers have been dropped from great heights.

### History

The Gozi have lived in these canyons for as long as anyone remembers. They bonded with the raptors, learned to fly the gorges, and built their society around the birds and the stone. The outside world passed them by, and they were content.

They remain content. The canyons provide everything they need. The raptors are their partners, not their property. The tribes are family. Why would anyone want anything else?
