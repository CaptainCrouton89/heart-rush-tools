## Roule

Tags: state, halfling, colonial, greenwater isles

A colonial halfling nation built on emptied land and sustained by honey, slavery, and selective memory. Roule is wealthy, orderly, and ruthless—a civilization that has perfected the art of not seeing what it doesn't want to see.

Three centuries ago, halfling colonists arrived on these shores. Within two generations, a plague had swept through the indigenous human population. The halflings called it providence. The survivors fled into the interior forest and have never forgotten. Today, Roule is one of the most prosperous nations in the Greenwater Isles, its flower fields and honey trade funding an expanding colonial enterprise. The price of that prosperity is paid by slaves, subjugated peoples, and the ghosts of those who came before.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant Oligarchy (Parliamentary Facade)

The Parliament of Flowers meets in Fozyader and passes laws with great ceremony. Real power rests with the Honey Lords—the dozen or so merchant families who control flower cultivation, honey processing, and the slave trade. The Parliament elects a Prime Consul every five years; the Honey Lords ensure their preferred candidate wins.

The system is stable because it's profitable. Every Honey Lord has enough wealth to be content, and competition is channeled into social status rather than political conflict. When disputes arise, they're settled in private clubs over honeyed wine, not in the streets.

**Primary Inhabitants**: Halflings

Roule is overwhelmingly halfling—roughly 85% of the population. The remainder includes human merchants and sailors, a small gnomish artisan community in Kabilcuz, and slaves of various races. The Velani humans of Murderwood are not counted in any census.

**Population**: ~180,000

**Stability**: Stable

The colonial economy generates enough wealth to keep most halflings comfortable. Dissent is rare and quickly addressed. The major instabilities are external: the Velani in Murderwood, Nylos resistance, tensions with Xoth, and the ongoing Rakite expansion.

**Core Values**:

- **Commerce above all**: Profit is virtue. Successful merchants are respected; poverty is a moral failing.
- **Respectability**: What matters is appearance. Private sins are tolerated; public scandal is unforgivable.
- **Progress**: Roule is civilization advancing into wilderness. This belief justifies everything.
- **Selective memory**: The past is what we say it is. Uncomfortable truths are simply not discussed.

### Culture

Roulean halflings are polite, industrious, and quietly vicious. Social interaction follows elaborate rules of courtesy that everyone understands and no one violates publicly. Insults are delivered through praise; rejection comes wrapped in apology. Outsiders often mistake this for friendliness and learn otherwise too late.

Status is everything. Hat styles indicate profession and rank. Flower pins show family affiliation. Seating arrangements at public events communicate subtle hierarchies. A halfling can read another's entire social position at a glance and adjust their behavior accordingly.

The wind is central to Roulean identity. Greetings wish "fair winds." Curses wish "still air." Weather vanes top every building. Children learn wind-reading before letters. This obsession is practical—Roule's constant winds power mills, fill sails, and shape agriculture—but it's also cultural. Movement is virtue; stagnation is death.

**Food & Drink**: Honey features in everything. Honeyed meats, honey-glazed vegetables, honey wines, honey-sweetened teas. Visitors find it cloying; locals can't imagine food without it. The cuisine otherwise emphasizes preserved fish, root vegetables, and dense breads suitable for the windy plains.

**Religion**: Roule's official faith centers on Gythry, daemon of commerce and fair exchange—interpreted locally as blessing profit and punishing those who interfere with trade. Shrines to Gythry appear in every marketplace. The Honey Lords fund elaborate temples while ignoring the irony of a "fair exchange" deity blessing their slave markets.

**Taboos**: Never mention the previous inhabitants. Never suggest the plague wasn't natural. Never imply Murderwood contains anything but animals. These silences are enforced through social pressure rather than law—violators find themselves uninvited to gatherings, passed over for contracts, quietly excluded from polite society.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

Roule punches above its weight economically. The honey trade alone would make it prosperous; combined with fishing, shipbuilding, and the slave trade, it's genuinely wealthy.

**Primary Exports**:
- **Taberthine honey**: Sharpens mental acuity (+1 cunning). Prized by scholars, merchants, and anyone facing important negotiations.
- **Zindwatt honey**: Induces gentle euphoria. Technically regulated; practically available to anyone with coin.
- **Preserved fish**: Roule's fishing fleets supply much of the Greenwater Isles.
- **Ships**: Kabilcuz and Teldib yards produce quality vessels.
- **Slaves**: Officially "modest domestic trade." Practically, a significant export to nations with fewer scruples.

**Primary Imports**:
- Iron and steel (limited local mining)
- Luxury goods for the Honey Lords
- Timber (Murderwood makes local logging... complicated)
- Exotic spices and goods from Xoth, Urok, and beyond

**Currency**: The Roulean Bloom—gold coins stamped with a stylized flower. Silver "petals" and copper "seeds" serve smaller transactions.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (with strong social pressure)

Roule's military is primarily naval. The fleet based at Teldib is the largest in the southern Greenwater Isles—fast patrol vessels, heavy warships, and the specialized prison-tender ships that supply Sunbeam Prison. Land forces are smaller but well-trained, focused on garrison duty and colonial expansion rather than large-scale warfare.

The navy operates with significant autonomy under Admiral Tessara Brightwater, a politically ambitious officer who has expanded her mandate steadily over the past decade. Her loyalty to the Honey Lords is... conditional.

**Notable Forces**:
- **The Teldib Fleet**: Main naval force. Approximately 40 combat vessels plus support ships.
- **Fairn's Pride**: Elite squadron named for the admiral who broke Xoth's naval power. Handles the most sensitive missions.
- **The Colonial Rangers**: Land forces specializing in "frontier security." Currently deployed in Rakite.
- **The Bay Watch**: Patrol force that guards Sunbeam Prison and monitors the Bay of Roule.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Velani Problem**

The survivors of the plague live in Murderwood. They call themselves the Velani—"the remaining"—and they have not forgotten what the halflings did. For three centuries they've held the forest against every attempt at pacification. The Honey Lords publicly maintain that Murderwood contains only dangerous animals. Privately, military planners know the truth and have no solution.

The Velani kill halflings on sight. They trade occasionally with outsiders through hidden intermediaries, accepting iron and salt in exchange for forest goods. Whether they could ever threaten Roule directly is unknown—but the possibility haunts those who know the real history.

**Nylos Subjugation**

The islands of Nylos were once independent. Now they're a Roulean territory, their people taxed, their fishing rights controlled, their resistance fighters tried in Samandoken and executed in the public square. The Nylosi haven't forgotten independence, and the younger generation is increasingly willing to fight for it.

Roule maintains order through military presence, economic control, and exemplary punishment. So far, it's been enough. But the occupation is expensive, the Nylosi are patient, and every execution creates new martyrs.

**Xoth Tensions**

Two centuries ago, Admiral Fairn sank a Xothian fleet in the passage that now bears his name. Relations have never recovered. The nations maintain formal peace, but naval "incidents" occur regularly, trade negotiations are hostile, and both sides assume the other is planning something.

The conflict is partly territorial (disputed island claims), partly economic (competing trade routes), and partly pure historical grudge. Neither side wants open war, but neither side will back down.

**Rakite Expansion**

Roule is currently colonizing Rakite—burning grasslands for farms, establishing settlements, pushing ever westward. The colonists insist the land is empty. It isn't. The Rakiten elves have lived there for millennia, and they're beginning to realize that retreat won't save them.

Back in Fozyader, the Honey Lords know only what the Colonial Rangers tell them: progress is good, expansion is profitable, the land is available. The truth—that Roule is repeating its founding crime—hasn't reached them yet. When it does, they'll probably find a way not to see it.

**The Colonial Villages**

Three settlements now dot the eastern Rakite peninsula, all drawing water from the Ves Neles river system:

*Kilik* is the oldest and largest—twenty years established, grown from a frontier outpost into something approaching a proper town. Wooden buildings cluster around a central square, a small Gythry temple serves the faithful, and the original ford across the Ves Neles is now a proper bridge. Population around 400. The Colonial Rangers maintain their regional headquarters here.

*Ilyasca* lies downstream in low hills, chosen for its defensible position. The settlers here are the most nervous of the three villages—they insist something watches them from the tall grass. Livestock goes missing. Fires start without explanation. The Rangers dismiss it as frontier paranoia. Population around 200.

*Golyayla* occupies the river mouth where the Ves Neles meets the sea. Primarily a fishing village, it receives supply ships from Roule proper at its small dock. The colonists here spend more time looking seaward than inland, which may be why they sleep better than their neighbors. Population around 150.

A trail connects all three villages, maintained by the Rangers for supply runs and patrol routes. The colonists believe they're civilizing empty wilderness. They don't know the Rakiten exist. They don't know they're being watched.

### History

**The Arrival (c. 3076 SD)**: Halfling colonists from [eastern origins] make landfall at what becomes Kabilcuz. They find a populated land—humans living in coastal villages and the interior plains.

**The Plague (3080-3095 SD)**: A devastating disease sweeps through the human population. Nine in ten die. The halflings are largely immune. Whether the plague was natural, carried unknowingly by the colonists, or something worse has never been established. Survivors flee into the interior forest.

**The Claiming (3095-3150 SD)**: Halflings expand across the emptied land. The first Honey Lords establish flower cultivation. Attempts to clear Murderwood fail repeatedly. The colonial narrative crystallizes: providence gave them this land; what came before doesn't matter.

**The Nylos Conquest (c. 3180 SD)**: Roule subjugates the Nylos islands, adding their fishing grounds and pearl beds to the colonial economy. Resistance is crushed. The first generation of Nylosi born under occupation knows no other life.

**The Fairn Victory (c. 3200 SD)**: Admiral Fairn destroys a Xothian fleet attempting to challenge Roulean control of the northern passage. Roule becomes the dominant naval power in the southern Greenwater Isles. Xoth never forgives.

**The Modern Era (3200-present)**: Roule consolidates, grows wealthy, and begins expanding into Rakite. The Honey Lords rule through commerce. The Parliament provides legitimacy. The navy ensures security. Everything is prosperous and stable and built on bones.

### Notable Figures

**Prime Consul Aldric Thornberry**: The current head of government—a mild, agreeable halfling who does exactly what the Honey Lords tell him. He's genuinely popular because he's genuinely harmless.

**Admiral Tessara Brightwater**: Commander of the Teldib Fleet. Brilliant, ambitious, and increasingly independent. She's built a power base within the navy that rivals the Honey Lords' economic influence. What she wants is unclear; that she wants *something* is obvious.

**Lady Primrose Goldpetal**: Head of the largest Honey Lord family. Ancient, ruthless, and possessed of a memory for slights that spans decades. She's outlived three husbands, five rivals, and countless enemies. The other Lords fear her.

**The Keeper of Thorns**: The Velani's leader, if they have one. Roulean intelligence has never confirmed this figure exists, but prisoners taken at the forest's edge sometimes whisper the title before dying. The name suggests someone who remembers the original massacre.

### Adventure Hooks

- A Honey Lord hires the party to "survey" Murderwood—actually to find proof the Velani exist, so he can argue for renewed military action.
- Nylos resistance fighters approach the party for help smuggling weapons through the Inside Passage.
- Strange honey appears on the market—Taberthine that grants visions instead of clarity. The source is somewhere in the forest.
- A Rakiten elf reaches Fozyader seeking allies against colonial expansion. No one will listen—except perhaps outsiders with nothing to lose.
- Something has killed three patrol ships near Sunbeam Prison. The navy wants it handled quietly.
