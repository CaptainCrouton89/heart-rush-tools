## Morgnor's Cradle

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Dragon tyranny

**Primary Inhabitants**: Etherweaver Goblins

**Population**: 8,000

**Stability**: Very Stable (under the dragon's claw)

**Core Values**: Obedience, mining, enchantment, survival

- Morgnor's Cradle is ruled absolutely by **Morgnor**, an ancient earth-attuned dragon. His word is law. Disobedience is death.
- The Etherweaver goblins serve the dragon—mining metals from the earth and enchanting them to his specifications. They are skilled with non-basic elements (time, void, force, light, dark) and use this magic in their crafting.
- Life under the dragon is harsh but predictable. Serve well and live. Fail and die. The goblins have adapted.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed (magical metallurgy)

**Primary Exports**: None (Morgnor hoards everything)

**Primary Imports**: None (self-sufficient through dragon mandate)

- The goblins mine gold, silver, and other precious metals from the Hills of Red Gold and the surrounding mountains.
- They enchant these metals using their Etherweaver magic, creating items of considerable power.
- Nothing leaves the Cradle. Morgnor keeps it all. His hoard is legendary—and growing.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (everyone serves the dragon)

- The goblins maintain a guard force, but Morgnor himself is the real military. An earth-attuned dragon in his own mountains is nearly unstoppable.
- Thespia paid tribute for generations rather than face him. Queen Akta's refusal to continue is either brave or suicidal.

### Geography

**Location**: Mountains northwest of Thespia, west of Glorin, containing the Hills of Red Gold

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, mining valleys, underground complexes

**Climate**: Alpine—harsh winters, brief summers

**Named Features**: Morgnor's Cradle (central mountains), Hills of Red Gold (southern slopes), Mt. Kazlos, Mt. Thryke

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Morgnor (the dragon's lair, also the name of the central settlement)

**Cities**: None (all settlements serve the lair)

**Towns**: Lagunas, Shegaat, Dir, Addis, Norwun, Scuilli, Telleni, Goldir

### The Hills of Red Gold

The southern slopes of Morgnor's domain, rich with gold and other precious metals. This is where most mining occurs. The earth-attuned dragon can sense every vein, every nugget, every grain of gold in his territory. Nothing escapes his notice.

### The Etherweaver Goblins

Unlike their Scalawag cousins, Etherweavers are reserved, cautious, and born with attunements to non-basic elements. Morgnor conquered their ancestors generations ago and put their magical talents to work. They enchant the metals he hoards, creating items of power that he adds to his collection.

The goblins don't love their master, but they've made peace with their situation. Some even take pride in their craftsmanship, even if Morgnor claims all credit.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Thespian Situation**

Queen Akta has stopped paying tribute. Morgnor hasn't responded yet—perhaps he's considering his options, perhaps he's amused, perhaps he's planning something elaborate. When he does respond, it will be devastating.

**Glorin's Gold**

Morgnor knows about Glorin's hidden wealth. He knows the Glorindian dwarves have been quietly mining gold for centuries. He wants it. The only question is when and how he'll take it.

**The Hoard**

Morgnor's greed is bottomless. No amount of gold, enchanted metal, or magical items is ever enough. The goblins mine constantly, enchant constantly, and it's never enough. The dragon always wants more.

### History

Morgnor claimed these mountains long ago, driving out or subjugating whoever lived there before. When he discovered the Etherweaver goblins' talent for magical enchantment, he conquered them rather than destroying them. A useful slave is better than a dead enemy.

For generations, the goblins have mined and enchanted under the dragon's rule. Thespia paid tribute to avoid his wrath. Glorin hid and hoped he wouldn't notice them. The arrangement was stable.

Now Akta has disrupted the tribute. Glorin's wealth has caught his attention. Morgnor is greedy, patient, and very, very powerful. Something is going to change.
