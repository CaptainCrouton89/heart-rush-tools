## Bynü Island Tribes

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Tribal confederation (barely)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Xicrein elves

**Population**: ~15,000 (scattered across hundreds of islands)

**Stability**: Stable through isolation (outsiders don't survive long enough to cause instability)

**Core Values**: Ancestral territory, twilight sovereignty, the killing of intruders

The Bynü Islands exist in permanent dusk. A magical phenomenon—or curse, depending on who you ask—shrouds this archipelago in eternal twilight. The sun never fully rises here; the stars never fully emerge. The Xicrein elves who call these islands home have adapted to this half-light over millennia.

They've also adapted to defending it.

The Xicrein are not negotiators. They do not trade. They do not allow visitors. Ships that enter Bynü waters without permission are attacked without warning. Survivors are not taken. The islands have earned their reputation through consistent, merciless violence against outsiders.

This isn't xenophobia born of ignorance—the Xicrein know exactly what the outside world offers. They've decided they don't want it.

### The Xicrein

The twilight elves of Bynü are visually distinct from their cousins elsewhere in Alaria. Their skin is pale gray to deep charcoal. Their eyes are enormous, adapted to the perpetual dimness—solid black orbs that unsettle even other elves. They move silently, see in near-darkness, and have spent generations perfecting the art of killing things that don't belong.

Xicrein culture revolves around the islands themselves. Each major island has a tribe; each tribe has territory; territorial boundaries are sacred. Inter-tribal conflicts are resolved through ritual—elaborate negotiations, formal duels, or seasonal wars fought with strict rules. But these rules don't apply to outsiders.

Outsiders have no status. They're not enemies to negotiate with—they're vermin to exterminate.

### The Twilight

No one knows why the Bynü Islands exist in permanent dusk. Theories range from ancient magical catastrophe to deliberate elven artifice to the influence of entities from other planes.

The twilight is real and constant. Ships approaching the islands watch the sun dim as they cross an invisible boundary. The transition takes perhaps an hour; by the time you're among the islands proper, it's perpetual half-night.

This affects everything. The ecology runs on twilight cycles—plants that never need full sun, animals that hunt in eternal dimness. The Xicrein have adapted completely; their eyes, their hunting patterns, their entire way of life assumes the sun will never truly rise.

Visitors (the rare ones who survive) find the twilight disorienting. Humans lose track of time. Sleep cycles collapse. The psychological pressure of endless dusk has broken more than one expedition.

### The Islands

The Bynü archipelago consists of perhaps a hundred significant islands and countless smaller ones. The terrain is dramatic: massive dark rocks with overhanging cliffs, forests of black-leafed palm trees, caves and grottos carved by eternal tides.

The water is dark. Not polluted—just dark, absorbing light rather than reflecting it. Even at the surface, you can't see more than a few feet down. This makes naval combat terrifying. Xicrein warriors attack from beneath, using the darkness as cover.

### The Tribes

Each major tribe controls a cluster of islands and maintains its own traditions within the broader Xicrein culture:

**The Cliffdwellers**: Occupy the northern islands, living in cave complexes carved into sea cliffs. They're the most likely to encounter (and kill) approaching ships.

**The Deeproot**: Central islands, forest-dwelling. Their territory is the most densely vegetated; they hunt from the trees.

**The Tidewatchers**: Southern islands, semi-aquatic. They spend as much time in the dark water as on land. Their warriors can hold their breath for disturbing lengths of time.

**The Stonetongue**: Eastern islands, keepers of oral tradition. They maintain the histories and laws that bind the tribes together.

**The Nightsingers**: Western islands, practitioners of a form of sound-based magic that works best in darkness. Their songs can disorient, terrify, or kill.

### Why So Hostile?

The Xicrein weren't always this violent toward outsiders. Old records from other nations describe occasional trade, diplomatic contact, even alliances.

Then something happened. The Xicrein call it **The Violation**—an event perhaps three centuries ago that they refuse to discuss with outsiders. Whatever occurred, it transformed Xicrein policy from wariness to extermination.

Scholars speculate about slaving raids, magical exploitation, or religious desecration. The Xicrein won't say. They'll only demonstrate, repeatedly, that the Bynü Islands are not for outsiders.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (self-sufficient)

**Tech**: Standard elven craftsmanship, specialized for twilight conditions

**Primary Exports**: None (deliberate isolation)

**Primary Imports**: None (deliberate isolation)

The Xicrein don't trade. They take what they need from the sea, the land, and the rare ships foolish enough to enter their waters. Salvage from wrecked vessels provides metal, cloth, and other materials the islands don't produce.

This isn't poverty—the islands provide abundantly. Fish are plentiful. Twilight-adapted plants yield food and materials. The Xicrein simply don't need or want what outsiders offer.

### Military

**Size**: The entire population

**Quality**: Exceptional in their environment

**Enrollment**: Universal (every Xicrein learns to fight)

Every adult Xicrein can fight. There's no professional military because there's no civilian population—the distinction doesn't exist. Children learn to kill intruders alongside learning to fish and farm.

Xicrein warfare is built around the twilight advantage. They see perfectly in the dimness; their enemies don't. They know every current, every rock, every shadow. They attack silently from unexpected directions. They don't negotiate surrender.

**Tactics:**
- Ships are swarmed by warriors in small boats or simply swimming
- Intruders on land are stalked through the forests, picked off one by one
- The Nightsingers use sonic magic to disorient and terrify
- Bodies are left on the boundary as warnings

### Geography

**Location**: Western Shattered Sea, west of Knova

**Biomes**: Twilight-adapted island ecology

**Climate**: Mild, humid, perpetually dim

**Named Features**: The individual islands aren't named on outsider maps—the Xicrein don't share that information

### Political Geography

**No Capital**: The tribes have no central authority. They cooperate against external threats and resolve internal disputes through tradition, but no one rules the Bynü Islands.

**Tribal Territories**: Each tribe's boundaries are precisely defined and fiercely defended—against other tribes as much as outsiders.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Boundary Debates**

Where does Bynü territory end? The Xicrein claim waters that other nations consider open sea. Ships passing "too close" have been attacked. No one agrees on where the line is—except the Xicrein, who won't say.

**The Memory of Violation**

Whatever happened three centuries ago still shapes Xicrein policy. Some younger elves question whether permanent isolation serves the people. Elders respond that the outside world proved itself untrustworthy. The debate is private—but it exists.

**The Nightsinger Question**

The Nightsinger tribe's magic has been growing stronger. Some other tribes worry about the balance of power shifting. Nightsinger influence could unite the islands—or tear them apart.

### Notable Figures

Outsiders don't know Xicrein names. The tribes don't introduce themselves before killing visitors. Any information about Xicrein leadership comes from old records, prisoner interrogations (rare), or speculation.

**The Cliffdweller Matriarch** — Reportedly the oldest living Xicrein, she supposedly remembers events before the Violation. She doesn't speak to outsiders.

**The Nightsinger Chorus** — The Nightsinger tribe is led by a council of their strongest sonic mages. How many, no one outside knows.

### History

**The Settling**: Xicrein elves arrived in the Bynü Islands in deep antiquity. Whether they caused the twilight or found it, no one outside knows.

**The Open Period**: For most of recorded history, the Bynü had limited but real contact with the outside world. Trade was possible. Diplomacy existed.

**The Violation** (~300 years ago): Something happened. The Xicrein closed their borders and began killing anyone who crossed them. They've maintained this policy ever since.

**The Present**: The Bynü Islands remain isolated, hostile, and mysterious. Ships avoid them. Scholars speculate about them. The Xicrein continue killing anyone who enters uninvited.

### What Players Might Want

- **The Violation's Truth**: What actually happened? Could revealing it change Xicrein policy?
- **Xicrein Artifacts**: The twilight islands produce unique materials. Getting them requires surviving the Xicrein.
- **First Contact**: Could someone actually make peaceful contact? What would it take?
- **The Twilight Source**: What causes the perpetual dusk? Could it be replicated—or ended?
