### Overview

Talresses is a malicious Daemon who has infliltrated the hearts and minds of the Shailin halflings of Sestros. He has convinced them that he is an oracle by performing small feats in front of them after predicting their occurence. With these few, well placed miracles, Talresses has the majority of the population under his thumb. 

With such power, Talresses seeks to undermine Mjulya, daemoness of good will, who used to be close friends and allies with Talresses, but when Talresses used his power to try to steal followers from Blyzarch, Mjulya yanked her followers from supporting Talresses. Talresses fell from power in embaressment.
