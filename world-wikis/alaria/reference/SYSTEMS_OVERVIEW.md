# Alaria Core Systems Reference

A high-level reference for lore writers. When writing content, ensure consistency with these foundational systems.

## The Cosmos

### Planar Structure

Alaria exists within a 14-plane stack centered on the **Material Plane (Belagria)**:

- **Core flip-sides**: Celestia (Ezz-infused), Astraeva (White Sun unfiltered), Eindumor (Black Sun unfiltered)
- **Vertical layers**: Astral Plane (above), Malstaris (below)
- **Overlay planes**: Ethereal and Nethereal (thread substrate binding souls/shadows to spirits)
- **Elemental planes**: 9 total—Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Dark, Force, Time, Void

Five other planar stacks exist beyond Alaria. Cross-planar travel is possible but constrained by specific magical means.

**See**: `cosmology_and_religion/alarian_planar_stack/`

### Celestial Bodies

**Three Suns**:
- **Bryn**: The visible sun—an awakened construct
- **Aurus** (White Sun): Source of souls, not directly visible
- **Nydus** (Black Sun): Source of shadows, not directly visible

**Two Moons**:
- **Auris**: 11-day cycle, soul-aligned, drives the weekly calendar
- **Nyxara**: 23-day cycle, shadow-aligned, affects shadow magic rhythms

**Lost Third Moon**: Disappeared during the Ezz Rift. Its absence causes periodic "Killing Moon" destabilization cycles. Five competing theological theories explain this.

**Stars**: Maintained by Starborn and Sarakiel beings in orbital towers.

**See**: `cosmology_and_religion/alarian_planar_stack/Stars_Suns_Moons.md`

### Time & Calendar

- **200-day year**, no axial tilt, 8 quarters starting at northern solstice
- **11-day week** (follows Auris): Cautious, Wakeday, Patrons' Day, Moil, Marketday, Merrynight, Brightlove, Lazyday, Farewell, Gather, Fireday
- **253-day alignment cycle**: When both moons align (Brightnight/Hollownight)
- **25,300-year Great Cycle**: Marks cosmic ages

**See**: `cosmology_and_religion/alarian_planar_stack/Time_and_Seasons.md`

## Magic Systems

### Deoric (Language of Absolutes)

Commands reality through absolute speech. Requires blood sacrifice or titan-blood runes.

**Two forms**:
- **Handmagic**: Titan blood tattooed as runes on hands. Risk of death from overfilling astral thread.
- **Ritual Magic**: Spoken Deoric combined with blood sacrifice warps reality.

**Key constraint**: Daemons cannot cast directly on Celestia. They guide mortal worshippers via Psywinds to channel power across planes.

**See**: `magic_and_knowledge/deoric/`

### Kethic Elementalism (Attunement-Based)

Practitioners attune to one of 9 fundamental elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Dark, Force, Time, Void.

- Power grows with bond strength and understanding
- Three attunement levels per element
- **Hard limit**: Cannot affect elements inside living beings (blood, flesh, bone are protected)

**See**: `magic_and_knowledge/elemental_magic/`

### Psy Magic (Thought Through Psywinds)

Taps into **Psywinds**—currents of collective thought flowing through reality.

- Enables telepathy, mind reading, perception manipulation, emotional projection
- Practitioners: Syncopaths, telepaths, daemon-touched, religious orders
- **Risks**: Madness from overexposure, psychic predators, daemon intrusion

**See**: `magic_and_knowledge/psy_magic/`

### Faesong (Melera's Imprisoned Harmony)

Ambient emotion and harmony flowing from the imprisoned goddess Melera.

- **Users**: Fae creatures (natural), druids (hybrid), bards (learned approximation)
- Operates through resonance and harmony rather than command
- Counterpart to Psywinds: emotion vs. thought

**See**: `magic_and_knowledge/faesong/`, `magic_and_knowledge/gaeic_melodies/`

### System Relationships

- **Psywinds ↔ Faesong**: Thought vs. emotion; possibly two aspects of the same Ezz substrate
- **Druids**: Living fusion of Azus's order (Kethic) and Melera's harmony (Faesong)
- **Deoric ↔ Psywinds**: Daemon-worshipper symbiosis enables cross-planar magic

### Elemental Leylines

Leylines are cracks in the planes where elemental power spills much closer to the Material Plane, forming great arcs across the world.

- **Effect**: Elemental magic performed on a leyline is significantly more potent
- **Structure**: Each of the 8 elemental planes has its own leyline network
- **Intersections**: Where leylines cross, effects combine and amplify (often dangerously)

**Elemental plane names**:
| Element | Plane Name |
|---------|------------|
| Fire | Yolus |
| Air | Sulus |
| Earth | Golus |
| Water | Pelus |
| Darkness | Vulus |
| Light | Kunus |
| Void | Nilus |
| Time | Izzus |

**Example**: Dragon Spout in the Westwilds sits where void and fire leylines intersect—gouts of flame erupt unpredictably, burning in impossible colors that cannot be extinguished.

**See**: `cosmology_and_religion/alarian_planar_stack/planes/Elemental Planes.md`

### Magical Materials

Eight significant materials with special properties:
- Aether, Sky-stone, Songsilk, Red Gold, Twyl, Diamonds, Honygar (hardstone), Titan blood/bones

**See**: `magic_and_knowledge/materials/`

## Life, Death & The Soul

### Tripartite Being

Every living being has three components:
- **Soul** (astral-connected)
- **Shadow** (malstaric-connected)
- **Spirit** (celestial essence, identity)

Ethereal and Nethereal threads bind these together during life.

### Death Cycles

**Souls**: Rise to Astral Plane → eventually dissolve into Astraeva (White Sun) → return as new souls

**Shadows**: Sink to Malstaris → eventually dissolve into Eindumor (Black Sun) → recycled as new shadows

**Spirits**: Fade to Celestia → persist only while their **true name is remembered** → **PERMANENT END when forgotten**

This is the only true death in the cosmos. Souls and shadows recycle; spirits do not.

**See**: `cosmology_and_religion/life_death/`

## Divine Entities

### Primordial Forces

- **Azus**: Law, order, structure
- **Melera**: Music, harmony, emotion—now imprisoned (her essence leaks as Faesong)
- **Lyzaria**, **Celest**: Other cosmic-level beings

### Daemons

Powerful entities that channel Deoric magic to mortal worshippers.

**Major Daemons (5)**: Mjulya, Gythry, Dezzy, Hevdarr, Nodlaus

**Minor Daemons (15+)**: Talresses, Loyera, Rodton, Thaes, Tuskeselom, Azak, Bylzar, Ghet, Jingu, Kiev, Lorus, Qoponatai, Sainu, Solas, Uun, Varn, Íritiv

Daemons communicate with mortals through Psywinds and grant power through ritual worship.

### Worship Traditions

- **Lunar cults**: Moon elves, arcane peoples (tied to Auris/Nyxara cycles)
- **Solar cults**: Common folk, seasonal worship (tied to Bryn)
- **Qindu religion**, **Shailin faith**: Regional organized religions

## Historical Framework

### Three Eons

1. **First Eon** (~4 billion years ago): Creation—Azus vs. Melera, the Cyclone of Possibilities
2. **Second Eon** (235 million years): Age of Titans → Dragons → Humans → Catastrophes
3. **Third Eon** (10,209 years ago – present): Post-Hykravones modern era

### World-Shaping Catastrophes

| Event | When | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Ezz Rift** | 120M years ago | Reality flood; titans went mad or fled; third moon lost |
| **Laughing Plague** | ~1,200 years duration | Spawned dwarves; destroyed cities |
| **God War & Long Winter** | 75K years ago | 30,000-year ice age |
| **Hykravones** | 10K years ago | Gray Prince nearly ended the world; now dormant underground |

### Modern Calendar

- **Seventh Dawn era**: Year 0 (World Fire, 10 BSD) through present (3,376 SD)
- **Periodic events**: Faesummer (light/chaos surges), Shadowrift (darkness/nightmare incursions)

**See**: `history_and_lore/timelines/`, `history_and_lore/events/`

## Consistency Checklist

When writing lore, verify:

- [ ] **Death/afterlife content**: Remember spirits are permanently lost when their true name is forgotten
- [ ] **Magic use**: Which system? Deoric requires sacrifice; elementalism can't affect living flesh
- [ ] **Time references**: 200-day year, 11-day week, use SD (Seventh Dawn) calendar
- [ ] **Celestial references**: Three suns (only Bryn visible), two moons, lost third moon
- [ ] **Divine entities**: Daemons channel power via Psywinds; they can't act directly on Celestia
- [ ] **Historical events**: Check timeline placement against the three eons
- [ ] **Leyline references**: Use correct elemental plane names (Yolus, Sulus, etc.); leyline intersections create combined/amplified effects
