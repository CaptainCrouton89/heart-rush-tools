# State Interview Workflow

Task: Systematically review and fill in `nations_and_powers/states/` entries through user interview.

## Workflow

1. **Search first** - For each state, search these locations for existing lore:
   - `atlas_of_alaria/[region]/` - geographic entry
   - `nations_and_powers/states/` - other states that mention it
   - `all_sections_formatted/` - compiled references
   - `heart_rush/races/` - race files (inhabitants, history)

2. **Present findings** - Summarize what's established, identify gaps

3. **Ask targeted questions** - But keep it brief; user prefers inference over interrogation

4. **Update BOTH files**:
   - `nations_and_powers/states/[State].md` - government, economy, military, conflicts, history
   - `atlas_of_alaria/[region]/[State].md` - geography, locations, physical descriptions

## User Preferences

- **Fill in gaps** - Make stuff up rather than asking endless questions
- **High-level** - Don't go insanely in-depth
- **Proximity order** - Proceed by geographic proximity; Claude leads state selection (with occasional input from me)
- **Infer liberally** - "I don't actually care about the details—just stick them in"
- **Don't invent major geography** - No new names for settlements, forests, mountains, major features (there's a physical map). Ask for names if needed. Small-scale/nebulous stuff is fine.
