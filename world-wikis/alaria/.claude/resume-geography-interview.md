# Resume: Alaria Geography Interview

We're building textual map descriptions for every region in Alaria. The process:

1. **Interview me** continent by continent, region by region
2. **I describe** what I see on the physical map (cardinal directions, relative positions, features)
3. **You update** the `_intro.md` files with spatial/positional information under a "Geography" section with "Boundaries and Position" subsections

## Completed

- **Clueanda** (frozen crown, northwest)
  - Northlands, Celedrim Plains, Kharvorn Mountains, Middle Sea, Westwilds, Frostmarch Peninsula
- **Northern Isles** (arctic archipelago, northeast)

## Next Up

- **Tarkhon** — controls the strait between Clueanda and Rimihuica
- **Rimihuica** — central continent with the great desert (Westrim, Emerald Coast, Innerrim, Shacklands)

Then continue with: Western Isles, Aboyinzu, Upoceax, Ve, Greenwater Isles, Free Isles

## High-Level Map Reference

- **Clueanda** (NW): Frozen crown. Nysanna Range (E-W at top) meets Kharvorn Mountains (diagonal NW-SE) at 120° angle. Middle Sea on southern coast.
- **Northern Isles** (NE): Canadian-style arctic archipelago in Ocean of Azeros. Bzulakar's tower at center.
- **Rimihuica** (Central): Massive yellow desert interior, dark green jungles to south, "Oblivion" storm off east coast. Upside-down U coastline forms Middle Sea with Clueanda.
- **Western Isles** (W): Tropical islands off western coast, barrier for mainland bays.
- **Aboyinzu** (SW): Hook/tail peninsula curving southwest, spinal mountains, dissolves into island chain at southern tip.
- **Upoceax** (SE): Forested sub-region with rugged coast, eastern gateway to southern seas.
- **Ve** (E): Isolated eastern continent. Yellow/arid north, forested south. Faces "Sea of Fools."

## Instructions

1. Read the existing `_intro.md` files for the next region before interviewing
2. Ask me about boundaries, coastlines, major features, and relative positions
3. Update files with spatial details while preserving existing content (political, notable locations, etc.)
4. Use the map image if needed: ask me to provide a screenshot path

Start by asking about **Tarkhon** (the strait region) or **Rimihuica** (central continent).
