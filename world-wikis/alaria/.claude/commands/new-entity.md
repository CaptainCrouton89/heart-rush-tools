$ARGUMENTS

Before a new entry is added, first check to see if it belongs as a subsection on an existing note. Search for relevant keywords. 

If it's not updating an existing section, then the new entry can be created. Entries always have this format:

```md
## [title]

Tags: [tag1, tag2...]

[description]

[Additional md sections as necessary]
```
