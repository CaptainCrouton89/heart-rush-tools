## Bzulakar

Tags: npc, monster, lich

Bzulakar is the most powerful person on Alaria. The power of his ice magic is enough to freeze the area in a thousand mile area. His control over air is the namesake for the surrounding seas, which are quiet as whispers due to the still air. The spire is his own work—using his attunement to the air. Although some assume he is weak to fire, Bzulakar is also an extremely talented fire mage. However, he never uses it.

A total master of many of Kethic elementalism, as well as tons of Deoric. Has lived for over nine-thousand years—his power rivals that of major gods.

Holds the secret to powering Deoric magic without death by using the ambient warmth of the ground. Has caused the entire area to freeze.
