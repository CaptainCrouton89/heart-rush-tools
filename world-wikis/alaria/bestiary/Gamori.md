## Gamori

Tags: race, elves, elder_wilds

An elven subculture inhabiting L'Coth D'hari in the Elder Wilds. The Gamori have developed a distinctive society centered on death, transformation, and the sacred hunt—diverging significantly from other elven peoples.

### Origins

The Gamori arrived in L'Coth D'hari at an unknown point in the early Third Eon, finding the peninsula already inhabited by the ancient druid Thorne. They reached an accommodation with this entity that persists to this day, the terms of which they do not discuss with outsiders. Some scholars speculate that this encounter fundamentally shaped Gamori culture.

### Culture

**Death as Transformation**: The Gamori do not fear death—they celebrate it as a phase transition. Funerals are massive, elaborate affairs that can last days, involving ritual consumption of the deceased (to absorb their strength), scarification of survivors, and communal ecstasy. They view the soul's journey through the afterlife as simply another hunt.

**Body Modification**: Gamori identity is carved into flesh. Scarification, bone-shaping, implantation of natural materials (thorns, stones, shells), extensive tattooing, and piercing all mark status, achievement, and spiritual growth. A Gamori's body tells their history. Important events are literally inscribed on their skin and passed down through generations of modification—this is their primary form of record-keeping.

**The Sacred Hunt**: Hunting specific prey is a religious act. The Gamori believe that consuming what you kill transfers its strength and spirit to you. Different creatures grant different qualities. The greatest hunters become living repositories of accumulated power.

### Physical Appearance

Gamori retain elven features—pointed ears, slender builds, ageless beauty—but their extensive modifications make them visually distinct. Most bear visible scarification patterns, bone protrusions (sometimes from their own body, sometimes grafted from prey), and paint or tattoos covering significant portions of their skin.

Eye modifications are common among spiritually advanced Gamori—pupils altered to resemble predator animals, sclera darkened, or irises artificially multicolored.

### Society

The Gamori organize into scattered communities across L'Coth D'hari, each with elected leadership. These leaders gather at Eriyen, the ceremonial capital, to make decisions affecting the whole territory. The republic functions through consensus-building and ritual combat when consensus fails.

Every Gamori participates in the hunt, making the distinction between "civilian" and "warrior" meaningless. Children learn to track and kill before they learn other skills.

### Relations with Outsiders

The Gamori consider the Elder Wilds their hunting grounds and rarely welcome visitors. Outsiders who enter L'Coth D'hari without permission may find themselves becoming prey—or simply turned around at the borders by hunters who materialize from the jungle and vanish again.

Trade occurs reluctantly through intermediaries, usually at Urzula or the edges of Gamori territory. They have no interest in outside politics and are known to dismantle settlement attempts in "their" wilderness.

### Thorne

The Gamori's relationship with the druid Thorne predates their own history in L'Coth D'hari. They give the druid's territory wide berth and refuse to discuss the terms of their understanding. Whatever Thorne represents to them—whether spiritual power, existential threat, or something else—shapes their behavior in ways outsiders find difficult to interpret.
