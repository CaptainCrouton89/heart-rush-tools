## Wind-singers

Tags: creature, beast, howlwood, edari, ve

Massive, solitary apes found only in Howlwood on the continent of Ve. They are the reason the Korel—who fear almost nothing—won't enter the forest's depths.

### Appearance

An adult wind-singer stands eight to ten feet tall when upright, though they spend most of their time in the canopy. Their fur is dark—deep brown to black—and thick enough to absorb light, making them nearly invisible in the shadows under Howlwood's dense canopy. Their arms are disproportionately long, ending in hands with fingers thick as human wrists and grip strength sufficient to crush bone.

Their faces are surprisingly expressive, with deep-set eyes that reflect ambient light and a mouth capable of producing sounds no human throat could manage.

### Behavior

Wind-singers are nocturnal and strictly solitary. Each adult claims a territory of several square miles within Howlwood and defends it against all intruders—including other wind-singers. They spend daylight hours sleeping in nest-platforms built high in the ancient trees. At dusk, they descend to hunt.

Their hunting method is ambush. A wind-singer will wait motionless on a branch for hours, perfectly camouflaged, until prey passes beneath. Then it drops—several hundred pounds of muscle and fury falling thirty feet onto a target that never saw it coming. The initial impact usually kills or cripples; the wind-singer finishes whatever survives.

They eat anything they can catch: deer, wild pigs, large birds, the occasional Korel who wandered too deep. They cache excess kills in tree hollows, returning over several days to feed.

### The Call

The "wind-singing" that gives both the creatures and the forest their names is territorial communication. Each night, every wind-singer in Howlwood calls to mark its territory and warn neighbors away. The sound is unlike any normal animal vocalization—a resonant, almost musical howl that rises and falls in complex patterns. Some scholars believe the calls encode information: identity, mood, recent kills, warnings about intruders.

The forest's acoustics amplify these calls dramatically. Sound bounces off the ancient trunks and channels through natural corridors in the canopy, carrying for miles. On the savannah outside Howlwood, the nightly chorus sounds like something between wind through ruins and distant, mournful singing.

### Danger Level

A wind-singer is an apex predator in its environment. Its combination of size, strength, ambush tactics, and perfect adaptation to the forest canopy makes it extraordinarily dangerous to anything that enters its territory after dark—and barely less dangerous during the day, when a sleeping wind-singer might wake to defend its domain.

The Korel are among the most capable hunters on Ve. They learned generations ago that Howlwood isn't worth the cost. A single wind-singer can kill multiple Korel before the survivors escape the canopy's edge. The forest belongs to the wind-singers. Everything else is prey.

### Population

Howlwood supports roughly two dozen adult wind-singers at any time. Their fierce territoriality limits their numbers—there's only so much forest, and each adult needs several square miles. Young wind-singers must either find unclaimed territory, kill an established adult, or leave Howlwood entirely. Most die trying one of the first two options. The rare individual that leaves the forest doesn't survive long on the open savannah, where Korel hunting parties can see it coming.

This population pressure keeps their numbers stable but ensures every surviving adult is a proven killer.
