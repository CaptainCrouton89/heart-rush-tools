# Aphoryis

Tags: fortress, dungeon, undead, lich, underwater

Aphoryis is the sunken fortress of Mirsalyenar the Cruel, constructed at the heart of [Slumber Deep](../atlas_of_alaria/emerald_coast/Slumber%20Deep.md)—the abyssal trench where Force and Water leylines intersect to create a zone of absolute stasis. The fortress is built from the preserved bodies of ships and leviathans caught in the Deep, assembled into impossible architecture by a lich who has mastered movement where nothing should be able to move.

## Mirsalyenar the Cruel

Mirsalyenar appears as a human head—male, middle-aged, with features that suggest Chimeyan ancestry—attached to the body of a massive octopus. Eight tentacles, each thirty feet long and covered in suckers that gleam with bioluminescent patterns, extend from where his neck should be. His eyes are human but dead, filmed over with the milky corruption of undeath. When he speaks, which is rarely, his voice resonates through water as if the ocean itself were his throat.

He was not always this. Before the transformation, Mirsalyenar was a human wizard of considerable power—a specialist in force magic who became obsessed with the theoretical intersection of leylines in the Sea of Seven Snakes. Records from the old Chimeyan Empire mention him as a court mage who vanished during an "experimental diving expedition" approximately two thousand years ago. What he found in the Deep, and what he did to survive it, transformed him.

The octopus body is not a curse or a punishment. It is a solution. Mirsalyenar needed a form that could navigate the crushing pressures of Slumber Deep, that could sense the currents of force magic, that could manipulate the fine details of phylactery construction in environments hostile to human hands. He chose the kraken-form deliberately, grafting himself to a creature he caught at the edge of the Drowse, binding his soul to its flesh even as he killed it.

He has been refining the design ever since. The current form is his seventh iteration.

### Personality and Demeanor

Mirsalyenar earned his epithet through a specific cruelty: he preserves his enemies conscious.

When someone threatens Aphoryis or interferes with his work, he does not kill them. He drags them to the edge of the stasis zone and releases them into it. They hang there forever, aware and awake, unable to move or scream, watching as the fortress continues its eternal work just beyond their frozen reach. He positions them carefully so they can see each other—so each new victim knows they are not alone, that others have hung in the dark water for centuries before them.

Beyond this cruelty, Mirsalyenar is patient, methodical, and utterly focused on his research. He does not enjoy conversation. He does not explain himself. He does not negotiate. Intruders are either useful (and taken for experimentation) or obstacles (and preserved). He has not spoken to a surface-dweller by choice in over a thousand years.

### Goals and Motivations

The truth about Mirsalyenar's purpose is unclear even to those who have studied him. Three primary theories exist:

**The Expansion Theory**: He is attempting to grow the stasis zone, to preserve an ever-larger region of the ocean in perfect stillness. Some scholars believe he intends to eventually freeze the entire Sea of Seven Snakes—or the world itself—in eternal motionlessness.

**The Compression Theory**: He is studying how to weaponize the stasis effect, to project zones of absolute stillness onto the surface world. An army frozen mid-charge. A city stopped between heartbeats. A weapon against which there is no defense.

**The Escape Theory**: He is trapped. The stasis zone is not his tool but his prison, and he has spent two millennia trying to find a way to leave it. Everything he does—the fortress, the servants, the research—is aimed at breaking free.

All three theories have supporting evidence. None have been confirmed.

## The Fortress

Aphoryis exists at the exact center of the stasis zone, in a bubble of normalcy that Mirsalyenar maintains through constant magical effort. Within this bubble, roughly two hundred feet in diameter, time and motion function normally—or close enough for his purposes.

### Structure

The fortress is organic in the architectural sense: it grew rather than was designed. Its core is the hull of a Kendor exploration vessel that Mirsalyenar captured early in his residence, reinforced with the bones of deep-sea leviathans and expanded outward using timber, metal, and hull sections from the ships that have drifted into the Deep over millennia.

The result is asymmetrical, multi-leveled, and deeply confusing to navigate. Corridors that seem to lead outward loop back on themselves. Chambers open onto other chambers without apparent logic. Entire sections are flooded while adjacent rooms remain dry, separated by barriers that appear solid but pass certain things freely.

The architecture reflects Mirsalyenar's thought process: non-linear, recursive, and fundamentally alien to human spatial reasoning.

### Key Locations

**The Throne of Tentacles**: Mirsalyenar's primary chamber, a vast space at the fortress's heart where he spends most of his time drifting in contemplation. The walls are lined with preserved specimens—creatures, sailors, objects that caught his interest—arranged in patterns that presumably have meaning to him.

**The Harvest Halls**: Processing areas where captured subjects are vivisected, studied, and either converted to servants or preserved for later use. The halls are staffed by drowned sailors raised as mindless labor.

**The Phylactery Chamber**: Rumored to exist at the fortress's deepest point, this chamber supposedly houses Mirsalyenar's phylactery. Its exact location is unknown to any living being—the lich has killed every servant who helped construct it, and the chamber's entrance changes regularly through mechanisms no intruder has survived long enough to understand.

**The Gallery of the Frozen**: A corridor that leads to the edge of the mobility bubble, where visitors can view the suspended graveyard beyond. Mirsalyenar sometimes brings captives here before releasing them into the stasis, allowing them to see their future prison.

### Inhabitants

Beyond Mirsalyenar himself, Aphoryis houses:

- **Drowned Servitors**: Sailors pulled from preserved ships and raised as mindless undead. They handle manual labor, basic defense, and tasks too tedious for the lich's attention. Approximately two hundred currently serve.

- **Bound Kendor**: Living Kendor captured from nearby waters, their minds broken and their wills bound to Mirsalyenar's through magical compulsion. They serve as skilled laborers and, occasionally, as intermediaries when surface contact becomes necessary.

- **The Preserved Intelligent**: Creatures caught in the stasis zone whose minds Mirsalyenar has found interesting enough to preserve within the mobility bubble. They exist in a state between life and undeath, their bodies frozen but their consciousness maintained, used as advisors, entertainment, or experimental subjects as the lich's whims dictate.

- **Deep Aberrations**: Things from the ocean's deepest trenches—creatures that evolved in perfect darkness and crushing pressure, that Mirsalyenar has befriended or bound through means unknown. They patrol the waters around Aphoryis, intercepting intruders before they can reach the fortress.

## Approaching Aphoryis

Reaching the fortress requires navigating multiple hazards:

1. **The Crushing Approaches**: The outer region of Slumber Deep, where Force leyline energy creates lethal pressure differentials. Water-breathing is insufficient—magical protection against pressure is mandatory.

2. **The Drowse**: The boundary zone where stasis begins. Movement slows dramatically, and those who linger too long may find themselves caught as the effect strengthens unpredictably.

3. **The Deep Patrols**: Aberrations and bound creatures that hunt the waters between the Drowse and the fortress. They do not negotiate.

4. **The Frozen Gauntlet**: The final approach, through the suspended graveyard of ships and bodies. The stasis is absolute here, but narrow channels of mobility exist—threads of normalcy that Mirsalyenar maintains for his own use. Finding these channels without guidance is virtually impossible.

Those who somehow survive these obstacles and reach Aphoryis find a fortress that does not want visitors, staffed by beings that cannot be reasoned with, ruled by an intelligence that views all intruders as either resources or annoyances.

No verified accounts of escaping Aphoryis exist. The fortress keeps what it catches.
