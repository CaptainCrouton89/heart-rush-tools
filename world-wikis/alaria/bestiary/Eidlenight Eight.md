## Eidlenight Eight

Tags: faction

A coalition of eight major daemons: Bylzar, Varn, Sainu, Íritiv, Solas, Uun, Qoponatai, and Azak. Followers wear an eight-sided, white star, which protects them from various evils. This is because the Eidlenight Eight grant power to those who perform evil against non-members. Rather than grant miracles, they punish non-followers. It is proving incredible effective.
