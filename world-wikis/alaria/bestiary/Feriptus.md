## Feriptus

Tags: npc, villain

Feriptus is a very powerful lich, living in his reclusive fortress Ipt, located in the far North, near the Nirvanis Mountains. Feriptus is trying to create a new race of sentient beings that are more subservient. He believes that much of the strife in the world is caused by disagreement, and that it could be solved if fewer people were capable of disagreeing with. 

Although tracers and the guiltless have been made in the past with little success, he plans to make this new race far more powerful, and only responsive to him, so there's no disagreement, and they can properly take over.
