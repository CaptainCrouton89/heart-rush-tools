## True Name

Tags: magic

One's true name is their magical identity in the world, and is far more powerful than a being's normal name used in everyday life. Very few people even know their own true name, as it poses a massive threat should someone else learn of it.

With someone's true name, you can control them like a puppet using fairly weak Deoric magic. However, in order to survive on Celesté, prayers must be made to you using your true name. For this reason, most people who become daemons do not return to the Material Plane, since their true name is no longer a secret.
