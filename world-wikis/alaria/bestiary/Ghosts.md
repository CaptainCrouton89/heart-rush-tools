## Ghosts

Tags: monster

Ghosts are nothing more than souls without bodies. When the soul leaves to the Astral Plane, it becomes a husk of energy. Millions of ghosts mill about in the astral kingdoms of the dead.

Ghosts and shades don't leave the Astral and Malstaric planes because of the high, planar forces pushing souls up and shadows down. Without thread binding them together, they do not cancel out. They also lack the free will to desire to return to the material plane.
