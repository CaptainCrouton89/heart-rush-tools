## Frostwalkers

Tags: creature, undead, pale-peaks, cold, threat

Humanoid figures of animated ice and frozen flesh that emerge from the Pale Peaks during deep winter, drawn northward toward heat and life. Frostwalkers are not undead in the traditional sense—they show no connection to Malstaris or the shadow plane—but neither are they alive. The Fengruk classify them as "cold-animated," a category that exists primarily because nothing else fits.

### Appearance

A frostwalker resembles a humanoid corpse preserved in ice. The flesh is blue-gray, frozen solid, covered in a rime of frost that never melts regardless of ambient temperature. The eyes are pale, pupilless, and emit a faint cold light. Movement is stiff but purposeful—they don't shamble like rotting undead but move with the deliberate precision of something that doesn't feel pain or fatigue.

Most frostwalkers appear to have been human or dwarven in life, though specimens have been documented from nearly every humanoid race. Their clothing and equipment—when present—dates to various historical periods, suggesting the Pale Peaks have been producing frostwalkers for a very long time. Some wear armor styles the Fengruk don't recognize.

The cold radiates from them. Standing within ten feet of a frostwalker drops the ambient temperature noticeably. Standing within arm's reach risks frostbite from proximity alone.

### Behavior

Frostwalkers are drawn to heat. They emerge from the Pale Peaks during the coldest months, when the Shrapnel Strait freezes and provides crossing. They move north in groups of three to twelve, following the warmest paths they can detect—which usually means heading toward settlements.

When a frostwalker reaches a heat source, it attempts to extinguish it. Fires are smothered. Warm-blooded creatures are killed. Buildings are frozen from the inside out. The frostwalker doesn't eat, doesn't rest, doesn't speak. It simply eliminates heat until there's nothing warm left, then moves on to the next source.

They don't communicate, don't negotiate, and don't retreat. Frostwalkers that encounter resistance fight until destroyed or until their targets are frozen. They show no fear, no pain response, and no self-preservation instinct. The only way to stop one is to destroy it.

Frostwalkers can sense heat at significant distances—at least several miles, based on Frostwatch observations. They navigate unerringly toward the warmest targets available, which makes settlements particularly vulnerable. A single frostwalker that reaches a village will systematically work through every building until nothing warm remains.

### Origin

The Fengruk believe frostwalkers are corpses animated by whatever force rules the polar waste beyond the Pale Peaks—bodies of explorers, animals, and possibly indigenous populations that died in the south and were somehow preserved and mobilized. This theory is unproven but widely accepted.

Supporting evidence includes the variety of historical periods represented by frostwalker equipment, the fact that new frostwalkers sometimes appear wearing gear from recent expeditions, and the complete absence of frostwalkers from anywhere except the Pale Peaks approach. Whatever creates them operates only in the far south.

Some scholars theorize a connection to elemental ice magic—that the frostwalkers are manifestations of Pelus (the water plane) contaminated by something else. Others suggest they're servants of the Cold That Hungers, the entity that Fengruk mythology claims killed the titan Vorukar. The truth remains unknown.

### Combat

Frostwalkers are dangerous but not invincible. Their frozen flesh is hard—equivalent to dense wood or soft stone—but can be damaged by sustained attacks. Fire is particularly effective; frostwalkers exposed to significant flame take damage rapidly and can be destroyed in minutes.

The primary threat is their cold aura. Combatants who engage in melee range risk frostbite and hypothermia, with the risk increasing the longer engagement continues. The Frostwatch addresses this through thermal gear, limited engagement windows, and tactics that emphasize ranged combat and fire.

Frostwalkers fight with whatever weapons they carried in life—swords, axes, bare hands. Their strength is considerable; the freezing process seems to enhance physical power while eliminating fatigue. They feel no pain and ignore wounds that would incapacitate a living creature.

Destroying a frostwalker requires reducing its body to fragments. The cold animation persists as long as significant mass remains connected. A frostwalker missing both arms will continue attacking with kicks and bites. A frostwalker reduced to a torso will drag itself toward targets. Only complete dismemberment or destruction by fire reliably ends one.

### Frostwatch Tactics

The Frostwatch has developed specialized methods for frostwalker engagement:

**Thermal lances** project concentrated heat, effective at destroying frostwalkers from a distance. The lances require fuel (alchemical compounds that burn hot enough to affect frozen flesh) and have limited duration.

**Fire pits** are maintained along likely approach routes. Frostwalkers that encounter fire often pause, apparently confused by a heat source they cannot extinguish by conventional means. This creates engagement windows.

**Containment** is sometimes preferable to destruction. Frostwalkers can be trapped in ice-houses—structures designed to contain them without providing heat worth pursuing. Trapped frostwalkers eventually become dormant, though they reactivate immediately if heat enters their containment.

**Rotation** is essential. Prolonged exposure to frostwalker cold causes cumulative damage even through protective gear. Frostwatch engagements are timed, with fresh teams cycling in before cold exposure becomes dangerous.

### Incursion Patterns

Frostwalker incursions follow predictable patterns tied to the winter freeze:

**Early winter** brings isolated scouts—individual frostwalkers or pairs that test the ice and probe north. The Frostwatch eliminates these before they can identify settlement locations.

**Deep winter**, when the strait freezes solid, brings larger groups. Three to twelve frostwalkers crossing together is typical; larger formations are rare but documented. The Frostwatch maintains constant patrols during this period.

**Late winter** occasionally brings mass incursions—dozens of frostwalkers crossing in coordinated waves. These events are rare (roughly once per generation) but catastrophic when they occur. The Frostwatch responds with general mobilization and fire-line defense.

The Fengruk have never determined what triggers mass incursions. They don't correlate with weather severity, stellar alignment, or any other factor the scholars have identified. The frostwalkers simply come when they come, and Azanfrain exists to stop them.

### Hooks

**The Warm One**: A frostwalker has been captured that radiates heat instead of cold—otherwise identical, but reversed. The Frostwatch doesn't know what to do with it. Some want to study it; others want to destroy it before it causes whatever disaster its existence portends.

**The Recognition**: A Fengruk veteran recognizes a frostwalker's face—a friend who died on an expedition twenty years ago. The friend is wearing the same gear, carrying the same weapons. What happened to the expedition, and what does this frostwalker remember?

**The Early Crossing**: Frostwalkers have appeared before the strait froze—they walked across the water, which froze beneath their feet as they moved. This has never happened before. Something has changed in the Pale Peaks.
