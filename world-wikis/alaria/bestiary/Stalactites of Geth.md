## Stalactites of Geth

Tags: region

Absolutely collosal stalactites, larger than mountains, hanging from Malstaris. They hang all the way down to the wastes, on the lower surface of the Material Plane.

Huge lava flows pour forth from the stalactites, and flying demons and devils reside in the stalactites, hunting anything that moves below.
