## Ice Wyrms

Tags: creature, beast, pale-peaks, cold, threat

Massive serpentine creatures that swim through ice as easily as fish swim through water. Ice wyrms are native to the Pale Peaks and the frozen wastes beyond, emerging occasionally to hunt in the warmer north. They are not dragons—they lack wings, breath weapons, and apparent intelligence—but their size and lethality make the distinction academic to anyone caught in their path.

### Appearance

Ice wyrms range from twenty feet to over a hundred feet in length, with bodies roughly cylindrical and tapering toward the tail. Their hide is composed of interlocking scales that appear to be made of actual ice—translucent, blue-white, and cold to the touch. The scales shift and flow as the wyrm moves, somehow maintaining flexibility despite their frozen composition.

The head is wedge-shaped, with a mouth that can unhinge to swallow prey far larger than the head's apparent capacity. The teeth are crystalline ice, constantly regenerating; broken teeth fall away and new ones grow within hours. The eyes are small, dark, and largely vestigial—ice wyrms hunt primarily through vibration sense.

No one has observed ice wyrm reproduction. The Frostwatch has documented individuals of various sizes but never juveniles small enough to suggest recent hatching. Where ice wyrms come from remains unknown.

### Ice Swimming

Ice wyrms move through frozen water as though it were liquid, leaving tunnels that refreeze behind them within minutes. The mechanism is not understood—kethic scholars theorize some form of water/ice attunement, but ice wyrms show no other magical properties. The effect is simply what they do.

An ice wyrm can travel through glacier ice, frozen seas, permafrost, and even frozen soil if the temperature is low enough. They cannot move through liquid water (they sink and drown) or through unfrozen earth. This limits their range to permanently frozen environments, which is why they're confined to the Pale Peaks region under normal conditions.

When an ice wyrm travels through ice, the surface shows only a slight ripple—easily missed unless you know what to look for. Experienced Frostwatch observers can track wyrm movement by these ripples, but the warning time is often seconds rather than minutes.

### Hunting Behavior

Ice wyrms hunt by vibration. They sense movement through ice and frozen ground, homing in on footsteps, heartbeats, and any other rhythmic disturbance. A person standing still on ice is nearly invisible to an ice wyrm. A person walking—or worse, running—is a beacon.

The attack pattern is consistent: the wyrm surfaces directly beneath or beside its target, striking before the victim can react. The crystalline teeth deliver a bite that freezes flesh on contact, and the wyrm's bulk can shatter structures or flip small boats. A successful strike is usually fatal; the wyrm swallows what it catches and submerges before organized response is possible.

Ice wyrms are not intelligent in any meaningful sense. They don't set ambushes, coordinate with each other, or show problem-solving behavior. They're predators operating on instinct, and their instincts are very good at what they do.

### Territory

Ice wyrms are native to the deep glaciers of the Pale Peaks and the polar waste beyond. Under normal conditions, they don't venture north of the peaks—the ice isn't thick enough, the ground isn't frozen deep enough, and they can't travel through the Shrapnel Strait when it's liquid.

During exceptionally cold winters, when the strait freezes solid and the northern ice sheet extends, ice wyrms sometimes follow their prey north. These incursions are less common than frostwalker crossings but far more destructive when they occur. A single large ice wyrm can devastate a fishing village in minutes.

The Frostwatch estimates that perhaps two dozen ice wyrms inhabit the Pale Peaks region at any time, ranging from small (twenty to thirty feet) to enormous (approaching a hundred feet). The polar waste beyond presumably contains more, but no one has survived long enough to conduct a census.

### The Fengruk Response

Azanfrain's defenses against ice wyrms differ from their frostwalker protocols:

**Vibration dampening** is the primary defense. The fortress and its approaches feature specially-designed floors and platforms that absorb footfall vibration rather than transmitting it through ice. Guards learn to move slowly, step softly, and avoid patterns that wyrms might detect.

**Detection stakes** are driven into the ice at regular intervals around the fortress. The stakes transmit vibrations upward; a wyrm passing nearby causes them to hum audibly. The system provides early warning but limited precision—you know something is coming, not exactly where.

**Harpoon emplacements** line the fortress walls, loaded with barbed projectiles designed to anchor in wyrm-hide. The goal isn't to kill the wyrm (that requires sustained damage most harpoons can't deliver) but to anchor it above the surface long enough for concentrated fire attacks. An immobilized wyrm can be destroyed; a submerged wyrm cannot.

**Bait stations** are maintained at safe distances from the fortress—platforms that generate deliberate vibrations, drawing wyrms away from defended positions. The stations are automated and expendable; when a wyrm surfaces to attack one, observers mark its location and route.

### Combat

Fighting an ice wyrm is an exercise in preparation and opportunity. The wyrm's ice-swimming ability means it controls engagement timing—it surfaces when it chooses, strikes, and submerges before retaliation is possible. The Frostwatch response focuses on creating conditions where the wyrm can't disengage.

**Anchoring** is essential. Harpoons, chains, anything that prevents the wyrm from submerging turns an ambush predator into a vulnerable target. An anchored wyrm thrashes violently but can be damaged by sustained attack.

**Fire** is effective once the wyrm is immobilized. The ice-scales are resistant to cutting weapons but vulnerable to heat. Alchemical fire and thermal lances can destroy an anchored wyrm in minutes.

**Scale harvesting** follows successful kills. Ice wyrm scales maintain their properties after death—they stay frozen indefinitely, regenerate minor damage, and provide exceptional insulation. The Frostwatch uses them for specialized cold-weather gear; traders pay substantial prices for intact specimens.

**Avoidance** remains the preferred tactic. The Frostwatch doesn't hunt ice wyrms—they contain them, redirect them, and destroy them only when necessary. Every engagement risks casualties, and ice wyrms don't threaten anything that stays off the ice.

### Ecology

Ice wyrms eat anything warm-blooded they can catch: seals, polar bears, caribou, people. They don't seem to require food frequently—a large wyrm can apparently go months between meals—which may explain their relative scarcity. The Pale Peaks ecosystem couldn't support many apex predators of this size.

They're solitary creatures. The Frostwatch has never documented ice wyrms traveling together or coordinating attacks. When multiple wyrms appear in the same area, they ignore each other entirely, neither cooperating nor competing.

The relationship between ice wyrms and frostwalkers is unclear. They don't seem to interact—wyrms don't attack frostwalkers (no vibration signature, no body heat), and frostwalkers ignore wyrms (no heat to extinguish). Whether they share a common origin or merely coexist in the same environment is unknown.

### Hooks

**The Deep One**: An ice wyrm of unprecedented size—estimated at over two hundred feet—has been spotted in the deep glaciers of the Pale Peaks. It hasn't approached Azanfrain, but its presence suggests something has changed in the wyrm ecology. The Frostwatch wants to know what.

**The Breeding Ground**: A scholar theorizes that ice wyrms must reproduce somewhere, and that finding this location might provide leverage against them—or reveal something important about the Pale Peaks. Gondurak is reluctantly considering an expedition.

**The Frozen Ship**: A trading vessel was found frozen into the strait ice, its crew dead and partially eaten. The attack pattern suggests an ice wyrm, but the ship was in waters that should have been too warm for wyrm activity. Something brought the cold with it.

**The Tame Wyrm**: Rumors persist of a Fengruk exile living in the Pale Peaks who has somehow domesticated a small ice wyrm—using it as a mount or guard beast. The Council dismisses this as impossible. Several merchants claim to have seen it.
