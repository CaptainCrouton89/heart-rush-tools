## Cendelle

Tags: race, dnykuul

A reclusive people native to the Dnykuul hills in the Sandreach Mountains. The Cendelle are not human—they're shorter, with pale skin that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it, and they possess perfect darkvision.

### Physical Characteristics

Cendelle stand between four and five feet tall, with wiry builds adapted for navigating their underground warrens. Their skin ranges from chalk-white to pale gray, and their eyes are large and reflective, appearing almost luminous in dim light. They're sensitive to bright sunlight and rarely venture above ground during the day.

### Society

The Cendelle live in extensive underground warrens carved into the Dnykuul hills. They emerge at night to hunt, forage, and raid. Their society is poorly understood by outsiders—they don't trade, don't negotiate, and kill intruders without hesitation.

What little is known comes from distant observation and the testimony of the rare survivors of Cendelle encounters. They appear to live in extended family groups within the warrens, with some form of hierarchy based on age or spiritual authority. They're believed to worship something in the deep earth, though the nature of this belief is unknown.

### Behavior

The Cendelle are territorial but not mindlessly aggressive. Travelers who pass through Dnykuul quickly and without showing interest in Cendelle territory are usually ignored. Those who linger, explore, or attempt to enter the warrens are killed. There is no negotiation, no warning—the Cendelle simply act.

They occasionally raid nearby human settlements, particularly Dalir in Breia. These raids seem more like tests of strength or coming-of-age rituals than serious attempts at conquest; the Cendelle take what they can carry and retreat before organized resistance forms.

### Origins

No one knows where the Cendelle came from. They may be related to other underground-dwelling peoples, or they may have evolved independently in the Dnykuul hills. Some scholars speculate they're descendants of humans who retreated underground during some ancient catastrophe; others believe they're something else entirely—perhaps not native to the material plane at all.
