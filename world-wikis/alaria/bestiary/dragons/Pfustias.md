## Pfustias

Tags: dragon, swamp, emerald coast, phirexes

A swamp dragon of unusual temperament who dwells in the Ogzwad Swamp at the southeastern edge of Phirexes. Where most dragons hoard gold and gems, Pfustias collects secrets. Where most dragons rule through terror, she watches with patient curiosity. She has lived in Phirexes for fifty years—a decade less than Queen Phendexelas—and in all that time, she has never moved against the gorgon, nor the gorgon against her.

This restraint makes her more dangerous, not less. Dragons act from instinct and desire; Pfustias acts from calculation. She is waiting for something, and she has been waiting for half a century.

### Appearance

Pfustias is smaller than the great wyrms of legend—perhaps forty feet from snout to tail—but this is deceptive. Her body is adapted for swamp life: a low, sinuous profile that slides through fog and water with equal ease, scales the grey-green of lichen-covered stone, eyes that glow with phosphorescent light in the perpetual murk. She can hold perfectly still for hours, looking like nothing more than a moss-covered hummock, until prey (or visitors) comes close enough.

Her voice is cultured, even pleasant—nothing like the thunderous roars associated with her kind. She speaks multiple languages fluently and seems to enjoy conversation. Those who've met her describe the unsettling experience of having an intelligent discussion with something that could kill them between heartbeats.

### Personality

Pfustias is, above all, curious. She wants to understand things: how magic works, why people make the choices they make, what happens when systems break down. Phirexes is the perfect laboratory for her interests—a trapped population, a manipulative tyrant, a slow-motion tragedy playing out over decades. She watches it like a scholar watches an experiment.

This does not make her benevolent. Pfustias has no interest in saving the Dengar or overthrowing the queen. She wants to see how the story ends. She may help those who further her understanding or hinder those who would end the experiment prematurely. Her morality is alien, built on axes humans don't naturally comprehend.

She values information above all else—specifically, information she doesn't already have. Bringing her news, secrets, or insights earns her favor. Bringing her things she already knows earns her contempt. She has been watching Phirexes for fifty years; there is very little about the swamp she doesn't know.

### The Hoard

Pfustias' lair in Ogzwad Swamp contains no gold to speak of. Her hoard is made of paper: books, letters, maps, journals, confessions. She has accumulated the written secrets of generations—the last words of dying men, the forbidden correspondence of lovers, the encoded messages of spies, the private doubts of the faithful.

Her nest is literally lined with secrets. She sleeps on other people's truths.

The most valuable items in her collection are sealed and warded: things too dangerous even for her to leave accessible. Among these, rumor says, is something about Queen Phendexelas—a secret the gorgon would kill to protect. What it is, only Pfustias knows. What she plans to do with it is anyone's guess.

### Relationship with Phendexelas

The queen and the dragon maintain a careful distance. They do not meet, do not communicate directly, do not acknowledge each other's existence in public statements. Yet neither moves against the other.

The conventional wisdom is mutual deterrence: the queen is powerful, but a dragon is a dragon. Neither wants to risk open conflict when the outcome is uncertain.

The refugees whisper a different theory: Pfustias knows the queen's secret. Not just any secret—*the* secret, the truth about Phendexelas that could unravel everything. The dragon holds this knowledge as leverage, ensuring the queen never moves against her. In return, Pfustias does not share what she knows.

If this is true, it raises questions. Why hasn't Pfustias used the leverage? Why sit on world-changing information for fifty years? What is she waiting for?

### Relationship with the Dengar

Pfustias tolerates the Dengar in her territory but does not protect them. Those who wander into Ogzwad Swamp and encounter her may be questioned, may be allowed to leave, may be eaten—her decisions seem arbitrary but probably follow some internal logic.

She has been known to trade: information for information, secrets for secrets. A Dengar who brings her genuine news—something she didn't already know—might receive knowledge in return, or protection, or passage through her territory. A Dengar who wastes her time receives nothing but a chance to flee before her patience ends.

The refugees have tried to cultivate her as an ally. She has declined, politely but firmly. She is not interested in their freedom, their survival, or their revolution. She is interested in watching what happens next.

### Encounter Notes

Meeting Pfustias is disorienting. She is intelligent, articulate, and genuinely interested in conversation—but she is also an apex predator who could kill everyone present without effort. The cognitive dissonance of pleasant dinner conversation with something that views you as potentially edible is difficult to maintain.

She does not automatically attack visitors. She assesses them first: Do they have anything interesting to offer? Do they serve her curiosity? Are they connected to larger events she wants to understand? Those who pass this assessment may find her helpful, in her alien way. Those who don't may be dismissed, or eaten, or simply allowed to leave.

She lies rarely but omits constantly. Everything she says is technically true. Nothing she says is the complete truth. Working with her is like working with a particularly sophisticated fey—the letter of any agreement will be honored, but the spirit is up for negotiation.

### What She Knows

Pfustias has spent fifty years gathering information about Phirexes. She knows:
- The truth about how the fogs came (the queen created them)
- The extent of the fog-binding and how it works
- The location and disposition of the refugees
- The internal politics of Maurevelious, including who dissents in secret
- The nature of Old One's Wood and what dwells at its heart
- What the Croaking Briars really are
- Why the ancestors stopped speaking at the Grove of Migwam

Most importantly, she knows something about Phendexelas herself—something fundamental about the gorgon queen that the queen desperately wants to keep hidden. This secret is Pfustias' most valuable possession, and she has no intention of spending it cheaply.

When she finally reveals it—if she ever does—it will be at the moment of maximum impact. Dragons are patient, and Pfustias has been waiting a very long time.
