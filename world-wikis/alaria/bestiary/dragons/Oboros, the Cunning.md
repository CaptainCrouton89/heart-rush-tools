## Oboros, the Cunning

Tags: dragon, water, pindolin-islands, leyline

A Water dragon who collects debts the way other dragons collect gold.

Oboros controls the central Pindolin Islands, moving through the Water leyline like a current himself. He's the oldest dragon in the archipelago, the most patient, and the most likely to talk before killing—though talking to Oboros has its own dangers. He never lies. He never needs to. He chooses his words with precision that would impress a Deoric practitioner, and by the time you realize what you've agreed to, it's far too late.

### The Collector

What Oboros accumulates is *obligation*. Favors owed. Services promised. Binding agreements etched into his memory and, he claims, into the leyline itself.

Over five centuries, he's bargained with sailors, merchants, pirates, mages, minor nobles, and at least three other dragons. He's traded safe passage for future considerations. He's provided information in exchange for unnamed services. He's rescued drowning crews who then owed him everything.

Most debtors are dead now, their obligations discharged or expired. But some aren't. Oboros maintains a mental ledger of outstanding debts, and he calls them in without warning, sometimes generations after the original agreement.

The grandson of a man Oboros saved in 2847 SD might wake to find a blue-scaled head surfacing beside his ship, politely requesting the assistance that was promised.

### Appearance

Oboros is blue in the way deep water is blue—not bright azure but the dark, cold blue of oceanic depth. His scales are smooth and close-fitted, offering no purchase for barnacles despite centuries in salt water. His eyes are luminous, self-illuminating, visible from hundreds of feet away in murk.

He's large, though smaller than he was. Water dragons don't age the way others do—they don't weaken, but they condense. Oboros at five hundred years is denser than Oboros at two hundred, each scale packed with compressed vitality. He looks merely huge. He feels like a depth charge waiting to detonate.

When he moves through water, he doesn't displace it—he becomes part of its flow, accelerating along the leyline at speeds that shouldn't be possible. When he surfaces, water doesn't fall from him so much as reluctantly release him.

### The Cunning

Oboros earned his epithet through centuries of demonstrated intelligence:

**The Vetralian Treaty**: When triton forces attempted to claim the central Pindolins, Oboros negotiated instead of fighting. The agreement grants Vetral theoretical sovereignty in exchange for Oboros having actual control. Tritons claim territory on their maps. Oboros does whatever he wants. Both consider it victory.

**The Elebria Arrangement**: When the lava dragon established herself in the volcanic south, conflict seemed inevitable. Oboros proposed a gift exchange ritual that established non-aggression without formal treaty. Elebria accepted without fully understanding she'd agreed to anything. They haven't fought since.

**The Information Network**: Oboros maintains contacts among sailors, fishermen, and smugglers throughout the Dragon's Spine Coast. He trades trivial favors for news, assembling a picture of mainland affairs that most rulers would envy. He knows events sometimes before they happen.

### The Lair

A flooded volcanic caldera in the central Pindolins—a perfect circle of sheer cliffs surrounding a deep, dark lake connected to the ocean through underwater tunnels. The Water leyline runs through its heart.

The lake looks empty from above. It isn't.

**The Receiving Chamber**: A partially flooded cavern where Oboros conducts business. Air pockets allow breathing; ledges allow standing; the space is designed to make visitors feel precisely as small and vulnerable as they are.

**The Current Paths**: Tunnels connecting the caldera to dozens of locations throughout the central islands. Oboros can travel miles in minutes, emerging anywhere without warning.

**The Depths**: The lowest chambers, where he keeps things he values. No air-breather has seen these and reported back.

### Bargaining With Oboros

Anyone can bargain with him. He encourages it.

The problem is the terms.

**What he offers**: Safe passage through central Pindolin waters. Information about the archipelago. Access to Water leyline enhancement for mages. Recovery of sunken cargo, vessels, or persons. Destruction of your enemies if they're in his waters.

**What he wants**: Unspecified future services (his favorite). Information about mainland politics. Objects of curiosity. Occasionally, specific targets delivered alive.

**The trap**: Oboros phrases requests as options, terms as suggestions. He never demands. He presents alternatives that all lead to the outcome he wanted. Negotiating feels collaborative until you realize you've agreed to exactly what he intended.

### Combat

Oboros avoids direct combat—not because he can't win, but because it's wasteful and unpredictable.

When unavoidable:

**Water control**: In his territory, he commands currents. Whirlpools, reversed tides, focused pressure capable of crushing ships or shattering bone.

**Depth advantage**: He drags opponents down. Water pressure does his killing.

**The leyline**: Near convergences, his power amplifies dramatically. Ships have simply *vanished*—compressed into wreckage, crews dissolved into sea.

**Escape**: His current paths allow exit faster than any pursuit. He's never needed to flee. The option exists.

### What He Knows

Five centuries in the Pindolins and centuries before that elsewhere:

- Complete current systems of the southern ocean, including routes on no chart
- Location and migration of every kraken-matriarch within five hundred miles
- Which mainland ports are most vulnerable to naval attack
- History of several sunken civilizations whose ruins dot the Pindolin seabed
- Where the Water leyline is strongest and how it's shifted
- Korvo Maelish's exact location and the nature of his curse (they've met; Oboros found it fascinating)

This information is available. For a price. The price is always reasonable at first.

### Hooks

- **The Debt Called In**: Someone the party cares about owes Oboros a favor from decades ago—or their ancestor did. The dragon has surfaced to collect. The terms of the original agreement were vague enough to demand almost anything.

- **The Treaty Breach**: Vetral claims Oboros has violated their agreement. Triton forces are mobilizing. Oboros insists he's done nothing wrong—technically true, but tritons don't care about technicalities. War would destabilize the entire region.

- **The Information Broker**: Oboros knows something critical—the location of a sunken artifact, the truth about a historical mystery, the plans of a major power. He'll share it. The price is a favor, details unspecified, to be collected at his discretion.

- **The Succession**: Rumors suggest Oboros is preparing for something—gathering specific debts, moving assets, making arrangements. Dragons don't die of old age, but they do plan. What is he preparing for?
