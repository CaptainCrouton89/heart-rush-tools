## Findra, the Glassy Eyed

Tags: dragon, force, pindolin-islands, leyline

A Force dragon who lost her eyes three centuries ago and replaced them with something better.

Findra lairs in the northeastern Pindolin Islands, where the Force leyline runs strongest. She sees nothing—no light, no color, no detail. Instead, she feels the world move. Every footfall within two miles registers through the crystalline resonance spheres that sit in her empty sockets. Every heartbeat. Every breath. The rhythm of waves, the settling of stone, the minute tremors of a mouse crossing rock a thousand feet below.

She cannot be surprised. She cannot be hidden from. Illusions have no weight, no vibration—she ignores them entirely.

### The Blinding

Findra doesn't discuss what happened. Those who've asked received silence, then death when they pressed.

What scholars have pieced together: she fought something in the deep water between the Pindolins and the Abyssal shelf. Something that targeted her eyes specifically. She won—probably—but crawled onto her current island blind, bleeding, and furious.

She should have died. Dragons don't recover well from sensory loss. A blind dragon is a dead dragon.

Findra disagreed.

### The Eyes

She spent decades experimenting. The Force leyline gave her raw material—volcanic glass shot through with leyline energy, already half-attuned to kinetic forces. The first attempts failed. The second attempts failed worse. She destroyed miles of coastline in her rages.

The eyes she eventually created aren't eyes at all. They're resonance spheres—fist-sized orbs of Force-crystallized glass that vibrate in response to motion. She doesn't see. She *feels* the world move.

**More than sight**: Hidden creatures register by their heartbeats. Invisible beings displace air. In absolute darkness, in fog thick as clay, in blinding noon, her perception remains unchanged.

**Less than sight**: No color. No fine detail. No reading. Beautiful things and ugly things feel the same. She hasn't seen a sunset in three hundred years.

The tradeoff has made her strange. Other dragons hoard gold for gleam; Findra hoards *movement*. Her lair contains clockwork salvaged from ships, pendulums that never stop swinging, waterfalls diverted through caverns for constant vibration. She keeps prisoners sometimes—not for torture, but because living things move in ways dead things don't, and she finds heartbeat rhythms soothing.

### The Obsession

Findra wants more eyes.

Her current pair works. But she's convinced better crystalline formations exist—purer Force-attuned glass, more sensitive resonance structures. She's interested in the Shattering Stones of Emblydium (the Nydor won't trade), the Chime Crystals of triton deep cities (too far, too wet), and persistent rumors of titan-era constructs that could perceive through solid stone.

She sends servants—rarely willing ones—to investigate. Most don't return. The ones who bring promising samples are rewarded. The ones who waste her time are killed. The ones who try to steal her current eyes are killed slowly.

### Appearance

Findra's scales are gray-white, the color of storm clouds or weathered bone. Her build is lean for a dragon—she relies on precision rather than mass. The empty sockets where her eyes were are filled with the resonance spheres, crystalline orbs that pulse with faint Force energy, catching light in ways that make observers deeply uncomfortable.

She moves with unnatural stillness between bursts of explosive action. When hunting, she settles onto rock and goes completely motionless—no breath, no heartbeat she doesn't suppress. Then she waits, perception extending outward, feeling for anything that moves. When she identifies prey, she strikes in a single motion—stone to sky to kill in seconds.

Victims report she appeared from nowhere, from *nothing*, a shape they'd mistaken for rock suddenly revealing itself as death.

### The Lair

Findra's island is called Glassback by sailors for the obsidian formations ridging its eastern shore. No one lands there by choice.

The lair is a complex of sea-caves and volcanic tubes, entrance underwater at high tide. Inside:

**The Resonance Chamber**: A natural cavern enhanced with hanging crystals, taut cables, and water channels. Everything vibrates, hums, or chimes. She spends most time here, surrounded by motion.

**The Collection**: Hundreds of crystalline samples from across Alaria, organized by resonance properties. Some pulse with leyline energy. Some are just rocks she can't discard.

**The Pen**: Where she keeps living things. Currently empty. Previously held sailors, a scholar who came voluntarily, and something from the Abyssal deep she eventually killed because its irregular heartbeat annoyed her.

### Dealing With Findra

Findra can be bargained with, but the terms are narrow.

**She wants**: Crystalline samples with unusual resonance properties. Information about perception technology. Living prey delivered to her island. News from the surface world in small doses.

**She won't trade**: Her eyes, obviously. Information about what blinded her. Lair access for research.

**Approach carefully**: She knows you're coming before you know you're there. Stealth is pointless and insults her intelligence. Overwhelming force is suicide. Your best approach is visible, respectful, and bearing gifts.

**The vulnerability**: If someone destroyed or stole her resonance spheres, she'd be blind again. Truly blind. She knows this. She's killed fourteen people she believed were thinking about it too seriously.

### Combat

**Stillness hunting**: She goes motionless, perception extending outward, then strikes explosively from unexpected positions.

**Force manipulation**: She can compress air into concussive blasts, accelerate objects to lethal velocities, and create localized gravity anomalies.

**Vibration reading**: Combat opponents telegraph every move through their heartbeat, their breathing, the vibration of their footsteps. She knows what you'll do before you do it.

**The leyline**: Near Force convergences, her power amplifies. In her territory, the leyline responds to her will.

### Hooks

- **The Crystal Trade**: Findra will pay handsomely for the right samples. Finding them requires traveling to dangerous places. Delivering them requires surviving her scrutiny.

- **The Blinding**: Someone claims to know what attacked Findra in the deep water. This information has value—to scholars, to Findra's enemies, possibly to Findra herself if she could be convinced to listen.

- **The Better Eyes**: Rumors surface of a crystalline formation that would give Findra perfect perception—through stone, across miles, perhaps across planes. She would do almost anything to acquire it. So would others who want to control or destroy her.

- **The Pen**: Findra is collecting again. Ships have gone missing near her territory. Someone wants to know why, or wants their crew back, or wants to stop whatever she's planning.
