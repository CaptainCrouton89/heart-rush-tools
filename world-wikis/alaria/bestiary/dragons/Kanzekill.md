## Kanzekill

Tags: dragon, force, dragons-spine-coast, leyline

A rust-orange Force dragon who has hunted the same quarry for over four centuries. Kanzekill lairs in the southern Dragon's Spine mountains, near the village that bears a corruption of her name, and spends her existence searching for Mountainveil—a hidden fortress she cannot find, built by survivors of a kingdom she destroyed.

### The Obsession

Kanzekill doesn't rule her territory. She doesn't demand tribute or terrorize villages for sport. She barely notices the surface kingdoms anymore. Her entire existence has narrowed to a single purpose: finding Mountainveil.

The fortress exists. She knows it exists. She can feel its presence—a massive concentration of Force magic somewhere in the mountains, tantalizingly close. But every time she draws near, something turns her aside. The trail goes cold. Her certainty wavers. She finds herself circling back, searching ground she's already searched, following paths that lead nowhere.

The locals have learned her patterns. When Kanzekill is actively hunting, she's predictable—methodical sweeps through the peaks, systematic investigation of caves and valleys. During these periods, travelers know which routes to avoid. When the trail goes cold and she retreats to her lair in frustrated rage, the mountains shake with her fury, but she doesn't emerge to hunt easier prey. She broods. She plans. She begins again.

Four hundred years of this. The same search, the same failure, the same maddening certainty that the prize is *right there* if she could only see it.

### What She Wants

The "enumerable riches" Mountainveil supposedly contains aren't what drive Kanzekill. Gold means nothing to a dragon who hasn't added to her hoard in centuries. What Mountainveil holds is her *name*.

When Kanzekill destroyed the Kingdom of Vael—a human realm that once controlled the western Dragon's Spine passes—the survivors didn't just flee with treasure. They fled with something far more valuable: her true name, extracted through rituals she still doesn't fully understand, bound into an object she has never seen.

Without her true name, Kanzekill is diminished. Not weak—she remains one of the most dangerous creatures in the Dragon's Spine—but *incomplete*. Her mastery of Force magic, which should be absolute, has a ceiling she cannot break through. She can feel the leyline's power flowing beneath her, through her, and she cannot fully grasp it. The name is the key, and the key is in Mountainveil.

The cruelest irony: whoever holds her name could theoretically command her. The survivors didn't just steal her power—they forged it into a weapon pointed at her heart. Every day Mountainveil remains hidden is another day that weapon exists.

### The Kingdom of Vael

Five centuries ago, Vael was a prosperous mountain kingdom—humans and others who had carved out a civilization in the western Dragon's Spine, controlling the passes between the coast and the interior. They were scholars as much as merchants, and their mages had learned to tap the Force leyline that ran beneath their realm.

Kanzekill came because dragons come. She was younger then, already powerful, drawn by the leyline's song and the kingdom's accumulated wealth. What followed was standard dragon conquest: demands for tribute, then punishment when tribute proved insufficient, then systematic destruction when the kingdom resisted.

But Vael's mages had time to prepare. As their cities burned, they worked a ritual that had never been attempted—extracting a dragon's true name from her essence while she was distracted by slaughter. They bound it into a vessel, and the survivors fled with it while Kanzekill razed what remained.

She didn't notice the theft immediately. Dragons don't use their true names; they guard them. It was only later, when she tried to push deeper into Force magic and found herself blocked, that she understood what had been taken. By then, the survivors had vanished. Mountainveil had been built. The hunt began.

### Character

Kanzekill is patient in the way that water is patient—she will wear down mountains given time, but she's also capable of sudden, devastating violence when obstacles present themselves. She is intelligent, methodical, and utterly consumed by her purpose.

She doesn't negotiate. There's nothing anyone can offer her except the location of Mountainveil, and anyone who claims to know that location had better be telling the truth. She has torn apart liars before, and she can tell when someone is hiding something. The problem is that almost no one knows anything to hide.

Her rages, when they come, are terrifying but brief. Concussive force tears through the mountains—avalanches, shattered peaks, shockwaves that flatten forests. Then silence. Then the hunt resumes. The surface kingdoms have learned that her rages aren't directed at them; they're the tantrums of a hunter who has lost the trail again.

She speaks rarely, and when she does, her voice carries the weight of compressed air—words that hit like physical blows. She has no interest in conversation, no patience for those who waste her time, no mercy for those who get in her way.

### Force Magic

Kanzekill is Force-attuned, and her connection to the element shapes everything about her:

**Breath Weapon**: Pure concussive devastation. No fire, no acid—just a wave of kinetic force that pulverizes stone, shatters bone, and turns armor into shrapnel. At close range, her breath doesn't just kill; it *erases*, reducing targets to scattered components.

**Movement**: She doesn't fly so much as she *pushes* herself through air. Her wings are almost vestigial; Force magic handles most of her locomotion. She can accelerate to terrifying speeds, stop instantaneously, and change direction in ways that seem to violate momentum.

**Lair Effects**: The area around her lair experiences constant low-level tremors. Loose objects vibrate. Sound carries strangely—sometimes amplified, sometimes muffled—as Force currents eddy through the terrain.

**The Ceiling**: Despite all this, Kanzekill knows she should be capable of more. The leyline offers power she cannot access. Force magic has applications she cannot master. Her true name is the key to her full potential, and without it, she is perpetually one step below what she should be.

### Appearance

Kanzekill's scales are rust-orange—the color of dried blood, of autumn decay, of iron left too long in weather. In certain light, they seem to shift toward copper or bronze; in shadow, they darken toward brown. She is large for a dragon, though not the largest, and her build emphasizes power over grace: thick limbs, heavy tail, a head like a battering ram.

Her eyes are the most distinctive feature—they never quite focus on what she's looking at. They're always searching, always scanning, tracking something that isn't there. Even in conversation (on the rare occasions she deigns to speak), her gaze wanders, hunting for signs of what she seeks.

The air around her is never still. Currents and eddies play across her scales, lift loose debris, create micro-whirlwinds of dust and ash. Being near Kanzekill means feeling pressure—subtle, constant, like standing at the edge of a storm.

### The Surface Kingdoms

The human and mixed settlements in Kanzekill's shadow have adapted to her presence. They pay no tribute—she doesn't want it—but they've developed customs around her existence:

**Silence about Mountainveil**: No one discusses the fortress openly. Some know it exists; most have only heard rumors. But everyone knows that anyone caught selling information about Mountainveil to the dragon would be killed by their neighbors long before Kanzekill arrived. The fortress represents hope—hope that somewhere, someone has the power to stop the dragon if she ever turns her attention to conquest.

**Reading the Signs**: Locals can predict Kanzekill's movements by watching the weather, listening for tremors, noting when birds flee certain valleys. Entire communities have developed expertise in "dragon-reading," and this knowledge is shared freely across political boundaries.

**The Rage Shelters**: Most villages in the western Dragon's Spine have reinforced structures designed to survive Kanzekill's tantrums. When the mountains shake, people know to seek shelter and wait. The rages pass. They always pass.

### The Nydor Question

The dark dwarves of Emblydium dwell deep beneath the mountains, largely beyond Kanzekill's reach. She knows they're there; she doesn't care. They can't help her find Mountainveil—their tunnels don't extend to wherever the fortress hides—and they have nothing she wants.

The Nydor, for their part, consider Kanzekill a convenient surface hazard. Her presence discourages invasion, complicates rescue missions for escaped slaves, and keeps the mountain passes dangerous enough that only the desperate or the powerful attempt them. They don't worship her, don't fear her, don't interact with her. She's just weather to them—a phenomenon to account for, not a threat to address.

### Hooks

- **The Map**: Someone claims to have found a map leading to Mountainveil. Word reaches Kanzekill. Word reaches the Nydor. Word reaches adventurers who might want the fortress's treasures—or who might want to warn its inhabitants. Suddenly, everyone is racing for the same prize.

- **The Name-Seeker**: A scholar believes they can reconstruct the ritual Vael's mages used to steal Kanzekill's name—and use it again. If successful, they could control the dragon. If they fail, she will know someone tried.

- **Mountainveil Opens**: After four centuries, something has changed. The Force leyline has shifted, or Mountainveil's defenses have weakened, or the fortress's inhabitants have decided to reveal themselves. Kanzekill can feel it. The hunt is almost over.

- **The Last Vaelish**: A descendant of the Kingdom of Vael surfaces—someone who knows family secrets, who might know where Mountainveil is, who might be willing to trade that information for the right price. Kanzekill would pay anything. Others would kill to keep her from finding out.

### Relationships

**Mountainveil**: The obsession. The wound. The only thing that matters.

**The Nydor**: Irrelevant. Underground vermin who pose no threat and offer no help.

**Lady**: Kanzekill is dimly aware that another dragon lairs far to the east, at a Force/Void intersection. She has no interest in Lady and no desire to interact. Lady's lair represents mastery of Force magic that Kanzekill cannot achieve—a reminder of what was taken from her.

**Surface Kingdoms**: Furniture. They exist in her territory, but they don't matter. If they stay out of her way, she stays out of theirs.
