## Pythalomos

Tags: monster, dragon

Dragon of constrictor snakes. A false dragon—self-declared god of constrictor snakes—who has terrorized the Ishnit Jungles for roughly four centuries. Hated by the Naruaghin and given a wide berth by all who value their lives.

### Appearance

Pythalomos is serpentine even by dragon standards. His body is extraordinarily long and sinuous, with a neck and tail that can each act independently. His scales shimmer between green and gold depending on the light, and his eyes hold the patient malevolence of a snake watching prey.

### Territory

Pythalomos claims the northern and central Ishnit Jungles, including the area around Ekomorn. His territory overlaps significantly with the North Naruaghin tribes, whom he treats as a food source. He hunts by patience—waiting coiled in the canopy for days until suitable prey passes beneath, then striking with crushing force.

The dragon maintains several lairs throughout his territory, moving between them unpredictably. The North Naruaghin track his movements obsessively but can never be certain where he'll appear next.

### Behavior

Pythalomos is intelligent but not ambitious. He has no interest in ruling, in accumulating treasure, or in the politics of other dragons. He wants to hunt, to feed, and to be worshipped—in that order. The false-god title satisfies his ego; he doesn't need actual divine power.

He views Senwyn the Agonizer as a rival and inferior. The two dragons' territories share a border, and skirmishes occur regularly. Neither has seriously attempted to kill the other—both seem to prefer the eternal competition to actual resolution.

### Combat

Very long neck, body and tail. Upon constriction, you make contested strength check. If you fail, take a wound. On fail by factor of 2 or more, you take two wounds instead. Fail by factor of 3, three wounds. Tail and neck can each attack independently. When captured in his coils, it's 5 levels of restrained.

### Counterpart

Senwyn the Agonizer is Pythalomos's mirror—the venom to his crushing grip. The Naruaghin hate them equally and refuse to say which is worse.
