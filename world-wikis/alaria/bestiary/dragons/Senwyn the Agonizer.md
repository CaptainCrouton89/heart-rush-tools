## Senwyn the Agonizer

Tags: monster, dragon

Dragon of venomous snakes. A false dragon—self-declared god of venomous snakes—whose very name makes the South Naruaghin spit and curse. She has haunted the western Ishnit Jungles for roughly four centuries, and every year of that occupation has been marked by suffering.

### Appearance

Senwyn is smaller than Pythalomos but far more vividly marked—her scales ripple with warning colors, bands of red and yellow and black that shift as she moves. Her fangs drip venom constantly, and the ground beneath her lairs is poisoned for years after she moves on.

### Territory

Senwyn claims the western and southern Ishnit Jungles, including the cursed coast near Demonwatch. Her territory overlaps with the South Naruaghin tribes, whom she torments with sadistic creativity. Unlike Pythalomos, who simply hunts, Senwyn plays with her prey.

She's been known to poison water sources and watch villages die slowly, to strike hunting parties and leave one survivor to spread fear, to kill a chief's family while leaving the chief alive. The South Naruaghin call her "the Agonizer" because death by her venom is neither quick nor painless.

### Behavior

Senwyn is intelligent, cruel, and creative. Where Pythalomos is content with simple predation, Senwyn seems to genuinely enjoy suffering. She has no interest in treasure or territory beyond what she needs—her pleasure comes from the fear she inspires.

She views Pythalomos as a rival and a bore. Their territories share a border, and she raids into his lands regularly, not for resources but to remind him she can. The two have never fought to the death, but Senwyn has wounded him on several occasions.

### Combat

Some of the most potent venom in the world. 6d8 poison damage + 1d8 for every 5 feet you move or action you take + plenty of piercing from bite. Multiple actions per turn. The venom causes agony even at sub-lethal doses—victims describe it as liquid fire in the veins.

### Counterpart

Pythalomos is Senwyn's mirror—the crushing grip to her burning venom. The Naruaghin hate them equally, though the South argue that Senwyn is worse because she makes you suffer before you die.
