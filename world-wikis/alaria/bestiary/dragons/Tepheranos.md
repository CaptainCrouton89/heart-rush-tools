## Tepheranos

Tags: dragon

Tepheranos is a black dragon, and brother of Rothogomos. Long ago, they came to Argysis to conquer the mountain and steal the dwarven treasure. However, upon entry, Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, and took the treasure for his own. Tepheranos was forced to retreat, and took over the small, unassuming kingdom of Anarak nearby. Since then, Tepheranos has made Anarak much more successful, while Argysis has stagnated. Tepheranos still wants his revenge, and his relative failure has made Rothogomos bitter, and is likewise now intent on revenge.
