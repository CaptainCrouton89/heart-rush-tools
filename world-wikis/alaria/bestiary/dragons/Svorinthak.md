## Svorinthak

Tags: dragon

Svorinthak is an ancient dragon who claims the Lyagnadarr Mountains as her territory—a domain that effectively separates the Luquihn Desert from the centaur plains of Siquestrya. She is among the older dragons of Alaria, though she keeps a lower profile than many of her peers.

Unlike dragons who build elaborate lairs filled with treasure, Svorinthak is a hunter. She maintains several cave networks throughout the Lyagnadarr range, moving between them seasonally to follow prey. The Lyndwyrmspren that infest the mountains are her get—lesser draconic creatures descended from her over millennia, now feral and pack-hunting.

Svorinthak's scales are the color of sun-bleached bone, allowing her to blend against the pale rock of the Lyagnadarr peaks. She prefers to hunt at dusk and dawn when the light is uncertain. Her breath is a searing wind that strips flesh from bone and can ignite dry vegetation at considerable distance.

### Disposition

Svorinthak is territorial but not aggressive beyond her borders. She has made no moves against the Bazaar of Scales at the edge of her territory, nor does she raid the centaur tribes of Siquestrya (though they fear her regardless). Some scholars believe she views these lesser creatures as beneath her attention; others suggest she values having a buffer of activity that warns her of approaching threats.

Those who enter the Lyagnadarr Mountains without permission rarely return. Svorinthak does not negotiate, does not accept tribute, and does not keep prisoners. She is, however, rumored to occasionally speak with those who interest her—though what might interest a dragon of her age is difficult to predict.

### The Lyndwyrmspren

The pack-hunting lesser dragons of the Lyagnadarr are Svorinthak's descendants, bred or evolved over thousands of years. They lack her intelligence and size but retain enough draconic cunning to be extremely dangerous. The Lyndwyrmspren hunt in groups of four to twelve, using coordinated tactics to bring down prey larger than themselves. Svorinthak tolerates their presence in her territory—they serve as both an early warning system and a first line of defense against intruders.
