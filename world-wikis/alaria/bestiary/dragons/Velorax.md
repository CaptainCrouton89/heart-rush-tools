## Velorax the Unfinished

Tags: dragon, elderran, old-tolaria, temporal

A young dragon frozen above the ruins of Elderran, caught in the moment of the Apparatus of Severance's activation. She has been suspended in a state of magical unraveling for centuries—conscious, aware, and slowly going mad.

### Nature

Velorax was barely a century old when she flew into Elderran, drawn by the unprecedented magical energies of the Apparatus's activation. Young for a dragon, curious, and perhaps foolish. She arrived at the exact wrong moment.

The Apparatus was designed to separate magical traditions into their pure forms. Dragons are inherently creatures of multiple magics woven together—elemental fire in their breath, arcane power in their minds, divine resonance in their ancient blood. When the Apparatus tried to unweave Velorax, it partially succeeded.

### Appearance

From a distance, Velorax appears frozen in flight above Elderran's central spire—wings spread, jaws open, fire mid-breath. A dramatic statue of a dragon mid-attack.

Closer inspection reveals the horror. Distinct bands of energy spiral around and through her body, each trying to separate from the others:

- **Elemental fire** streams from her throat in frozen ribbons, looping back on itself
- **Arcane formulae** manifest as glowing sigils that drift across her scales, constantly rearranging
- **Temporal energy** creates afterimages—dozens of Veloraxes overlapping, each a fraction of a second apart
- **Something else**—a dark, thrumming power that may be divine, may be draconic essence, may be something the mage-kings never anticipated

She is being pulled apart and has been for centuries. The process is perhaps one percent complete.

### Consciousness

Velorax is aware. This is perhaps the cruelest aspect of her imprisonment.

Time moves differently for her—she experiences each moment stretched across years, watching her own dissolution in excruciating slow motion. She has had centuries to contemplate her fate, her choices, her nature. She has had centuries to go mad.

Those who enter the time-dilation zone around Elderran report hearing her voice—not in their ears, but in their minds. Fragments. Pleas. Threats. Philosophical musings on the nature of magic. Descriptions of sensations no mortal could understand. Sometimes she is lucid. Sometimes she is not.

### What Freeing Her Might Mean

The Apparatus has been slowly separating Velorax's component magics for centuries. If she were freed—if the temporal prison were broken—several outcomes are possible:

**Reunification**: Her magics snap back together. She emerges whole, if changed. Possibly grateful. Possibly vengeful. Certainly traumatized by centuries of conscious dissolution.

**Completion**: Without the temporal stasis, the separation completes instantly. Velorax ceases to exist as a coherent being. Her component magics scatter—a mindless elemental, a cloud of arcane energy, a divine echo, and whatever that dark power was.

**Transformation**: The partial separation has created something new. Velorax emerges as neither dragon nor elemental nor anything that has existed before. A new category of being, born from magical trauma.

**Explosion**: The energies held in tension are released all at once. The resulting detonation would make the original Unraveling look like a candle flame.

### Adventure Hooks

- A dragon cult believes Velorax is their god in chrysalis, transforming into something greater. They want to accelerate the process.
- A mage theorizes that Velorax's unique state makes her the only being capable of understanding—and reversing—the Apparatus's effects.
- Velorax has made mental contact with someone outside the time dilation. She is offering tremendous rewards to anyone who can free her. She is not mentioning what "freedom" might actually mean.
- The dark power within her is growing stronger relative to the others. Something is feeding on her imprisonment, and it's almost ready to hatch.
