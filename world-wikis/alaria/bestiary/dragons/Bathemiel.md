## Bathemiel

Tags: dragon, free-isles, chained

The chained dragon beneath Mpehi, bound in the depths since before humans arrived at the Free Isles. Bathemiel grants the ruling patrón of Mpehi the power to transform any non-living matter into gold—a gift that has made the Gattorini family wealthy beyond measure and slowly driven each successive patrón mad.

### Nature

Bathemiel is ancient even by dragon standards. No living scholar can date the creature's arrival at the Free Isles, and the dragon itself offers no clarity on the subject. It sleeps in vast caverns beneath Mpehi, bound by chains of dull gray metal that defy identification—neither iron, nor steel, nor any known alloy. The chains predate the Gattorini, possibly predate human settlement entirely. Some believe Bathemiel bound itself. Others suspect a power older than dragons.

The dragon is massive, its scales a deep amber-gold that might be natural or might be a consequence of centuries producing golden gifts. Its eyes, when they open, reflect wealth—not fire, not hunger, but the glint of coins and the weight of obligation. It speaks rarely, and only through dreams, conveying messages that feel more like requirements than requests.

### The Bargain

When the first Gattorini arrived at Mpehi and discovered the caverns beneath, Bathemiel was already chained. The dragon offered a deal: tend the caverns, maintain the chains, and receive in return a gift beyond price. The exact terms were recorded in a vault that no subsequent patrón has been able to open. What remains is the power—the ability to transform non-living matter into pure gold through touch.

The gift is genuine. The gold is real. Every patrón who has wielded it has also eventually lost their mind, convinced that the transformation is spreading to their own flesh, that their blood is thickening to metal, that their heart is slowly transmuting. Several have died tearing at their own skin. The current patrón, Donna Serephina Gattorini, has worn golden gauntlets for fifteen years, refusing to touch anything—or anyone—directly.

### Recent Activity

After centuries of cryptic silence, Bathemiel's messages have become more urgent. Donna Serephina dreams of golden hands reaching up from the earth. The dragon speaks of payments due, of prices delayed too long, of a soul that must choose the chain. The Gattorini don't know what Bathemiel wants. They suspect they won't like it.

The dragon's caverns show signs of activity—fresh scratches on the chains, new patterns in the dust, warmth rising through stones that were cold for generations. Something is changing beneath Mpehi. The Gattorini are quietly researching ways to break the bargain, modify the terms, or simply understand what they agreed to. So far, they've found nothing.

### Disposition

Bathemiel is patient, ancient, and utterly alien in its priorities. It doesn't think in human timeframes or human terms. A century is a brief nap. A generation is an eyeblink. Whatever the dragon wants, it has been waiting for a very long time—and its patience appears to be ending.

Approaching Bathemiel requires Gattorini permission, which is never given. The cavern entrances are sealed, guarded, and protected by wards that kill intruders. Even Gattorini family members don't visit the dragon directly; dreams are considered sufficient communication.

If Bathemiel were freed—or if the bargain were broken—the consequences would be catastrophic. A dragon that old, that powerful, bound for that long, would have motivations beyond mortal understanding. The Gattorini have kept the chains maintained for centuries. They hope they never find out what happens if they stop.
