## Ezra Olkanis

Tags: dragon, ancient, wycendeula, eyendra, riin

The dragon called Ezra Olkanis has dwelt in the Eyendra forest for longer than any human civilization on Upoceax has existed. The name itself is Riin—the language of a people who no longer exist as individuals—and translates roughly to "the one who remained." Whether the dragon chose this name or the Riin gave it to her is a question no one alive can answer.

### Appearance

Ezra Olkanis is vast even by dragon standards, though she moves with a stillness that makes her seem smaller until she chooses otherwise. Her scales have taken on the colors of the forest over millennia—deep greens and browns, bark-textured in places, with patches of moss and lichen that grow on her undisturbed. Her eyes are the amber of old sap, and they move slowly, tracking things mortals cannot see.

She rarely flies anymore. When she does, the forest goes quiet for miles.

Those who have seen her describe an impression more than a creature—the sense of something ancient and patient watching from the treeline, present in the way old growth is present. Her lair, somewhere in the deep forest west of Zor, has never been mapped. Those who go looking do not return, though whether the dragon kills them or the forest simply absorbs them is unclear.

### Nature

Ezra Olkanis operates on timescales that make mortal concerns nearly invisible to her. She has watched civilizations rise and fall, and the Riin were only one of them—though they were the one she cared about, in whatever way dragons care.

She is not cruel, but she is not kind. Cruelty requires attention, and she has too much time to waste it on malice. When she acts, it is because something has finally crossed a threshold she established centuries ago. The people of Zor tell stories of entire expeditions vanishing after disturbing the wrong ruin—not attacked, simply gone. Whether the dragon did this or merely allowed it, the effect is the same.

What she wants is unclear. She maintains the pact with Zor, enforces boundaries within Eyendra, and occasionally demands service—but toward what end? She has never explained. She has never explained anything.

When she speaks—rarely, and only to those who interest her—her voice is described as coming from everywhere at once, as if the forest itself were talking. Her words are precise, archaic, and often answer questions that weren't asked while ignoring the ones that were.

### The Riin Connection

Ezra Olkanis was old before the Riin built their first settlement. By the time they had grown into a civilization, she had been watching them for centuries. The nature of their relationship is preserved only in fragments—the Riin practiced a form of magic that merged them with the land, and some believe the dragon taught them. Others believe she merely observed. The dragon has never clarified.

What is certain: when the Riin reached the culmination of their art—when they attempted the final merger that would bind them permanently to Eyendra—the dragon did not stop them. Whether she couldn't, or wouldn't, or simply chose to see what would happen, the result was the same. The Riin did not die. They diffused. The forest absorbed them, or they became the forest, or some combination that mortal language cannot capture.

Now Ezra Olkanis is the only being alive who knew them as they were—every Riin face, every name, every conversation across two thousand years of civilization. Whether she carries this as burden or treasure, whether she grieves or simply observes, she has not said.

Some scholars believe she is waiting for the Riin to reconstitute—that the diffusion was not permanent, and given enough time, they will coalesce back into individuals. Others believe she is ensuring they never do. Still others suggest the dragon's goals have nothing to do with the Riin at all, that she is simply territorial in the way dragons are territorial, and the Riin connection is incidental. Her behavior supports any of these interpretations.

### Relationship with Zor

The city-state of Zor exists because Ezra Olkanis permits it.

The arrangement predates Zor's current form—the original agreement was made with a fishing village that eventually grew into a city. Every generation, Zor's rulers reaffirm the pact, though the dragon has not appeared in person for over two centuries. The terms are straightforward:

**Zor must not disturb the interior.** Certain ruins are forbidden. Certain lakes must never be approached. The boundaries shift over decades—the dragon sends word through channels no one discusses publicly—and Zor obeys. Those who don't tend to vanish.

**Zor must report what it observes.** Changes in the forest, unusual activity, strangers asking questions. The dragon wants eyes on her borders.

**The dragon may demand service.** Guides, supplies, artifacts, occasionally people with particular skills. Those summoned to the interior usually return.

**Zor may take from the forest's edge.** Timber, herbs, game—all permitted within a day's travel of the coast. Beyond that invisible line, permission ends.

In exchange, Zor survives. Whether the dragon actively protects them or merely refrains from destroying them is debated. Zor has never been attacked by the forest's deeper dangers, but whether that's the dragon's doing or simply luck is unknown.

### Moral Complexity

Ezra Olkanis defies simple categorization.

She allowed the Riin to destroy themselves—or become something else, depending on interpretation—and now guards the territory they became. She maintains a pact with Zor that costs the city little but binds them absolutely. She kills those who disturb the interior—but she has never attacked Zor itself, not once in eight hundred years.

Those who have spoken with her describe contradictions. She expresses something like grief when discussing the Riin, but refuses to say she could have stopped them. She hoards knowledge about them that she will not share. She treats mortals with indifference bordering on contempt, but has maintained a relationship with Zor longer than most nations have existed.

What drives her is unknown. Dragons are territorial; perhaps she simply claimed this forest long ago and the Riin were an interruption she's still processing. Dragons are possessive; perhaps the Riin were hers in some way, and what remains of them still is. Dragons live for millennia; perhaps her motives operate on timescales mortals cannot perceive, and what looks like vigil is simply patience.

The common theory: she is waiting. For what, no one knows.

### Lair

Ezra Olkanis dwells somewhere in the deep Eyendra, roughly 120 miles west of Zor. The exact location has never been established—those who get close enough to find it don't come back, and scrying fails within the forest's interior.

What is known: the lair is not a cave or a ruin but a section of forest so old and tangled that the canopy blocks all light. The trees there are massive, impossibly ancient, and they grow in patterns that suggest intention. The dragon rests among them, or beneath them, or possibly *as* them—reports vary. The Riin built nothing there, which is strange given how thoroughly they settled everywhere else. Either they respected it as the dragon's domain, or the dragon ensured nothing permanent rose near her.

Treasure, if it exists, is not gold or gems. Ezra Olkanis collects Riin artifacts—objects, documents, things the forest hasn't absorbed. Whether she hoards them possessively or preserves them deliberately, the effect is the same: if you want to understand the Riin, you would need to reach her lair. No one has.

### Hooks

- **The boundary moved.** Zor's foresters report that the safe extraction zone has shrunk—trees they've harvested for generations are now responding badly to approach. The dragon has sent no word explaining the change. Is she tightening control, or is something else happening in the interior that requires a larger buffer?

- **The dragon spoke.** For the first time in two centuries, Ezra Olkanis sent word to Zor's ruling council. A single sentence: "Something is moving in Wer Azenzi." No one knows what this means, but the council is seeking outsiders to investigate—Zor's own people are bound by the pact not to enter the lake region.

- **A Riin artifact surfaced.** A trader arrived in Zor with an object clearly of Riin make—a small stone that hums when touched and shows images of faces no one recognizes. He claims he found it on the coast, washed up after a storm. If true, the interior is reaching outward. If false, someone has been where they shouldn't.

- **The dragon wants to talk.** Word reaches the party that Ezra Olkanis has requested a meeting—specifically with outsiders, specifically those with no connection to Zor. She has never done this before. What she wants, and why now, is unknown. Getting to her lair alive is the first challenge.

- **Zor is pushing boundaries.** A faction within Zor's government believes the dragon is dead, gone, or exaggerated. They've begun planning expeditions into the interior to test the pact's enforcement. The traditionalist faction is horrified and seeking help—either to stop the expeditions or to warn the dragon before she demonstrates exactly how present she still is.
