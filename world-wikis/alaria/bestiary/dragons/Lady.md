## Lady

Tags: dragon, teal, leyline

A teal dragon who has made her lair at the intersection of Force and Void leylines, somewhere beneath the waters or islands near the Tyvern archipelago. Lady is ancient, reclusive, and profoundly disinterested in the affairs of the world above. She doesn't want to be bothered, and she has arranged her existence to ensure that bothering her is nearly impossible.

### The Leyline Nexus

Lady's lair sits at the crossing of Force and Void — an unusual combination. Force governs motion, impact, kinetic power; Void governs emptiness, negation, the space between things. Where they intersect, they create *stillness*. Absolute stillness. The power to stop.

The approach to Lady's lair passes through zones where this effect intensifies. Movement becomes difficult, then exhausting, then nearly impossible. Visitors find themselves wading through air that resists like water, then like mud, then like stone. The Void energy bleeds into the passages, creating pockets of absolute nothing — spaces where light fails, sound dies, and matter that enters doesn't always exit.

Those who reach Lady (very few do) have typically spent days or weeks in the approach, burning through magical resources, testing their will against the intersection's effects. By the time they arrive, they're desperate — which is exactly how Lady prefers her visitors.

### Character

Lady isn't hostile. She's *indifferent*. The distinction matters.

A hostile dragon wants something from visitors — to kill them, to drive them away, to make a point. Lady wants nothing. She doesn't care if visitors live or die, succeed or fail, exist or don't. She stopped caring a very long time ago, and the leyline nexus she's chosen reflects her nature: she is the stillness, the stopping, the void that swallows motion and meaning alike.

Conversations with Lady — for those who manage to have them — are exercises in frustration. She answers questions with questions. She offers nothing freely. She radiates an aura of profound emptiness that makes visitors question why they came, what they wanted, whether any of it matters. Many leave without getting what they sought, unable to articulate what went wrong.

Some scholars theorize that Lady has been changed by centuries at the leyline intersection — that the Void energy has drained something essential from her, leaving only this hollow shell. Others believe she sought out the intersection precisely because it matched what she already was. The truth, if there is one, Lady isn't sharing.

### The Name

"Lady" is what the locals call her — a polite title for something they don't understand and don't want to offend. The Tuktuk know she's there; they avoid the areas near her lair and warn others to do the same. The name is deliberately vague, deliberately respectful, deliberately *not* her true name.

If Lady has a true name, she doesn't share it. Names have power, and Lady has arranged her existence to minimize all forms of engagement — including the engagement of being known.

### Appearance

Lady is teal — her scales the blue-green of deep water, darker than the sea above and lighter than the abyss below. She is large, though visitors who've seen her disagree on exactly how large; the Void energy that permeates her lair makes distances and proportions unreliable.

Her eyes are the most unsettling feature. They're empty — not blind, but *vacant*, as if whatever looks out through them has withdrawn to somewhere very far away. Meeting her gaze feels like staring into nothing, and nothing staring back.

### Interactions

Lady can be reached. She can be spoken to. She might even answer questions or provide assistance — she has knowledge accumulated over millennia, and the leyline nexus gives her awareness of magical currents that few beings can perceive.

But getting anything from Lady requires understanding what she values, which is: nothing. She can't be bribed, because wealth means nothing to her. She can't be threatened, because she doesn't fear death or pain. She can't be bargained with, because she wants nothing in return.

The only approach that sometimes works is offering her something that disrupts her stillness in interesting ways. A problem she hasn't encountered. A question she can't immediately answer. A visitor who doesn't behave the way visitors usually behave. Even then, her interest is fleeting — a moment of engagement before she retreats back into indifference.

### Hooks

- **The Stillness Spreads**: The leyline intersection is destabilizing. The zones of frozen motion around Lady's lair are expanding, creeping into waters and islands that were previously safe. Lady doesn't care. The region might.

- **What Lady Knows**: Someone needs information only Lady possesses — the location of something lost, the nature of something ancient, the answer to a question no one else can answer. Getting it requires reaching her, surviving the approach, and somehow engaging a being who has no interest in being engaged.

- **Something Woke Her**: For the first time in centuries, Lady has moved. Not far — just enough for those who watch such things to notice. Something has disturbed her stillness, and whatever it is might be important enough to matter.
