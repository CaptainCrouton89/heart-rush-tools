Green dragon. No specialty, but growing older and more obnoxious. Has been making occasional raids on passing ships. Adron can't do anything about it because to kill a dragon is sacrilege. There are merchants in Grey Port and Shipmarsh who would pay a lot of money to have the problem "solved" however.
