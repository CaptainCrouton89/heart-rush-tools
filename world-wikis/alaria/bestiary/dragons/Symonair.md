## Symonair

Tags: dragon

Symonair is a blue dragon who has claimed the lake that bears his name for longer than any orc state has existed. He dwells in the waters south of Cykravikus Lake, in the heart of the Wildwood's lake system, and his presence casts a long shadow over the politics of the orc nations—though few understand exactly how.

Blue dragons are known for patience, deception, and water affinity. Symonair embodies all three. He does not rage or rampage. He watches. He waits. He has been watching the orc states fight and scheme for centuries, and he has never once intervened directly.

This restraint is itself a kind of power.

### The Lake

Symonair Lake connects to Cykravikus Lake, the domain of the Hag Queen and her Griebi subjects. The waters flow between them. Whatever relationship exists between the dragon and the hag is unknown to outsiders—but neither has attacked the other in all recorded history, and that alone is remarkable.

The lake is deep, cold, and dark. Symonair's lair lies in underwater caverns that no surface dweller has ever mapped. Occasionally, travelers report seeing something massive moving beneath the surface—a shadow too large to be any fish, too deliberate to be a current.

### The Mystery

What does Symonair want?

He could destroy any of the orc states. He hasn't. He could claim tribute, demand worship, install himself as a god-king. He hasn't. He simply... watches. Some say he's playing a game that spans centuries, manipulating the orc wars for purposes only he understands. Others say he's simply waiting for something—but what?

The orc states give him a wide berth. The Griebi treat his lake as sacred and forbidden. The Hag Queen has never spoken of him publicly. The Tarni spirit-seers say his soul is "old and cold and deep," but they cannot read his intentions.

### Danger

Those who enter Symonair Lake without permission do not return. This is not rumor—it is fact. Fishing boats that drift too far, adventurers seeking dragon treasure, even orc war-parties pursuing enemies into the waters have all vanished without trace.

Symonair does not warn. He does not negotiate. He does not accept tribute in exchange for passage. His lake is his, and those who enter it belong to him.

### The Balance

Some scholars speculate that Symonair and the Hag Queen have divided the lake system between them—she controls the northern waters and the Griebi, he controls the southern waters and... whatever he controls. This arrangement, if it exists, may be what keeps the entire region stable.

If either of them fell—if the Hag Queen were killed, or if something drove Symonair from his lake—the consequences would ripple through every orc state. The Griebi might collapse. The other states might finally attack. Or something worse might emerge from the waters that two ancient powers have kept contained.

No one wants to find out.
