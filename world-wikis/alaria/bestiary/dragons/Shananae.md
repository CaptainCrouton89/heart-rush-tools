## Shananae

Tags: dragon

Shananae is a white dragon who claims the western reaches of the Nysanna Range as her territory, dwelling in a labyrinthine glacier near where the range curves toward the Anderegnons. She is ancient even by dragon standards—old enough to remember when the Atowatowa first arrived in Anu'Itiklik, and patient enough to watch their civilization develop over millennia without interference.

Unlike most white dragons, Shananae is not actively cruel so much as profoundly indifferent. She views the beings below her territory as one might view lichen—present, occasionally interesting, ultimately beneath notice. This indifference makes her more dangerous in some ways; she will destroy a caravan crossing her hunting grounds not out of malice but simply because it was there.

The Atowatowa consider her a force of nature rather than a threat to be opposed. Their wind-callers can sense when she hunts by the way the air currents shift, and they adjust their migration routes accordingly. Some Atowatowa elders claim she has a bargain with the spirits of Top of the World—that she guards the western approaches to the sacred peak in exchange for something the spirits provide. What that might be, none will say.
