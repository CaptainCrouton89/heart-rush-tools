## Pelera

Tags: dragon, dark, dragons-spine-coast, the-glog

A dark emerald dragon who claims The Glog forest and surrounding territory as her domain. Unlike Kanzekill to the south, who barely acknowledges the surface kingdoms in her obsessive hunt for Mountainveil, Pelera actively cultivates her reputation. She rules through fear and mystery—not by destroying settlements, but by making the forest itself feel like her. Every shadow might contain her. Every silence might be her approach. She is the Glog's apex predator, and she ensures no one forgets it.

### The Shadow in the Forest

Pelera is Dark-attuned, and her magic reflects this: concealment, misdirection, and the cold terror of unseen threats. She can move through The Glog's shadows without disturbing them, emerge from darkness that shouldn't contain anything her size, and vanish before witnesses can be certain what they saw. The forest's reputation for making travelers feel watched? That's not superstition. That's Pelera.

She hunts primarily at night, though she can be active during the day when the forest canopy provides sufficient shadow. Her preferred prey is large game—elk and moose—but she takes humans and other travelers often enough to maintain her reputation. The attacks follow a pattern: isolation of the target, a period of psychological terror (rustling sounds, distant glimpses, the knowledge that something is there), and then a strike from an unexpected direction.

Survivors are rare but not nonexistent. Pelera occasionally releases prey after the chase, letting them spread stories. The terror serves her purposes better than corpses would.

### Appearance

Pelera's scales are dark emerald green, so deep they appear almost black in shadow. In direct sunlight—which she avoids—they show iridescent patterns of deeper green that seem to shift with her breathing. Her eyes are pale silver, luminescent in darkness, often the only visible sign of her presence before she strikes.

She's smaller than many ancient dragons—perhaps sixty feet from nose to tail—but her build is optimized for forest hunting: sinuous, flexible, able to weave between trees that would impede larger specimens. Her wings are proportionally reduced; she's a glider rather than a sustained flyer, using height and darkness rather than aerial pursuit.

The air around her is noticeably colder, not from elemental cold but from the absence of light—darkness seems to leak from her, dimming nearby illumination and deepening shadows within several dozen feet.

### Territory

Pelera claims The Glog forest as her core territory, with Shimmer Lake as her lair. Her domain extends west into the eastern Gaplands, east to The Screech's foothills, and south to the northern Shasalassere slopes. This makes her one of the more expansive dragon territories on the Dragon's Spine Coast—and one of the most actively patrolled.

She tolerates human activity at the margins. Logging operations along The Glog's western fringe continue unmolested as long as they stay within understood limits. The Gaplands settlements have learned which directions to avoid. Travelers crossing The Glog Road pass through her territory but rarely draw her attention if they move steadily and don't linger.

What she doesn't tolerate is intrusion into the core territory—the deep forest around Shimmer Lake. Operations that push too far toward the interior, travelers who leave the road, anyone who approaches the lake itself—these attract her direct attention. The response is usually lethal.

### Shimmer Lake

Pelera's lair lies beneath or within Shimmer Lake, though no one has confirmed the precise location. The lake's distinctive shimmer—that too-bright, too-active reflection that doesn't match normal optics—is likely a consequence of her presence. Dark magic contaminating the water, perhaps, or a deliberate effect she cultivates.

The lake supposedly contains a submerged structure—glimpsed occasionally when the light angles just right. Whether this is a natural formation, pre-existing ruins she's claimed, or something she built remains unknown. No one has investigated closely enough to determine the truth. The few who've tried haven't returned.

Local legend holds that the shimmer shows things—visions of other places, glimpses of the future, images of desires that the viewer didn't know they had. Whether this is true or merely the sort of story that accumulates around dragon lairs is unclear. Pelera doesn't confirm or deny anything. She prefers mystery.

### The Tribute Tradition

Unlike Kanzekill, who wants nothing from the surface kingdoms but information about Mountainveil, Pelera accepts tribute. Some logging operations leave offerings at designated clearings—portions of their harvest, coins, occasionally worked goods. The Rosensaw Compact has been known to make larger payments when they need guaranteed safe passage for valuable shipments.

Whether Pelera actually collects this tribute or simply permits those who pay to continue operating is a subject of debate. The offerings disappear, but no one has witnessed her taking them. Some believe lesser creatures—forest predators she's somehow bound to her service—collect on her behalf. Others suspect the tribute is theater, a ritual that satisfies human psychology without meaning anything to the dragon.

What's certain is that operations which pay tribute suffer fewer losses than those that don't. Correlation isn't causation, but it's enough to keep the payments flowing.

### Character

Pelera is cunning, patient, and apparently amused by fear. She doesn't rage like Kanzekill or demand like other dragons. She watches. She waits. She cultivates a reputation that does most of her work for her. Why chase prey when prey can be convinced to avoid your territory entirely? Why destroy settlements when terrorized settlements produce better tribute?

She's intelligent—more intelligent than some give her credit for. She understands the economic relationships of the region, knows which trade routes matter and which don't, and calibrates her predation to take enough to maintain fear without taking enough to collapse the system that feeds her. She's been ruling this territory for roughly two centuries and shows no signs of losing interest.

Communication with Pelera is possible, though difficult. She speaks when she chooses, usually in the moments before a kill—a few words of acknowledgment, perhaps a question, occasionally what might be humor. No one has successfully negotiated with her, but several have received what seemed like warnings or instructions. Those who followed them survived. Those who didn't... didn't.

### The Dragon and the Mermaids

An interesting dynamic exists between Pelera's territory and the Shasalassere mermaids to the south. The mermaids have colonized underground waterways that extend north into The Glog, but they don't seem to have spread into Pelera's core territory. Whether the dragon actively prevents this, whether something about Shimmer Lake is hostile to them, or whether they simply haven't expanded that far yet remains unclear.

Some scholars theorize that Pelera's Dark attunement creates conditions the mermaids avoid—that her shadow-magic contaminates the water in ways that cold-adapted, vibration-hunting predators find uncomfortable. If true, Pelera's presence might be inadvertently protecting the region from a threat worse than herself.

### Hooks

**The Missing Loggers**: A logging operation has gone silent—all hands, no bodies, no signs of violence. The pattern doesn't match Pelera's usual approach, which suggests either something else is responsible or the dragon has changed her methods. Either possibility is concerning.

**The Compact's Request**: The Rosensaw Compact wants to negotiate directly with Pelera—not just pay tribute, but establish formal terms for safe passage through her territory. They need someone to carry the offer to the dragon and, ideally, bring back a response. The pay is excellent because the odds are poor.

**The Shimmer Vision**: A merchant claims the lake showed him something—a vision of an object buried in the deep forest, something valuable enough to be worth any risk. He's assembling an expedition and needs people willing to enter Pelera's territory. The dragon's response to uninvited treasure hunters is well established. The merchant believes his vision makes him special. He's probably wrong.

**Pelera's Question**: A survivor of a Pelera encounter reports that the dragon asked her something: "Where is the door that wasn't there?" The question makes no sense, but Pelera seemed genuinely interested in an answer. Scholars want to know what the question means. Finding out might require asking the dragon directly.
