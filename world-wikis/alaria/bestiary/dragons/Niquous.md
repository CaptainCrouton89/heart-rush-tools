## Niquous

Tags: dragon

Niquous is a white dragon who makes his lair in the central Nysanna Range, east of Shananae's territory and west of the Wydling-inhabited tunnels of Witvein. Where Shananae is ancient and indifferent, Niquous is younger and far more actively malevolent—a cruel hunter who takes pleasure in the terror of his prey.

His scales have an unusual blue-white shimmer that makes him nearly invisible against glacial ice. He uses this camouflage to ambush travelers, caravans, and the occasional Wydling hunting party that strays too far from Pyoa Noi. The Wydlings have learned to read the signs of his presence—unusual silence, a certain quality to the light reflecting off distant ice—and flee when they sense him near.

Niquous and Shananae maintain a cold détente. Their territories do not overlap, and neither has reason to challenge the other. Travelers sometimes make the mistake of assuming this means there is a safe corridor between their domains. There is not. The space between them is simply where both dragons hunt.
