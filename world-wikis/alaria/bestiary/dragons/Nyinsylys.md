## Nyinsylys

Tags: dragon

Nyinsylys is a white dragon who claims the glacial highlands between the Nirvanis Mountains and the Knives, in the far northern reaches of the Kharvorn range. Her territory is a wasteland of ice and stone where nothing grows and the wind never stops—perfect for a creature who prefers solitude to scheming.

Unlike many dragons who crave treasure, political power, or worship, Nyinsylys seems to want only to be left alone. She hunts the mountain goats and ice-adapted creatures of her domain, sleeps in glacier caves, and ignores the world below. Travelers who pass through her territory without disturbing her are often allowed to live—a rarity among white dragons, known for their cruelty.

This apparent passivity masks tremendous danger. Nyinsylys has destroyed expeditions that lingered too long, mining operations that cut too deep, and entire Zwaeron caravans that strayed into her hunting grounds. She does not negotiate, does not warn, and does not accept tribute. Those who displease her simply die in a storm of ice and fury.

The Kyth-haunted Nirvanis Mountains to her south seem to hold no terror for her. Some scholars speculate she has some arrangement with the spirits there, or that she is old enough to remember when those mountains were inhabited by the living. Others suggest the Kyth simply recognize her as something more dangerous than themselves.
