## Zosuun

Tags: dragon

Zosuun is an albino dragon who lairs in the coastal mountains of Gümloskos, north of Solhalven where the land meets the frozen Ocean of Azuros. His scales are the pale white of old ice, and his eyes burn with an unsettling inner light—not the warmth of fire dragons nor the cold gleam of white dragons, but something between.

He is one of the rare ice-fire dragons, a paradoxical creature whose breath can freeze or burn depending on his mood, sometimes both at once. Alchemists and mages have spent lifetimes trying to understand how such opposing forces can coexist in a single being. Zosuun has never deigned to explain.

The Valkyries of Solhalven maintain a careful distance from Zosuun. The dragon predates their arrival by centuries, and some scholars believe the angels who cursed them to guard Starreach chose this location specifically because Zosuun already claimed the region—an additional complication to their eternal duty. The Valkyries neither worship nor war with him; they simply... coexist, each attending to their own ancient business.

Zosuun hunts the pack ice and coastal waters, taking seals and the massive walruses that haul out on the northern shores. He has been seen diving through ice floes, emerging with prey frozen and burned simultaneously. Sailors who glimpse his white form against the snow and ice often mistake him for a cloud or a distant glacier—until he moves.

Unlike many dragons, Zosuun seems to have no interest in accumulating treasure in the traditional sense. His hoard, if he has one, remains unknown. What he does collect, according to Valkyrie accounts, are moments—memories stolen from those who trespass in his territory. Travelers who encounter him and survive often find gaps in their recollection, pieces of their past simply... gone.
