## Emtus

A crater lake in the Celedrim Plains.

## Ennros Lake

Tags: lake

Filled with Rusalka. Also home to the Sennites.

### Promise of Mythras

A massive stone object, permanently trapping the Sennites within Ennros Lake. Named after Mythras, the great dwarven family and king of Argysis before it fell to the dragon. When they got revenge, they placed a powerful enchantment on lake, barring the Sennites from ever leaving the lake. The Sennites would pay very handsomely for its removal.

On it is engraved, "A promise, once broken, can be no better reforged than a sword of diamond".

If a sword of diamond is brought to the site and broken, the enchantment is lifted.

Diamonds necessary to make an entire sword can only be found deep underground (verrrry deep) where it would be quite sketchy to go.

## Hills of Starfire

## Jotunhills

Tags: mountains

Home to the Jotuns—smaller, frosty giants. They survive and regenerate in the cold (attunement), but love the taste of flesh. Highly valued. Jotun will horde frozen humans as proof of their wealth. Will show them off to each other. Very cunning, though terrible communicators—similar to trolls.

## Konai Mora

### Kona Morai

A massive, white expanse—freezing cold, miserable, and incredibly dangerous.

Home to Mythandrulve, similar to the chulpe, but all white, and similar to wolves. No heirarchy of control like with chulpe—just a pack. All of them are roughly same size—smaller than Terragones, but bigger than chulpe. Huge paws, can run on top of the snow.

Think "vampire wolf gnolls" for vibe.

### Blistering Mountains

A mountain range north of Konai Mora, marking the northern boundary of the icy tundra.

#### Solhalven

A city-state north of the Blistering Mountains, home to the valkyries. This remote settlement serves as the guardians of one of the most extraordinary structures in all of Alaria.

##### Starreach

A tower that extends all the way from the ground to the Astral plane itself. The valkyries of Solhalven have been cursed to guard Starreach from the angels Sarakiel and Xaphkiel, and they are bound to permit only certain chosen individuals to ascend the tower. The curse has transformed what might have been an honor into an eternal duty, and the valkyries stand watch over this bridge between worlds, never knowing rest.

### Yukum's Wall

Although not actually a wall, this mountain range is rife with giants, wyverns, snow spirits, and an eternal blizzard, making passing through so treacherous that it has almost never been done. Located on the east side of Konai Mora (basin plains surrounded by mountains in northeast all the way to southwest). Yukum's Wall is coastal mountains, separating Ceredrim Plains from the Northern Isles. To its north are the Blistering Mountains (contiguous with Yukum's Wall, volcanos).
