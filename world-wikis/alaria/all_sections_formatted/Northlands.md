## Nysanna Range

Tags: mountains

The Nysanna Range is one of the most inhospitable places on Alaria. The entire range is plagued with constant blizzards, high winds, and freezing temperatures. It is rare for the temperature to climb above -20, and the high altitudes can cause people to make poor decisions.

Within the range lie a wide variety of wildlife, civilizations, and valuable resources.

### Witvein

Small subsection of the eastern part of the Nysanna Range on the northerly side. Mountainous and tunnel-laden glaciers filled with Wydlings.

## Plumes

## Senaveer Mountains

Tags: mountains

They are home to a large population of northern rocs, which hunt the caribou in the east. The mountains are rich with the lichen that feeds the caribou, so the Atowatowa herders will journey there every spring.

### Anderegnons

The Anderegnons are a miserable, cold, windy range of mountains, on the border of the Material Plane and Celesté. It is also a rich source of malstaric ash, which can be found throughout the mountains. The Bollinger Mining Company have discovered it, laid claim to it, and now mine and ship the ash south towards the sea. It is an incredibly expensive and dangerous operation, as food has to be shipped in, and ash shipped out. The journey is treacherous. They have so far managed to avoid the Atowtowa by skirting along the eastern edge of the Senaveer Mountains. However, stray too far west and get eaten by the Northern Rocs in the mountains, and stray too far east an get captured and killed by the Atowatowa.

The Plumes are a small region with frequent, intense geysers of fire and steam. Crabs live around the edge of the holes in the ground, feeding off the archea that grow in the hot vents. Docile Magma Snails are throughout.
