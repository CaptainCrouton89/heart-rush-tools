The Nysanna Range is one of the most inhospitable places on Alaria. The entire range is plagued with constant blizzards, high winds, and freezing temperatures. It is rare for the temperature to climb above -20, and the high altitudes can cause people to make poor decisions.

Within the range lie a wide variety of wildlife, civilizations, and valuable resources.
