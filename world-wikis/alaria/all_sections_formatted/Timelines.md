## World Timeline

### Timeline

Time, to the most modern scholar’s best understanding, has consisted of three eons of full world cycles. Each cycle is marked by ending with a reality warping event. The current cycle is still relatively “young” in terms of eon cycles.

### The Early Times

The first eon. Little is known about this time period.

#### The Cyclone of Possibilities: 4–1.3 billion years ago

During this time, nearly nothing is known. It is generally believed that a primordial soup of the cosmos was swirling around, with the period eventually cumulating with the rise of Azus. Azus and Melera were the first gods, each with differing mindsets. 

- Each created their own system of laws and behaviours of the world. For azus, everything was to be described, things had rules, and there was perfect balance: for creation, there would come destruction
- Melera, she viewed the world as an instrument, to be played. Creating beauty from nothing—there is no cost to creating something wonderful with music. Nobody knows about her, or knows this story.
- Together they created Ezz—an energy embodying both of their beliefs. However, Azus realized that his law and order was impossible—forever tainted by the randomness within the Ezz. He created Planar stacks—little bubbles protected from the Ezz.
- Azus hated the freeform nature of Melera, locked her in a prison of specificity.
- He creates the world alone. Begins organizing things into categories and boxes. Uses his magic, "Deoric" magic to do so. 
- Although Melera remains locked away still to this day, she creates her music from her prison, and it resonates across the universe. 
	- Things attributed to Melera
    	- Music
        - Gaea
        - Gaeic Melodies
        - Druids (part melody, part deoric origins—true mix)
        - The alarian planar stack bursting and Ezz spilling in was her. Before that, there was much more strict separation of the planes.
    - In a desparate effort to call for aid, Melera sent out a ripple of music. It was weak, but it was just enough to cause the Alarian Planar Stack to fracture, causing Ezz to pour in. 
- Azus is off toying with othr plains—hasn't visited Alaria since the the Ezz Rift—when his project was "ruined" (tainted by Melera's music). Melera has taken special interest in Alaria however, for she sees hope of someone there one day rising up and setting her free.

#### The Contraction: 1,300–235 million years ago

Azus began manipulating the cosmos, building planar stacks everywhere. It is believed he used an ancient ancestor of the Deoric language to do so. Over the course of over a billion years, Azus tightened and sorted the universe, bringing everything closer and closer together and into neater piles.

##### Azus Creates Alaria: 235 million years ago

#### The Age of Titans 235–100 million years ago

##### Alaria is Born: 235 million years ago

Alaria was one of the last planar stacks to form. It opened up without any psyic energy, and with only three planes—the material realm, the Astral Plane, and Malstaris.

##### Lyzaria Era: 235–180 million years ago

The first beings in Alaria were Nydus, Aurus, and Celest—three titan-gods, siblings who embodied the fundamental forces of the planar stack. After them came Lyzaria, the first daughter, and with her the first true titan was born.

###### Titan-Gods and Titans

The distinction between titan-gods and titans is critical. The **titan-gods**—Nydus, Aurus, and Celest—were not merely powerful beings but fundamental cosmic forces given form. They *are* the planes they embody: Aurus is the source of all souls, Nydus is the source of all shadows, and Celest became the seed of Celestia. As cosmic forces, they cannot truly be destroyed—only transformed. When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the titan-gods dissolved into their essential natures rather than dying.

**Titans**, by contrast, are their descendants—immensely powerful, capable of creating life and reshaping reality through Deoric, but ultimately mortal in ways their progenitors were not. Lyzaria was the first titan, and her ability to *choose* death proved the difference between her kind and the primordial three. Regular titans could be killed (as Eyachria later demonstrated), could go mad, could flee. The titan-gods could only ever become more fully what they already were.

###### Pre-Ezz Consciousness

The titans thought and created and made choices, yet Alaria had no Ezz during this age—no spirit-substance as mortals would later understand it. Titan consciousness was fundamentally different from the emotion-infused awareness that would come after. They were powered by pure Deoric structure, by direct connection to Azus's organizing principle. They had will without feeling, purpose without passion.

This explains why the Ezz Rift drove them mad. When Melera's music flooded Alaria, the titans experienced emotion for the first time—beings who had never felt were suddenly overwhelmed by feelings they had no framework to process. Their consciousness was *order*, and suddenly they were experiencing *randomness*. Many killed themselves simply to escape the unbearable novelty of grief, or joy, or despair.

Titans were enormous, powerful beings who were responsible for creating most life on Alaria, probably also using Deoric. They populated all three planes, though their most epic civilizations were built up in the depths of the Astral Sea and deep in the caves of Malstaris.

###### Lyzaria's Obsession

Unlike her kin, who built and created endlessly, Lyzaria was obsessed with endings. While other titans shaped mountains and crafted life, she studied what happened when things *stopped*. She created creatures specifically to observe their deaths. She weakened herself to understand weakness. She was the first being in Alaria to ask: *What comes next?*

###### The First Death

In an act that horrified her siblings, Lyzaria chose to die—the first titan to willingly end their own existence. When she did, she became the first being to experience the separation that death brings: her soul rose to the Astral Plane, her shadow sank to Malstaris, and through her sacrifice, the nature of mortality was defined.

Her soul spread across the Astral Sea, becoming the foundational substrate that later souls would settle into. She carved the grooves that make the Astral Plane a repository of the dead. To this day, every soul that enters the Astral Sea flows through traces of Lyzaria's essence. Scholars call this presence **The Dreaming of Lyzaria**—not a region, but the very fabric of the Astral Sea itself.

Her shadow, meanwhile, became something different in Malstaris. As the first secret that plane ever held—the secret of what death *is*—her shadow became the first and most ancient of the Shadow Lords. She rules a region of Malstaris that no other power dares challenge, and is known as **The First Dark**.

The tragic irony: Lyzaria's soul and shadow were once unified. Now they are separated across planes forever, unable to reunite. Some say the strange currents between the Astral Sea and Malstaris—the ways death sometimes feels *wrong*, the ways shadows sometimes seem to reach for light—are echoes of Lyzaria trying to become whole again.

###### The Seed of Celestia

Celest was younger than her twin brothers, Aurus and Nydus, and she was bound to the Material Plane while they claimed the Astral and Malstaris. She had also been touched by Melera's song in ways her brothers were not—a faint resonance that would prove significant. Nydus and Aurus fought frequently, wreaking destruction across all three planes, including on the hard work of the other titans.

Celest decided she could better serve the titans by sacrificing herself. As a titan-god, she could not truly die, but she could transform—and so she poured her essence into a pocket dimension, a protected space that existed outside the conflict between her brothers. This became the *seed* of Celestia: a refuge where those who died could persist, a source of power the titans could draw upon.

For 115 million years, this seed remained small and hidden—a pocket dimension accessible only through death. The titans knew of it but could not enter it while alive. Celest's sacrifice protected them, but Celestia itself was not yet a full plane.

##### Ezz Rift: 120 million years ago

The reign of titans ended with the Ezz Rift—a world flood that began when a leak in the Alarian Planar Stack caused Ezz to fill up the planar stack. As Alaria filled with Ezz, Melera's music filled the world. Emotions had never been felt by the titans, and they drove them mad. Titans, naturally ageless, killed themselves in droves to escape the unfamiliar and hated feelings. Those who could fled the plane, abandoning their cities, and flew to the cosmos. Where they are, if they are even still alive, remains a mystery. 

This marked the end of the second eon. The dead titan bodies that remain on Alaria are great sources of magical power, even today, though their scarcity is a source of enormous conflict wherever they are found. 

### The Gaeaic Eon: 120,000,000–7,210 years ago

Back in Alaria, the influx of Ezz transformed everything. The seed that Celest had planted 115 million years before—that small pocket dimension—suddenly *bloomed*. Ezz accumulated around Celestia because it was the only structure in Alaria that resonated with Melera's song. The pocket dimension expanded into a full plane, peeling away from the Material Plane to become its mirror-image flip side.

This is why Celestia has its strange dual nature: its *core* is Celest's essence (which is why it serves as a refuge for spirits), but its *substance* is made of Ezz (which is why it reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the living). The titan-god created the vessel; Melera's music filled it.

Many creatures died with the titans, but many others survived, acclimating to the new Ezz-infused atmosphere. This new planar atmosphere became the substrate in which psyic energy could flow. It gave new life, thought, emotion, and diversity to life on Alaria, and marked the beginning of the third eon.

#### Gaea is Born: 120 million years ago

The new world also gave rise to Gaea, the Earth Mother. Gaea was responsible for bringing emotion to Alaria. Her magic came straight from the psyic energy of Alaria, and she channeled it with the language she named as Kethic. Her home was everywhere, but she was strongest in the material realm. Gaea also had three sons: Nagatayora, the First Dragon; Ulvma, the First Wolf; and Shara Bolasi, the First Lion. Together, these were her protectors.

Gaea also created all manners of life. The mammoths of the northern plains, the dinosaurs of the easter jungles, the scorpions in the deserts, the giant rocs that soared across the skies, and everything else in between. However, intelligent life was absent except for the druids.

#### The Druids: 120 million years ago

Along with Gaea came the druids—an ancient race of beings so in touch with nature that they were believed to be incarnations of the wilderness and life itself. The druids do not belong to Gaea, like nearly every other creature born in this period, but work along side her. Often, their interests align, but not always.

The druids built small villages wherever there was life on Alaria. They took care of the land, and worked powerful magic to control it. Their magic is neither Kethic nor Deoric, but something older and stranger: **Faesong**, the ambient music of Melera herself. While Gaea channels psyic energy through Kethic, and the titans commanded reality through Deoric, the druids hear and harmonize with the melody that runs through all creation. This makes them a true mixture of both primordial sources—part of Azus's ordered creation, yet attuned to Melera's imprisoned song. 

#### The Reign of Dragons: 100–2.5 million years ago

Of her three children, Nagatayora was the eldest and proudest, and the species he spawned would prove to become the most powerful creatures since the Age of Titans. During this time, dragons covered all six planes of Alaria, securely at the top of the social and natural food chain.

Ulvma and Shara also became the first of their species, and populated the forests and plains of Alaria. As sibling species, the three groups would never prey on each eachother—something that remains true, even among the Naga, Sharabha, and Ulvsjael today.

##### The Walk of Elves: 10 million years ago

Although the druids never die of natural causes, they have slowly been killed off over time, such that only a few reside in Alaria today. However, their legacy remains, as the elves were created by the druids, from the branches of trees, the stones and mud from the rivers that ran through Alaria, and the life from the druids. The elves were made in the druid's images, and share their pointed ears, slender forms, and graceful movement, and have similar appreciations for nature and beauty as the druids.

The elves were good at everything they did, and quickly grew in population as they covered Alaria. They worked in harmony with the dragons for many years, and together, ruled the land.

##### Eyachria the Dragon Goddess: 2 million years ago

One of the dragons, Eyachria, was Nagatayora's favorite. She was the most noble, most honorable, most trustworthy of the dragons, and held the respect of all of Alaria. However, as she grew in eminence, she grew secretly jealous of Gaea's position as caretaker of the world. She decided that with time, she could replace Gaea. And so she grew and grew and grew for thousands and thousands of years, growing in size. After many thousands of years, her wingspan nearly stretched the planes. Cities grew upon her back. She was like a continent of her own. And it was now that she challenged Gaea as the caretaker of Alaria. Eyachria could move and breathe fire and cast powerful magic, and Gaea was but a song in the ground. And Eyachria was right—Gaea was no match for Eyachria. 

However, Nagatayora saw this, and just as he had given life to all other dragons, he could take it away. And with crushing despair, he ended Eyachria's life right then and there. She crashed to the ground, deceased. Her spine, however, is still visible as the collosal mountain range in the south of Aboyuinzu. 

#### The Birth of Man: 2,500,000–45,000 years ago

Gaea, jealous of the success and intelligence of the elves and the druids, soon set about working on her own creation. Although not as thoughtfully constructed as the elves, the determination that fueled her craft flowed into her creation, and from her work spawned the beastmen and humans. 

##### The Golden Age of Man: 200,000–75,000 years ago

Of the races of Gaea, humans were by far the most versatile and ambitious, and it was not long before humans had covered Alaria. This began the Golden Age of Man—125,000 years of flourishing civilization. Technology reached incredible levels that have never been reached since. Flying machines soared across the skies and beyond the planes, civilizations stretched from deep within the seas to high in the clouds, and magical knowledge was common and plentiful.

This time also gave rise to the daemons of Celestia. As Gaea’s children explored the world, the nature of the bond between Celestia, the material realm, and the psyic energy enveloping them both became known. People began moving across the boundary in droves, and the population dramatically shifted away from the material realm to Celestia.

##### The God War: 75,000 years ago

As people shifted over, believers and prayers started to quickly fade, and people across Celestia begat disappearing. With the risks of returning to the material realm being to great, many remained, and fought viciously amongst themselves for followers on the material realm.

The combination of a competition for survival among the daemons and a gross expenditure of power on their followers resulted in total war. Most people died, many others returned from Celestia and hid in isolation, and others fought on. The world war continued for years until a follower of Dyos used all of the power of his god to force an eruption of the Kajiit volcano. Immediately killing millions more, this began a volcanic winter that would set the world into a multi-millennia ice age.

##### The Long Winter: 75,000–45,000 years ago

As everything died, and ice age set in, the small pockets of surviving civilization went into hiding in the mountains, surviving off of lichens and hunting the wild animals that roamed the surface. No daemons survived, as residents of the material realm lost all faith in their gods. Hundreds of dragons died as well, while many of those who survived terrorized the skies, hunting anything that could be found. Technology regressed to a primitive state once more.

#### The Age of Craggus: 45,000–30,000 years ago

The Age of Craggus began when Craggus, a young man, survived a journey to Celestia with an avid group of devotees who remained alive in their tribe back on the material realm. The tribe began spreading the word of Craggus, who grew in power and slowly began to lift civilization out of despair. He was the first Daemon, god of all men.

##### The Rise of the King: 45,000 years ago

Over the next thousand years, Craggus’ name became more and more known, and with magnificent effort, he pushed back the ice age, ending millions of years of desolation. He was seen as a hero, and became the sole god of the material realm. 

##### Craggus’ Reign: 45,000–30,000 years ago

The next fifteen thousand years were marked by Craggus’ kingship among the daemons of Celestia. Although society returned to its state of frequent war and conflict, and others joined Craggus in Celestia, Craggus remained king of all, and Alaria remained relatively stable. Technology climbed back to an industrial level, as people relearned how to harness the power of aetherium. Fortunate period during which the killing moon remained dormant for the duration.

#### The Lost Ages: 30,000–10,209 years ago

Less is known about the Lost Ages, as the time was marked by years of hardship and despair. Craggus' reign came to an end with the start of the laughing plague, which destroyed much of the progress made up to this point. 

##### The Laughing Plague: 30,000–28,800 BSD

Craggus’ reign was brought to an end with the arrival of the laughing plague. The laughing plague was a brutal disease from the plane of Glyssen. How it got to Alaria remains unknown, but it slowly drove all those exposed to it into a fevering, maniacal madness that incited them to horrible acts of violence, all while unconrollably laughing. It spread through prolonged exposure to the sound of the laughter, and brought nearly all of Alaria to bloodthirsty insanity. A fight for the survival of life on Alaria began, with creatures forced to turn on their own kin who had been infected. For 1,200 years, the Alarian population dwindled as people went into isolation and trade and progress stopped.

The disease ran its course, and left the civilizations of Alaria in shambles. Entire cities lay barren—their citizens all dead, at each others’ hands. Only those deep underground or completely isolated survived unaffected. Most written history was lost at this time, and technology once again regressed to a primitive state. 

###### Dwarves

A few among the population held a natural resistance to this corrupting plague. Although they were immune to it's violence inciting effects, the disease stunted growth and fundamentally and permanently changed those who survived it. These men were known as dwarves. Entire communities of those immune formed—many of which were underground.

It is rumored that the laughing plague still circulates deep underground Alaria, among the Kackles—held at bay by the Uline dwarves.

##### Rise of the False God: 28,700–28,000 BSD

##### Blight of Arcanus: 12,000 BSD

Magic was cursed, using it killed you. Brought down the entire empire.

##### The Dark Night: 12,000–11,500 BSD

A 500 year long night, caused by a shadowrift. A time of great fear and loss for the world.

##### The Oblivion Years: 11,500–10,400 BSD

Lost all information. Starting over.

##### The Hel Dynasties: 11,400–10,900 BSD

Series of tryannical dynasties, complete overlords over world

Ends with the Killing Moon.

##### The Blood War: 10,900 BSD

Battle between dynasties, no winners

#### Hykravones: 10,210–10,209 BSD

Before the titans fled and died, Hykravones, the Gray Prince went into inter dimensional space, only returning millions of years later. The world as he knew it had been destroyed, and he flew into a rage, and began dismantling Alaria.

Gaea’s children, with the help of several other peoples including the Vystrilik fought the Gray Prince. The daemons across Celestia helped where they could, though efforts were disjointed. Daemons did not want to give up everything they had, at risk of losing followers and influence. By the time they realized they had to, it was too late.

The Gray Prince ultimately destroyed nearly all civilization. Nearly ever daemon died as their base of followers was wiped out. The World was set back thousands of years technologically. After ravaging the world, the Gray Prince went dormant, never to be seen again. Legend is that he still lives on Alaria, asleep deep within the ground, one day to reawaken and finish his work.

##### Rebirth of Gaea's Children

From the blood and soil of gaea's fallen children rose the Sharabha, Ulvsjael, and Naga. 

##### The Greatest Sacrifice

In the final months of Hykavones' destruction, nearly every daemon across Celestia saw that they were about to get completely wiped out. While some faught, others snuck back to the material plane—taking on new forms and going into hiding. These daemons would ultimately go on to found new races—descending from themselves. 

### The Modern Era: 10,209 BSD–Now

The Modern Era makes up the third and current eon.

#### The Great Expansion: 9,950–0 BSD

Not everyone perished, and those who survived began the work of rebuilding. 

##### Frost Fall: 8,840–8,695 BSD

##### The Return of Dragons: 8,104 BSD

Most sentient creatures did not get along with dragons, who were quickly taking over. This led to a lot of fiery and bloody conflict. 

##### The World Fire: 10 BSD
