# Greenwater Isles

## Geography

The Greenwater Isles are a tropical archipelago lying between Upoceax to the west and south, and Rimihuica to the north and east. The region is dominated by the great island of **Urok** at its center, surrounded by a ring of seas, straits, and smaller island states. Bright teal waters, coral reefs, and lush green vegetation characterize this perpetually warm region.

### The Island of Urok (Central)

The largest landmass in the Greenwater Isles, Urok dominates the center of the region:

- **Northern Urok**: Rainforests and dense jungles
- **Central Urok**: The **Pearly Mountains** run east-west across the island's midsection
- **Southern Urok**: The state of **Xoth**

### Surrounding Waters (Clockwise from North)

**Agreben Sea** (North): The northern waters of the archipelago, containing several island states:
- **Crab Island**: Home to the city-state of **Blackport**
- **Prophecy Island**: North of Crab Island
- **Smokestack Island**: East of Prophecy Island
- **Pelaria**, **Glador**, and **Flurin**: Three states in the eastern Agreben Sea

**Shriyen Passage** (Northeast): The strait separating Urok from the Ishnit Jungles of Rimihuica.

**Gulf of Norag** (East): The waters east of the passage, near the Ishnit coast.

**Movasi** (Southeast): A large island covered by the **Dream Jungle**, lying between the Gulf of Norag and the Sea of Spiders.

**Sea of Spiders** (Southeast): The southeastern waters of the archipelago.

**Roule** (South): An island state south of Urok, home to halflings.
- **Roule Channel**: The waters south of Roule, separating the Greenwater Isles from Sandreach (Upoceax)
- **Gulf of Xoth**: The waters between Roule and southern Urok

**Bejeweled Sea** (West): The waters between Urok and the Farlands of Upoceax.

**Chykos Strait** (Northwest): Connects the Bejeweled Sea to the Agreben Sea, passing between Urok and the Seacleft Coast.

### Neighboring Regions

- **West**: The Seacleft Coast and Farlands of Upoceax
- **North/Northeast**: The Ishnit Jungles of Rimihuica, across the Shriyen Passage

## Notable Locations

### Agreben Sea Islands

#### Prophecy Island

Located north of Crab Island and west of Smokestack Island, Prophecy Island was once heralded as a miracle—a volcanic island that rose directly from the sea, seemingly as a gift from the gods to the people. Colonists arrived with hope and built a thriving civilization, believing they had found their promised land.

For two years, the settlement flourished. Then the volcano erupted a second time, burying the entire population in ash and lava. The ruins of Zyquirk village remain visible among the hardened lava flows, a haunting reminder of false prophecy and divine cruelty. Some say the island continues to whisper false promises to sailors who pass too close, luring them to their doom.

Maun is the home to the most famous dwarven school of music and theater in Alaria. Many bards travel to Maun to learn from the great scholars of the school. 

Comes with a cost. Everyone who goes *must* serve a year in the military or mines, either mining or fighting the beasts within the mountain. You can either do it simultaneously, or sequentially. 

Yearly competition at the school for musical ability. Chapion gets an incredibly powerful magical instrument.

"The Ghost" wanders halls of school, offering help. Some believe he is one of the founders.

#### Sunbeam Prison

At the intersection of light and force leylines in the Roule Channel stands one of the most unusual prisons in all of Alaria. The Sunbeam Prison is not made of stone or iron, but of beams of solidified light bound together by force magic. These sunbeams create a perfect cage—impenetrable, unbreakable, and visible from miles away as they shimmer above the water. The prison requires constant magical maintenance to sustain the leyline convergence, making it both a marvel of magical engineering and a constant drain on resources.

At the southwestern tip of the Pearly Mountains, north of the Tyberoskos forest, lies the Shenchen Forest—an eerie woodland inhabited by ancient samurai suits of enchanted armor. These dark knights stand eternal vigil over ruined shrines and temples, their armor animated by old magic. The forest grew up around and atop the ruins, but the guardians remain, still defending the sacred sites they were bound to protect centuries ago.

Approaching the ruins means facing these spectral sentinels, whose skill with blade and bow has not diminished with the passing years. They attack intruders without warning or mercy, their movements as precise and deadly as the day they were first enchanted.

### Xoth

On Prophecy Island

When people settled on this isle, a prophet said that the isle would be destroyed by the gods. Nobody listened, but eventually the island erupted, and her prophecy came true. Now believed to be cursed.
