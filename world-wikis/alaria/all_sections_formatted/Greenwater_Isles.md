# Greenwater Isles

## Geography

The Greenwater Isles are a tropical archipelago lying between Upoceax to the west and south, and Rimihuica to the north and east. The region is dominated by the great island of **Urok** at its center, surrounded by a ring of seas, straits, and smaller island states. Bright teal waters, coral reefs, and lush green vegetation characterize this perpetually warm region.

### The Island of Urok (Central)

The largest landmass in the Greenwater Isles, Urok dominates the center of the region:

- **Northern Urok**: Rainforests and dense jungles
- **Central Urok**: The **Pearly Mountains** run east-west across the island's midsection
- **Southern Urok**: The state of **Xoth**

### Surrounding Waters (Clockwise from North)

**Agreben Sea** (North): The northern waters of the archipelago, bounded by Mueras to the north, Atriik to the east, and Urok to the south. Contested between the elegant Kendrel Kingdoms along the eastern shelf and Bfaspeen broods in the deeper waters. See [Agreben Sea](Agreben%20Sea.md) for full details.

The **Kendrel Kingdoms**—three allied states of aquatic Kendrel civilization:
- **Flurin** (north): Cosmopolitan gateway, handling most surface trade. See [Flurin](Flurin.md).
- **Glador** (center): Traditional heartland, largest and most insular. See [Glador](Glador.md).
- **Pelaria** (south): Volcanic kingdom, fire-attuned and militarized. See [Pelaria](Pelaria.md).

Western islands outside Kendrel territory:
- **Crab Island**: Home to the pirate city-state of **Blackport**
- **Prophecy Island**: Volcanic island with cursed ruins
- **Smokestack Island**: Active volcano, pyromancer's domain

**Shriyen Passage** (Northeast): The strait separating Urok from the Ishnit Jungles of Rimihuica.

**Gulf of Norag** (East): The waters east of the passage, near the Ishnit coast.

**Movasi** (Southeast): A large island covered by the **Dream Jungle**, lying between the Gulf of Norag and the Sea of Spiders.

**Sea of Spiders** (Southeast): The southeastern waters of the archipelago.

**Roule** (South): An island state south of Urok, home to halflings.
- **Roule Channel**: The waters south of Roule, separating the Greenwater Isles from Sandreach (Upoceax)
- **Gulf of Xoth**: The waters between Roule and southern Urok

**Bejeweled Sea** (West): The waters between Urok and the Farlands of Upoceax.

**Chykos Strait** (Northwest): Connects the Bejeweled Sea to the Agreben Sea, passing between Urok and the Seacleft Coast.

### Neighboring Regions

- **West**: The Seacleft Coast and Farlands of Upoceax
- **North/Northeast**: The Ishnit Jungles of Rimihuica, across the Shriyen Passage
- **South**: Sandreach (Upoceax) across the Roule Channel
- **Southeast**: The Sea of Spiders, then open ocean

### Agreben Sea Islands

#### Prophecy Island

Located north of Crab Island and west of Smokestack Island, Prophecy Island was once heralded as a miracle—a volcanic island that rose directly from the sea, seemingly as a gift from the gods to the people. Colonists arrived with hope and built a thriving civilization, believing they had found their promised land.

For two years, the settlement flourished. Then the volcano erupted a second time, burying the entire population in ash and lava. The ruins of Zyquirk village remain visible among the hardened lava flows, a haunting reminder of false prophecy and divine cruelty. Some say the island continues to whisper false promises to sailors who pass too close, luring them to their doom.

## Agreben Sea

Tags: sea, geography, greenwater-isles

The northern waters of the Greenwater Isles archipelago—a warm, teal-colored sea bounded by Mueras to the north, Atriik to the east, and the great island of Urok to the south. The Agreben is contested territory: the elegant reef-cities of the Kendrel Kingdoms line the eastern continental shelf, while Bfaspeen broods lair in the deeper waters to the west and south.

### Geography

The Agreben Sea occupies roughly 400 miles east-to-west and 300 miles north-to-south. The waters are shallow along the eastern edge where the continental shelf supports Kendrel civilization, deepening rapidly toward the center and west into trenches that Bfaspeen favor.

**North Agreben**: The northern reaches of the sea, where cooler currents from the Darkened Coast meet warmer tropical waters. Mueras's fragmented coastline creates complex navigation.

**The Eastern Shelf**: Shallow, warm waters perfect for coral reef cultivation. Home to the three Kendrel Kingdoms—Flurin, Glador, and Pelaria—arranged north to south along the coast.

**The Central Deep**: Open water too deep for permanent Kendrel settlement, patrolled by Bfaspeen hunting parties. Merchant ships crossing between the western islands and the eastern kingdoms travel in convoys or not at all.

**The Volcanic South**: Where Pelaria's thermal vents begin, the water temperature rises sharply. This zone is contested between Pelarian forces and Bfaspeen broods, with neither side holding permanent advantage.

### The Kendrel Kingdoms

Three Kendrel states occupy the eastern Agreben, collectively known as the Kendrel Kingdoms despite their distinct governments and occasional rivalry:

**Flurin** (north): The cosmopolitan gateway, handling most trade with surface nations. See [Flurin](Flurin.md).

**Glador** (center): The traditional heartland, largest and most insular of the three. See [Glador](Glador.md).

**Pelaria** (south): The volcanic kingdom, fire-attuned and militarized. See [Pelaria](Pelaria.md).

The kingdoms maintain formal alliance against external threats (primarily Bfaspeen) while competing fiercely in trade, prestige, and the elaborate courtship-politics that define Kendrel society.

### Western Islands

Several smaller islands dot the central and western Agreben, outside Kendrel territory:

**Crab Island**: Volcanic island hosting the city-state of Blackport—a notorious pirate haven controlled by the retired Nyolci captain Bridger Blindeyes. Black lavarock bluffs give the port its name. Ships seeking to cross the central Agreben often stop here, whatever their opinion of the management. See [Blackport](Blackport.md).

**Prophecy Island**: North of Crab Island, a volcanic island with a grim history. Colonists built a thriving settlement here, believing the island a divine gift. Two years later, the volcano erupted, burying everything. The ruins of Zyquirk village remain visible among hardened lava flows. See [Zyquirk](Zyquirk.md).

**Smokestack Island**: An active volcanic island east of Prophecy Island, wreathed in perpetual steam and smoke. Home to a reclusive pyromancer who has built a dungeon-complex into the volcano itself. Locals give it wide berth.

### The Bfaspeen Threat

The deeper Agreben waters host multiple Bfaspeen broods—eel-bodied monstrosities with mandibles, bulbous eyes, and a pathological lust for gold. They live in strict matriarchal groups, raiding ships for treasure and dragging prey to their underwater lairs.

The Kendrel have fought the Bfaspeen since before recorded history. Glador maintains purely defensive positions. Pelaria conducts active operations against brood-mother lairs. Flurin provides intelligence and tries to stay out of direct fighting. The conflict has no end in sight—but it's also what keeps the three kingdoms cooperating despite their differences.

### Navigation

**The Eastern Route**: Following the continental shelf from Flurin south to Pelaria, this is the safest passage through the Agreben. Kendrel patrols keep Bfaspeen activity suppressed, and the shallow waters make ambush difficult.

**The Central Crossing**: Direct routes between the western islands and eastern kingdoms cross deep water. Bfaspeen hunting parties make this dangerous. Merchant convoys form regularly at Blackport; individual ships take their chances.

**The Northern Passage**: Skirting the Darkened Coast toward Mueras. Avoids Bfaspeen but brings other hazards—the supernatural shadow that shrouds Mueras's eastern waters breeds strange creatures and stranger currents.

### What Travelers Should Know

- Surface vessels are generally safe in Kendrel-controlled waters, but should follow established routes and not anchor in unknown locations overnight.
- The Kendrel are friendly to trade but have elaborate social protocols. Causing offense—especially through violence—can result in permanent exclusion from all three kingdoms.
- Blackport asks no questions and offers no guarantees. It's useful, not safe.
- The central deep is genuinely dangerous. Don't cross alone, don't carry visible treasure, and don't assume help is coming if something goes wrong.
- Pelarian waters are too hot for normal swimming. Visitors need magical protection or specialized equipment.

## Bejeweled Sea

## Blackport

Tags: citystate

Named after the black, lavarock bluffs the surround the island. A very convenient stop for traders from Mueras going south, it has grown to a large city. Built on a hillside, stacked on top of itself.

Also harboring some infamous pirates. The city is controlled by the retired, Nyolci pirate king Bridger Blindeyes who has decided to overlook the pirates who use his port.

Home to many Nyolci.

## Flurin

Tags: region, kendrel, greenwater-isles

The northernmost of the three Kendrel Kingdoms, occupying a chain of barrier islands and submerged reef-cities along the eastern edge of the Agreben Sea. Where its sister kingdoms turn inward, Flurin faces outward—toward Atriik, toward trade, toward the surface world.

### Geography

Flurin stretches roughly 120 miles north to south, a scattered constellation of coral atolls, volcanic islets, and deeper reef-fortresses. The continental shelf here is relatively shallow, allowing the cultivated reef architecture that defines Kendrel civilization. Surface settlements serve as interface points for air-breathing traders; the true cities sprawl beneath the waves in lattices of coral and bioluminescent gardens.

**Northern Waters**: Cool currents from North Agreben create comfortable temperatures for standard Kendrel. The border with Mueras's Darkened Coast brings occasional strange phenomena—darker-than-normal waters and unusual creatures drifting south.

**Eastern Edge**: Just thirty miles from Atriik's coast, making Flurin the natural gateway between Kendrel civilization and surface trade.

**Southern Border**: The Passage Gardens mark the transition to Glador—coral sculptures maintained by both kingdoms as a symbol of unity.

### Major Settlements

- **Azulora** (capital): Spiral of coral towers rising from a submerged volcanic cone. Population ~8,000.
- **Watalina**: Surface-accessible trade port, primary interface with Atriik.
- **Ashenia**: Northern fishing village near the Darkened Coast.
- **Voltunis**: Southern border town at the Passage Gardens.

### Character

More cosmopolitan than Glador, more commercially-minded than Pelaria. Flurin has developed extensive infrastructure for air-breathers and maintains the closest relationships with surface nations. The Pelaendor subrace dominates, their practical pragmatism suited to constant dealings with outsiders.

See [Flurin (State)](../../nations_and_powers/states/Flurin.md) for governance, culture, and political details.

## Glador

Tags: region, kendrel, greenwater-isles

The heart of the Kendrel Kingdoms—oldest, largest, and most stubbornly traditional. Glador occupies the central archipelago of the eastern Agreben Sea, a maze of reef-fortresses and coral palaces where the ancient customs of Kendrel society are preserved in amber-like perfection.

### Geography

Glador sprawls across roughly 200 miles of the Agreben's eastern waters, from the Flurin border in the north to Pelaria's volcanic reaches in the south. The continental shelf here is broad and shallow, perfect for cultivated reef architecture.

**The Reef Cities**: Underwater forests of giant kelp alternate with open plains of cultivated coral. The reef-cities are vertical complexes, with different depth-layers serving different social functions.

**The Trenches**: Deep channels cut through the shelf, providing natural defenses against Bfaspeen incursions. These have been cultivated over millennia to channel attacks into defensive kill zones.

**The Surface Islands**: Scattered volcanic islets provide the minimal surface presence Glador maintains—mostly for receiving foreign visitors who cannot survive underwater.

### Major Settlements

- **Delphran** (capital): The Abyssal Throne's seat, largest Kendrel city anywhere. Vertical complex descending through five depth-layers. Population ~25,000.
- **Aquicada**: Northern gateway, handling traffic with Flurin.
- **Telune**: Northern village with the famous Oracle Pools.
- **Liculvia**: Eastern settlement, quietly handles surface trade.
- **Thautias**: Central town, famous for memory coral artisans.
- **Caecadis**: Southern border town where disputes with Pelaria are resolved.
- **Neptusia**: Deep-water Cendoriln village.

### Character

Insular, refined, and utterly convinced of its own superiority. Glador is Court Kendrel territory—the iridescent-scaled aristocrats who elevated social manipulation to art form. Violence remains the ultimate obscenity; all conflicts are resolved through social pressure, reputation warfare, and (when necessary) quiet Cendoriln intervention.

## Gulf of Norag

Tags: bay, sea, geography

A warm, shallow gulf where the Greenwater Isles meet the mainland coast of the Ishnit Jungles. The gulf's waters shift from the characteristic teal of the Greenwater archipelago to murky green near shore, where jungle rivers dump silt and organic matter into the sea.

### Character

The Gulf of Norag is beautiful and treacherous in equal measure. Coral formations create a maze of shallow channels that only experienced pilots can navigate safely. The waters teem with life—brilliantly colored fish, sea turtles, and hunting sharks that follow the fish. Above the waterline, jungle-covered headlands plunge directly into the sea, offering few natural harbors.

The gulf's primary danger isn't the reefs or the sharks. It's what watches from shore.

### Demortik Bay

The western arm of the Gulf of Norag curves around a jungle cape topped by Demonwatch—a darkstone palace visible from miles out to sea. Sailors call this inlet Demortik Bay, a corruption of "demon-tide bay," and avoid it religiously.

The waters here are unnaturally still. Fish avoid the bay. Even sharks turn away at its mouth. Local Naruaghin believe the demons confined to Demonwatch have poisoned the water with their presence—not literally toxic, but spiritually tainted. Whether true or superstition, vessels that anchor in Demortik Bay report crew nightmares, equipment failures, and occasionally crew members who walk into the water and don't return.

The bay would make an excellent harbor if anyone were foolish enough to use it.

### Strategic Significance

The Gulf of Norag represents an untapped trade route. Ships traveling between the Greenwater Isles and the western mainland currently swing wide around the Ishnit coast, adding days to their journey to avoid the gulf's dangers. A safe passage through the gulf—and more critically, a friendly port on its shores—would cut significant time from the voyage.

No one controls the gulf. The Naruaghin tribes don't build ships. The Dwelyn of Enapay maintain no naval presence. The waters are technically unclaimed, which means they belong to whoever's willing to fight for them.

Merchant houses have discussed establishing a trading post, but the combination of Demonwatch's curse, the warring tribes, and three territorial dragons within striking distance has deterred every attempt.

### Navigation Hazards

**The Coral Maze**: Shallow reefs extend miles from shore, with channels that shift seasonally as storms rearrange the coral. Local knowledge is essential.

**Jungle Rivers**: The Ishtar River and several smaller waterways dump fresh water and debris into the gulf, creating unpredictable currents and reducing visibility near shore.

**Weather**: Sudden tropical squalls blow in from the open sea with little warning. The gulf's shallow waters become violent chop in heavy weather.

**Dragons**: Both Pythalomos and Senwyn the Agonizer hunt over the gulf waters. Ships are generally too small to interest them, but "generally" provides cold comfort when a green dragon shadow passes overhead.

### Settlements

No permanent settlements exist on the Gulf of Norag's shores. The nearest civilization is **Lise**, capital of Enapay, located inland along the Ishtar River delta where the jungle gives way to the Green Wilds. Naruaghin fishing camps dot the coast temporarily, abandoned when the tribes move or when dragon activity increases.

Ambitious merchants occasionally anchor in the gulf's eastern reaches, trading with whatever Naruaghin are willing to approach. These transactions are tense, brief, and conducted with weapons visible on both sides.

## Movasi

Tags: island, state, nation, geography, pilgrimage, psychedelic

A large island in the southeastern Greenwater Isles, Movasi is covered almost entirely by the **Dream Jungle**—a bioluminescent forest where the boundary between waking perception and something deeper grows dangerously thin. The island is home to the **Velwey**, a reclusive society of dwarves who've built their civilization around the jungle's psychedelic properties and the sacred Pool of Names at their capital.

Pilgrims travel from across the known world to undergo the Velwey ritual: a guided psychedelic journey that can reveal one's **true name**—the magical identity that persists into the afterlife. For those who fear the permanent death that comes when spirits are forgotten in Celestia, Movasi offers something priceless: the chance to learn what name their followers must speak to keep them alive beyond death.

### Geography

Movasi lies between the **Gulf of Norag** to the northeast and the **Sea of Spiders** to the southeast. The island stretches roughly 200 miles across—large enough to lose yourself in, small enough that the jungle's influence reaches every corner.

**Telugai Bay** curves along the southern coast, offering the only reliable anchorage. The waters here run unusually calm; dissolved compounds from the island's runoff sedate the marine life and dull the currents. Ships approaching Movasi often report crews growing drowsy, dreaming vividly even while awake. Experienced captains warn passengers to stay topside until they've docked at Holik.

The coastline is ringed by a narrow band of conventional tropical vegetation—mangroves, palms, beaches of gray-white sand. This buffer zone lasts perhaps a mile before the Dream Jungle begins.

### The Dream Jungle

The jungle that covers Movasi's interior defies easy description. The canopy runs purple-green rather than the expected tropical emerald, shot through with bioluminescent veins that pulse faintly even in daylight. At night, the forest glows.

**The Pods**: Every tree hosts clusters of fist-sized pods that emit soft purple and green light. These pods contain the concentrated psychoactive compounds that make Movasi unique. Cracked open, the sap inside can be refined into the sacramental preparations the Velwey use in their rituals. Left intact, the pods simply breathe their contents into the air.

**Ambient Effects**: Walking through the Dream Jungle induces mild dissociation even without consuming anything. The air itself carries enough psychoactive pollen and spore-matter to alter perception. First-time visitors often describe feeling watched, sensing presences at the edge of vision, hearing voices that might be their own thoughts spoken aloud. Experienced travelers learn to distinguish hallucination from reality. Most of the time.

**The Deep Jungle**: Farther from the coast, the effects intensify. The pods grow larger, the glow brighter, the boundary between inner experience and outer reality harder to locate. The Velwey have mapped safe routes through this terrain, but unguided travel is strongly discouraged. People who wander into the deep jungle without preparation sometimes emerge changed. Sometimes they don't emerge at all.

### Settlements

#### Holik

The only port town, built on the southern coast where Telugai Bay offers shelter for ships. Holik exists as a buffer between the outside world and the Dream Jungle proper—a place for pilgrims to arrive, acclimate, and prepare before venturing inland.

The architecture here is deliberately mundane: stone foundations, timber frames, thatched or tiled roofs. Nothing glows. The Velwey built it this way intentionally, a concession to visitors who need solid ground before facing what comes next.

**The Quarantine Period**: New arrivals must spend at least three days in Holik before proceeding inland. This isn't bureaucratic delay—the jungle's ambient effects can overwhelm the unprepared, inducing psychotic breaks in those who encounter the full intensity without gradual exposure. Holik's lower concentration allows visitors to adjust.

**Services**: Licensed brokers connect pilgrims with appropriate Velwey priest-guides. Apothecaries sell preparation compounds (to ease the transition) and clarity tonics (to resist the jungle's effects for those who'd rather stay sober). Merchants offer everything a pilgrim might need and several things they probably don't.

**The Sober Quarter**: A district where clarity tonics are dispensed freely and the buildings are sealed against outside air. Sailors who refuse to sleep on Movasi stay here, conducting their business quickly and departing before their defenses fail.

**The Returnees**: Some who complete the pilgrimage never leave Holik. They linger at the docks, helping new arrivals, offering advice no one asked for. Something about the ritual changes people, and not everyone finds their way back to who they were before.

Population: ~4,000 (fluctuates with pilgrim traffic). Majority non-Velwey: humans, halflings, elves.

#### Moura

The capital, built around the **Pool of Names**—the sacred site where pilgrims undergo the ritual to learn their true name. Moura sits in the west-central interior, deep enough in the jungle that the ambient effects are constant but not overwhelming.

**Velwey Architecture**: The city is built *in* the trees rather than beneath them. Platforms and structures of woven vines, crystallized dream-matter, and shaped wood spiral up through the canopy, connected by rope bridges and spiral stairs. The buildings breathe with soft purple-green light. Walls shimmer with half-seen images—not decorations, but residue from generations of dreaming.

**The Pool of Names**: At the city's heart lies a still, dark body of water. The Pool predates the Velwey—they found it when they first came to Movasi, studied its properties, built their civilization around it. The surface reflects nothing. The depth is unknown. Some say it connects to something deeper than water.

The ritual itself takes days of preparation: fasting, guided lesser trips, confession of all names the pilgrim currently knows. On the final night, the pilgrim drinks the prepared sacrament and submerges alone. What they experience in the dark water varies. Most emerge knowing their true name. Some emerge knowing other things. A few don't emerge at all—the Pool claims perhaps one in fifty pilgrims, their bodies never recovered.

**The Confidentiality Architecture**: The Velwey designed the ritual so that priest-guides never learn the pilgrim's name. They prepare you, stabilize you, guide you to the threshold—but the moment of revelation happens in a space they cannot access. You submerge alone. What you hear in the dark is between you and whatever answers.

This is why pilgrims trust the Velwey: not because they're virtuous, but because the ritual makes betrayal impossible.

**The Speaking Houses**: After emerging from the Pool, pilgrims often need to speak their name aloud—to commit it to memory, to practice forming the sounds, to share it with chosen witnesses. The Speaking Houses are private chambers where this can happen safely, warded against eavesdropping by any means.

Population: ~12,000 (mostly Velwey, plus transient pilgrims and support staff).

#### Dreftwaf

A meadow in the northern interior where the jungle thins to swampy grassland. The Velwey maintain this as a **preparation site**—where pilgrims spend the days of fasting and preliminary rituals before they're ready for the Pool.

The clearing exists because the Velwey deliberately suppress the jungle's growth here, creating a space of lower psychedelic intensity. Simple treehouse accommodations dot the meadow's edges. The atmosphere is quiet, contemplative, anxious—everyone here is waiting for something that will change their life.

**The Lesser Journeys**: Priest-guides conduct preliminary rituals here, using diluted preparations to help pilgrims practice navigating altered states. These "lesser trips" are training for what the Pool will demand.

**The Confessionals**: Before facing the Pool, pilgrims must confess every name they know—their own common name, the names of family, friends, enemies, gods they worship. This isn't religious penance; it's preparation. The ritual works better when the mind is cleared of other names.

Population: ~800 permanent (Velwey priests and support staff), plus 200-400 transient pilgrims.

#### Trusiin

A meadow in the east-central interior, another swampy clearing where the jungle's intensity lessens. Trusiin serves as the **integration site**—where pilgrims go *after* the Pool to process what they learned.

Learning your true name is one thing. Deciding what to do with it is another.

**The Weight of Knowledge**: A true name is power—and vulnerability. Anyone who knows your true name can command you through Deoric magic, puppet you like a marionette. But if no one knows your true name when you die, your spirit will eventually fade from Celestia into permanent oblivion.

The priests at Trusiin help pilgrims navigate this paradox. Who do you tell? How do you tell them? What bindings or oaths might protect you? Some pilgrims resolve these questions in days. Some take weeks. Some never leave—they learned their name and realized they have no one in the world they trust enough to share it with.

**The Memorial Stones**: At the meadow's center stand dozens of carved stones, each bearing a true name spoken by a pilgrim who had no one else to tell. Whether the stones remember, whether the jungle remembers, whether speaking your name to the swamp counts as being known—the Velwey don't say.

Population: ~600 permanent, plus 100-300 transient pilgrims.

#### Banguna

A small village east of Moura, in a clearing near the jungle's edge. Banguna is where the **harvesters** live—the workers who cultivate, collect, and process the jungle's psychedelic bounty.

**The Cultivation Fields**: The villagers maintain controlled growing areas where specific pod varieties are encouraged. Different strains produce different effects; the sacramental preparation used in the Pool ritual requires precise combinations.

**The Processing Houses**: Raw pod-sap must be refined before use. The Processing Houses are workshops where this happens—drying, filtering, combining, aging. The work is skilled and dangerous. Errors can produce preparations that kill, or worse.

**The Workers**: Banguna's population is mixed: some Velwey, many humans and elves hired for their steady hands and expendable minds. The workers here are constantly exposed to psychoactive residue. They see things others don't. They're not always sure what's real. Turnover is high.

Population: ~1,200.

#### Kung

An isolated village in the southwest interior, far from the pilgrim routes. Kung is home to **the skeptics**—people who don't trust the Velwey's monopoly on truth.

**The Old Ways**: Before the Velwey formalized the Pool ritual, people sought their true names through longer, harder methods: solo journeys into the deep jungle, days of fasting and exposure, communion with the plants without priestly intermediaries. Kung's residents practice these older techniques.

They claim their methods are purer—that the Pool ritual has been optimized for throughput rather than truth. The Velwey call them reckless mystics risking their minds for ideology.

**The Results**: Occasionally someone from Kung emerges from a solo journey with what might be their true name. Or might be something else they found in the deep jungle, wearing the shape of a name. The uncertainty is the point, they say. Truth shouldn't come with a guarantee.

Population: ~400.

#### Solis

A marked location on the remote northeast peninsula, deep in jungle that grows differently than the rest of the island. The pods here glow amber instead of purple-green. The trees twist into older, stranger shapes. The Velwey don't go to Solis. They don't forbid it, exactly. They just don't discuss it.

**What's There**: Ruins. Structures that predate the Velwey, built by something that understood true names before the dwarves arrived. The Velwey founding stories say they "discovered" the Pool and "were called" to Movasi. Solis suggests a different history—that something was here first.

**The Seekers**: Occasionally a pilgrim, unsatisfied with what the Pool revealed (or having received no answer at all), makes the trek to Solis. Most don't return. The few who do seem changed—not damaged, necessarily. Just different. They don't talk about what they found.

**The Rumor**: Something lives at Solis. Something with a true name that cannot be spoken by mortal mouths—a name that predates language itself. Whether this is metaphor or literal, no one outside the peninsula knows.

The Velwey do not discuss Solis with pilgrims. Questions about it are politely deflected. Insistence is met with silence.

Population: Unknown.

## Nekanzi Jungle

Tags: jungle, urok, neka, fire-leyline

The Nekanzi Jungle covers the northeastern peninsula of Urok—a dense, humid rainforest split down its center by the Firespine, a raw wound in the earth where the Yolus fire leyline breaches the surface. This is Neka territory, home to the dark-skinned, fire-attuned gnomes who have claimed these lands since before human ships first reached the Greenwater Isles.

The jungle itself is typical of Urok's tropical interior: canopy so thick that the forest floor lives in perpetual green twilight, air heavy enough to drink, and wildlife that treats anything smaller than itself as food. What makes Nekanzi distinct is the heat. Not the humid warmth common to all Urok jungles, but a dry, mineral heat that radiates from the ground itself near the Firespine. Plants here have adapted to periodic burning—fire-blooms that only seed after their parent plant ignites, ash-trees with bark like charcoal that regenerates from within, fungi that fruit in the wake of flames.

The Neka have adapted too. Five villages dot the jungle, loosely confederated by kinship and shared tradition. Two sit directly on the Firespine; three do not. This geographic divide shapes everything about Neka society.

### The Firespine

A jagged fissure tears through the Nekanzi Jungle from north to south, following the path of the Yolus fire leyline where it runs close to the surface. The Neka call it the Firespine because it resembles exactly that—the exposed vertebrae of something colossal and long-dead, glowing with residual heat.

The fissure varies in width from a few feet to gaps wide enough to swallow a house. Smoke seeps from the narrower sections. The wider gaps exhale gouts of flame at irregular intervals, and the rock along the edges glows dull red even in daylight. The temperature near the Firespine runs twenty degrees hotter than the surrounding jungle, and the air tastes of sulfur and hot stone.

Fire spirits emerge here. Not constantly, but frequently enough that the Neka have developed an entire tradition around managing them. Most are minor elementals—flickering humanoid shapes, serpents of living flame, floating motes of malicious heat. Occasionally something larger pulls itself from the fissure. The Neka don't discuss those incidents with outsiders.

The leyline's power makes fire magic significantly more potent within a mile of the Firespine. Neka fire-speakers can accomplish workings here that would exhaust them elsewhere. Foreign pyromancers who've visited (the few who were permitted) describe it as intoxicating—and dangerous. The power comes easily, but it doesn't want to stop.

#### The Buried Serpent

Neka oral tradition holds that the Firespine is literally what it appears to be: the spine of a titanic fire-serpent struck down in the first age of the world. They call it Yolu-Kazyn, the Burning One Who Fell. Whether this is mythology, corrupted history of an actual entity, or simply a convenient explanation for the leyline's existence, the Neka treat it as foundational truth.

According to the stories, Yolu-Kazyn was neither good nor evil—it simply was, as fire simply is. It burned across the world until something (the stories vary: a rival titan, a coalition of gods, its own hubris) brought it low. It fell into the sea and the land rose around it, but it never truly died. Its spine still glows. Its blood still burns. And its children—the fire spirits—still emerge from the wound, confused and hungry, looking for their parent.

The Neka see themselves as inheritors of this legacy. They didn't slay Yolu-Kazyn; they weren't even born yet. But they've made peace with its remains, learned to speak to its children, and earned the right to carry fire in their blood.

### Neka Society

The Neka are a confederacy, not a nation. No single chief or council rules all five villages. Instead, decisions affecting the whole jungle require consensus between representatives—traditionally, at least one from a leyline village and one from a shadow village.

This distinction matters. The two villages built on the Firespine (Hyhi and Sygozoki) are called "hot" villages—their residents live closer to the fire spirits, tend toward spiritual vocations, and claim deeper attunement to flame. The three villages away from the leyline (Tyunigogo, Kanamazi, and Yanayazi) are called "cool" villages—their residents are hunters, traders, and the practical backbone of Neka survival.

Neither type is superior. The Neka philosophy of balance—what they call *Zyka-Mend*, roughly "the feeding of two fires"—holds that hot and cool must coexist. A jungle of only flame would be ash. A jungle without flame would choke on its own growth. The tension between the village types is considered healthy, even necessary.

#### Leadership and Law

Each village governs itself through a council of elders, with one elder typically recognized as "first voice" for external matters. These positions aren't hereditary—they're earned through demonstrated wisdom, usually over decades. Young Neka who show promise are informally apprenticed to current elders, but there's no guarantee of succession.

Inter-village disputes go to *Moot*—a gathering of representatives at a neutral location (traditionally a clearing called the Ash Circle, roughly equidistant from all five villages). Moots are rare, called only for matters that affect multiple villages: territorial disputes, responses to outside threats, marriages that would shift village populations significantly.

Neka law is oral, memorized by specialists called *tongue-keepers* who can recite precedents going back generations. The law emphasizes restoration over punishment—a wrong must be made right, and the wrongdoer must do the making. Exile is the ultimate sanction, reserved for those who cannot or will not restore balance. Exiles are not killed; they're simply no longer Neka. The jungle usually handles the rest.

#### Fire-Speakers

The Neka's racial fire attunement manifests in everyone to some degree—resistance to heat, comfort near flame, an intuitive sense of fire's moods. But some develop the gift further. These are the fire-speakers: those who can communicate with fire spirits, negotiate safe passage through the Firespine's emanations, and channel the leyline's power for greater workings.

Fire-speakers aren't priests, though outsiders often mistake them for such. They don't worship fire spirits—they bargain with them. Every interaction is a negotiation. Spirits want fuel, attention, freedom to burn. Fire-speakers offer controlled outlets: ritual fires, burnt offerings, designated burn-zones in the jungle. In exchange, the spirits refrain from random destruction and sometimes provide services: lighting forges, clearing land, or defending against threats.

The relationship is tense. Fire spirits aren't malicious, but they aren't benevolent either. They're fire. They want to burn. A fire-speaker's job is to give them enough burning to keep them satisfied without losing the jungle entirely. When negotiations fail—and they do, every few generations—villages burn. The Neka accept this as the cost of living where they do.

#### Outsiders and Trade

The Neka are territorial but not isolationist. They trade with the outside world, but on their terms. Tyunigogo serves as the designated point of contact—foreigners are not permitted to travel freely through Neka lands, but they can wait at Tyunigogo's cooling zone for Neka traders to come to them.

What the Neka offer: rare jungle materials (fire-resistant woods, medicinal plants that grow only near the leyline, the shells of fire-adapted insects), Sygozoki's flame-touched metalwork, and guide services through the jungle for those with legitimate business on the other side.

What the Neka want: metal (they have little ore), salt, textiles, and news. Despite their isolation, the Neka are curious about the outside world. Traders who bring interesting stories often get better prices than those who bring only goods.

What the Neka won't trade: fire-speaker services, access to the Firespine, anything that would give outsiders power over the leyline. Attempts to acquire these have ended badly for the would-be acquirers.

### The Five Villages

#### Tyunigogo

*"Where the Fire Meets the Sea"*

The northeastern-most Neka settlement, Tyunigogo occupies a strip of coastline where the jungle thins enough to see the sky. It's the only village with direct access to the Shriyen Passage, the strait separating Urok from Rimihuica's Ishnit Jungles, and this geography has shaped its character entirely.

Tyunigogo is the gateway. All legitimate trade with the outside world passes through here. Foreign ships anchor in the small natural harbor, their crews confined to the "cooling zone"—a cleared area at the beach's edge where the jungle's heat gives way to sea breeze. Neka traders come down to meet them, transactions are conducted, and the foreigners leave. Those who try to proceed further without escort are turned back. Those who try repeatedly disappear.

The village itself sits a quarter-mile inland, invisible from the shore. Its structures are typical Neka construction: platforms built into the canopy, connected by rope bridges, with fire-pits at strategic locations that serve as both light sources and spiritual anchors. The coastal Neka of Tyunigogo are considered the most worldly of their people—they've learned fragments of foreign languages, understand outside currencies, and have developed a merchant's instinct for value.

But they haven't softened. Tyunigogo's elders remember why the cooling zone exists: a foreign expedition three centuries ago that tried to claim the harbor for a trading post. The expedition's fate became a teaching story. The Neka don't discuss details with outsiders, but the cooling zone's boundary stones are made from ship timbers.

**Hooks:**
- Foreign traders seeking rare goods must negotiate Tyunigogo's protocols
- Smugglers try to bypass the village through Swindle Sound—with mixed results
- Occasionally, something from across the Shriyen Passage washes up on shore

#### Hyhi

*Named for the hiss of steam*

Hyhi sits on the Firespine at the point where steam vents mix with a natural spring, creating a perpetual curtain of hot mist that shrouds the village. It's the spiritual heart of the Neka—home to the largest concentration of fire-speakers and the site of the most important negotiations with fire spirits.

The village is built around a gap in the Firespine where the fissure widens into something like a bowl. Steam rises from pools of water heated by the leyline below. Fire spirits emerge here more frequently than elsewhere, but they emerge... calmer. The Neka believe this is because Yolu-Kazyn's heart lies beneath Hyhi, and the spirits that emerge are closest to their parent's original nature before it was wounded.

Whether this is true or not, Hyhi's fire-speakers have the highest success rate in negotiations. Spirits bound here tend to honor their bargains longer. The village has become the default location for difficult bindings—when another village needs a particularly powerful or stubborn spirit contained, they bring it to Hyhi.

Life in Hyhi is strange by outside standards. The mist makes visibility perpetually poor. Residents navigate by sound and heat-sense as much as sight. Conversations happen in low voices because the steam carries sound unpredictably. Fire-speakers spend hours in meditation at the bowl's edge, communing with whatever responds. The village feels dreamlike, liminal, not entirely present in the material world.

Non-fire-speakers live here too—someone has to hunt, cook, maintain structures—but they tend to be quieter, more contemplative than Neka elsewhere. Long exposure to the mist changes people. Not physically, but in disposition. Hyhi natives move slowly, speak carefully, and seem to listen to things others can't hear.

**Hooks:**
- Fire-speakers from Hyhi are occasionally willing to negotiate with outsiders' fire-related problems—for appropriate compensation
- The bowl is rumored to grant visions to those who meditate there, but the visions aren't always survivable
- Something has been emerging from the steam lately that isn't quite a fire spirit

#### Kanamazi

*"Those Who Walk Without Light"*

Northwestern Kanamazi is the furthest village from the Firespine's influence, nestled in deep jungle where the canopy blocks even the leyline's glow. This is hunter territory—the Neka here are beast-masters, trackers, and the closest thing the confederacy has to a military force.

Kanamazi's hunters know the deep jungle better than anyone. They track prey through absolute darkness using sound, smell, and the animal-mimicry that all Neka possess but Kanamazi residents have elevated to art. A Kanamazi hunting party can coordinate across miles of jungle using calls indistinguishable from natural wildlife—and their prey never realizes they're being herded until it's too late.

The village takes its name from its residents' comfort with darkness. While other Neka maintain fire-pits throughout their settlements, Kanamazi keeps theirs minimal. Residents move through their village at night without light, navigating by memory and subtle cues. They claim this keeps them sharp, prevents dependence on the Firespine's gifts, and reminds them that survival doesn't require flame—only skill.

This philosophy creates occasional tension with the hot villages. Kanamazi elders have been known to suggest that Hyhi and Sygozoki have grown soft, too reliant on spirit-bargains to solve problems that could be handled with a spear. The hot villages counter that Kanamazi has forgotten what makes the Neka special, that they might as well be any other jungle tribe. The arguments are old, familiar, and generally resolved by the next Moot—but the underlying tension persists.

Kanamazi also handles the confederacy's security. When something dangerous enters Neka territory—foreign expeditions, escaped beasts from elsewhere on Urok, creatures displaced by the leyline's fluctuations—Kanamazi hunters deal with it. They're not warriors in the organized military sense, but they're extremely good at making problems disappear into the jungle.

**Hooks:**
- Kanamazi hunters occasionally hire out as guides, but only for purposes they approve of
- The deep jungle beyond Kanamazi holds things even the hunters avoid
- A recent hunt went wrong—the hunting party hasn't returned, and the elders are considering asking for outside help

#### Yanayazi

*"Water-That-Remembers-Fire"*

Southwestern Yanayazi sits where the Scheleur River runs closest to the Firespine before turning west toward the sea. The river runs warm here—not hot enough to harm, but noticeably above the temperature of normal water. The Neka of Yanayazi have built their lives around this peculiarity.

Yanayazi is the fishing village, though "fishing" understates what they do. The Scheleur's warmth supports species found nowhere else—heat-adapted fish, crustaceans that cluster around thermal vents, amphibians that bask in the warm shallows. Yanayazi fishers have developed specialized techniques for harvesting these creatures, some of which are valuable to outside alchemists and gourmands.

The village is also the confederacy's connection to the western interior. The Scheleur is navigable by small craft, and Yanayazi traders pole their way upriver to deal with other Urok peoples—carefully, given the jungle's dangers, but profitably enough to justify the risk. They're the most mercantile of the Neka, with a practical streak that sometimes frustrates the more traditional villages.

Yanayazi's relationship with the Firespine is complicated. They're close enough to feel its influence but not close enough to produce many fire-speakers. Instead, they've developed their own spiritual tradition around the warm river. They believe the Scheleur carries Yolu-Kazyn's blessing outward—that the heat in the water is the serpent's gift to lands too far from the spine to receive fire directly. River-prayers before fishing expeditions are common, and Yanayazi mourning rituals involve releasing the deceased's ashes into the current to be carried toward the sea.

**Hooks:**
- Yanayazi traders can arrange passage upriver for those with legitimate business—and sufficient payment
- The warm-water species occasionally include things that shouldn't exist
- Something upstream has been fouling the water, and the village wants to know what

#### Sygozoki

*"Burning Without End"*

Southern Sygozoki is the forge-village, built directly on the Firespine at a point where the fissure's heat is most consistent and controllable. This is where the Neka make things—tools, weapons, art—using techniques that blend conventional smithing with fire-spirit negotiation.

Sygozoki's forges don't use bellows. They don't need to. Fire-speakers maintain ongoing agreements with spirits bound to each forge, ensuring steady, controllable heat that mundane fuel couldn't match. The smiths—called *char-hands* for the permanent discoloration their work leaves—shape metal in temperatures that would kill an unprotected worker, relying on their racial fire resistance and additional spirit-bargains for protection.

The results are distinctive. Sygozoki metalwork has a rippled, flame-pattern finish that can't be replicated elsewhere, and the metal itself holds heat longer than it should. Weapons made here don't burn their wielders, but they burn everything else—a Sygozoki blade drawn across flesh leaves cauterized wounds. The most valued pieces have spirits bound into them permanently, granting minor magical properties that vary by the smith and the spirits involved.

This is also the most dangerous village for outsiders. The spirits here are more active, more present, more *hungry* than those at Hyhi. Sygozoki's fire-speakers maintain control through constant negotiation and regular offerings, but the balance is precarious. Visitors who don't understand the protocols—who carry too much flammable material, who speak disrespectfully of fire, who simply look like they might be good fuel—tend to attract attention. The villagers will try to intervene. They don't always succeed.

Sygozoki has burned twice in living memory. Both times, the village was rebuilt within a year, slightly differently, slightly more attuned to the spirits' preferences. The Neka here accept this as part of their arrangement. They get to work with fire in ways no one else can. Sometimes fire works with them back, in ways they didn't intend. The forge-gift and the forge-price are the same thing.

**Hooks:**
- Sygozoki weapons are valuable trade goods, but acquiring one requires negotiating with the char-hands directly
- A smith has bound something into a blade that they shouldn't have, and now the blade is missing
- The spirits have been restless lately—demanding more offerings, honoring bargains less reliably

### Scheleur River

The Scheleur rises somewhere in the jungle's interior—the Neka claim to know its source but don't share that information—and flows southwest before curving west to empty into the sea south of Urok's main landmass. For most of its length it's a typical jungle river: brown water, overhanging vegetation, things with teeth lurking beneath the surface.

But where it passes within a few miles of the Firespine, the Scheleur changes character. The water warms. The color shifts from brown to a faintly reddish tinge (mineral content from the heated groundwater, probably, though the Neka have other explanations). The species living in this stretch are found nowhere else—adapted to temperatures that would kill their relatives downstream.

Yanayazi claims stewardship of the warm stretch, but the river is technically accessible to all Neka. Fishing rights are governed by informal traditions rather than strict law, which occasionally causes friction when a Kanamazi hunting party takes fish that Yanayazi considers theirs. These disputes rarely escalate beyond angry words—the confederacy has larger concerns—but they're a persistent minor irritation.

The river is navigable by small craft from Yanayazi to the coast. Larger vessels can't handle the shifting channels and submerged debris. Foreign cartographers named it the Scheleur; the Neka simply call it *Yolu-Mazi*, "fire's vein."

### Swindle Sound

Southeast of the Nekanzi Jungle, where the coastline curves inward, lies the body of water that foreign sailors call Swindle Sound. The name comes from bitter experience: treacherous currents, hidden reefs, and sandbars that seem to shift between voyages have wrecked dozens of ships over the centuries. Captains who thought they'd found a shortcut around Tyunigogo's tolls discovered instead why the Neka don't bother patrolling these waters.

The Neka call it *Zend-Kulam*, roughly "the patient water"—patient because it waits for ships to make mistakes, then collects them. They don't fish here; the currents make small craft as vulnerable as large ones. Occasionally valuable salvage washes up on the jungle's southeastern beaches, but more often it's just wreckage and bodies.

Smugglers still try. Some even succeed—there are channels through the sound that skilled pilots can navigate, though the knowledge is closely held and expensive. The Neka are aware of this traffic and largely ignore it. Anything that makes it through Swindle Sound and into the jungle still has to deal with the jungle, and the Neka would rather let the sound do the filtering than waste hunters on patrol duty.

**Hooks:**
- A ship carrying something valuable went down in the sound—someone might pay well for its recovery
- A smuggler claims to know a safe route through and is selling passage
- Something in the sound has started actively hunting ships rather than just waiting for wrecks

## North Agreben

Tags: sea, geography

The northern portion of the Agreben Sea.

TODO

## Pelaria

Tags: region, kendrel, greenwater-isles

The volcanic kingdom. Pelaria occupies the southern reaches of the eastern Agreben Sea, where underwater volcanic vents have created an environment that would kill ordinary Kendrel—and forged a people adapted to thrive in it.

### Geography

Pelaria stretches across the volcanic ridge marking the southern edge of the Agreben's continental shelf. The seafloor fractures into a maze of thermal vents, lava tubes, and superheated caverns.

**The Thermal Waters**: Water temperatures range from warm to scalding depending on proximity to active vents. Mineral-rich plumes color the currents in reds and oranges. Only Pelarian Kendrel—with their fire attunement and thermal adaptation—can survive here comfortably.

**The Vent Fortresses**: Settlements are built into volcanic formations that serve as natural defensive positions. The superheated waters create barriers that enemies cannot easily cross.

**The Southern Edge**: Where Pelarian territory meets the open Agreben and the Bfaspeen-infested waters beyond. Heavily fortified, perpetually contested.

### Major Settlements

- **Saphinia** (capital): Built into an ancient volcanic cone, from warm shallows to near-boiling depths. Population ~12,000.
- **Brilina**: Northern border village, relatively cool, transition zone for visitors.
- **Osirey**: Western settlement, most productive mineral vents.
- **Purine**: Eastern village, deepest and hottest vents, Cendoriln-dominated.
- **Levirus**: Central town, Steam Shaper training center.
- **Naurey**: Southern outpost facing the open Agreben.
- **Coralona**: Southernmost settlement, early warning station.

### Character

Pelaria has diverged significantly from traditional Kendrel culture. The fire-attuned population practices metalwork, maintains a standing military (the Ember Guard), and conducts active operations against Bfaspeen broods. The northern kingdoms find this deeply unsettling. Pelarians find the northern kingdoms naive.

See [Pelaria (State)](../../nations_and_powers/states/Pelaria.md) for governance, culture, and political details.

TODO

## Roule

Tags: island, state, nation, geography

A broad peninsula and island chain in the southern Greenwater Isles, Roule is the heartland of halfling colonial power. Rolling golden plains give way to prosperous farmland, bustling port cities, and—at the center of it all—a dark forest the halflings have never managed to tame. The air smells of honey and salt. Red-roofed towns dot the countryside connected by well-maintained roads, and halfling merchants speak of Roule as civilization's triumph over wilderness. They don't speak of who lived here before.

The halflings arrived three centuries ago. Within two generations, a plague had swept through the indigenous human population, killing nine in ten. The survivors fled into the interior forest. The halflings called it providence and built their empire on the emptied land. Today, Roule is wealthy, orderly, and profoundly unwilling to discuss its founding.

### Arins Plains

The agricultural heart of Roule stretches across the northern and central regions—endless fields of grain, orchards, and most importantly, the flower farms that drive Roulean wealth. Taberthine blossoms (pale blue, faintly luminescent at dusk) produce honey that sharpens the mind, prized by scholars and merchants across Alaria. Zindwatt flowers (deep crimson, almost black at the center) yield a honey that induces gentle euphoria, technically regulated but freely available to those with coin.

The plains are beautiful in a manicured way. Windmills turn constantly—Roule is never without wind—and the halfling estates sprawl white and comfortable amid their holdings. The laborers in the fields are a mix of halfling smallholders, contracted workers, and slaves. Slavery in Roule is "modest," they'll tell you. A small household staff. Domestic service. The Honey Lords don't discuss the field crews.

The wind shapes everything here. Buildings are low and sturdy. Trees grow bent. Halflings greet each other with "fair winds," and the worst curse you can level is to wish someone "still air."

### Murderwood

At the center of Roule squats a forest the halflings pretend doesn't exist. On maps, it's simply unlabeled green. In conversation, they call it the Murderwood, the Dreadwood, or simply "the interior." Official Roulean policy holds that it's undeveloped wilderness with dangerous fauna. Everyone knows this is a lie.

The forest is dense, old-growth, and wrong. Trees grow too close together. The canopy blocks all but the dimmest light. Sounds carry strangely—or don't carry at all. Halfling logging expeditions entered the Murderwood for decades after colonization. They stopped when the expeditions stopped coming back.

The truth, known to historians and denied by the Honey Lords, is that survivors of the plague fled here. What they became in three centuries of isolation, hatred, and desperation is unclear. Some say they're simply humans who know the forest intimately and kill halflings on sight. Others whisper of pacts with old things in the deep woods, of people who aren't quite people anymore. The Roulean military has attempted "pacification campaigns" four times. The forest has never been pacified.

The halflings have learned to leave it alone. A rough border of abandoned farms and warning signs marks where civilization ends. Travelers are advised to take the long way around. Those who enter uninvited rarely return, and those who do won't speak of what they saw.

#### Kyullyuk

In the heart of the Murderwood, the survivors built a town. Kyullyuk appears on no Roulean map, but sailors sometimes trade with hooded figures at hidden coves, and those figures speak of a settlement deep in the forest where the old ways continue.

The people of Kyullyuk are the descendants of those who fled the plague. They call themselves the Velani—"the remaining"—and they have not forgotten what the halflings did. Three centuries have transformed them. They know the forest as intimately as their own bodies. They've made accommodations with whatever else lives in the Murderwood. And they wait.

Kyullyuk itself is said to be built in the trees and beneath them, a vertical town of rope bridges and root-cellars that can vanish at a moment's notice. The Velani trade with outsiders only rarely, and only for iron and salt. They kill halflings without exception. Whether they could ever emerge from the forest in force—whether they'd want to—is a question that haunts Roulean military planners who are too honest to accept the official story.

### Hakö Lake

A clear, cold lake in the northeastern interior, Hakö is Roule's largest freshwater body and the source of the Hanli River. Fishing villages dot its shores, and wealthy halflings maintain summer estates on the southern bank where the views are best. The lake is deep—deeper than anyone has successfully measured—and local folklore holds that something lives at the bottom.

The previous inhabitants considered Hakö sacred. Roulean developers have found carved stones on the lakebed during construction projects, which are quietly disposed of. A ruined temple complex on the eastern shore has been converted into a fashionable resort, its original purpose carefully unmentioned.

### Ezcelmez Lake

Smaller and shallower than Hakö, Ezcelmez Lake sits near Ovabasi in the agricultural heartland. Its waters are warm and silty, fed by dozens of small streams running off the surrounding flower fields. The honey produced from Ezcelmez-area flowers is considered the finest in Roule—something in the water, they say.

The lake is heavily worked. Barges carry flower harvests to processing facilities on the shore. Fish farms crowd the shallows. Nothing sacred remains here; Ezcelmez is purely commercial, and the halflings prefer it that way.

### Hanli River

The Hanli flows from Hakö Lake southwest through the Arins Plains before emptying into the Inside Passage near Karamehmetler. It's the main commercial artery of interior Roule—flat-bottomed barges carry grain, honey, and goods between the lake towns and the coast.

The river is slow, wide, and reliable. Floods are rare. Halfling engineers have straightened its course in several places, and locks allow navigation around the few elevation changes. Towns along the Hanli are prosperous and dull, the kind of places where nothing interesting ever happens and the residents prefer it that way.

### Bay of Roule

The great southern bay that gives Roule its naval power and commercial reach. Sheltered from the worst storms by the eastern peninsula, the Bay of Roule offers deep anchorage and calm waters. Teldib dominates the bay's northern shore, but fishing villages and minor ports scatter along the coastline.

The bay is heavily patrolled. Roulean naval vessels run regular circuits, and privateering is punished by imprisonment or worse. The message is clear: these waters belong to Roule, and Roule protects its interests.

#### Sunbeam Prison

Visible from anywhere on the bay—a shimmering pillar of light rising from the waves. The Sunbeam Prison floats where light and force leylines intersect in the Roule Channel, a marvel of magical engineering and a warning to anyone who might challenge Roulean authority.

The prison is not made of stone or iron, but of beams of solidified light bound together by force magic. These sunbeams create a perfect cage—impenetrable, unbreakable, and impossible to approach without authorization. The prison requires constant magical maintenance to sustain the leyline convergence, employing a permanent staff of mages who rotate monthly to avoid burnout.

Inmates include pirates, political prisoners, and those the Honey Lords want forgotten. Sentences are measured in decades. Escape is theoretically impossible—the light-walls burn flesh, and the waters below are patrolled by bound water elementals. The prison is Roule's most visible display of power and its most closely guarded secret. What happens inside is not discussed.

### Roule Channel

The waterway south of Roule proper, connecting the Bay of Roule to open ocean. The Channel is where light and force leylines intersect beneath the waves—the phenomenon that enables Sunbeam Prison and creates unusual magical conditions for any vessel passing through.

Ships report compasses spinning, minor enchantments flickering, and an oppressive sense of being watched. The Roulean navy has learned to navigate these effects, but foreign vessels sometimes struggle. Whether this is natural leyline interference or deliberate magical manipulation is unclear.

### Inside Passage

The sheltered waterway between Roule and the western islands, including Nylos. The Inside Passage offers calm sailing and protection from open-ocean storms, making it the preferred route for coastal traders and fishing fleets.

Roule controls the Passage absolutely. Naval checkpoints at both ends inspect vessels, collect tariffs, and turn away anyone deemed undesirable. Nylos fishing boats must obtain Roulean permits. Smugglers use hidden coves and night sailing, but the penalties for getting caught are severe.

### Fairn Passage

The northern sea lane connecting Roule to the broader Greenwater Isles and beyond. Fairn Passage sees heavier traffic than the Inside Passage—merchant vessels bound for Xoth, Urok, and distant ports.

The passage is named for Admiral Fairn, who established Roulean naval supremacy here two centuries ago by sinking a Xothian fleet. Relations with Xoth have never recovered. Today, Roulean and Xothian vessels maintain careful distance when passing, and naval "incidents" occur with enough regularity to keep both sides on edge.

### Fozyader

The capital of Roule sprawls along the northeastern coast where the Arins Plains meet the sea. White stone buildings with red tile roofs climb gentle hills, and the harbor is a forest of masts. This is where the Honey Lords meet, where colonial policy is made, and where Roule's wealth accumulates in counting houses and vaults.

The city is beautiful in the way wealthy places often are—clean streets, manicured parks, impressive public buildings. The Parliament of Flowers convenes in a domed hall at the city's heart, though real power rests with the merchant councils that meet in private clubs nearby. Halfling society here is elaborate and status-obsessed, with subtle gradations of rank indicated by hat styles, flower pins, and seating positions at public events.

Fozyader's darker business happens in the Harbor District and the warren of streets behind the main markets. Slave auctions occur in private courtyards. Captains can be hired for any cargo, no questions asked. The city watch is efficient but selective about what it sees.

Foreign visitors find Fozyader welcoming on the surface—good food, comfortable inns, polite conversation. But there's a coldness beneath the hospitality, a sense that outsiders are being assessed for usefulness. The halflings smile, and the smiles don't reach their eyes.

### Kabilcuz

The oldest port in Roule, Kabilcuz on the northwestern coast is where halfling colonists first made landfall three centuries ago. The original harbor has been rebuilt several times, but locals insist on showing visitors the "First Stone"—a weathered boulder supposedly touched by the first halfling to step ashore.

The city trades heavily on its history. Museums display colonial artifacts. Tour guides explain (with careful omissions) how the brave settlers tamed a wilderness. There's a performative quality to Kabilcuz's identity, as if the city is constantly trying to justify what happened here.

Beneath the historical theater, Kabilcuz is a working port. Shipyards line the harbor's edge. Fishing fleets depart before dawn. The city's craftspeople are known for fine woodworking, particularly furniture and musical instruments made from Murderwood timber—harvested, they insist, only from the forest's edge.

### Samandoken

The western port of Samandoken faces the Inside Passage and serves as Roule's administrative center for Nylos. Government officials, tax collectors, and military officers rotate through here before deployment to the subjugated islands. The city has a transient quality—people are always coming or going, and long-term residents are outnumbered by those passing through.

Samandoken is where Nylos resistance fighters are tried and sentenced. The courthouse is the city's largest building, deliberately imposing. Executions happen in the public square. The message to any Nylosi who might be watching is clear.

Despite its grim official function, Samandoken has a lively merchant quarter. Goods from Nylos—fish, pearls, worked coral—flow through here on their way to Roulean markets. The prices are set in Samandoken, and Nylosi sellers have no leverage to negotiate.

### Teldib

The great port on the Bay of Roule, Teldib is the commercial and naval heart of southern Roule. The harbor can accommodate hundreds of vessels; the naval yards employ thousands. This is where Roule's military power is built, maintained, and deployed.

The city divides into three distinct zones: the Naval Quarter (restricted, bristling with uniforms and checkpoints), the Merchant District (chaotic, profitable, smelling of fish and spices), and the Estates (quiet, wealthy, overlooking the bay). The Sunbeam Prison is visible from anywhere in Teldib, a constant reminder of what happens to those who cross Roulean authority.

Teldib's admiral is technically subordinate to the Parliament of Flowers, but in practice the naval command operates with considerable autonomy. The current admiral, a halfling woman named Tessara Brightwater, is said to have ambitions beyond the military.

### Recnaf

On the southern shore of the eastern peninsula, Recnaf is Roule's quietest city—a sheltered harbor town more focused on fishing than politics. The city lacks Fozyader's grandeur, Teldib's military importance, or Kabilcuz's historical pretensions. Locals consider this a virtue.

Recnaf's fishing fleet is the largest in Roule, and the city's markets supply much of the nation's seafood. The work is hard, the people are practical, and outsiders who put on airs are quietly mocked. There's a stubbornness here that the other cities lack—Recnaf was settled by colonists who wanted distance from halfling high society, and that independence persists.

The city maintains informal trade relationships with communities the Honey Lords would prefer not to acknowledge. Fishing boats sometimes return with cargo that didn't come from the sea. The city watch asks few questions. Recnaf takes care of its own.

### Tezina

The city closest to Murderwood, Tezina exists in the forest's shadow—sometimes literally, when the afternoon sun falls behind the treeline. The city is smaller than its coastal counterparts and markedly less prosperous. Young halflings from Tezina tend to leave for opportunities elsewhere. Those who remain have their reasons.

Tezina serves as the staging ground for any official business involving the forest—which is to say, almost none. The last "survey expedition" departed fifteen years ago and never returned. The city maintains a token garrison, but the soldiers spend their time drinking and avoiding the forest's edge.

What Tezina does have is information. Travelers, hunters, and those who've glimpsed the forest's secrets pass through here. The city's taverns are full of stories—most of them lies, but occasionally something true slips through. Anyone seriously interested in Murderwood starts their research in Tezina.

### Ovabasi

Near Ezcelmez Lake in the agricultural heartland, Ovabasi is the center of Roule's honey industry. The processing facilities here handle the majority of Taberthine and Zindwatt production, and the city smells permanently of sweetness and flowers.

The Honey Lords maintain their most impressive estates around Ovabasi, competing to display wealth through architecture, gardens, and elaborate social functions. This is where Roulean high society performs itself most intensely—balls, salons, and garden parties where the real business of the nation is conducted over honeyed wine.

The workers who actually produce the honey live in dormitories outside the city proper. Their conditions vary by employer, but none would be called comfortable. Ovabasi's beauty is built on labor that prefers to remain invisible.

### Kilik

The most forward outpost of Roule as it ventures into Rakite. Kilik is a new town, barely two decades old, carved out of grassland that the colonists insist was empty.

The town provost has heard troubling reports from farmers—discoveries of charcoal in the soil, stone foundations beneath the grass, the remains of old campfires. The official position is that these are natural formations or ancient ruins. But the farmers aren't stupid, and some have started asking uncomfortable questions about who lived here before.

Kilik represents everything complicated about Roulean expansion. The colonists are ordinary halflings seeking opportunity, not monsters. They genuinely believe they're building something good. And they're building it on land that belongs to someone else, refusing to see what's directly in front of them.

### Kameesi Jungle

The Kameesi Jungle dominates the northwestern peninsula of Urok—a dense, ancient rainforest where the canopy closes so thick that twilight persists even at midday. The air hangs heavy with moisture and the copper-sweet smell of rotting vegetation. This is Zelle territory, and outsiders who enter uninvited rarely leave.

The jungle teems with venomous life: serpents that drop from branches, frogs whose skin kills on contact, insects that burrow beneath flesh to lay eggs. But the true danger is the Zelle themselves—crimson-winged pixies who view every stranger as either threat or sacrifice.

#### Sovia River

The Sovia winds through the heart of Zelidian territory, flowing northeast from the jungle interior toward the coast. All five Zelidian settlements cluster along its banks, connected by the river's dark waters. The Zelle travel it by leaf-boat and wing, and its currents carry offerings downstream to wherever the jungle-spirits wish to receive them.

Outsiders sometimes attempt to navigate the Sovia to reach Zelidian markets. Most are intercepted within hours. The fortunate are merely turned away. The rest feed the river's hungry gods.

#### Iirmos

Once the capital of Zelidia, Iirmos now stands empty—a wound in the jungle where the canopy refuses to close. The city's bone-white spires still rise above the treeline, visible for miles, but no Zelle has set foot there in centuries.

The High Priestesses do not speak of what happened. The jungle remembers.

What is known: the priestesses of Iirmos attempted a great blood-working, a ritual to permanently ward Zelidia from all outsiders. They sacrificed not individuals but entire villages of captives, channeling more blood than had ever been offered. Something answered—but it was not the jungle-spirits they knew.

The ritual tore open a passage to somewhere else. What came through consumed Iirmos in a single night. The survivors fled to what is now Glezamos, and the High Priestesses sealed the city behind wards of a different kind: wards meant not to keep things out, but to keep something in.

The jungle has grown strange around Iirmos. Trees bend away from the ruins. Animals fall silent within a mile of its walls. Those who approach report hearing voices—not screaming, but welcoming. Inviting them inside. Promising they'll never need to leave.

#### Zelidia

The state of Zelidia encompasses all Zelle settlements along the Sovia River. See the full state entry for details on its theocratic government and blood-sacrifice religion.

##### Glezamos

The current capital of Zelidia sprawls across both banks of the Sovia, connected by bridges woven from living vines. Glezamos was built hastily after the fall of Iirmos, and its architecture still carries that desperate, improvised quality—structures that grew organically around the needs of refugees rather than following any grand design.

The Temple of the Hungry Canopy dominates the city's center, where the High Priestesses conduct their sacrifices and commune with the jungle-spirits. Foreign delegations (the rare few permitted to live) are received in the Bleeding Court, an open plaza where the stones are permanently stained rust-red.

##### Nox

The easternmost Zelidian village, closest to the coast and to outsiders. Nox serves as the reluctant interface between Zelidia and the outside world—a shadow-market where non-pixies can trade under heavy restriction. Transactions occur at night (hence the name), conducted through intermediaries, with the actual Zelle traders remaining unseen in the darkness above. Weapons are forbidden. Lights are forbidden. Those who break the rules simply vanish.

##### Katat

An agricultural village upriver from Glezamos, where the Zelle cultivate the jungle's bounty: fruits that induce prophetic dreams, fungi that enhance blood-magic, flowers whose nectar is essential for pixie reproduction. Katat's fields are tended by thralls—outsiders who wandered too close and now serve without will or memory.

##### Sookap

A fishing village where the Sovia widens into lazy pools. Sookap's fishers harvest river-creatures for food and ritual use, including the sacred blood-eels whose consumption is required for High Priestess initiation. The village also maintains the ritual boats used to send offerings downstream.

##### Yift

The village closest to Glezamos, practically a suburb of the capital. Yift's artisans produce the material culture of Zelidian religion: ritual blades, wing-paints in sacred patterns, sacrificial implements, and the bone-chimes that hang throughout every Zelle settlement. Yift's workshops never fall silent.

### Phalkrene Mountains

The Phalkrene range runs north-south through the center of Urok's northwestern peninsula, separating Thrallwood to the west from Chitinwood to the east. The mountains are old and worn, their peaks rounded by millennia of tropical rain, but they remain formidable—dense with fog, treacherous with sudden drops, and home to things that prefer not to be found.

The range's most striking feature is visible from miles away: a colossal skull embedded in the mountainside, its eye sockets glowing faintly at night. This is Pyonokraus.

#### Pyonokraus

A city-state built into the skull of a dead titan. See the full state entry for details on its curse and inhabitants.

#### Vainye River

The Vainye descends from the Phalkrene heights, fed by mountain springs and perpetual mist-rain. Its waters run cold even in the tropical heat—cold enough that locals say the river remembers winter from somewhere else.

The Vainye flows past Pyonokraus before disappearing into the mountains' western slopes, eventually emerging to feed Thrallwood's swamps. Those who drink from it near the city report strange dreams: visions of a world with four suns, of beings with too many arms, of purposes that span centuries. Whether this is the titan's memory bleeding into the water or the Ayblek's alien influence remains unclear.

### Thrallwood

The western slopes of the Phalkrene Mountains drain into Thrallwood—a swamp-forest that stretches to Shamerei Bay. The trees here grow from standing water, their roots tangled into vast platforms of rotting vegetation. Mist rises perpetually from the warm, stagnant pools.

Something old claims Thrallwood. Not a god, not a spirit—something from the same age as the titan whose skull became Pyonokraus. Perhaps it served that titan once. Perhaps it was the titan's enemy. Whatever it was, it bound this place to its will, and that binding has outlasted the binder.

Every creature in Thrallwood serves. The beasts move in patterns too regular to be natural, patrolling routes they've walked for centuries. Birds call at precise intervals. Insects swarm in geometric formations. Even the plants seem to reach toward intruders with coordinated purpose.

The compulsion is contagious. Those who linger in Thrallwood begin to feel the pull—an urge to walk a certain path, to guard a certain tree, to wait for instructions that never come. The longer one stays, the harder it becomes to leave. After a few days, the victim stops wanting to. After a week, they forget they ever wanted anything else.

Thralls wander the forest still: humans, gnomes, beasts, all moving in silent service to a master that may be dead, sleeping, or simply elsewhere. They do not speak. They do not acknowledge outsiders. But they will stop anyone from reaching whatever lies at Thrallwood's heart.

### Chitinwood

East of the Phalkrene Mountains, the forest floor crunches underfoot. Chitinwood takes its name from what covers everything: the shed exoskeletons, the gnawed remains, the living shells of countless giant beetles.

This is not a civilization. There is no hive-mind, no beetle-society, no alien intelligence to negotiate with. Chitinwood is simply an ecosystem—one where beetles the size of horses are the dominant life form. Rhinoceros beetles that can gore through trees. Stag beetles whose mandibles shear through bone. Bombardier beetles that spray caustic chemicals. And countless smaller varieties that swarm, burrow, devour.

The beetles aren't aggressive by nature; they're simply beetles, doing what beetles do. But everything in Chitinwood has adapted to them. Predators have evolved chitin-cracking jaws. Prey have developed shells of their own. The trees grow thick, corky bark. Even the birds have beak-plates that can pry larvae from wood.

Travelers can pass through Chitinwood, but they must move carefully. Disturbing a beetle's territory, stumbling into a mating display, or simply smelling like food can trigger swarming behavior. The forest floor is littered with the picked-clean skeletons of those who made mistakes.

Chitin itself is valuable—beetle-plate armor, tool components, alchemical ingredients. Hunters from Pyonokraus occasionally venture into the edges of the forest to harvest, but they never go deep. Something larger lives in Chitinwood's interior. No one has seen it clearly. They've only found the shells it leaves behind—each one the size of a building.

### Shamerei Bay

The western coast of the peninsula curves inward to form Shamerei Bay, where Thrallwood meets the sea. The bay takes its name from Shamerei the Defiant—a merchant captain who, according to legend, refused to pay tribute to Zelidia and attempted to establish a trading post on these shores.

The Zelle made an example of her. They did not kill her quickly. They did not kill her crew at all—instead, they released them to spread word of what happens to those who defy the pixie kingdom. The captain's bones were woven into a warning-marker that still stands at the bay's entrance, preserved by blood-magic against rot and time.

No ships anchor in Shamerei Bay now. The waters are safe enough—calm, deep, well-sheltered from storms. But the warning remains, and sailors give the bay a wide berth. Only smugglers and the truly desperate make landfall here, hoping to slip into Thrallwood and reach... something. Whatever they're looking for, they rarely find it.

### Anemone Sound

South of Chitinwood, the coast opens into Anemone Sound—named for the vast colonies of sea anemones that carpet its shallow floor. These are not ordinary anemones. The largest specimens stretch twenty feet across, their stinging tentacles capable of paralyzing a whale.

The anemones have made the sound nearly impassable. Ships that enter find their hulls gripped by tentacles, their crews snatched from the decks. The water itself seems to reach upward. Only shallow-draft vessels piloted by those who know the safe channels can navigate through, and that knowledge is jealously guarded.

Something feeds the anemones—something that wants the sound protected. The waters beyond the colonies are strangely clear, almost crystalline, and divers who've made it through report structures on the seafloor: walls, columns, what might be roads. No one has explored them. No one has returned from trying.

### Deadwater Bay

At the peninsula's southern tip, Deadwater Bay earns its name. Nothing lives here. The water is clear—too clear, sterile as glass. No fish swim in it. No seaweed clings to its rocks. No barnacles grow on the few wrecks that have drifted in. Even bacteria seem absent; corpses that wash into the bay do not rot. They simply... remain.

The effect extends several hundred yards from shore. Sailors who must pass through report an oppressive silence, a sense of being watched, and a wrongness they can't articulate. Some claim the water itself feels different—heavier, more reluctant to move.

No one knows what killed Deadwater Bay, or what keeps it dead. The Zelle avoid it. Pyonokraus ignores it. Even Thrallwood's compulsion seems to have no interest in this stretch of coast. Whatever happened here was thorough, and whatever lingers here is patient.

### Hurtzsh River

The Hurtzsh flows southeast through Chitinwood, eventually emptying into Anemone Sound. Its waters run murky with beetle-waste and decaying chitin, giving it a brackish, faintly metallic taste. The river serves as a natural highway through the beetle-forest—most creatures avoid the water, making it safer than the forest floor.

Rafts can navigate the Hurtzsh, though the journey is unpleasant. The smell is memorable. The sound of beetles clattering on the banks is constant. And occasionally, something large surfaces to investigate the disturbance before submerging again.

### Andestro River

The Andestro winds through the southern reaches of the peninsula, fed by streams from the Phalkrene Mountains' lower slopes. Warmer and slower than the Vainye, it meanders through marshland before reaching the coast near Deadwater Bay.

The river is navigable but eerie. As it approaches Deadwater Bay, the wildlife along its banks grows sparse, then absent. Fish become scarce. Birds stop calling. The last few miles flow in absolute silence, the Andestro's waters growing clearer and more lifeless as they near their destination. Locals call this stretch the "Dying Mile," and avoid it.

### Tethryn Mountains

The Tethryn range rises in northwestern SW Urok, younger and sharper than the worn Pearly Mountains to the south. These peaks still show volcanic origins—black basalt cliffs, hot springs steaming in high valleys, and soil rich enough to support terraced farms where little else would grow. The range runs roughly east-west, creating a natural barrier between the coastal lowlands around Phiona Bay and the interior plateau where the Thyogres River begins its long journey south.

The Tethryns are most famous for what sits atop them: Xi Chin, the Timekeeper city, whose white marble towers are visible from ships in the Gulf of Xoth on clear days. The mountains' height and the clarity of their air make them ideal for astronomical observation—a fact the city's founders recognized millennia ago.

Several rivers originate in the Tethryn heights. The Pteyalune flows north toward Deadwater Bay, its waters growing colder and more lifeless as they approach that cursed shore. The Freolian drains the eastern slopes, flowing southeast toward the Pearly Mountains—it's the main water-road connecting Xi Chin's region to the interior. The Expation River tumbles down the western face toward Phiona Bay, named (locals claim) by exiles from some forgotten conflict who settled its fertile banks.

#### Xi Chin

The Timekeeper city rises from a high plateau in the central Tethryns, its marble architecture stark white against the dark volcanic stone. See the full state entry for details on its astronomical traditions, the Great Clocktower, and the Chroniclers' Compact that guarantees its neutrality.

From a distance, Xi Chin appears to glow at dawn and dusk—the marble catching the light when the surrounding peaks have fallen into shadow. Pilgrims, students, and diplomats make the climb along the Wister Road, a switchback path carved into the mountainside over centuries. The journey takes three days from the coast, or two if you're young and foolish enough to push through the night.

#### Wister Valley

East of Xi Chin, the mountains open into Wister Valley—a high bowl of terraced farms and scattered villages that feeds the Timekeeper city. The valley's volcanic soil grows grain, vegetables, and the famous Wister apples, small and tart, that ferment into a cider prized across the Greenwater Isles.

But Wister Valley serves more than agriculture. Its orientation creates a natural corridor for observing specific star-rises, and ancient standing stones—predating Xi Chin itself—mark astronomical positions that the Chroniclers still use for their most precise calculations. Some scholars believe Xi Chin was built where it was specifically because of Wister Valley's sight-lines.

The valley folk are a mix of humans and dwarves whose families have worked this land for generations. They're proud, practical, and suspicious of the marble-city intellectuals who depend on their harvests but rarely deign to visit. "Xi Chin counts the stars," goes a local saying, "but Wister counts the sacks of grain."

### Pearly Mountains

The Pearly Mountains arc across SW Urok's midsection, older and more weathered than the Tethryns to the north. Millennia of tropical rain have rounded their peaks into soft shapes that gleam pale gray in certain light—hence the name. The range separates the northern forests and river valleys from the southern territories where Xoth holds sway.

These mountains are riddled with caves. Some are natural limestone formations carved by underground rivers. Others show signs of ancient habitation—smooth walls, carved steps, chambers that once held purpose. The deepest caves connect to tunnel systems that run beneath the entire range, linking to whatever lurks below Maun and Wisgarrd.

The Pearly Mountains' western extent reaches almost to the coast, sheltering Phiona Bay from southern storms. Their eastern slopes descend into the Pyrgion Forest and Xoth territory. In between, the Thyogres River has carved a pass that serves as the main route between the northern and southern halves of SW Urok.

The Myestrones—"hundred streams" in an old trade tongue—drain the northern faces, eventually feeding the Freolian River. The Vyandrik and Prelapon rivers flow west toward Phiona Bay, their valleys dotted with villages that have maintained independence by being too poor and too remote for anyone to bother conquering.

#### Shenchen Forest

At the southwestern extent of the Pearly Mountains, where the slopes descend toward Tyberoskos, lies Shenchen Forest—a place travelers learn to avoid.

The forest grows dense and dark here, ancient trees closing overhead like a canopy of grasping fingers. Among them stand the ruins of what was once a monastery-fortress: pagoda towers strangled by vines, meditation gardens gone to wilderness, training yards where the stones still show sword-cuts centuries old. This was the home of the Order of the Falling Leaf.

The Order were Uline Dwarven warrior-monks who rejected the daemon-pacts that were spreading across southeastern Urok—the covenant that would eventually unite diverse peoples into the theocratic state of Xoth. While others embraced the Seven Patrons' power, the Order sought enlightenment through martial perfection—not divine blessing, but the precise, almost artistic discipline of the sword-saint. For generations they trained in isolation, developing techniques that blended combat and meditation into something approaching transcendence.

When the growing covenant demanded the Order's submission, the masters refused. They knew they could not win a war, and they would not flee. Instead, they performed a final ritual. The students were sent away—some say to found what would become Maun's martial tradition, carrying the Order's philosophy to a new home. The masters remained, binding their souls to their armor in a rite that cost them their lives but granted them eternity.

Now they stand eternal vigil. The armor moves without flesh inside it, animated by spirits that remember only duty. They patrol paths that have been overgrown for centuries. They guard shrines whose gods may no longer exist. They attack intruders without warning, without mercy, and without any degradation of the skills they mastered in life. A Falling Leaf guardian is worth a dozen ordinary soldiers—and there are hundreds in Shenchen Forest.

What do they guard? The Order's sacred texts remain in the monastery's deepest vaults—philosophical treatises on death, discipline, and transcendence that Xoth has long sought to destroy. Some scholars believe the texts contain techniques for resisting daemonic influence, which would explain Xoth's interest. Others think the monastery hides something older, something the Order was built to protect. The guardians ensure no one gets close enough to find out.

### Xoth

The theocratic nation of Xoth dominates southeastern Urok—a multi-racial covenant-state bound by shared worship of the Seven Patrons rather than blood or ancestry. See the full state entry for details on its religion, government, and the daemon-aided military that makes its neighbors nervous.

Xoth's territory spans diverse terrain: sacred forests, fertile plains, harsh desert, and a long coastline. The landscape shapes the faith as much as the faith shapes the landscape; every region has its patron, every feature its religious significance.

#### Umlas

The holy capital rises from the central plains where the original covenant was struck. Seven great temples—one for each patron—ring a central plaza dominated by the Hall of Convergence where the Hierophancy meets. The Temple of Theros faces east, catching the dawn; the Temple of Petranos is half-buried, its lower levels extending deep into the earth; the Temple of Lykanos stands at the crossroads where the major pilgrimage routes meet.

Umlas isn't the largest city on Urok, but it may be the most orderly. Streets follow a geometric pattern radiating from the central plaza. Buildings are constructed to last centuries. The constant sound of bells marks the hours and calls the faithful to prayer. Visitors describe the city as beautiful but unsettling—too quiet, too clean, too *watched*.

The population hovers around forty thousand, swelling during major festivals when pilgrims arrive from across Xoth. Most residents work in temple administration, craft production, or services for the endless stream of visitors. The truly devout seek positions in Umlas; living in the holy city is itself a form of worship.

#### Kumi Wood

North of Umlas, Kumi Wood stretches from the foothills of the Pearly Mountains to the coast near the Bay of Lords. This ancient hardwood forest is sacred to both Petranos and Kethros—the earth that grows the trees and the craft that shapes them.

Every tree felled in Kumi Wood requires ritual permission. Foresters must petition the local temple, specifying which tree, for what purpose, and offering appropriate thanks to Petranos for the gift. This sounds like bureaucratic obstruction, but it actually ensures sustainable harvesting. Kumi Wood has been producing exceptional timber for centuries and shows no sign of depletion.

The wood itself is prized across Alaria. Kumi hardwood takes stain beautifully, resists rot, and—when worked by Xothic craftsmen invoking Kethros—holds minor enchantments well. Instruments made from Kumi wood are particularly valued; some say they never go out of tune.

Settlements in Kumi Wood tend to be small and focused on forestry or woodcraft. Ku'or, the largest, serves as the administrative center for lumber operations and hosts a major temple to Kethros.

#### Dunes of Tithonius

Northeast of Kumi Wood, where the forest gives way to scrubland and then to sand, lie the Dunes of Tithonius—a desert that shouldn't exist.

The rest of Urok is tropical or temperate. The Dunes are arid, harsh, and strange. Scholars have proposed various explanations: ancient magical catastrophe, a curse from a forgotten god, residual effects from whatever created Deadwater Bay to the north. None are confirmed. The Xothic explanation is simpler: Theros claimed this land, burning away everything soft, leaving only truth.

The dunes are named for Tithonius, a figure from the time before the covenant. The stories disagree on who he was—a prophet, a king, a demon, a god. What's consistent is that he's *gone*, his works buried beneath the sand, his name surviving only as a geographic label.

Ruins beneath the dunes predate the covenant by unknown centuries. The Hierophancy has excavated some, found others by accident, and suspects more remain hidden. What they've uncovered includes architectural styles no Xothic scholar recognizes, inscriptions in no known language, and artifacts that sometimes... do things. The temples keep these finds secure and don't discuss them publicly.

The living population is sparse. Ascetics seek visions in the deep desert, claiming Theros speaks more clearly where distractions are few. Military units train here, learning to fight in brutal conditions. Herders graze animals at the dunes' edges. The few permanent settlements—Iphikrates, Gryllus—serve as supply points and temples for those passing through.

#### Pyrgion Forest

Western Xoth, between the Siddaneas River and the heartland, is dominated by Pyrgion Forest—dense woodland that serves as the buffer between the covenant and non-Xothic territories.

Pyrgion is frontier country. The settlements here—Aegicoros, Deru'or, Fonirisxes, Hippasus—are devout but practical, accustomed to dealing with outsiders who haven't taken the covenant. Trade flows through; so do travelers, refugees, and occasionally missionaries heading in both directions.

The Meilaenias River provides the main route through Pyrgion, navigable for most of its length. River towns handle much of the traffic between Xoth and the western city-states. The temples in these towns are well-funded—Lykanos blesses trade, and the traders repay him generously.

The forest itself is less sacred than Kumi Wood—no special rituals for timber harvest, no particular patron claiming it. But it's still Xothic territory, and the settlements maintain temples to all Seven. Travelers passing through will find the faith omnipresent even in the frontier.

#### The Central Plains

Between Kumi Wood, the Dunes, Pyrgion, and the coast lies the heartland: rolling plains of farmland and pasture dotted with temple-towns and connected by pilgrimage roads.

This is where most Xothic live. The soil is fertile, the climate mild, the Petranos-blessed irrigation systems well-maintained. Farming families work the land as their ancestors did, punctuating labor with prayer and marking the seasons with festivals. It's ordinary life, made extraordinary by constant divine presence.

The plains settlements—Speusippos, Hippotas, Qo'koven, Sicule'os, and dozens of smaller towns—are administrative and religious centers for the surrounding farms. Each hosts temples to all Seven, though different towns emphasize different patrons based on local needs. Speusippos is known for its Kethros temple and craft guilds; Hippotas maintains the largest Makhros shrine outside Umlas and trains many Theophoroi.

Roads connect everything. The Xothic don't just maintain roads for trade—pilgrimage is a religious duty, and every citizen is expected to visit Umlas at least once. The routes are sacred paths, marked with shrines to Lykanos at crossroads and rest stations where travelers can pray and resupply.

#### Stepsidae Peninsula

Southeastern Xoth extends into the Stepsidae Peninsula—drier, rockier, more isolated than the heartland. The settlements here (Eos, Phryne, Perdik'kias, and smaller villages) are self-reliant communities of herders and fishers.

Some say Stepsidae is where the most fervent Xothic live. Away from Umlas's sophistication and the plains' comfort, faith becomes harder, purer. The peninsula's temples are austere; its priests are strict; its people are suspicious of soft mainlanders who've never struggled for their devotion.

This reputation isn't entirely fair—Stepsidae has its moderates too—but it's not entirely wrong either. The peninsula produces more than its share of zealots, Theophoroi, and priests who rise high in the Hierophancy. When Xoth needs something done without hesitation or mercy, Stepsidae volunteers.

The Gulf of Xoth defines the peninsula's western coast; the Bay of Lords curves around its northern edge. Fishing villages work both waters, and a small shipbuilding industry in Eos produces vessels that carry Xothic goods across the Greenwater Isles.

#### Rivers of Xoth

**Meilaenias River**: The main artery through Pyrgion Forest, flowing from the Pearly Mountains' eastern slopes toward the coast. Navigable for most of its length, it carries trade between Xoth and the western territories. Temple-towns cluster along its banks.

**Tipholes River**: Flows through northern Xoth, skirting the edge of Kumi Wood before reaching the coast near the Bay of Lords. Smaller than the Meilaenias but important for lumber transport—logs float downstream from Kumi harvesting sites to coastal mills.

**Siddaneas River** (upper reaches): The Siddaneas marks Xoth's western boundary, but its upper reaches flow through Xothic territory before heading south. See the fuller description in the Rivers of SW Urok section.

#### The Settlement Hierarchy

Xothic settlements follow a clear hierarchy:

**Umlas** stands alone as the holy capital—seat of the Hierophancy, center of the faith, destination for all pilgrims.

**Sacred Cities** (Ku'or, Speusippos, Hippotas, Qo'koven, Sicule'os, Gryllus, Iphikrates) each host major temple complexes and serve as regional administrative centers. Each Sacred City has particular significance—a connection to sacred history, a notable shrine, or an important institutional function.

**Temple-Towns** (dozens across the territory) maintain resident priesthood and serve as religious and civic centers for surrounding villages. A temple-town has temples to all Seven, though some may be small shrines rather than full structures.

**Villages** have minimal religious infrastructure—perhaps a shared shrine, visited periodically by priests from the nearest temple-town. Villagers travel to temple-towns for major rituals and festivals.

The road network connects these layers. Pilgrimage routes link villages to temple-towns, temple-towns to Sacred Cities, and Sacred Cities to Umlas. The geography of Xoth is the geography of faith.

### Tyberoskos

South of the Pearly Mountains, where the land descends toward the coast, Tyberoskos spreads across rolling hills of limestone and clay. This is not a forest that welcomes travelers. The ground is treacherous—riddled with sinkholes that open without warning, swallowing the unwary into darkness. The trees have adapted with vast root systems that grip the unstable earth, their canopy so thick that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight.

Two peoples call Tyberoskos home, bound together by necessity and lunar rhythm.

#### The Weretigers

The weretigers of Tyberoskos are not monsters—most of the time. For twenty-two days of the month, they live as humans do: hunting, trading, raising families in scattered camps throughout the forest. They're suspicious of outsiders but not hostile, willing to guide travelers through safe paths for fair payment.

Then the new moon comes.

When Nyxara goes dark, the weretigers lose themselves. The transformation is involuntary and total—not just physical but mental. They become apex predators driven by instinct, hunting anything that moves with terrible efficiency. Even their own families are not safe; weretiger camps scatter before the new moon, individuals isolating themselves to minimize the carnage.

The change lasts three nights. When Nyxara's first sliver returns, the weretigers wake—often miles from where they started, sometimes covered in blood they pray isn't human. They've learned to live with this curse, but they've never learned to cure it. Some say it came from a Zelidian blood-ritual gone wrong, others that it's punishment from a tiger-god for some ancient transgression. The weretigers themselves don't speak of origins. They simply endure.

#### The Qipi

The Qipi are gnomes—but barely. Standing less than a foot tall, they're the smallest of the gnomish peoples, with gray skin that blends into limestone and enormous dark eyes adapted to underground life. They live in the sinkholes that pock Tyberoskos, carving tiny cities into the vertical walls: miniature towers, thread-thin bridges, gardens of phosphorescent fungi.

From above, a Qipi sinkhole looks like nothing—a dark hole in the forest floor, maybe thirty feet across. Climb down (if you can fit in the handholds carved for Qipi fingers), and you'll find a civilization. The largest sinkholes house thousands, their walls honeycombed with dwellings, their floors converted to underground lakes stocked with blind fish.

The Qipi have an arrangement with the weretigers. When the new moon approaches, the gnomes retreat underground and seal their sinkholes with stone caps—too heavy for a transformed weretiger to move, too snugly fit to offer purchase for claws. They wait in darkness until the danger passes. In exchange, during the safe twenty-two days, weretiger hunters protect Qipi trading expeditions to the surface and escort their merchants to markets in Maun and Wisgarrd.

It's not friendship. The weretigers are terrified of what they might do to the tiny gnomes during transformation; the Qipi are pragmatic enough to know they need protection. But generations of mutual dependence have built something like trust. When a Qipi elder speaks of "our great friends above," there's genuine warmth beneath the irony.

#### The Suverain River

The Suverain flows through western Tyberoskos, its course determined by the same limestone geology that creates the sinkholes. The river disappears underground in several places, emerging miles later, making navigation unreliable. Local guides know which stretches are safe for boats and which will swallow you into darkness.

### Maun

A dwarven city-state on the southern coast of SW Urok, famous for its School of Music and Theater. Maun sits where the Maun River empties into Beauty Bay, its harbor busy with ships carrying students, graduates, and the instruments they craft. See the full state entry for details on its martial traditions, mandatory service requirements, and the mysterious Ghost who haunts its halls.

The city is as much heard as seen—music drifts from every quarter, students practicing at all hours, the sounds of a hundred instruments blending into a constant, ever-shifting symphony. Visitors either fall in love with Maun or flee within a day. There is no middle ground.

### Wisgarrd

A dwarven city-state inland from Maun, built into the foothills where the Pearly Mountains descend toward the coast. Wisgarrd is home to the School of Jewelry, where master craftsmen teach the art of gem-cutting and, to select students, the secrets of magical enchantment. See the full state entry for details on its curriculum, the legendary Book of Gems, and its complicated relationship with Maun.

The Peonie River flows past Wisgarrd's walls, its banks thick with the flowering plants that give the river its name. Jewelers draw inspiration from the blooms; some say no Wisgarrd piece is complete without at least one element borrowed from the peonie's form.

### South Reach

The southern coast of SW Urok curves from Beauty Bay to the Gulf of Xoth, a stretch of shoreline that serves as the region's maritime gateway. South Reach isn't a political entity—no city-state claims it, no nation governs it—but rather a geographic term for the coastal strip and its scattered settlements.

Most traffic flows through **Threshold**, a rough harbor town at the midpoint of the coast. Threshold exists because it's useful: ships need somewhere to resupply, travelers need somewhere to rest, and merchants need somewhere to conduct business away from city-state tariffs. The town has all the vices sailors expect and all the services travelers need, governed loosely by a council of ship captains and innkeepers who agree on exactly one principle: Threshold stays neutral, or Threshold dies.

The Mneri River reaches the sea here, its mouth forming a natural harbor that Threshold has exploited for generations. Fishing villages dot the coast to either side, their catches feeding both the town and the trade ships that stop for provisions.

### Phiona Bay

The western coast of SW Urok curves inward to form Phiona Bay, a broad shallow anchorage sheltered by the Pearly Mountains' western extent. The bay takes its name from Saint Phiona, a healer-priestess who, according to legend, walked across its waters during a great plague three centuries past. She touched the sick in every fishing village along the shore, and by morning the plague had broken. Whether miracle or myth, the bay is considered blessed water by many sailors.

Phiona Bay is treacherous for the unwary. Sandbars shift with the seasons, submerged rocks lurk where charts say clear water should be, and the currents run strange near the river mouths. Local pilots know the channels; outsiders founder. The fishing villages along the shore make good money guiding merchant ships to safe anchorage—and salvaging those that didn't pay for guidance.

The Vyandrik River empties into the bay's northern reach, wide and slow and navigable for shallow-draft vessels. The Prelapon joins it from the south, faster and prone to seasonal flooding. Together they drain most of the Pearly Mountains' western slopes, carrying silt that builds the sandbars and makes the bay's navigation so unpredictable.

On feast days commemorating Phiona's Walk, small boats with candle-lit shrines drift across the bay after sunset. Some say the candles burn for days without going out. Others say that's just good wax and wishful thinking.

### Beauty Bay

South of Tyberoskos, where the Maun River meets the sea, Beauty Bay earned its name honestly. Something about the water's mineral content—runoff from the limestone sinkholes upstream—combined with the angle of the Pearly Mountains creates sunsets of extraordinary color. Oranges and purples that seem impossible, light that paints the water like oil on canvas.

Artists from Maun have painted Beauty Bay for centuries. Some claim watching the sunset from its shores inspires creativity; others say that's romantic nonsense, but they keep coming back anyway. The bay has become part of Maun's identity—the School of Music holds outdoor performances in a natural stone amphitheater on the eastern shore, timing finales to coincide with the sunset's peak.

The same minerals that color the light make the bay's water unsuitable for drinking but excellent for certain dye-making processes. Maun's theatrical costumes are famous partly for colors that can't be reproduced elsewhere—the bay's gift to the city that celebrates it.

### Drunken Forest

East of Wisgarrd, between the city-state and Xoth's western territories, the Drunken Forest earns its name with every step. The trees grow wrong here. Not just tilted but spiraling, looping, growing horizontally for yards before shooting upward at impossible angles. Root systems twist back on themselves. Branches reach down instead of up. The forest looks like it was planted by a giant who couldn't walk straight.

Walking through the Drunken Forest induces vertigo. The wrongness of the trees confuses the eye; the brain insists "up" is somewhere it isn't. Prolonged exposure—more than a few hours—causes genuine disorientation. Travelers have been found wandering in circles, convinced they were walking straight, their sense of direction completely scrambled.

No one knows why. Theories range from a leyline intersection beneath the soil to buried titan-bones leaking residual magic to a collapsed temple dedicated to a god of madness. The Qipi claim the forest "drank something bad from the earth" and leave it at that. No one's dug deep enough to find the truth—the disorientation makes sustained work impossible.

The forest serves as a natural buffer between Wisgarrd and Xoth's Pyrgion Forest territory. Neither side has tried to tame it; neither side needs to. Anyone attempting to march an army through the Drunken Forest would arrive with soldiers too dizzy to fight.

Timber from the forest is prized for decorative work—the natural spirals are genuinely beautiful, and furniture-makers pay well for Drunken wood. Harvesters work in short shifts, retreating before the disorientation takes hold. They mark their paths with rope and never work alone.

### The Rivers of SW Urok

SW Urok is defined by its waterways. The mountains catch rain; the rivers carry it to the sea; and along those rivers, civilization clusters.

#### Northern Rivers

**Pteyalune River**: Flows north from the Tethryn Mountains toward Deadwater Bay. Cold, clear water that grows increasingly lifeless as it approaches that cursed shore. Fish swim the upper reaches; the lower river is sterile. Locals believe the Pteyalune once flowed warm and full of life before "something happened" to the bay. Now it carries that death upstream, a little further each generation.

**Freolian River**: The main water-road from Xi Chin's region southeast toward the interior. Named for the Freolian family, merchant-explorers who first mapped its navigable stretches. Good fishing, moderate current, lined with trading posts. If you're traveling from the Tethryn Mountains to the southern city-states by water, you start on the Freolian.

**Myestrones**: Less a river than a network—"hundred streams" in an old trade tongue. The Myestrones drain the Pearly Mountains' northern faces, dozens of creeks and brooks converging into tributaries that eventually feed the Freolian. Locals navigate by knowing which stream leads where; outsiders get lost within hours.

#### Western Rivers

**Vyandrik River**: The major western artery, flowing from the Pearly Mountains into Phiona Bay. Wide, slow, navigable for much of its length. Fishing villages cluster at its mouth, and shallow-draft boats can travel surprisingly far inland—nearly to the mountain foothills in the wet season.

**Prelapon River**: Joins the Vyandrik from the south, draining the Pearly Mountains' western slopes. Faster current, prone to dramatic seasonal flooding. The name means something like "after the washing"—supposedly named for a legendary flood that "washed away the old and left behind the new." The Prelapon's floods are destructive but fertilizing; the river-valley farms produce the best yields in SW Urok.

**Expation River**: Flows down the western coast into Phiona Bay from the north. Local legend claims the name is a corruption of "Expatriate's River"—named by exiles from some forgotten conflict who settled its banks rather than return home. The exiles are long gone, absorbed into the fishing villages, but the name persists.

#### Central Rivers

**Thyogres River**: The great central artery of SW Urok. The Thyogres rises in the highlands between the Tethryn and Pearly ranges, flows south through the mountain pass, skirts the eastern edge of Tyberoskos, and eventually reaches the sea near South Reach. It's the primary trade route through the interior—wide, deep, and slow enough for heavy cargo vessels. Control of Thyogres River traffic has been fought over for centuries; currently, no single power dominates, and tolls are collected by whoever holds the nearest bank.

**Suverain River**: Flows southward through western Tyberoskos, parallel to the Thyogres but smaller and wilder. The name suggests "sovereign"—perhaps once a boundary between territories now forgotten. The Suverain disappears underground in several places, a product of Tyberoskos's limestone geology, making it unreliable for navigation.

#### Southern Rivers

**Peonie River**: Flows past Wisgarrd toward the coast, clear water over a rocky bed, famous for the flowering plants that grow thick along its banks. The peonies bloom in late spring, carpeting the riverbanks in pink and white. Wisgarrd's jewelers have drawn inspiration from the flowers for centuries—peonie motifs appear in their oldest and most traditional designs.

**Maun River**: The river that gives Maun its name—or perhaps Maun gave the river its name; scholars argue. Either way, the city straddles it, connected by bridges of increasing architectural ambition as you move from the outskirts toward the School. The Maun is shallow enough to ford in places but deep enough for small boats, making the city a natural crossroads.

**Mneri River**: Southwest of Maun, reaching the sea at Threshold. Smaller and wilder than its neighbors, with rapids in its upper reaches that make navigation difficult. The name is old, its meaning forgotten—possibly derived from a language that predates the current inhabitants.

#### Eastern River

**Siddaneas River**: Flows along the eastern edge of SW Urok, marking the approximate boundary with Xoth territory. The river is less a border than a convenient reference point—Xoth's influence extends somewhat west of it, and independent settlements exist somewhat east. But when locals say "across the Siddaneas," they mean "in Xoth's sphere," and they lower their voices when they say it.

### Bay of Lords

A bay on Urok.

### Nekanzi Jungle

The northeastern peninsula of Urok, dominated by dense rainforest split by the Firespine—a surface breach of the Yolus fire leyline. Home to the Neka gnomes, a confederacy of five villages (Tyunigogo, Hyhi, Kanamazi, Yanayazi, and Sygozoki) who have built their culture around negotiating with the fire spirits that emerge from the leyline. The Neka are territorial but trade through Tyunigogo with outsiders, offering fire-resistant materials and distinctive flame-touched metalwork from Sygozoki's spirit-powered forges.

See the full entry in [Nekanzi Jungle](Nekanzi%20Jungle.md) for details on the villages, the Firespine, and Neka society.

### Stepsidae

A steppe region on Urok.

On Prophecy Island

When people settled on this isle, a prophet said that the isle would be destroyed by the gods. Nobody listened, but eventually the island erupted, and her prophecy came true. Now believed to be cursed.
