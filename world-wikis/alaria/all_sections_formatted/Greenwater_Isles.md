## Maun

Tags: citystate

Maun is the home to the most famous dwarven school of music and theater in Alaria. Many bards travel to Maun to learn from the great scholars of the school. 

Comes with a cost. Everyone who goes *must* serve a year in the military or mines, either mining or fighting the beasts within the mountain. You can either do it simultaneously, or sequentially. 

Yearly competition at the school for musical ability. Chapion gets an incredibly powerful magical instrument.

"The Ghost" wanders halls of school, offering help. Some believe he is one of the founders.

### Roule Channel

A waterway south of Roule, where light and force leylines intersect beneath the waves.

#### Sunbeam Prison

At the intersection of light and force leylines in the Roule Channel stands one of the most unusual prisons in all of Alaria. The Sunbeam Prison is not made of stone or iron, but of beams of solidified light bound together by force magic. These sunbeams create a perfect cage—impenetrable, unbreakable, and visible from miles away as they shimmer above the water. The prison requires constant magical maintenance to sustain the leyline convergence, making it both a marvel of magical engineering and a constant drain on resources.

#### Shenchen Forest

At the southwestern tip of the Pearly Mountains, north of the Tyberoskos forest, lies the Shenchen Forest—an eerie woodland inhabited by ancient samurai suits of enchanted armor. These dark knights stand eternal vigil over ruined shrines and temples, their armor animated by old magic. The forest grew up around and atop the ruins, but the guardians remain, still defending the sacred sites they were bound to protect centuries ago.

Approaching the ruins means facing these spectral sentinels, whose skill with blade and bow has not diminished with the passing years. They attack intruders without warning or mercy, their movements as precise and deadly as the day they were first enchanted.

### Xoth

A state on Urok.

### Tyberoskos

A forest on Urok near the Pearly Mountains, inhabited by weretigers who are deadly on the new moon but peaceful otherwise. The forest is also home to the Qipi—a very small race of gnomes who live in huge sinkholes where they've built small cities. A couple of these sinkhole settlements exist throughout the forest, hidden beneath the canopy.

On Prophecy Island

When people settled on this isle, a prophet said that the isle would be destroyed by the gods. Nobody listened, but eventually the island erupted, and her prophecy came true. Now believed to be cursed.
