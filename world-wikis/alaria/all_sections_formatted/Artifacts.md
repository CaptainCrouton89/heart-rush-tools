## Ezzal Artifacts

Tags: item

Some materials and items of Alaria were imbued with ezz during the Ezz Rift. The materials were hoarded by the first dragons, then captured by dwarven king who had them forged into a collection of weapons named "thought swords". Fast as thought, and as deadly as one's imagination. The weapons melded with your mind. Extremely potent. They were necessary to become a true swordmind.

## The Four Dragon Blades

Tags: magic

Each of the four dragon blades is an ancient item that was forged by a dark elf master smith. The blades are a rare example of elven smithing competing with the best of the drwaven and cyclopse craftsmen. Although none of the blades are enchanted, they were made with such skill and such rare material that they posses mythic properties, allowing them to aid the weilder in supernatural ways without the use of conventional magic or mana. The blades where forged for dragon riders of the ancient dark elf empire. The hilt of the blade is modelled after the dragon's maw while the blade itself is modelled after the dragon's tongue. This design resulted in the swords looking thick, wavey, and slightly sluggish. Their shape combined with their dark materials have led to them being described as crude or unsightly but on the battle field they serve their purpose flawlessly. They swing with speed and ease despite their size and shape and they seperate flesh, bone, and armor alike, without becoming dull. The blades have been scattered and traded over the years but remain legendary items coveted by dark elf establishments.

## The Golden Enchanting Table

Tags: magic

The Golden Enchanting Table was built by one of the greatest golden beard dwarf forges of all time. Although he is also famous for erecting the legendary 9-ringed city, the enchanting table is the crown jewel of his achievements. The table is made of the purest gold and resides at the center of a room made of ever turning gears. The gears are enchanted with lesser souls, allowing them to continue turning without fuel. On each side of each tooth of each gear, there is a fundamental rune that inevitably connects with the runes of each other gear during its rotation. When the fundamental runes of different gears touch they form a classical rune that draws power from the tables core (a legendary soul) and presents itself to whomever stands within the room of the enchanting table. Once the rune is presented to the tables user, they may use it however they wish without the need of soul energy or a sacrifice. The gears in the room are set up in a way that each gear migrates around the room over the course of a decade so that it can make contact with every other room and form as many different classical runes as possible. Reknowned enchanters search for the table and fight for a place at it so that they may learn from its complicated design and use is renewable magic. The golden beard dwarf who designed the table was a genious and an outlier within history. He was able to construct the fundamental runes from an advanced understanding of magic, souls, and enchanting that few beings have been able to replicate since.
