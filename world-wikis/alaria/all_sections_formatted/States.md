## Aldriktch Trade Alliance

Tags: faction

### Overview

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is an agreement between Erasnus, Watar, Myorna, Camaran, Bestacia, and Ubrik that dictates open trade routes between the countries. It sets limits on maximum tariffs for ports and foreign trade, and gives member nations more favorable trading rights.

Currently, the entie alliance is under threat, as tensions between Myorna and its neighbors continue to rise. Allowing Myorna into the trade alliance was only barely permitted (spear headed by phenomenal diplomats from both Myorna, Ubrik, and Bestacia), and now it's causing trouble.

It is also threated by the massive silvertongue outbreak in Ubrik, which has driven half the country into a canabalistic frenzy, terrorizing the nearby countryside. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold the alliance together (it is most profitable for them of all the countries), but it is difficult to hold on.

Camaran has become more isolationist recently as well, which spells trouble, and the Watari and Bestacians relations are getting worse as tension over control of the Telphineas Strait escalates. 

### History

Echea was vetoed by Camaran. Myorna was partially let in because people wanted access to the incredible quanities of silver in those mountains. Bestacian diplomats also hoped that it would deter war.

### History

## Chaal Nazzerox

Tags: state

The massive, undead empire of the south. Definitely worrisome for everyone in the region. Led by Xynoth Azkonor, undead lich king.

The undead mill aimlessly when not directed by Xynoth or his henchmen. 95% of population are undead (no spirit), but 5% are still pretty evil, but have free will. Have surivived by pillaging and enslaving. Live slaves tend to fields to provide for few remaining living people. Undead keep watch. Relentless army.

Boxed in by sea and mountains, and armies have dwindled. Needs an influx of shadows/souls to resume campaign and cross the mountains or the sea.

Can't get through the smoky mountains cuz the Firesworn are too  well burrowed in. Can't get through mountains cuz treacherous and decently defended. Will cross sea once they can build boats, though they have no way of building boats yet.

The undead are unruly and vicious, barely kept in check by Xynoth Azkonor. Cities are in state of disrepair because everyone is incompetent and selfish. Only know how to steal, not create.

#### No Roads

Nearly all travel takes place on the rivers. Ground is very soft—terrible for roads.

### The War

Armies continue to march south from the capital. People are fleeing, seeking refuge in the Gray Citadel and Methrayn.

## Chechol

Tags: state

Inhabited by Rentar.

Also contains the Pyramid of Five Sides—a four sided pyramid that theoretically has a fifth side on Celesté. It is a location where you can cross back and forth between Celesté and the Material Plane. It's incredibly sacred, and a massive source of power for the Rentar.

This results in highly capable, extremely talented elemental war casters making up the majority of the Echean military forces.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Adi Assabehta

**Cities**: Adal

**Towns**: 

**Villages**: 


### Primary Conflicts

- Echea is frequently the trophy of military endeavors, since it is seen as a wellspring of wealth and education to be harnessed. However, invaders have never made it to the capital.
- Echea houses many children of foreign royalty who wish to see some of the knowledge of the Echean universities rub off on their offspring, with variable success.
- Despite hundreds of years passing, the vicious hatred between Echeans and Cogheads continues. Echea conveniently ignores the Coghead genocide only 50 years ago that killed all the cogheads in echea.
- A mad scientist scholar hypothesized about the existance of a flip site of the Material Plane. Unbeknownst to anyone else, he managed to open a portal to the other side, binding the entire city of Adi Assabehta to Zylogmus Eternus. Now, people are mysteriously dying throughout the city, and some people are fleeing. Many people don't think this mysterious death thing is real (or think it's caused by other reasons), so most stay. The scholar was the first to die (freak coincidence), and no one suspects anything. Portal undiscovered. The capital will slowly empty out over the next few years as people realize that there is something causing people to mysteriously die.

### History

Two centuries ago, Cogheads and Echi worked together in the mountains. The cogheads created the machinery, and the Echi created the magic. The mountains were jointly ruled over by the two races. A friendly, but fierce rivarly between the two races existed over which technology was better—magic or machines. The Echi declared victory when they had created infinite resources from their elemental artifacts, but the Cogheads countered by developing a machine allowing them to steal the very elemental attunement out of another creature's body. They used this to say that they had in fact won. Of course, this was disputed by the gnomes. In retaliation, the cogheads sucked the extremely potent elemental attunement right out of a Echi figurehead. This was seen as an act of war, and the Echi massacred and drove the Cogheads out of the mountains. The Cogheads have never forgiven the Echi for the brutal massacre, and the Echi believe it was totally justified. This conflict has spread across ethnic lines, and many gnomes and goblins who had nothing to do with the history now have variably extreme views towards the other.

## Edari

Home to the Korel. Savage, nomadic leopard people. No permanent settlements.

## Elephant Groves

Tags: forest

Enormous forest, inhabited by the spirit of an ancient elephant. Guards this grove, as it is the birthplace of the loxodon. Intruders are repelled.

## Enapay

Tags: state

Home to the Dwelyn. A very ancient monarchy.

## Enavadi

A relatively poor, human nation. Lots of simple fishermen with a very inward facing culture. Very uninterested in interacting with outsiders. However, they are the best fishermen in world.

## Enymu

Tags: state

Inhabited by humans and craven. Fairly similar to Nektuna in population, but much poorer in comparison, as it has no leylines nor strangehold on trade. However, it still has decent money from trade. Primarily a farming nation, and ruled by a very long line of honorable, albeit perhaps naive, kings. 

Could be persuaded to turn on Nektuna, but only with some difficulty.

## Eoga

**Quality**: Extremely high

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- A small, elite fighting force exists within Eoga. They are rarely deployed to do anything, but they are both diplomats, fighters, emmisaries, and healers.

### History

Eoga and Vystrilik were once one nation, before Hykravones came and destroyed the world. After the titan destroyed the world, the Eoga broke away from Vystrilik, in shame. They were disappointed that they had not died as well, with the humans and other races of the world. This shame has remained with them this day. Although they are virtually unfindable within the jungle, should a child of Gaiea find them, the Caerine would gladly give them anything they wanted.

## Erasnus

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal, House of Nobles and House of Commerce

**Primary Inhabitants**: Belenstrope

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Wealth, prestige, intelligence, vision, entrepreneurship

- Erasnus is jointly ruled by two parliamentary houses—the House of Nobles, and the House of Commerce. These consist of the highest ranking members of society within the two most important areas of Erasnun society.
- Nearly every village, town, and city is home to multiple nobility, as well as their extended family. Practically everyone has at least a cousin who's distantly related to some noble family or another.


### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Textiles

**Primary Imports**: Everything

- They are members of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. 
- Erasnus is home to the best over-land merchants in Alaria. Their ability to haggle is unparalleled, and their eye for a good deal is uncanny.
- Lending, business, entreprenuership, and traveling merchant are all extremely common professions in Erasnus.


### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Military enrollment is mandatory, but there are a thousand ways to wiggle your way out of it, which means that it consists primarily of the poor and less influential.
- Working in the military is seen as a job for idiots who can't turn a profit on their own. 
- As tensions heat up between Anarak and Myorna, Erasnus is scrambling to not get swallowed up if war should break out.
- The population is largely non-violent. If threatened with a sharp stick, most Erasnuns would throw up their hands and give over all of their money. Most see it as much easier to trade to make money rather than risk getting hurt stealing.

### Primary Conflicts

- Myorna and Anarak are both potential sources of war, and Erasnus' military is terribly ill-equiped to handle a war, should it break out. They are currently desparately trying to negotiate peace treaties, and although things look good on paper, there is a lot of uncertainty.
- The military is largely disrespected, but those at the head of it do control a considerable amount of power, which they could wield to wrestle some control from the nobility and merchants, who have scorned them forever.

- Despite their downfall being attributed to their own pride, the Nemo view it as a tragic injustice, and not their fault. This bitterness towards the outsider world affects many of their relations.
- Few people wish to take control over the forests, as they are haunted by the souls of the Nemo.
- Some of the Nemo wish to have their forest destroyed, so they can finally be set free.

Tags: state

Multiple, semi-united Kendrel monarchies.

- Flurin
- Glador
- Pelaria

## Kerwin

Tags: state

Home to agrarian halflings. Very relaxing country, pretty despite being quite arid. Decent art, very kind people. Like hobbits. 

However, ruled over by [Ulyas, the Immortal], the 898 year old halfling king. They are certainly a lich, though nobody knows where he gets his spirits from—they believe that his yearly trip to [LOCATION TBD] replenishes his health. In actuality, involves large sacrifice to keep him alive. He is a good king, so believes it's justifiable.

## Kingdoms of Fire

Tags: alliance

There are four Neferati kingdoms, adjacent to each other, known as the Kingdoms of Fire. Although each kingdom is independent (and is actually a monarchy), they frequently work together and make decisions together.

The Kingdoms of Fire are made up of Gissemari, Yaif, Kabir, and Wadiyah.

## Klevnaf

Tags: state

Recently split from Istora due to the murder of the elven king. Some people blame the king's younger brother. 

Old King passes away. Kingdom (Istora and Klevnaf combined) goes to eldest son, Istor XXVI. Istor is murdered. Istor's daughter Lamenrae claims foul play from Istor's brother, Taoinor, and denies him the throne. It's time for a queen (Istor XXVI only had a daughter so far).

## Knova

Tags: state

Home to the Iron Academy—the greatest combat school in the world. Knova is composed of quite a few small islands, each of them rich with metals. 

The capital is a towering iron fortress, completely impenetrable to attack. The seas around it are guarded by a legion of triton. They gain free instruction at the academy in exchange for their services defending the islands. 

The outer fortresses are for the other, lesser schools of Knova—school of tactics/center of command for wargames is located in Seatower, and the school of history, strategy, and logsitics is in the north, at Blackwater. Both other schools are some of the best in Alaria, though the Iron Academy is far and away the best at teachign combat.

Extremely lucrative mines lie beside the city, and provide enormous riches which have funded the rapid regrowth of the. city.

### History

Myorna: 50 years ago, Myorna did not exist. But then, moon elves surfaced from the mountains, declaring that now they wanted to interact with the rest of the world, and trade. Since then, relations have been tenuous. Despite entering into the Aldriktch trade alliance with its neighbors, discoveries about the nature of moon elves (also known as silver elves here) has made their neighbors wary. More recent terrorist attacks with links pointing back to Myorna have made their neighbors outright hostile. Even within Myorna there is political unrest. King Thyolinor brought the kingdom to the surface, but many feel they are unwelcome, and wish to return to the caves from which they came. King Thyolinor is not without supporters though—many of the settlements closer to the borders have already begun to assimilate into Erasnian (Erasnus) culture, and hope to stay.

Even longer ago, Tiira was made into their goddess, after Myorna was driven underground by other elves. Elves spent thousands of years underground.

### Stone Slums


The Stone Slums are an area of super foggy, flat, slate-built, short buildings. Many of the poor of Myorna make their home here, and it is home to many unsavory and mysterious characters. This is where golems were discovered and first built.

## Nektuna

Tags: state

An incredibly powerful state, as they control the Tarkhetan Strait—a very thin passage of water connecting the Shattered Sea to the Gray Sea. They tax all trade that passes throug the port. Many aren't happy about this, but Tarkhetan is a massive fortress with powerful armaments and a large navy. The city is located on a leyline of fire, and powerful firemages grow up in the city, capable of easily burning ships down from afar.

Nektuna is hardly safe, however. They are surrounded on all sides by those interested in taking their wealth and controlling the strait themselves. 

Based loosely on king's landing from GoT. Controlled by many lords from different regions.

Nektuna is farily diverse place, home to primarily humans, but with a massive population of Craven, and smaller populations of dwarblin, trollkin, and even ayblek. A fair number of weblin also travel throughout, selling their wares.

Also controls the island of Pyris. Pyris is home to an old race of dwarves, who have interbred with humans long enough to be very rough mix of the two. Mostly farmers who want to live simple lives. 

Nektuna also contains the city Besnoumeru, which lies directly on the leyline of time. Besnoumeru is almost as famously wealthy as Tarkhetan for the phenomenol ability of its merchants to predict the changes in supply and demand before they happen.

In possession of Astrelle.

## Phirexes

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Dengar

**Population**: 30,000

**Stability**: [Anarchy, Very Unstable, Unstable, Somewhat Stable, Stable, Very Stable, Eternal] 

**Core Values**: Love for the queen, independence, pursuit of one's own interests, unity

- Phirexes is ruled over by the gorgon queen Phendexelas the Beautiful, an evil sorceress and witch.
- The fogs of Phirexes are partially under the control of Phendexelas, and they prevent those who have stayed for a long time from leaving.
- Every evening, the queen makes rounds, and the citizens bow down to her and praise the ground she crosses.
- Further outside the city, refugees from the city live in abject poverty. Should they allow their presence become too well known, the queen would destroy them. However, they cannot leave, and to return to Phirexes would mean bending under the thumb of the queen once more.


### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Products from the swamp, medicine

**Primary Imports**: Metals and metal products

- The Phirexes economy is stunted by the horrible conditions of Phirexes. The swamps and marsh prevent any heavy industry.

### Primary Conflicts

- There is a constant tension between the queen and the Dengar who have left. The queen has to walk a line between being the savior of the Dengar, while also supressing those who escape. The Dengar are stuck between living in a city in the swamp bowing down to a false queen, or else trying to survive in a deadly swamp that they can never leave.


### History

Sixty years ago, the Dengar lived in the swamp, in peace. They were close with many of the beasts of the marshes, and knew how to survive. Then, the gorgon Phendexelas arrived, and the fogs began. At first the fogs were not an issue, but slowly the beasts of the swamp were driven mad, and the Dengar became affected. A city was built by the queen, and the Dengar fled to it, running from a swamp that had turned against them. The gorgon had solved a problem she had created, and now she was the queen of a city.

## Postronamas Empire

Tags: ruins, state

Long ago fell to civil war, and eventually died out kool-aid style. Located in the Piktiniti Desert

Had beautiful insect armor, line art, insect partnerships, and knew the secret of harvesting twyl—getting the large dung beetles to vibrate their wings, which causes the right frequency of vibrations to break the bonds between the crystals and the sand they are attachced to.

Egypt + Japan + Tlingit

## Poum-Titch

## Pyonokraus

Tags: city, state

Home to some Ayblek.

This city is cursed—none of the inhabitants can ever leave, including those who enter from the outside. Built into a titan skull on the mountainside, it has layers upon layers of city built on top of itself, since there's nowhere to go but down and on top of existing buildings. 

It has a similar feel to the mining town in guardians of the galaxy where they meet the bioengineer

It has existed for millenia, and contains secrets completely unknown to the outside world. Getting them, however, is quite difficult; no one who enters can ever leave. You can greet people at the border, but you have to be able to offer something fantastic to make them willing to share—after all, they're screwed, and they have no reason to help you if you can't offer something incredible in return.

Facing tensions with Roule, which has been burning the plains down (in order to plant farms). The Rakiten have been withdrawing from the coast, and the Roules don't even know of the existence of the Rakitens, but Rakitens are deciding that maybe it's time to fight back, rather than just disappear and retreat. 

Culturally very against confrontation. Disagreements are settled by gift giving. Whoever can give bigger gift is the one more favored. Love thy opponent. When you are presented a gift that took enormous sacrifice for your opponent, you are expected to accept it and do what they want, even if their gift isn't actually useful to yourself.

## Tamadrez

Tags: state

Tamadrez is a suffering country, in a brutal diplomatic balance with Gorath. In the south, Gorathi slavers pick up thousands of Drasnian dwarves a year. These dwarves have been sold into slavery by their very own people. Those that flee north are denied into the northern towns due to a treaty between Gorath and Tamadrez that forbids the Northerners from accepting slaves from the south, in exchange for not being invaded by Gorath. 

Many in the north turn a blind eye to the slaves, but the threat of Gorath invasion is very real and terrifying, so open dismissal of the treaty could spell disaster for Tamadrez. Once, several years ago, a northern town was found to be harboring hundreds of escaped slaves. A Gorathi warship came by and firebombed the entire city to ash, killing thousands.

Gorath has not invaded for the primary reason that its forces are already spread quite thin, due to brutal wars along its northwest and eastern borders. Gorath can only profit off of Tamadrez so long as it remains divided.

### History

## Windor

Tags: state

Inhabited by Windorf halflings. Each town has a several seats in the council. Each town has some local nobility, who go to capital for council.

Frequently forced to deal with raiding trolls from the Green Mountains.

## Wisgarrd

Tags: citystate

Similar to Maun, but with the Dwarven School of Jewelry. Famously good. Nobles will pay the extreme tuitions to have their personal jewelers attend for a few years and come back and make jewelry for them.

Staff favorites are granted access to the school-within-a-school where they teach you how to incorporate magic into the jewelry. 

The school's library is home to a rare and ancient text known as the "Book of Gems." The book is said to contain the secrets of creating magical jewels and imbuing them with powerful enchantments. The book is guarded by the school's librarians and is only made available to select students who have proven themselves worthy.

Tuition is extremely expensive.

High tuition of Wisgarrd school pays for students from Maun to defend both cities from the monsters below. There is some animosity between the two schools (snobs vs artists)

## Wykakas

Tags: city-state

Home to many Sharabha families. Strict, casted society. Nobility have arranged marriages. Large standing army to defend against Naruaghin in the south. Army has lots of talk about "honor" and "bravery" but they've not had to fight in 100 years, so the army has gone soft and is full of bs.
