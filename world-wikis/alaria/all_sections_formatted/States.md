## Adron

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Naga

**Population**: 500,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, intelligence, dignity

- The Adrak nobility are famously powerful, well mannered, knowledgeable, and agreeable. They can also be condescending toward non-Naga outsiders, though rarely to the point of rudeness.
- Descendants of the first dragon, Naga have upheld their ancestors' values for eons. "A Naga without honor is no Naga at all" is a famous saying among Naga elders.
- Three major ley lines cross Adron—water, time, and dark—creating numerous intersections that produce an unusually high number of elementally attuned citizens.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Cultural artifacts, financial services, food, ships, iron, luxury goods, magic

**Primary Imports**: Animal products, luxury goods

- The Adrak economy relies heavily on the Royal Adrak Bank, famous for funding both sides of foreign wars and coming out on top regardless of the victor.
- A steady stream of red gold mined out of the Gozwin and Majesty Mountains has provided insane wealth to the nobility of Adrak, and is the source of the famous Adrak jewelry. Red gold is the most valuable currency in Alaria.
- The shipyards of Shipmarsh are among the finest in the Middle Sea, producing both merchant vessels and warships.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Most Adrak citizens are enthusiastic to join the military, due to its prestige and honor. All Naga citizens are drafted at 19, where they serve until they are 23.
- The nobility generally are trained from a younger age to become leaders of the Adrak army, and it is customary for the king or queen of Adron to lead the charge into major battles.

### Geography

**Location**: Easternmost state on the Middle Sea, where the Kharvorn Mountains terminate

**Biomes**: Mediterranean coastline, temperate forests, mountain ranges, salt marshes, river valleys

**Climate**: Mediterranean—warm, dry summers and mild winters

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Adrak

**Cities**: Shipmarsh, Greyport

**Towns**: Numerous small towns scattered throughout, particularly along the Tenori River and around the western lakes

### Primary Conflicts

- The Dwarf King continues to steal from travelers through the Majesty Mountains. He is descendant of the dwarves who used to live there, believes the resources of the mountains belong to him.
- The Royal Adrak Bank is rumored to be funding all three sides of the War of Three Kingdoms.
- A large influx of Danaki refugees from the Danak-Atyeska war is angering citizens of the northern settlements.
- The dragon Chavux raids ships near The Blades, but killing a dragon is sacrilege—merchants in Greyport would pay handsomely to have the problem "solved" quietly.

### History

Adron was once the land of dragon riders. For centuries, Naga warriors bonded with dragons through sacred rituals at the Maw of Chao, blessed by Damasaki Edara herself. The Adrak dragon cavalry dominated the Middle Sea.

Roughly four centuries ago, the Waterdark conspiracy ended this golden age. The secret order—masters of water and darkness magic who had long resented draconic dominance—performed a coordinated ritual that severed every dragon-bond in Adron simultaneously. The dragons, suddenly feeling nothing for their riders, simply flew away. Many riders died from the psychic shock. Those who survived found they could no longer pass through Oblivion to reach the Maw of Chao.

The royal family preserved their dragon eggs and bred smaller, domesticated dragons—beautiful but nothing like the war-beasts of old. The art of true binding was lost. Modern Naga feel deep pride in their draconic heritage alongside quiet shame that they are no longer dragon riders. Some believe the old bond could be restored; others think attempting it would be an abomination.

Before the Naga, Tritons inhabited this land. Their exodus left drowned ruins beneath the western lakes—remnants of a civilization that departed for the Alrock Ocean eons ago.

## Aldriktch Trade Alliance

Tags: faction

### Overview

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is an agreement between Erasnus, Watar, Myorna, Camaran, Bestacia, and Ubrik that dictates open trade routes between the countries. It sets limits on maximum tariffs for ports and foreign trade, and gives member nations more favorable trading rights.

Currently, the entie alliance is under threat, as tensions between Myorna and its neighbors continue to rise. Allowing Myorna into the trade alliance was only barely permitted (spear headed by phenomenal diplomats from both Myorna, Ubrik, and Bestacia), and now it's causing trouble.

It is also threated by the massive silvertongue outbreak in Ubrik, which has driven half the country into a canabalistic frenzy, terrorizing the nearby countryside. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold the alliance together (it is most profitable for them of all the countries), but it is difficult to hold on.

Camaran has become more isolationist recently as well, which spells trouble, and the Watari and Bestacians relations are getting worse as tension over control of the Telphineas Strait escalates. 

### History

Echea was vetoed by Camaran. Myorna was partially let in because people wanted access to the incredible quanities of silver in those mountains. Bestacian diplomats also hoped that it would deter war.

## Anarak

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Dictatorship

**Primary Inhabitants**: Anori, Oznak, Tikhaya (Humans)

**Population**: 300,000

**Stability**: Very Stable (through oppression)

**Core Values**: Patriotism, might, revenge

- Anarak is ruled by the black dragon Tepheranos, brother of Rothogomos. He is manipulative, greedy, and patient.
- The population has been brainwashed over a century to see Tepheranos as a savior rather than a tyrant. People are proud citizens; few choose to leave despite poor living conditions.
- The culture emphasizes martial prowess, loyalty to the state, and hatred of Argysis.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- The Anarak economy is largely self-contained. Tepheranos restricts travel in and out of the country.
- Heavy taxation funds the military while most people live in poverty.
- The basin produces enough food to sustain the population, barely.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Anarak military is brutally strict, powerful, and filled with some of the cruelest, most ferocious soldiers anywhere.
- Everyone serves. The military is the path to status and escape from poverty.
- The army is ready for war—Tepheranos just needs a target he can hit without Rothogomos striking while he's exposed.

### Geography

**Location**: Great basin between the Crags of Geth (south) and the Kharvorn Mountains/Argysis (north)

**Biomes**: Basin grasslands, farmland, the Black Hills

**Climate**: Continental—harsh winters, hot summers

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tephrakus (at the base of the Black Hills, near Tepheranos's lair)

**Cities**: Tephrakus, Nidzhoni (center of the basin)

**Towns**: Scattered agricultural settlements across the basin

### Primary Conflicts

**The Argysis Standoff**

Tepheranos and his brother Rothogomos are locked in a generations-long feud. Long ago, they came together to conquer Argysis and steal the dwarven treasure. Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, taking everything for himself. Tepheranos retreated to Anarak, built it into a regional power, and has plotted revenge ever since.

Neither dragon can commit forces elsewhere while the other lives. Argysis is weaker but fortified in the mountains; Anarak is stronger but has hundreds of miles of burnable farmland. The standoff continues.

**Expansionist Hunger**

Tepheranos is greedy. He wants more wealth, more territory, more everything. Anarak will invade whoever they can reach—Erasnus, Hephake, anyone who looks weak. But the Argysis situation ties their hands.

**The Goblin Raids**

Griselian goblins from the Crags of Geth terrorize southern villages. Whether genuine aggression or theatrical spillover is unclear. Either way, villagers suffer and the military can't fully respond while watching the northern border.

**Underground Dissent**

Not everyone believes the propaganda. Resistance cells exist, fragmented and frightened. Tepheranos's agents hunt them constantly, but dissent spreads anyway.

### History

Anarak used to be a free nation—unremarkable but peaceful. A century ago, Tepheranos arrived, secretly killed the king, and subjugated the people. Over the following decades, he brainwashed the population, transforming their understanding of history until they believed he was their savior, not their conqueror.

Now Anarak is a military state waiting for war. The only question is who Tepheranos can attack without leaving himself vulnerable to his brother's revenge.

## Argysis

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**:

**Primary Inhabitants**: Shyka

**Population**: 20,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Killing, vengeance

- Argysis is ruled over by the black dragon Rothogomos, enemy brother of Tepheranos. 
- The population worships Rothogomos as patron in their journey to destroy Tepheranos in the south, towards whom Rothogomos has swayed everyone's animosity. 


### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- The Argysisean economy is totally isolated from the world, as few are willing to trade with the greedy, cutthroat traders of Argysis.


### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Everyone is enrolled in the military, and trained to a high level of proficiency. You do not leave the military until you reach late middle age.


### Geography

**Location**: 

**Biomes**: 

**Named Entities**:

**Rivers & Lakes**: 

**Adjacent Waters**: 


### Political Geography

**Capital**: 

**Cities**: 

**Towns**: 

**Villages**: 


### Primary Conflicts

- Argysis is locked in a currently bloodless war of vengeance with Anarak. Neither can commit to a full war against any other neighbor till the other is removed, but neither is strong enough to remove the other. Argysis is weaker, but is fortified in the mountain, so cannot be pried out. Anarak is stronger, but hundreds of miles of burnable farmland.
- Argysis wants to take over Hephake, which used to be its sibling kingdom, but cannot leave Argysis ungaurded.


### History

## Astrelle

Tags: state

Home to the Stravlar goblins, though a fairly even mix of human/mish-mash and the Stravlar. The Stravlar lived here first, but they were conquered by Tarkhon relatively early in the Tarkon Wars.

## Atriik

Tags: state

pronounced "at-try(spanish "r")-**ike**"

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederation of monarch city-states

**Primary Inhabitants**: Kor, Sharabha

**Population**: 70,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Courtesy, policy, law, appearances, calmness

- Four royal families rule Atriik, each governing a different city-state
- Kor culture dictates politeness to levels viewed as absurd by outsiders—elaborate greeting rituals, indirect speech, and elaborate formal titles for every social interaction
- Social capital and one's standing in society is everything; public loss of face can end political careers
- Three city-states are Kor monarchies; one (Byonowidi) is Sharabha, and despite cultural similarity, is the source of persistent tension

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Furs, animal products, hardwoods from Sprenwood and Fatiik Forest

**Primary Imports**: Metal, weapons, finished goods from desert traders

- Forest industries dominate the west (Sprenwood, Fatiik Forest); hunting and animal husbandry in the central savanna
- Trade routes run north to Kura's glass markets and east toward the Kunagi Desert caravans

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Each city-state maintains its own militia; no unified Atriik army exists
- Sharabha cavalry from Byonowidi are considered the finest mounted warriors
- Chronic border skirmishes with Naruaghin raiders from the south

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Westrim, between the Milras Forest (north), the Dunes of Kunagi (east), the Bloodlands/Ishnit Jungles (south), and Shark Bay (west)

**Biomes**: Savanna-woodland transition, coastal forests, semi-arid scrubland

**Named Entities**: Milras Forest, Sprenwood, Fatiik Forest, Kunagi Hills, Mykala (colossal tree ruin)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Sha Puniki, Sha Ulokoni, Sha Kariki, Sha Sonisst

**Adjacent Waters**: Shark Bay (west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (confederation of equals)

**City-States**:
- **Lupuno**: Northwestern city-state near Milras Forest, controls Sha Puniki river trade
- **Byonowidi**: Western city-state, the Sharabha monarchy, major fur trading hub
- **Shinii**: Eastern city-state, gateway to desert trade, borders Kunagi Hills
- **Wykakas**: Southern city-state, controls Sha Sonisst, buffer against Bloodlands

**Notable Sites**:
- **Mykala**: Ruined fortress at the base of a colossal tree (30-mile canopy, 2-mile trunk diameter), sacred site for all city-states, contested by a druid and an Elnor

### Primary Conflicts

- Three Kor city-states versus one Sharabha monarchy (Byonowidi): despite shared values, racial tensions occasionally flare into trade disputes and border arguments
- Naruaghin raids from the south across the Bloodlands keep southern cities on constant alert
- The Mykala situation: an Elnor attempting to take control of the sacred tree from its resident druid threatens the religious stability of all four city-states

### History

## Atyeska

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Sedentary tribes

**Primary Inhabitants**: Enti

**Population**: 90,000

**Stability**: Somewhat stable

**Core Values**: Raw strength, dominance, athleticism

- Dozens of enti tribes live across Atyeska, in constantly shifting territories. Battle is not uncommon, and taking prisoners is customary.
- Prisoners become slaves to the tribe, and are treated not inhumanely. They grow up in a tribe, and die in the tribe, and have relatively safe lives.


### Economy

**Size**: Very small
**Tech**: Very undeveloped
**Primary Exports**: Pelts, animal products
**Primary Imports**: Technology

- The Atyeska economy is primarily centered around trade. Lianthan Currency is worth very little here.
- Will leave on boats, sail for hundreds of miles, and perform massive raids on the neth who live even further north.
- Food come from fishing in Geshwin Passage

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Although a significant portion of Atyeskans are members of the military, since they are not under one cohesive nation, that military is not united, and therefore significantly less powerful.
- Joining the military is not mandatory, but expected

### History

## Avalon

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Temptari

**Population**: 200,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Relgion, truth, sacredness, seasons, the cycle of time, duty, fate, determinism

- Avalon is ruled over by the Grand Imperial Ecclesiarch, believed to be a walking god. They have not blinked or left their throne for their entire life, and they are said to be able to see the future.
- Multiple fiefdoms are each controlled by a local religious leader. These are all overseen by the Solum Impervium—the hand of the Ecclesiarch. 
- Many time attuned people live in Avalon. 


### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: 

**Primary Imports**: None

- Tithes are collected by the church yearly, as foreseen to best suit the needs of Avalon by the Ecclesiarch in dreams.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Extremely High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- As with most careers, a career in the military starts at age 8, after being brought before the local priest, who declares their future expertise. Soldiers are chosen for special skill in the forces of time, and are raised and trained in isolation from their families for a decade before entering the force. They are machine-like in their skill, never make mistakes, and are utterly unpredictable and deadly.


### Geography

**Location**: Central-western Ve, north of the Widebarrow Mountains, south of Sestros

**Biomes**: Temperate grasslands, mixed forests

**Named Entities**: Goldwood (west), Pathanul (north), Promisewood (south), Shorolyn Forest (east), Honor Moss (central wetland)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Honor River (central), Honor Creek (northeast branch), Pale Run (south)

**Adjacent Waters**: Munari Inlet (west coast)


### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tarolin (central, on Honor River)

**Cities**: Ismail (west coast, Honor River outlet), Karahoroz (east)

**Major Towns (West to East)**: Mekenk, Micitlar, Orenonu, Zindi, Incebolu, Daralan, Kenzek, Burga, Maral, Sukanli, Yasyan, Taylilar

**Towns (South)**: Makavla, Ayni

**Towns (Northeast)**: Civicvler, Sarihalliler, Kochisar


### Primary Conflicts

- Corruption in more minor religious roles is common, and a frequent cause of strife.
- People's partners in life are chosen for them, but not always correctly.


### History

## Azawahasi

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Independent nomadic tribes

**Primary Inhabitants**: Sharabha

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, duty, self-sufficiency, gift-giving

- Sharabha tribes function like lion prides—a strong male and his brothers lead a tribe of up to 50 people. Everyone knows their role, their place in the Pride Circle, and their obligations to the group.
- The Sharabha are descendants of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father who died fighting the titan Hykravones. His blood transformed the land and the people who settled upon it. This shared ancestry creates deep bonds across tribal lines.
- Honor is paramount. "My honor before my life" isn't a saying—it's how Sharabha actually live. Oaths are taken seriously, debts are remembered, and reputation matters more than wealth.
- The two major Sharabha cultures—Sharakari (Pride Guardians) and Sharadin (Oathspeakers)—both exist here, with different tribes following different traditions.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Very Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Beads, furs, animal products, ivory

**Primary Imports**: Furs, textiles, art, metal goods

- The Sharabha have little use for money. Within tribes, everything is shared. Between tribes, gift-giving establishes relationships—you don't trade with strangers, you give gifts to friends and receive gifts in return.
- Hunts occur every few weeks, targeting the massive game that roams Azawahasi: elephants, great cats, enormous antelope. The hunts are communal events involving multiple families working together.
- Outsiders who want to trade must first establish themselves as friends through gift exchange. Merchants who try to conduct business without this social foundation are viewed with suspicion or contempt.
- The Sharabha produce exceptional leather goods, bone carvings, and beadwork. These items are valued trade goods for the few merchants who've learned how to work with Sharabha customs.

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: N/A

- The Sharabha have no standing army because they don't need one. Every adult can fight. Every adult has trained since childhood. Every adult can transform into a lion-like form with fangs and claws.
- Tribal conflicts are resolved through ritual combat, negotiation, or (rarely) small-scale skirmishes. Full warfare between tribes is almost unknown—the shared honor code makes atrocities unthinkable.
- When external threats arise, tribes coordinate rapidly. The goblin broods learned long ago that raiding Sharabha territory invites devastating retaliation. A coordinated Sharabha response is terrifying—dozens of lion-warriors hunting as a single pride.
- Individual Sharabha warriors are among the most dangerous fighters in the region. The combination of honor-driven fearlessness and lion transformation makes them lethal opponents.

### Geography

**Location**: Eastern portion of the transition zone between Ofrenia and southern Rimihuica

**Biomes**: Savanna, grassland, scattered forest, coastal plains

**Named Entities**: Plains of Eregnar, Forest of Esperanza, the Central Hills

**Rivers & Lakes**: Seasonal rivers, scattered watering holes that determine tribal movement patterns

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (east)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (nomadic)

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None permanent

**Villages**: Semi-permanent seasonal camps at reliable water sources

### Primary Conflicts

**The Generational Divide**

Young Sharabha increasingly leave their tribes to see the wider world. They return (if they return) with foreign ideas, foreign goods, and foreign attitudes. Elders view this as corruption—traditional ways being abandoned for flashy novelty. The young see it as growth and opportunity. The argument plays out in every tribe, with no resolution in sight.

**The Goblin Nuisance**

Scalawag goblins from the western plains occasionally raid Azawahasi territory. The raids are more annoying than threatening—the goblins can't stand against Sharabha warriors—but they disrupt hunts, steal supplies, and require responses that take warriors away from productive work.

**The Honor Paradox**

Sharabha honor code makes them excellent warriors but complicated diplomats. They struggle with societies that don't share their values—where oaths are broken, where gift-giving is seen as bribery, where reputation counts for nothing. Navigating the outside world without compromising their principles is an ongoing challenge.


### History

The Sharabha emerged on this land after Shara Bolasi's final battle against the titan Hykravones. The great lion father died, but his blood transformed the earth where it fell. Generations later, humans who settled this transformed land found themselves changing—becoming something new, something more.

The first Sharabha discovered their lion forms during times of great emotion—protecting loved ones, defending against predators, facing impossible odds. They learned to channel Shara Bolasi's legacy, to transform at will, to carry his courage in their blood.

For centuries, the Sharabha have lived as their ancestors did. Tribes follow the herds. Pride Circles define loyalty and obligation. Honor governs everything. The system works—Azawahasi has been stable while kingdoms rise and fall around it.

But stability isn't stagnation, and the Sharabha are changing whether the elders like it or not. Young warriors return from foreign lands with new ideas. Traders from the United Free Nations bring goods and concepts unknown to traditional culture. The world is getting smaller, and Azawahasi can't stay isolated forever.

The question isn't whether the Sharabha will change, but how—and whether they can preserve what matters while adapting to what's coming.

## Azuros

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 8,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Discipline, silence, respect, abstinence from pleasure

- Various subsects of the Shogi Monastery practice here in different monk groups. Each is managed by a head monk, who sits on the Council of the Silent Elders which oversees the mountain. All are taught by a mysterious figure known as the Rhea monk.
- Families are raised in simple stone houses built on the side of the mountain. Life is austere, contemplative, and governed by ritual.
- A large percentage of the population have attunements to air, due to the high altitude and powerful winds that constantly sweep the peaks. The monastery encourages this development.
- The order demands full devotion. Those who achieve mastery become something remarkable—able to walk on air, fly, call forth lightning. The greatest monks are legendary figures, spoken of in hushed tones across Alaria.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Air elemental masters (who leave to serve or teach elsewhere)

**Primary Imports**: None

- Azuros is little more than a collection of villages surrounding the monastery. There is almost no economy to speak of—the monks grow what they need and want nothing else.
- The monastery produces nothing for trade. Pilgrims occasionally bring gifts, which are accepted with humility and distributed to those in need.
- The only "export" is the monks themselves. Those who complete their training sometimes leave to serve as teachers, advisors, or guardians elsewhere. Their services are never purchased—they go where they feel called.

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: N/A

**Enrollment**: Forbidden

- The Azuros monks forbid violence. To become involved in a physical altercation is deeply shameful. The monastery has no warriors, no guards, no defenses.
- There is little wealth to steal from Azuros, and so no one bothers trying. The difficulty of reaching the monastery, combined with the absence of anything worth taking, makes it secure through irrelevance.
- That said, the most powerful monks could devastate armies if they chose. They don't choose. The threat is never spoken but universally understood.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Erpeus Island, the highest peaks

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, wind-scoured peaks, high meadows

**Named Entities**: Shogi Monastery, Devil's Crest (southern border)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Mountain streams, snowmelt pools

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (visible from the heights)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Shogi Monastery (no formal capital)

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Azur, Pul, and several unnamed settlements clinging to the mountainsides

### Primary Conflicts

**Isolation and Stagnation**

Traveling to Azuros is like traveling back in time. The monastery interacts so little with the outside world that it has fallen behind technologically and culturally. Some younger monks question whether complete isolation serves the order's true purpose—but questioning itself is discouraged.

**The Rhea Monk**

The mysterious figure who teaches the head monks is ancient, powerful, and increasingly absent. Some say the Rhea monk is dying. Others say they have transcended mortality entirely. The uncertainty creates quiet tension among the Council of Silent Elders.

**The Murder Hills**

The path to Azuros passes through Lier's Murder Hills, where bandits and worse prey on travelers. The monastery officially doesn't acknowledge the problem—violence is forbidden, and the monks won't fight even in self-defense. Pilgrims must fend for themselves.

**The World Encroaches**

Despite centuries of isolation, Azuros cannot remain untouched forever. Wars, magical catastrophes, and political upheavals across the Middle Sea send ripples that eventually reach even the highest peaks. Some monks have begun wondering whether withdrawal from the world is sustainable—or responsible.

### History

The Shogi Monastery was founded in an age before reliable records, by monks seeking a place where the wind blew pure and the world's distractions couldn't reach. They found the peaks of northern Erpeus and began building—simple stone structures that have survived centuries.

The monastery developed its techniques for working with air magic over generations, guided by the Rhea monk whose origins are lost to legend. Students learned to feel the wind as an extension of themselves, to ride the currents, eventually to become one with the element.

The order grew slowly. Those who couldn't commit to its demands left; those who remained became something extraordinary. The most powerful monks achieved abilities that looked like miracles—flight, lightning-calling, storm-speaking. They used these abilities only for contemplation and never for conflict.

Modern Azuros is much as it was centuries ago. The same stone houses. The same rituals. The same devotion to discipline and silence. The outside world has changed beyond recognition; Azuros hasn't changed at all. Whether this is wisdom or blindness depends on who you ask—but the monks don't ask, and don't answer.

## Balduahr

Tags: state

Inhabited by gray-stone dwarves. Citadel is to the west is a juicy target, but unattainable, as the hills are chalk full of giants.

## Bestacia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Democratic republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Goshwen (Hill Gnomes)

**Population**: 30,000

**Stability**: Stable (deteriorating)

**Core Values**: Freedom, invention, independence, gratitude

- Bestacia boasts one of the happiest populations on Alaria. Plentiful food, rewarding lifestyles, and a culture of gratitude and contentment.
- Notable for producing great scholars in art, philosophy, history, medicine, literature, and law. Education is widely valued; institutions here are among the finest.
- Goshwen are clever, inventive, good-natured. They've never built empires or started wars—they'd rather tinker and abstain from violence.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Research, inventions, trained scholars, legal expertise

**Primary Imports**: A little bit of nearly everything

- Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. Bestacian diplomats helped secure Myorna's membership, hoping it would deter war.
- The economy runs on intellectual output rather than raw materials or manufacturing.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Bestacian military is pitiful. Most Goshwen want nothing to do with war and would rather stay home working on inventions.
- What Bestacia lacks in military strength, it makes up for in intrigue. They have sharper minds than their neighbors and play the diplomatic game well—spies, information brokers, legal manipulation, and quiet influence.

### Geography

**Location**: Middle Sea coast, between Ubrik (east) and Watar (west), with mountains along the southern border

**Biomes**: Temperate forests, rolling hills, mountain ranges to the south

**Climate**: Mild and pleasant—good growing weather

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Petra

**Cities**: Petra, Kisoy

**Towns**: Pastrova (home to one of the best law schools in Alaria), various small settlements

### The Ghoul Problem

Bestacia's forests are infested with ghouls. These soulless undead—created by ancient wizards, driven by eternal hunger for flesh and magic—lurk in the woodlands and prey on travelers.

The gnomes barely tolerate this. They can't deal with it effectively—their military is too weak, and ghouls are difficult to kill without elemental mages. Ghoul hunters pass through occasionally, but the problem persists. Most Bestacians simply avoid the deep forests and hope the ghouls stay there.

This is not coexistence. Ghouls are monsters. But the gnomes lack the martial strength to exterminate them.

### The Southern Mountains

The mountain range along Bestacia's southern border separates the country from the Telphineas Strait. Kisoy sits just north of these mountains.

The mountains are home to all sorts of interesting creatures—the Goshwen have a fondness for exotic fauna, and the peaks have become something of a menagerie. Some creatures were brought here deliberately; others simply found the mountains hospitable and stayed.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Telphineas Strait**

South of the mountains lies the Telphineas Strait—a crucial trade chokepoint. Whoever controls it can impose tariffs on shipping and effectively win the economic game. Bestacia wants control but has limited access; the mountains block easy passage, and their military can't project force.

Watar also wants the strait. Tensions are escalating. Bestacia is playing the intrigue game—diplomatic pressure, trade agreements, legal maneuvering—while Watar has actual ships.

**The Ubrik Crisis**

Silvertongue incursions from Ubrik are hitting Bestacia's eastern border. Refugees are flooding in. The gnomes are sympathetic but overwhelmed—their tiny military can't stop the silvertongues, and their communities can't absorb unlimited refugees.

**Intellectual Sabotage**

Even in good times, competition for academic acclaim leads to theft and sabotage. Scholars steal research, claim credit for others' work, and undermine rivals. It's ugly, but contained.

**Alliance Strain**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Bestacia helped build it, but Camaran is isolating, Ubrik is collapsing, and the Watar tensions are worsening. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold things together.

### History

Bestacia was founded by Goshwen who wanted a peaceful place to think, invent, and live well. They succeeded—for centuries, it's been a quiet, prosperous republic where clever gnomes could pursue their interests without interference.

They never built a military because they never needed one. Neighbors fought each other; Bestacia stayed out of it. The forests acquired a ghoul problem at some point, but the gnomes learned to avoid the deep woods.

Now the peace is ending. Ubrik is vomiting refugees and monsters across the eastern border. Watar is pushing for control of the strait. The alliance is crumbling. Bestacia's greatest asset—its minds—may not be enough to navigate what's coming.

## Bonnetaz

Tags: state, city-state, sandreach, kuzagt

The city of salt and bone. Bonnetaz rises from the blinding white of the Salt Flats like a fever dream—towers of crystallized salt reinforced with ancient fossils, their surfaces carved in geometric patterns that catch the light. Beautiful from a distance. Up close, visitors notice the ornamentation is human bone.

The Kuzagt have ruled here for over a thousand years, since before humans arrived in significant numbers on this continent. They do not consider themselves cruel. They consider themselves practical. Humans breed quickly, die easily, and make excellent raw material. The Flats demand labor. The Kuzagt provide it.

To outsiders, Bonnetaz is a nightmare made functional—a slave state so methodical in its brutality that it has achieved a kind of terrible efficiency. To the Kuzagt themselves, they are simply harvesting a renewable resource.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchical council

**Primary Inhabitants**: Kuzagt (Bone Elves), humans (enslaved)

**Population**: ~12,000 Kuzagt; ~3,000 humans (city proper); ~40,000 humans (camps)

**Stability**: Extremely stable (unchanged for centuries)

**Core Values**: Efficiency, hierarchy, self-sufficiency, tradition

#### The Council of Thirteen

Thirteen bloodlines share power in Bonnetaz, each holding a hereditary seat on the ruling council. Succession within bloodlines varies by family tradition—some practice primogeniture, others allow siblings to assassinate each other for position, a few hold internal votes. The council itself operates by consensus; deadlocks are rare because Kuzagt take the long view. A matter that cannot be resolved today may resolve itself in a decade.

The council meets in the Pale Spire, the tallest structure in Bonnetaz. Sessions are closed to non-Kuzagt, and decisions are announced rather than debated publicly. Outsiders attempting to observe council proceedings have historically not been seen again.

The current council has remained stable for nearly a century—unusually long even by Kuzagt standards. Some attribute this to prosperity. Others whisper that certain elder members have discovered methods of extending their already considerable lifespans beyond natural limits.

#### Rank and Display

Kuzagt society is rigidly hierarchical, and rank is literally embedded in the face. All Kuzagt possess distinctive bony protrusions from their cheekbones—the source of their common name. These protrusions serve as mounting points for gems that denote status:

- **Unadorned**: Common citizens, laborers, craftspeople
- **Garnets, amber, jade**: Minor nobility, successful merchants, professional overseers
- **Sapphires, rubies**: Council families and their close relatives
- **Diamonds**: Council members themselves, arranged in patterns denoting specific lineages

Attempting to wear gems above one's station is punishable by death. The Kuzagt take hierarchy seriously.

#### The Human Population

Humans in Bonnetaz fall into three categories:

**The Camps**: Approximately forty thousand slaves labor in the underground warrens radiating outward from the city. They extract salt, maintain tunnels, process raw materials, and die. Life expectancy in the camps averages eight to twelve years.

**City Servants**: Perhaps three thousand humans work within Bonnetaz proper—domestic servants, skilled craftspeople, entertainers, and specialists too valuable to waste on camp labor. Their status falls between slave and citizen: permitted certain freedoms, even paid wages, but never permitted to leave. Many were born in this role; their parents were too useful to send to the camps, and they inherited that usefulness.

**Outsiders**: Foreign merchants, sailors, and traders pass through on business. They are housed in designated quarters, permitted access to trading halls, and forbidden from most of the city. Those who violate the rules are... reassigned.

### Religion & Culture

#### The Long Perspective

Kuzagt live for centuries. This shapes everything about their culture.

They do not rush. A decision that will matter in fifty years receives fifty years of consideration. Their art emphasizes permanence—bone and salt and lacquered stone, materials that endure. Their grudges endure similarly. A Kuzagt offended today may wait three human generations before seeking revenge.

This patience makes them profoundly alien to shorter-lived species. Kuzagt find human urgency amusing, dwarven grudge-keeping amateurish, and elven detachment insufficiently practical. They alone, in their view, have achieved the correct balance: passionate enough to act, patient enough to act correctly.

#### Blood and Bone

The Kuzagt drink fermented blood—not for sustenance but for ritual and pleasure. The best vintages are aged for decades in bone vessels, developing complex flavors that younger races cannot appreciate. Sharing blood wine signifies trust; refusing it signifies either insult or wisdom, depending on context.

Human leather appears throughout Kuzagt material culture: robes for the elite, book bindings, decorative elements. The Kuzagt see nothing wrong with this. Humans die; their materials remain useful. Waste offends them more than death.

#### The Calendar of Bones

The Kuzagt maintain their own calendar independent of Alarian standard, though they are aware of external dating for trade purposes. Their year is divided by the ossification of specific creatures—a cycle based on how long various bones take to properly cure. This makes their ceremonies incomprehensible to outsiders and precisely timed for them.

Major observances include:

- **The Harvest Festival**: Celebrating the annual intake of new slaves, held when the camps' population reaches its annual peak
- **The Rendering**: A ceremony of death and transformation, where the previous year's deceased (Kuzagt and significant humans alike) are processed into materials
- **The Pale Dawn**: A three-day period when the Salt Flats' reflected light creates unusual optical effects, considered auspicious for major decisions

### Economy

**Size**: Medium (regionally significant)

**Tech**: Developed (specialized)

**Primary Exports**: Salt (numerous specialized grades), bone crafts, alchemical compounds, preserved goods

**Primary Imports**: Slaves, food, water, metals, luxury goods

#### The Salt Trade

Not all salt is equal. The Kuzagt have identified dozens of distinct varieties based on mineral content, crystal structure, and depth of excavation:

- **White Salt**: Common table salt, the bulk of exports
- **Preservation Salt**: High mineral content, extends food freshness significantly
- **Ritual Salt**: Specific grades used in magical practices, commands premium prices
- **Poison Salt**: Toxic to specific creatures—fae, certain undead, particular demon types
- **Blood Salt**: Produced through proprietary processes involving human blood; used in Deoric rituals

This specialization represents centuries of accumulated expertise. Competitors can produce salt; they cannot produce the *right* salt for specific purposes. This knowledge base is Bonnetaz's true wealth.

#### The Ivory Hand

Bonnetaz does not acquire slaves directly. The Kuzagt consider such work beneath them—hunting, capturing, transporting, all terribly undignified. Instead, they purchase through the Ivory Hand merchant network.

The Hand maintains permanent representatives in the city, handling logistics while the Kuzagt focus on "productive employment." Several Bonnetaz merchants hold Ivory Hand membership themselves, participating in the organization's broader activities—including supplying sacrificial subjects for Deoric rituals across Alaria.

The Kuzagt officially disapprove of Deoric magic. They accept payment for "specialized inventory" without asking questions.

### Military

**Size**: Small (defensive focus)

**Quality**: High (specialized)

**Enrollment**: Professional only

#### The Salt Guard

Bonnetaz maintains no standing army in the traditional sense. Why would they? The Flats themselves are defense enough. Any invading force must cross a hundred miles of salt—no water, no shade, no shelter—while the Kuzagt simply wait.

The Salt Guard instead focuses on internal security: controlling the slave population, protecting trade routes, and enforcing the council's will. Approximately two thousand Kuzagt serve in this capacity, organized into specialized units:

- **The Pale Watch**: City security and camp oversight
- **The Bone Wardens**: Elite enforcers who handle "sensitive" problems
- **The Salt Sailors**: Naval forces protecting maritime approaches

#### Defensive Doctrine

If enemies somehow reached Bonnetaz, the city would descend into its tunnels. The underground network extends for miles, stocked with supplies sufficient for years. The Kuzagt would wait out any siege while the Flats killed the besiegers.

No one has tested this doctrine. The Kuzagt consider this proof of its effectiveness.

### Geography

**Location**: Salt Flats, northeastern Sandreach

**Biomes**: Salt flat, coastal desert

**Named Regions**: Salt Flats, Bone Hills

**Adjacent Waters**: Gindrik Sea

The city itself stands on the coast where the Salt Flats meet the Gindrik Sea—the only reliable water access in the region. The harbor is modest by continental standards but essential for trade.

Behind the city, the Flats extend south and west for a hundred miles before rising into the Bone Hills and eventually the Luquihn Desert proper. This terrain provides natural defense and natural resources: salt from the Flats, fossils and minerals from the Hills.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Bonnetaz (city-state, sole settlement)

**Major Facilities**: The Camps (distributed underground network)

**Key Locations**: The Pale Spire (council seat), the Harbor Quarter (trade), the Bone Hills (mining operations)

### Relations

**Ethadia**: Primary trading partner. Ethadian ships carry Kuzagt salt to markets that would never deal with Bonnetaz directly. Both parties profit. Neither discusses the moral implications.

**Gorath**: Mutual contempt. The Kuzagt view Gorathi slavery as crude, wasteful, and vulgar. Gorath views Bonnetaz as too distant and too entrenched to be worth conquering. They ignore each other.

**The Ivory Hand**: Essential partnership. The Hand supplies slaves; Bonnetaz supplies specialized goods and asks no questions about their ultimate use.

**The Free Isles**: Occasional trading, carefully managed. Many Isles populations include escaped slaves, which creates awkwardness. Bonnetaz merchants visiting the Isles do not discuss their city's economy.

### History

The Kuzagt arrived on the Salt Flats over a thousand years ago, fleeing some catastrophe in their original homeland that they do not discuss with outsiders. They found the Flats hostile but habitable—brutal summers, flooding winters, and no competition for resources.

For centuries they were a minor settlement, harvesting salt for their own use and trading small quantities with passing ships. The arrival of humans on the continent changed everything. The Kuzagt recognized a resource: abundant, replaceable, and useful.

The slave camps expanded gradually. First dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of humans labored beneath the salt. Bonnetaz grew wealthy. The council ossified into its current form. The Kuzagt achieved what they consider their ideal state: stable, prosperous, and permanent.

They see no reason to change.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Council's Secret**: How have the eldest council members survived so long? Rumors suggest the Weeping Vein—a preservative substance from the Bone Hills—can extend elven lifespans indefinitely when properly applied. But the process may require... fresh materials.

**The Underground Railroad**: Slaves occasionally escape despite impossible odds. Someone is running an escape network through the camps. The council wants them found—and made an example.

**Castle Alexandr**: The mysterious fortress on the promontory has defeated every attempt at occupation. The Kuzagt know something about what lies beneath it. They are not sharing.

**The Ivory Hand's Request**: The Hand wants something the council hasn't provided before—a specific type of "inventory" for a specific ritual. The council is debating whether the price is worth the implications.

**The Walking Bones**: Excavations in the Bone Hills sometimes uncover fossils that resist extraction. Bones that move when unobserved. The Kuzagt have learned which sites to avoid. Lately, the avoidance zones are growing.

## Breia

Tags: state

Golden skinned sky-knights. Numerous towers in the sky, interconnected city built on towers. Higher nobility ride on griffin. Harvest water from the clouds (no water down below). Had city Shtaneres until Hermelia burned it to the ground and fled.

Inhabited by the Inavolin.

Noble, intelligent.

### Shtaneres


Once a great city of Breia. However, Hermelia worked there, got pissed, and burned the entire thing down.

## Bynü Island Tribes

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Tribal confederation (barely)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Xicrein elves

**Population**: ~15,000 (scattered across hundreds of islands)

**Stability**: Stable through isolation (outsiders don't survive long enough to cause instability)

**Core Values**: Ancestral territory, twilight sovereignty, the killing of intruders

The Bynü Islands exist in permanent dusk. A magical phenomenon—or curse, depending on who you ask—shrouds this archipelago in eternal twilight. The sun never fully rises here; the stars never fully emerge. The Xicrein elves who call these islands home have adapted to this half-light over millennia.

They've also adapted to defending it.

The Xicrein are not negotiators. They do not trade. They do not allow visitors. Ships that enter Bynü waters without permission are attacked without warning. Survivors are not taken. The islands have earned their reputation through consistent, merciless violence against outsiders.

This isn't xenophobia born of ignorance—the Xicrein know exactly what the outside world offers. They've decided they don't want it.

### The Xicrein

The twilight elves of Bynü are visually distinct from their cousins elsewhere in Alaria. Their skin is pale gray to deep charcoal. Their eyes are enormous, adapted to the perpetual dimness—solid black orbs that unsettle even other elves. They move silently, see in near-darkness, and have spent generations perfecting the art of killing things that don't belong.

Xicrein culture revolves around the islands themselves. Each major island has a tribe; each tribe has territory; territorial boundaries are sacred. Inter-tribal conflicts are resolved through ritual—elaborate negotiations, formal duels, or seasonal wars fought with strict rules. But these rules don't apply to outsiders.

Outsiders have no status. They're not enemies to negotiate with—they're vermin to exterminate.

### The Twilight

No one knows why the Bynü Islands exist in permanent dusk. Theories range from ancient magical catastrophe to deliberate elven artifice to the influence of entities from other planes.

The twilight is real and constant. Ships approaching the islands watch the sun dim as they cross an invisible boundary. The transition takes perhaps an hour; by the time you're among the islands proper, it's perpetual half-night.

This affects everything. The ecology runs on twilight cycles—plants that never need full sun, animals that hunt in eternal dimness. The Xicrein have adapted completely; their eyes, their hunting patterns, their entire way of life assumes the sun will never truly rise.

Visitors (the rare ones who survive) find the twilight disorienting. Humans lose track of time. Sleep cycles collapse. The psychological pressure of endless dusk has broken more than one expedition.

### The Islands

The Bynü archipelago consists of perhaps a hundred significant islands and countless smaller ones. The terrain is dramatic: massive dark rocks with overhanging cliffs, forests of black-leafed palm trees, caves and grottos carved by eternal tides.

The water is dark. Not polluted—just dark, absorbing light rather than reflecting it. Even at the surface, you can't see more than a few feet down. This makes naval combat terrifying. Xicrein warriors attack from beneath, using the darkness as cover.

### The Tribes

Each major tribe controls a cluster of islands and maintains its own traditions within the broader Xicrein culture:

**The Cliffdwellers**: Occupy the northern islands, living in cave complexes carved into sea cliffs. They're the most likely to encounter (and kill) approaching ships.

**The Deeproot**: Central islands, forest-dwelling. Their territory is the most densely vegetated; they hunt from the trees.

**The Tidewatchers**: Southern islands, semi-aquatic. They spend as much time in the dark water as on land. Their warriors can hold their breath for disturbing lengths of time.

**The Stonetongue**: Eastern islands, keepers of oral tradition. They maintain the histories and laws that bind the tribes together.

**The Nightsingers**: Western islands, practitioners of a form of sound-based magic that works best in darkness. Their songs can disorient, terrify, or kill.

### Why So Hostile?

The Xicrein weren't always this violent toward outsiders. Old records from other nations describe occasional trade, diplomatic contact, even alliances.

Then something happened. The Xicrein call it **The Violation**—an event perhaps three centuries ago that they refuse to discuss with outsiders. Whatever occurred, it transformed Xicrein policy from wariness to extermination.

Scholars speculate about slaving raids, magical exploitation, or religious desecration. The Xicrein won't say. They'll only demonstrate, repeatedly, that the Bynü Islands are not for outsiders.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (self-sufficient)

**Tech**: Standard elven craftsmanship, specialized for twilight conditions

**Primary Exports**: None (deliberate isolation)

**Primary Imports**: None (deliberate isolation)

The Xicrein don't trade. They take what they need from the sea, the land, and the rare ships foolish enough to enter their waters. Salvage from wrecked vessels provides metal, cloth, and other materials the islands don't produce.

This isn't poverty—the islands provide abundantly. Fish are plentiful. Twilight-adapted plants yield food and materials. The Xicrein simply don't need or want what outsiders offer.

### Military

**Size**: The entire population

**Quality**: Exceptional in their environment

**Enrollment**: Universal (every Xicrein learns to fight)

Every adult Xicrein can fight. There's no professional military because there's no civilian population—the distinction doesn't exist. Children learn to kill intruders alongside learning to fish and farm.

Xicrein warfare is built around the twilight advantage. They see perfectly in the dimness; their enemies don't. They know every current, every rock, every shadow. They attack silently from unexpected directions. They don't negotiate surrender.

**Tactics:**
- Ships are swarmed by warriors in small boats or simply swimming
- Intruders on land are stalked through the forests, picked off one by one
- The Nightsingers use sonic magic to disorient and terrify
- Bodies are left on the boundary as warnings

### Geography

**Location**: Western Shattered Sea, west of Knova

**Biomes**: Twilight-adapted island ecology

**Climate**: Mild, humid, perpetually dim

**Named Features**: The individual islands aren't named on outsider maps—the Xicrein don't share that information

### Political Geography

**No Capital**: The tribes have no central authority. They cooperate against external threats and resolve internal disputes through tradition, but no one rules the Bynü Islands.

**Tribal Territories**: Each tribe's boundaries are precisely defined and fiercely defended—against other tribes as much as outsiders.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Boundary Debates**

Where does Bynü territory end? The Xicrein claim waters that other nations consider open sea. Ships passing "too close" have been attacked. No one agrees on where the line is—except the Xicrein, who won't say.

**The Memory of Violation**

Whatever happened three centuries ago still shapes Xicrein policy. Some younger elves question whether permanent isolation serves the people. Elders respond that the outside world proved itself untrustworthy. The debate is private—but it exists.

**The Nightsinger Question**

The Nightsinger tribe's magic has been growing stronger. Some other tribes worry about the balance of power shifting. Nightsinger influence could unite the islands—or tear them apart.

### Notable Figures

Outsiders don't know Xicrein names. The tribes don't introduce themselves before killing visitors. Any information about Xicrein leadership comes from old records, prisoner interrogations (rare), or speculation.

**The Cliffdweller Matriarch** — Reportedly the oldest living Xicrein, she supposedly remembers events before the Violation. She doesn't speak to outsiders.

**The Nightsinger Chorus** — The Nightsinger tribe is led by a council of their strongest sonic mages. How many, no one outside knows.

### History

**The Settling**: Xicrein elves arrived in the Bynü Islands in deep antiquity. Whether they caused the twilight or found it, no one outside knows.

**The Open Period**: For most of recorded history, the Bynü had limited but real contact with the outside world. Trade was possible. Diplomacy existed.

**The Violation** (~300 years ago): Something happened. The Xicrein closed their borders and began killing anyone who crossed them. They've maintained this policy ever since.

**The Present**: The Bynü Islands remain isolated, hostile, and mysterious. Ships avoid them. Scholars speculate about them. The Xicrein continue killing anyone who enters uninvited.

### What Players Might Want

- **The Violation's Truth**: What actually happened? Could revealing it change Xicrein policy?
- **Xicrein Artifacts**: The twilight islands produce unique materials. Getting them requires surviving the Xicrein.
- **First Contact**: Could someone actually make peaceful contact? What would it take?
- **The Twilight Source**: What causes the perpetual dusk? Could it be replicated—or ended?

## Camaran

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Purity, law, order

- The High Camarik Council makes all laws and determines policy. Council seats are technically elected, but in practice controlled by wealthy manufacturing families.
- Camarans are industrious, educated, and deeply suspicious of anything they cannot control—particularly magic that comes from within rather than from the elements.
- Protestant work-ethic culture: idleness is shameful, debt is sin, and success is proof of moral worth. The flip side is a rigid class system where poverty implies moral failing.

### Magic Laws

All varieties of Deoric magic are banned in Camaran. It is seen as corrupting—magic that comes from within the self rather than channeled from external elements is considered spiritually polluting.

- **Hand magic**: If caught practicing, your hand is cut off. Repeat offenders lose the other hand.
- **Elemental magic**: Permitted with a license. Must register at Rathscar or voluntarily quarantine upon arrival by ship until approved.
- **Unlicensed magic**: Enormous fines, or jail time if you cannot pay.

The licensing system is bureaucratic nightmare—forms in triplicate, inspections, annual renewals, restrictions on where and when you can practice. Many mages simply avoid Camaran entirely.

### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Very developed

**Primary Exports**: Manufactured goods, textiles, precision instruments, clockwork

**Primary Imports**: Raw materials, ore, timber, food

- Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though becoming increasingly isolationist—threatening the alliance's stability.
- Camaran has a highly educated and industrious population. They produce non-magical manufactured goods used across Alaria: tools, furniture, textiles, clockwork mechanisms, weapons.
- Some of the best schools in the world are located here—strict and rigorous, producing skilled craftsmen, engineers, and bureaucrats.
- Vetoed Echea's membership in the Trade Alliance (reasons unclear, likely political).

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Camarik military is not particularly powerful, but their population is substantial and they can raise a large army quickly if needed.
- Military service is seen as civic duty—another form of productive labor for the state.

### Geography

**Location**: Northwest of Adron, south of the Kharvorn Mountains, west of the Breidlheiss Basin

**Biomes**: Temperate farmland, rolling hills, river valleys, mountain foothills

**Climate**: Temperate continental—cold winters, warm summers, reliable rainfall

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Rathscar

**Cities**: Rathscar, several manufacturing towns along the rivers

**Towns**: Scattered agricultural and mining settlements

### Primary Conflicts

**The Giant Question**

East of Camaran lies the Breidlheiss Basin, home to giants. The Camarik position is that giants are dangerous, unpredictable, and must be contained. In practice, this means Camaran runs mining operations in the basin's foothills—technically giant territory—extracting ore while insisting the giants have no legitimate claim to land they "aren't civilized enough to develop."

When giants object (sometimes violently), Camaran retaliates with punitive military expeditions. The cycle continues: Camaran encroaches, giants push back, Camaran calls it "unprovoked aggression" and takes more territory as "security buffer."

Some Camarans—particularly those who trade with the Ngül Mountain communities where Kimril and Güli giants coexist peacefully—understand the giants aren't inherently hostile. But acknowledging this would mean admitting Camaran's mining expansion is the problem, which would threaten powerful economic interests.

**Internal Tensions**

- Council members who want to relax or repeal the magic bans, arguing they put Camaran at a competitive disadvantage.
- Massive wealth disparity between manufacturing families and workers. The rhetoric of "moral success" keeps the lower classes blaming themselves rather than the system.
- Growing isolationism straining the Aldriktch Trade Alliance—some council members want to leave entirely.

### History

**The Deoric Ban**

Three centuries ago, Camaran was ruled by a Deoric sorcerer-king named Valdric the Beloved. He was genuinely popular—charismatic, generous, seemingly benevolent. For forty years, he guided Camaran to prosperity.

Then the truth emerged: Valdric had been using psy-magic to manipulate the entire population. Every citizen's loyalty, every feeling of contentment, every memory of his "benevolent" rule—manufactured. When a foreign mage broke the enchantment, Camaran experienced collective psychological trauma on a national scale. People couldn't trust their own memories. Families discovered their relationships had been artificially constructed. The suicide rate spiked for a generation.

The revolution that followed was brutal. Valdric was executed (slowly), and the new republic instituted absolute bans on Deoric magic—any magic that comes from within, that could touch the mind or soul. Elemental magic, which channels external forces, was deemed acceptable because it cannot directly manipulate a person's inner self.

Three hundred years later, the trauma has faded into cultural assumption. Most Camarans don't know *why* Deoric magic is evil—they just know it is. The bureaucratic licensing system has become self-perpetuating, a jobs program for inspectors and a revenue stream from fines.

## Chaal Nazzerox

Tags: state, undead, empire

The undead empire of southern Terrenia, ruled by the lich king Xynoth Azkonor from his rotting capital at Emnatt Nazzerath. Approximately ninety-five percent of the population are undead—shadow-bound corpses with no spirit, no will, and no purpose except what their master commands. The remaining five percent are living collaborators: the cruel, the desperate, and the mad who have chosen service over death.

Chaal Nazzerox was once a prosperous agricultural region, its rivers carrying grain to markets across Terrenia. That ended when Xynoth rose. Now the rivers carry corpses and slave barges, the fields are tended by shambling dead under living overseers, and the cities crumble because no one remembers how to maintain them.

The empire is contained—for now. Sea to the west, mountains to the south, hostile forces to the east, and living nations to the north. Every year, Xynoth probes these barriers. Every year, he comes a little closer to breaking through.

---

### Government

#### The Lich King

**Xynoth Azkonor** rules absolutely. His word is law. His will animates the dead. Without him—or, more precisely, without the fragment of spirit that remains after centuries of death and rebirth—the undead would collapse into purposeless heaps.

Xynoth was human once, a necromancer of considerable power who sought immortality through lichdom. He achieved it, but lichdom is not free. Each time a lich dies and reforms, their spirit fragments—a piece lost, a piece changed. Xynoth has died many times. What remains is barely recognizable as the man he was. Whether he remembers his original motivations is unclear; whether they would matter anymore is doubtful.

The lich king rules from a citadel in Emnatt Nazzerath, emerging rarely but seeing much through the eyes of his dead servants. He does not eat, sleep, or engage in the activities of the living. He plans. He experiments. He waits.

#### The Living Elite

The five percent of living population are not slaves—they are collaborators, elevated above the masses in exchange for service. These are overseers, administrators, specialists whose skills the dead cannot replicate. They manage the living slaves, maintain what infrastructure survives, and compete viciously for the lich king's favor.

The living elite are not organized into formal houses or factions. Alliances form and dissolve based on immediate advantage. Trust is rare; betrayal is expected. The only constant is that everyone serves Xynoth, and everyone fears becoming unnecessary.

Some collaborators are true believers who worship the lich king as a god or see undeath as evolution. Others are pragmatists doing whatever survival requires. A few are biding their time, hoping for an opportunity that may never come. All of them are damned in the eyes of the living world outside.

#### The Undead Mass

Ninety-five percent of Chaal Nazzerox's population are animated corpses—shadows bound to dead flesh, with no spirit to provide consciousness or will. They are tools, not people. They follow commands with literal precision, lack initiative or creativity, and "mill aimlessly when not directed."

The undead hierarchy reflects this. Most are simple laborers or soldiers: shambling corpses capable of basic tasks and basic violence. Above them are the preserved—corpses maintained in better condition, capable of more complex work. At the top are the intelligent undead: revenants who retained their spirits, liches who followed Xynoth's path, and stranger things that serve for reasons of their own.

All undead ultimately answer to Xynoth. Without his will binding them, they would collapse. This makes him both the empire's greatest strength and its critical vulnerability.

---

### Settlements

#### Emnatt Nazzerath

The capital city, seat of the lich king. Once the grandest city in southern Terrenia; now a rotting monument to death's triumph over life.

The streets are choked with shambling dead—soldiers between assignments, laborers awaiting tasks, corpses that simply stopped and never moved again. The buildings decay because no one repairs them; roofs collapse, walls crumble, infrastructure fails. The living elite maintain their own compounds through constant effort, islands of functionality in a sea of rot.

At the city's heart rises Xynoth's citadel, a tower of black stone that predates the empire. Some say he built it; others claim he found it and made it his. The citadel never decays. It never changes. It watches.

The living population clusters in the merchant quarter, where food and goods still change hands. Slaves are bought and sold here. So are services, information, and favors. Everyone is for sale in Emnatt Nazzerath—including the buyers.

#### Gorvul Mkayin

A city on the southern shore of Deadman's Lake, built to control the one body of water where corpses stay dead. The empire disapproves of wasted resources, and every body dropped into Deadman's Lake is a soldier denied.

Gorvul Mkayin processes arrivals from the northern territories—slaves, tribute, captured refugees. The living elite here are particularly brutal; they earned their positions through demonstrated cruelty. The city also serves as a staging ground for campaigns against the holdouts, its position allowing rapid deployment in multiple directions.

The lake's strange property—preventing undead animation—has made Gorvul Mkayin a center for covert disposal. Living residents sometimes pay enormous bribes to have their dead relatives dropped into the lake rather than conscripted. The authorities take the bribes and make no promises.

#### Sklevyurn

A northern city serving as the empire's primary military staging area. Armies mass here before marching south against the holdouts or probing the northern borders. Smithies work slave labor to arm the dead—not that undead need much equipment, but Xynoth believes in overwhelming force.

Sklevyurn is grim, functional, and joyless. Even by the standards of Chaal Nazzerox, the atmosphere oppresses. The living here exist to serve military logistics; there is no pretense of normal life. Rations are distributed, quotas are met, and the war machine grinds forward.

#### Parthemylos

An eastern city that serves as the empire's administrative hub—taxes, census, supply allocation, the bureaucratic machinery that keeps even an undead empire functioning. The living elite here are clerks and accountants, tracking resources that the dead cannot count themselves.

Parthemylos maintains the empire's records, such as they are. Population counts (living and dead), tribute schedules, military deployments, slave inventories. The archives are a mess—the dead make poor record-keepers, and the living have more pressing concerns than organization—but they exist, and occasionally prove useful.

#### Pyaal Faras

A southwestern city near Hagswood, maintaining an uncomfortable proximity to the hag coven. Pyaal Faras serves as the point of contact between the empire and the hags—whatever arrangement exists between them, it's administered here.

The city has an undeserved reputation for commerce. Goods flow through Pyaal Faras that aren't available elsewhere in the empire: hag-brewed potions, items from the Strait of Curses, things better not examined closely. The living elite here are traders and intermediaries, people comfortable dealing with monsters.

#### Eyovlix

A southeastern town on the Melkron River, serving as the empire's forward base for campaigns against the Crystal Mountains. Undead armies stage here before their endless, grinding assaults on the mountain passes.

Eyovlix is less a settlement than a military camp that never disbanded. The living population exists to support operations—healers for the wounded (living soldiers do fight alongside the dead), quartermasters, engineers attempting to solve the problem of moving shambling armies through mountain terrain. Progress is slow.

---

### The Holdouts

Two significant settlements within the empire's claimed territory have never fallen: the Gray Citadel and Melthrayn. Both are under constant pressure but have held for years. Their continued existence is an embarrassment to Xynoth and a symbol of hope for those who resist.

#### Gray Citadel

A fortress in the Steed Hills, originally built to guard against threats from the south. When Xynoth rose, the citadel's garrison refused to surrender. They've been refusing ever since.

The Gray Citadel's survival owes to terrain, construction, and desperation. The Steed Hills are difficult for shambling armies to traverse. The fortress walls were built thick and have been reinforced with everything available. The defenders know that surrender means death or worse—they fight because there is no alternative.

The citadel is overcrowded with refugees, undersupplied by occasional smuggler convoys, and perpetually on the edge of starvation. Commanders debate whether to hold or attempt a breakout. Neither option offers good odds. They hold because holding is all they can do.

#### Melthrayn

A walled city-state in the eastern reaches that has somehow resisted incorporation into the empire. Unlike the Gray Citadel, Melthrayn is not just a fortress—it's a functioning city with farms within its walls, industries, a civilian population living something approaching normal lives.

How Melthrayn has survived is unclear. Theories include powerful wards, alliance with unknown powers, leverage over Xynoth himself, or simply that the lich king hasn't committed the resources to take it. The city's rulers don't explain, and visitors (what few there are) report a population that doesn't discuss the matter.

Refugees who reach Melthrayn rarely leave. Whether this is because they've found safety or because they're not permitted to leave is another question without answers.

### Military

The empire's military strength is simple: numbers without limit and soldiers that never tire, never flee, and never stop. An undead army is not particularly skilled or adaptive, but it doesn't need to be. It just keeps coming.

**Shambling hordes**: The bulk of the army. Animated corpses capable of basic weapon use and basic tactics—advance, attack, repeat. They're slow, clumsy, and easily confused by complex terrain. But there are so many.

**Preserved soldiers**: Better-maintained corpses, faster and more durable. These form elite units for specialized tasks.

**Siege forces**: The undead are natural siege troops. They don't need food, don't need rest, and don't care about casualties. They simply assault until the walls fall or they're destroyed.

**Living auxiliaries**: Some living soldiers serve the empire voluntarily—mercenaries, fanatics, those who've chosen the winning side. They provide tactical flexibility the dead lack.

**Command structure**: Intelligent undead and living commanders direct the mindless masses. Without direction, undead armies stall. Kill the commanders, and the assault fragments.

---

### Economy

Chaal Nazzerox produces almost nothing. The empire survives through:

**Slave agriculture**: Living slaves work fields to feed the living population. The undead don't eat, but their masters do.

**Plunder**: What the empire can't produce, it takes. Neighboring regions have been stripped; now the pickings are thin.

**Tribute**: Conquered populations pay in food, goods, and bodies. The Brevldorf Hills communities survive through this arrangement.

**Hag trade**: Whatever the Hagswood coven provides, it has value. Pyaal Faras facilitates exchange.

The economy is unsustainable. Without expansion, the empire will eventually consume itself. This is why Xynoth probes the borders constantly—he needs new resources, new slaves, new corpses.

---

### Travel

Nearly all travel is by river. The ground is soft—waterlogged, unstable, unsuitable for roads. The rivers are Chaal Nazzerox's highways, and whoever controls them controls movement.

The undead can wade through soft ground, but slowly. Living travelers without boat access are effectively immobile. This has shaped the empire's geography, concentrating power along riverbanks and leaving the interior accessible only to those willing to struggle.

Outsiders attempting to enter or leave Chaal Nazzerox face significant challenges. The rivers are patrolled. The overland routes are watched. The borders are guarded by things that don't sleep. Refugees still escape—through the Frowning Forest, down the Yephrenzi River, over the Prowling Hills—but the price is high.

---

### Relations

**Aal Salma**: The merchant nation to the northwest watches the empire with alarm. Refugees cross their border constantly. War seems inevitable, but neither side has struck.

**Windor**: The halfling nation further north has sealed its borders. No trade, no contact, no acknowledgment that the undead exist. This is official policy; unofficially, halfling smugglers make fortunes running goods to holdout forces.

**Poum Titch**: Currently tearing itself apart in civil war, which has distracted Xynoth from northern expansion. The lich king may be waiting for the war to end—whoever wins will be weakened.

**The Crystal Mountains**: Whatever lies beyond is defended. The mountain peoples have held the passes for years. Xynoth's armies assault and die and assault again.

**The Hagswood Coven**: An arrangement of unclear terms. The hags and the lich tolerate each other. No one knows why.

---

### What Makes It Dangerous

- **The dead keep coming**: Every defender who falls becomes an enemy. Attrition favors the empire absolutely.
- **Xynoth sees through his servants**: Surveillance is everywhere. The dead report to their master.
- **No conventional victory**: Kill every soldier, and Xynoth raises more. Destroy every city, and the empire operates from ruins. Only destroying Xynoth himself—and his phylacteries, wherever they are—ends the threat.
- **Containment is failing**: The barriers that hold the empire are weakening. The Crystal Mountain defenders lose ground each year. The northern states are distracted by their own problems.
- **The lich is patient**: Xynoth has been planning for centuries. Whatever he's waiting for, it's coming.

## Chechol

Tags: state

A landlocked state in Central Aboyinzu, wedged between the Deadloop inner sea to the north and the Dalizi Confederation to the south. Chechol is defined by its three river valleys, its significant Rentar minotaur population, and two sites of immense spiritual power: the Pyramid of Five Sides and the School of Summoning.

From a distance, Chechol appears unremarkable—a modest agricultural state, quieter than its neighbors, known for exporting grain and pious mercenaries. Visitors who stay longer notice something harder to name. The Rentar here move with unusual certainty. Decisions are made quickly, without debate, as if everyone already knows the answer. The human population has grown quieter over the past generation, deferential in ways that feel learned rather than natural.

Something is deeply wrong in Chechol. Most of its residents don't know it yet.

### Government

**The River Duchy**

Chechol is officially ruled by **Duke Yelen Vorotny** from the capital of Sevich, the fourth duke of the Vorotny line. The duchy predates the Rentar arrival by centuries, and the ducal institution remains formally supreme—the Duke commands the army, levies taxes, and represents Chechol to foreign powers.

In practice, Duke Yelen makes no significant decision without consulting the **Council of Elders**, a body of senior Rentar spiritual leaders. This has been true for three generations. The Vorotny dukes consider it wisdom—why wouldn't you seek divine guidance when it's available? The Rentar consider it proper—they are vessels of celestial truth, and secular rulers should acknowledge that.

The problem is that the Council's guidance has been subtly corrupted for decades. The Elders don't know this. Duke Yelen doesn't know this. The decisions they make feel right, feel divinely inspired, but they've been steering Chechol toward an end none of them would choose.

**The Three River Councils**

Below the duchy, each river valley maintains its own local council:
- **Chechik Council** (Sevich, Astopol, Pyadrov) — the political heart
- **Stulov Council** (Stulovka, Yeletity) — agricultural backbone
- **Riki Council** (Prozny and surrounding settlements) — closest to the School of Summoning

These councils handle local governance and traditionally sent representatives to the Duke. Now they increasingly defer to whichever Rentar monastery is nearest.

### Culture

**Two Peoples, One Faith (They Think)**

Chechol's population is roughly 60% human, 40% Rentar minotaur, but cultural influence doesn't track with numbers. Humans farm the river valleys and staff the towns. Rentar occupy the highlands between rivers, maintaining monasteries and temples. Over generations, the relationship has shifted from coexistence to hierarchy—humans defer to Rentar on matters of spirit, morality, and increasingly, politics.

This isn't resented, exactly. Most humans in Chechol grew up with Rentar neighbors and genuinely believe in their spiritual insight. The Rentar aren't cruel or exploitative. They simply... know things. They receive guidance. They share that guidance generously.

What the humans have begun to notice—without quite articulating it—is that the Rentar have changed. Their grandparents' generation was contemplative, patient, fond of long debates about theological nuance. Today's Rentar are certain. They know the right answer immediately. Disagreement makes them uncomfortable. Questions make them defensive.

The Rentar notice nothing wrong. This is simply what faith feels like when it matures.

**The Pyramid and the School: Two Paths**

Chechol hosts two centers of spiritual power, and understanding their distinction is essential to understanding the coming catastrophe.

The **Pyramid of Five Sides** is ancient, predating human settlement. It's a genuine gateway to Celestia—a four-sided pyramid whose fifth face exists only on the celestial plane. Those who meditate within its shadow can receive true divine inspiration. The Rentar who tend the Pyramid are the purest practitioners of their faith, and they are—so far—uncorrupted.

The **School of Summoning** is a mortal institution, founded centuries ago to study the Pyramid and other dimensional phenomena. It developed its own communion techniques—faster, more accessible, requiring less discipline than the Pyramid's demanding practices. Most Rentar learn the School's methods before (or instead of) making the pilgrimage to the Pyramid. The School's techniques are what Gynor has corrupted.

This creates a schism the Rentar don't recognize. Pyramid-path Rentar receive genuine celestial guidance. School-path Rentar receive Gynor's whispered lies, dressed up as divine truth. Both groups believe they're following the same faith. They share temples, debate theology, respect each other's insights. They have no idea they're receiving guidance from fundamentally different sources.

### The Hidden Threat: Gynor the Conqueror

**Who He Was**

Gynor was a human summoner at the School of Summoning, roughly 200 years ago. Brilliant, ambitious, and deeply interested in the nature of consciousness and will. He developed new communion techniques that allowed deeper contact with other minds—and eventually developed techniques to *influence* those minds during communion.

When the School's masters discovered what he was doing, they moved to expel him. Gynor killed three of them, stole foundational texts on celestial communion, and fled into the highlands. The School assumed he died in the wilderness.

He did die, eventually. But not before transforming himself into a lich—binding his soul to an anchor hidden somewhere in Chechol's highlands.

**What He's Doing**

For nearly two centuries, Gynor has been refining his techniques and slowly infiltrating Rentar spiritual practices. He can't corrupt the Pyramid—it's genuinely celestial, beyond his reach. But he can corrupt the School's communion methods, which most Rentar use.

His approach is patient. He doesn't issue commands. He offers *guidance*. During communion, corrupted Rentar receive visions that feel divine: a sense of righteous certainty, a conviction that they know the correct path, a subtle discomfort with doubt or questioning. Over generations, this has transformed the Rentar from contemplative mystics into confident zealots.

Gynor is building an army. Not through recruitment or conscription, but through faith. When he finally activates his control—when he shifts from subtle guidance to direct command—thousands of Rentar will march as his **Red Army**, utterly convinced they're fulfilling divine purpose.

**Where He Is**

Gynor's physical location is unknown. His phylactery is hidden somewhere in the highlands between the Stulov and Riki valleys. He himself may be there, or may be elsewhere—liches are patient, and he's had two centuries to establish contingencies.

The School of Summoning suspects *something* is wrong with the local psychic currents. They've detected anomalies for decades. But they haven't connected these anomalies to their expelled former student, who they believe long dead.

**How Close Is the Red Army?**

Not imminent, but not distant. Gynor is still refining his control, still testing how much direct influence he can exert before resistance emerges. The Rentar could be activated in years, not decades. If something forces his hand—discovery, a threat to his phylactery—he might move sooner, with a less complete army.

### Economy

Chechol's economy is modest and agricultural. The three river valleys produce grain, vegetables, and livestock. The Rentar monasteries are largely self-sufficient. Trade flows north toward the Deadloop ports and south into Dalizi.

The one unusual export is **summoners**. The School of Summoning produces trained practitioners who command premium fees across Aboyinzu. This gives Chechol disproportionate influence in regional politics—several major courts retain Chechol-trained summoners as advisors.

The Rentar also hire out as mercenaries and spiritual consultants. Their reputation for divine guidance makes them valuable (and expensive) advisors. Few clients realize that the advice they're paying for may originate with a lich.

### Military

The **Chechol River Guard** is a modest professional force of roughly 3,000 soldiers, primarily human, responsible for border security and internal order. They've seen little serious combat in generations.

The Rentar maintain no official military organization, but every adult Rentar has combat training. The monasteries practice martial disciplines as a form of meditation. In an emergency, Chechol could field 8,000-10,000 Rentar warriors.

This is the Red Army.

The Rentar don't think of themselves as a military force. They think of themselves as spiritual practitioners who happen to be combat-capable. But Gynor has spent two centuries ensuring they're ready—their training, their equipment, their organization, all shaped by "divine guidance" toward military effectiveness.

### Relations

**Dalizi Confederation**

The Dalizi city-states view Chechol as a quiet neighbor—useful for trade, not threatening, not interesting. Several Dalizi states hire Chechol summoners or consult Rentar advisors. None suspect the danger incubating next door.

Turbuni, the city-state bordering the School of Summoning, has the closest relationship. They share jurisdiction over the School's territory and maintain trade agreements. If the Red Army activates, Turbuni will likely be the first casualty.

**Terrenia and Northern States**

Chechol's northern neighbors (Grustos, Quintas, Chaal Nazzerox) barely think about Chechol at all. It's a backwater, too far south to matter. This neglect may prove catastrophic—no one is watching for the threat that's building.

**The Deadloop**

The Deadloop inner sea provides Chechol's primary trade access. Goods flow to the port city of Tenches and then across the sea. Chechol has no navy, no maritime ambitions, and treats the Deadloop purely as a trade route.

### Notable Locations

#### Sevich (Capital)

The seat of Duke Vorotny, located where the Chechik River widens before joining the Deadloop drainage. A modest city of 15,000, dominated by the ducal palace and the Grand Temple of Communion—the largest Rentar temple in Chechol.

The Grand Temple was built over an older human shrine. Its architecture blends Rentar meditation chambers with human ceremonial spaces. Duke Yelen visits weekly to receive spiritual counsel.

#### The Pyramid of Five Sides

Southeast of the capital, in the highlands between the Chechik and Stulov valleys. A stepped pyramid of unknown origin, its four visible faces oriented to the cardinal directions. The fifth face exists only in Celestia—those who enter the Pyramid during certain celestial alignments can cross between planes.

The Pyramid is tended by the **Keepers of the Fifth Face**, an order of Rentar monks who maintain the site and guide pilgrims. These monks are among the few Rentar whose communion practices remain uncorrupted—they use the Pyramid's direct celestial connection rather than the School's techniques.

They've noticed that their visions don't always match what other Rentar describe. They've attributed this to their greater proximity to celestial truth. They haven't considered that other Rentar might be receiving guidance from somewhere else entirely.

#### The School of Summoning

On the border with Turbuni, technically under shared jurisdiction. See the full entry for details.

The School is the unwitting source of Chechol's corruption—its communion techniques are what Gynor has infiltrated. The faculty suspects something is wrong with local psychic phenomena but hasn't identified the cause.

#### The Three River Valleys

- **Chechik Valley**: The most developed, containing the capital and primary agricultural lands. Human-majority.
- **Stulov Valley**: The breadbasket, rolling farmland with scattered Rentar monasteries. Mixed population.
- **Riki Valley**: The most rural, closest to the School of Summoning. Increasingly Rentar-dominated, increasingly zealous.

### Player Hooks

**The Warning Signs**

- A Pyramid Keeper approaches the party with concerns—her visions don't match what the Council of Elders describes, and she's starting to wonder why.
- The School of Summoning hires investigators to examine "psychic anomalies" they've detected. They don't know they're asking players to investigate their own corrupted techniques.
- Duke Yelen's chancellor (one of the few human officials left) quietly seeks outside help. He can't articulate what's wrong, but he knows *something* is.

**The Race Against Time**

- Someone has discovered evidence of Gynor's survival. Now it's a race—can the players find and destroy his phylactery before he activates the Red Army?
- A Rentar elder has begun to break free of Gynor's influence. She remembers what communion used to feel like, and she's terrified. She has days before her absence is noticed.

**The Aftermath**

- The Red Army has already activated. Turbuni is burning. The players must evacuate civilians, rally resistance, or find a way to break Gynor's control over thousands of zealots who genuinely believe they're doing divine work.

### History

**Pre-Rentar Era** (before ~1200 SD)

The three river valleys were settled by humans migrating south from Terrenia. The Pyramid of Five Sides was already ancient—a monument from a forgotten civilization. Early settlers avoided it, considering it haunted. The ducal line was established to unify the valleys against Dalizi expansion.

**Foundation of the School** (~1200 SD)

Human scholars established the School of Summoning to study the Pyramid and develop practical communion techniques. For centuries, it was a respected academic institution, producing summoners who served across Aboyinzu.

**Rentar Arrival** (~1600 SD)

Rentar minotaurs, seeking a genuine connection to celestial truth, discovered the Pyramid and recognized its power. They settled in the highlands, initially as pilgrims, eventually as permanent residents. The human dukes welcomed them—their spiritual insight was valuable, and they paid taxes.

**Gynor's Fall** (~1750 SD)

The summoner Gynor developed mind-influence techniques, was discovered, killed three faculty members, and fled. The School assumed he died in the wilderness. In fact, he became a lich and began his centuries-long corruption project.

**The Quiet Transformation** (1750 SD - present)

Over 200 years, Gynor's subtle influence transformed Rentar spiritual culture. Early Rentar were contemplative, patient, fond of doubt and debate. Modern Rentar are certain, confident, uncomfortable with questions. No one noticed the change because it happened across generations.

**Present Day** (3376 SD)

Chechol appears peaceful. Duke Yelen rules with Rentar guidance. The School produces summoners. The Pyramid draws pilgrims. Underneath, thousands of Rentar are primed to become the Red Army, awaiting only Gynor's command.

## Chimea

Tags: state

Links: States

Chimea is a hungry nation. Its jungles sprawl across southwestern Ve, its mines burrow into the Blood Mountains, its colonies spread across the Emerald Coast of distant Rimihuica, and still it wants more. The Chimean Empire—they call themselves that now, though the title is barely a century old—is built on expansion, exploitation, and the unshakeable belief that strength justifies itself.

The irony is that Chimea's success comes not from military genius but from relentless opportunism. When the Aureum dwarves were weakened by internal strife, Chimea annexed their territories. When the Boneswamps made the northern border impassable, Chimea turned south and crossed the ocean. When New Chimea needed soldiers to fight elves and lizardfolk, the homeland sent convicts and debtors. Chimea doesn't plan conquests—it simply never stops probing for weakness, and when it finds one, it pushes.

The result is an empire stretched thin and held together by coercion. The Aureum in the Blood Mountains resist assimilation. The colonial governors in New Chimea pursue their own agendas. The Suki Jungle swallows settlements whole. And beneath the veneer of imperial confidence, the throne in Chimus knows that Chimea's reach has finally exceeded its grasp.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (Chimean), Naga, Aureum (subject population)

**Population**: 200,000

**Stability**: Stable (domestically); Unstable (in colonies and annexed territories)

**Core Values**: Strength, expansion, wealth, ambition

- Emperor Valdris III has ruled for thirty-two years, inheriting a kingdom and declaring it an empire. His title is grand; his authority is real. The Emperor's word is law, and the noble houses that once contested royal power have been systematically reduced to ceremonial roles. The secret police—the Quiet Office—ensure that ambition remains channeled toward external enemies.
- Chimean society is stratified by birth, wealth, and usefulness to the state. The old noble families retain prestige but little power. The merchant houses control trade and pay for the privilege. The military offers advancement to commoners willing to bleed for the Empire. At the bottom, convicts and debtors are shipped to New Chimea as "redemption colonists"—a polite term for expendable labor.
- The Naga occupy a peculiar position. These serpentine peoples have lived in the Suki Jungle since before humans arrived, and their relationship with Chimea is technically alliance rather than subjugation. Naga nobles attend the imperial court; Naga warriors serve in elite units. In practice, the alliance is increasingly one-sided, and younger Naga chafe at the arrangement.
- The Aureum dwarves are subjects, not citizens. Chimea conquered their Blood Mountain territories three generations ago, and the occupation has never been accepted. Aureum pay higher taxes, face restrictions on weapon ownership, and are excluded from military service. A low-grade resistance simmers constantly; the Quiet Office spends as much effort suppressing dwarven dissent as monitoring human rivals.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Rubies, iron, exotic hardwoods, jungle products, Naga silk, colonial goods

**Primary Imports**: Grain, manufactured goods, weapons, slaves (for colonial labor)

- The Blood Mountains are Chimea's treasure vault—ruby deposits, iron veins, and copper seams that would make any nation wealthy. The problem is extraction. The Bloodlings control the deepest mines and emerge at night to prey on workers. The Aureum population resents their conquerors and works slowly when they work at all. Every gemstone that reaches Chimus is stained with someone's blood.
- The Suki Jungle produces hardwoods, medicinal plants, exotic spices, and Naga silk—the last being nearly as valuable as Lyzine silk, though the Naga resent the comparison. Jungle harvesting is dangerous work, and the labor force relies heavily on convicts working off sentences.
- Trade with New Chimea is theoretically profitable: the colony produces tropical goods, and the homeland provides manufactured supplies. In practice, the ocean crossing is expensive and dangerous, and the colony increasingly produces what it needs locally. The trade balance has been shifting for years.
- Chimea imports grain from Avalon (the Suki Jungle doesn't farm well) and weapons from Dern (ironic, given the old wars). The grain dependency gives Avalon leverage; the weapons trade gives Dern gold. Neither relationship is comfortable.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (domestic); Conscription (colonial)

**The Imperial Legions**: Chimea maintains four legions of professional soldiers, each numbering roughly 5,000. The First Legion guards the capital and serves as the Emperor's personal force. The Second patrols the Blood Mountains and suppresses Aureum unrest. The Third watches the Dern border and the Boneswamps. The Fourth rotates between jungle pacification and colonial deployment.

**The Naga Cohorts**: Elite units of Naga warriors serve alongside the legions, specializing in jungle warfare and night operations. Their loyalty is to the alliance, not the Emperor personally—a distinction that makes some generals nervous.

**The Colonial Militia**: New Chimea fields its own forces, technically under imperial command but practically autonomous. Colonial troops are predominantly conscripts and redemption colonists, stiffened by a core of professional officers.

- Chimean military doctrine emphasizes flexibility and sustained pressure. They don't win wars with brilliant maneuvers; they win by refusing to stop. Campaigns in the Blood Mountains have ground on for generations. The colonial wars have lasted decades. Chimea accepts casualties that would break other nations.
- The Quiet Office maintains its own armed branch for internal security—secret police who answer directly to the Emperor and operate outside military command. Their exact numbers are unknown; their reputation is terrifying.

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Ve, extending from Traitor Bay and the Gulf of Chimea through the Blood Mountains and Suki Jungle

**Biomes**: Tropical jungle, mountains, coastal plains, swampland

**Named Entities**: Blood Mountains, Suki Jungle (West Suki, South Suki, North Suki), Boneswamps

**Rivers & Lakes**: Tonyfall River, Shoosus River (seasonal)

**Adjacent Waters**: Traitor Bay, Gulf of Chimea

- The Suki Jungle dominates Chimea's heartland—a vast tropical forest divided into three regions. West Suki stretches from the Blood Mountains to the coast, relatively tamed and settled. South Suki covers the southern interior, wilder but productive. North Suki borders the Boneswamps and Dern, and is the most dangerous region—close to enemy territory and haunted by the war dead.
- The Blood Mountains form the northwestern spine of Chimea's territory—conquered Aureum lands rich in minerals and infested with Bloodlings. The mountains are essential to Chimea's economy and a constant drain on its military.
- The Boneswamps mark the border with Dern—a cursed wetland where the dead from ancient wars still walk. Neither nation claims the Boneswamps; both patrol their edges. The swamps serve as an effective barrier, which is the only reason Chimea and Dern aren't currently at war.
- Traitor Bay earned its name from a naval battle where Chimean captains switched sides during a civil war. The bay is now Chimea's primary western port, though the name remains an uncomfortable reminder.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Chimus
**Cities**: Old Tyabb
**Towns**: Port Vincent, Miltalie, Kargunyah, Nugent, Aldaville, Frowat
**Villages**: Dozens scattered throughout the jungle and mountains

**Chimus** — The imperial capital sprawls across the southern plains where the Suki Jungle opens into cultivated territory. Perhaps 40,000 people live here, making it Ve's second-largest city after Shyona's capital. The city was built for display: broad avenues, marble government buildings, the massive Imperial Palace complex. The message is clear—Chimea is powerful, wealthy, and permanent.

The reality is more complicated. Chimus's grand façade covers cramped worker districts, ethnic enclaves where Aureum and Naga maintain their own customs, and a thriving underworld that the Quiet Office can suppress but never eliminate. The city works, but it works despite itself.

**Old Tyabb** — The gateway to New Chimea and Chimea's most important inland city. Old Tyabb sits where the western jungle meets the coastal road to Port Vincent, serving as the staging ground for colonial expeditions. Soldiers, supplies, convicts, and "redemption colonists" all pass through here on their way to the ships. The city is perhaps 15,000 people—a rough mix of military administrators, merchants supplying the colonial trade, and the desperate hoping for a new start across the ocean.

Old Tyabb has the character of a city perpetually saying goodbye. The taverns are full of people drinking away their last nights on Ve; the temples do brisk business in blessings for safe voyage; the loan sharks extend credit to colonists who'll never return to repay. It's not a pleasant place, but it's essential—the funnel through which Chimea feeds its distant ambitions.

**Port Vincent** — Chimea's primary western port, built around a natural harbor on Traitor Bay. Ships bound for New Chimea depart from here, as does most of Chimea's sea trade. The town is rough, commercial, and cosmopolitan in the way port towns become—criminals, merchants, and desperate colonists mixing in dockside taverns.

**Blood Mountain Settlements** — The conquered Aureum territories are administered from towns within the range itself. Gilla serves as the primary administrative center for the occupation, processing ore and coordinating the Second Legion's patrols. Jenolan Caves is a mining community literally built into cavern systems—and the site of frequent Bloodling incursions from the depths. Jindivick, Gorokan, Hell Creek, and Bumbaldry are extraction settlements deep in the range, while Courangra, Narara, and Boggabilla sit on the jungle-mountain border. Life is hard; Bloodling attacks are common; Aureum resistance makes every night uncertain.

**Jungle Towns** — Miltalie, Kargunyah, and Nugent anchor the interior jungle territories, while Aldaville and Frowat control the Tonyfall River. These towns harvest the jungle's resources and maintain roads that the forest constantly tries to reclaim. Many smaller villages dot the Suki—Harrismith, Tumut Shire, Portagabea, Huntley, Muringo, and dozens more—tiny outposts that appear and disappear as the jungle allows.

**Border Settlements** — The eastern edge of Chimea, near the Boneswamps, hosts nervous communities that watch for the walking dead: Bowning, Kinglake, Chatford, Broughton, Nymboida. These are not prosperous places. People live here because they have no better options.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Aureum Resistance**: Three generations of occupation have not produced acceptance. Aureum sabotage mining operations, assassinate officials, and dream of liberation. The resistance is decentralized—no single leader to capture—and the Quiet Office's brutal methods create martyrs faster than they eliminate threats.
- **The Colonial War**: In New Chimea, the Empire fights elves in Vystrilik and skirmishes with the Ix Tyrann lizardfolk. The war has lasted decades with no end in sight. Each year drains more resources; each year the homeland asks what it's getting in return.
- **The Blood Mountains**: Controlling conquered territory while extracting resources while fighting Bloodling incursions while suppressing resistance is a four-front war disguised as occupation. The Second Legion is permanently deployed; replacements arrive constantly; the costs never stop.
- **The Succession Question**: Emperor Valdris III is sixty-four and in declining health. His heir, Prince Aldric, is capable but untested. Various noble houses—supposedly powerless—are quietly positioning for influence in the next reign. The Quiet Office watches everyone.
- **The Naga Alliance**: Younger Naga leaders increasingly view the alliance as exploitation. Chimea takes Naga warriors, Naga silk, Naga knowledge of the jungle—and gives back a seat at a court that treats them as exotic curiosities. A formal break would be catastrophic for Chimea's jungle territories, but current trends suggest it's a matter of when, not if.

### History

Chimea began as one of several human kingdoms in southwestern Ve, distinguished only by its position between jungle and mountains. For centuries, it competed with neighbors, won some wars, lost others, and remained unremarkable.

The transformation began roughly 300 years ago, when the War of Bone against Dern ended in mutual exhaustion and the Boneswamps became impassable. Unable to expand north, Chimea turned its attention to the Aureum territories in the Blood Mountains. A century of pressure—economic, military, diplomatic—culminated in conquest. The Aureum kingdom fell; its people became subjects; its mines became Chimean property.

With mountain wealth funding expansion, Chimea pushed into the deeper Suki Jungle, negotiating alliance with the Naga rather than fighting them. The alliance was genuinely mutual at first—the Naga gained access to Chimean metalwork and trade goods; Chimea gained jungle expertise and warriors. Over generations, the balance has shifted.

The colonial era began eighty years ago, when Chimean explorers reached the Emerald Coast of Rimihuica and found the Jungles of Godahi. New Chimea was founded; settlers arrived; conflict with the native elves and lizardfolk proved inevitable. The colonial war has now lasted longer than some nations' entire histories.

Emperor Valdris III declared the Empire thirty-two years ago, formalizing what had become obvious—Chimea had outgrown kingdom status. The title changed nothing practical, but it signaled intent. Chimea means to rule, and it means to keep ruling, whatever the cost.

### Hooks

- **The Aureum Conspiracy**: A coordinated uprising is being planned in the Blood Mountains—not spontaneous resistance, but something organized. Someone is smuggling weapons. Someone is coordinating cells. The Quiet Office knows something is coming but can't find the leadership.
- **The Naga Secession**: A faction of young Naga nobles is preparing to withdraw from the alliance and declare the jungle territories independent. They're seeking outside support—from Dern, from Avalon, from anyone who'd benefit from Chimean weakness.
- **The Colonial Recall**: New Chimea's governor has stopped sending taxes and started issuing his own currency. He claims loyalty to the Empire but acts like a sovereign. Someone needs to go assess whether this is autonomy or rebellion.
- **The Boneswamps Incursion**: Something has riled up the dead in the Boneswamps—they're pushing deeper into Chimean territory than they have in centuries. The border settlements are evacuating. The Third Legion is mobilizing. And reports suggest the dead are organized in a way they've never been before.
- **The Bloodling Bargain**: A Bloodling emissary has approached the Imperial Court with an unprecedented offer: peace in the mines in exchange for... something. The Bloodlings won't say what. The Emperor is curious. The Quiet Office is suspicious. Someone needs to find out what the vampiric gnomes actually want.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Scattered tribes

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ix Tyrann

**Population**: 4,000

**Stability**: Very unstable

**Core Values**: Predatorship, might makes right, killing

- The Ix Tyrann are a vicious group, known to eviscerate outsiders who somehow wander into one of their villages.
- Small villages are managed by a strongman chief, who took their position because they managed to kill the previous guy. As chief, you can boss people around until someone else kills you and takes your place.


### Economy

**Size**: None

**Tech**: Very undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- There is no economy to speak of.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Nearly anyone who can fight, wants to fight. 
- The Ix Tyrann have no organized fighting whatsoever, but what they lack in discipline, they make up for in savagery. They are some of the most efficient killers in Alaria.

### History

## Dalizi Confederation

Tags: state, confederation

A sprawling political entity comprising over forty member states—some true nations, others mere city-states—bound together by ancient treaties, mutual defense obligations, and a bewildering tangle of marriages, debts, and grudges. The Confederation occupies the territories northwest, west, and southwest of Lake Tonactlet Chipe, making it one of the largest political entities in southern Aboyinzu.

On paper, the Confederation is a unified realm. In practice, it's a slow-motion civil war fought through trade agreements, marriage contracts, assassinations, and procedural manipulation in the Diet. Every generation or so, the cold war turns hot—two or three states openly clash before exhaustion or outside pressure forces a truce. The borders inside the Confederation shift more often than the borders outside it.

Outsiders find the Confederation maddening. There's no single authority to negotiate with. Treaties with one state mean nothing to its neighbor. Merchants must navigate dozens of different tariff regimes, legal systems, and currencies. Mercenaries can find work on any given day, because someone is always fighting someone.

And yet the Confederation endures. When external threats arise—and they do—the member states somehow manage to cooperate just long enough to survive. Then they go back to fighting each other.

### Government

**The Dalizi Diet**

The nominal governing body of the Confederation, the Diet meets in the city of Metato (in Samani state) during the dry season. Representatives from every member state gather to debate, vote, and—theoretically—make binding decisions for the whole Confederation.

In practice, the Diet is a theater of manipulation. Voting blocs form and dissolve. Bribes change hands openly. Procedural rules are weaponized to delay, obstruct, or ram through proposals. A skilled political operator can paralyze the Diet for seasons or force through legislation no one wanted.

The Diet's actual power is limited to:
- Declaring war on external enemies (requires two-thirds majority)
- Admitting or expelling member states (requires three-quarters majority)
- Electing the Paramount (requires Elector consensus)
- Adjudicating disputes between member states (routinely ignored)

**The Paramount**

The head of the Confederation—a ceremonial position with theoretical supreme authority and practical powerlessness. The Paramount presides over the Diet, commands the Confederate Army (which exists only when the Diet authorizes it), and represents the Confederation to foreign powers.

The Paramount is elected by the Seven Electors upon the previous Paramount's death. The position is not hereditary, which means every succession is a crisis. Electors trade their votes for concessions—territories, trade rights, marriages, debts forgiven. The candidate who wins is usually the one who promises the most.

The current Paramount is **Makisani III of Mpaso**, an aging woman who has held the position for thirty-two years. She's competent, respected, and visibly declining. Her impending death has already triggered succession maneuvering. Three candidates have emerged, and none commands majority Elector support.

**The Seven Electors**

Seven member states hold the hereditary right to elect the Paramount:
1. **Mpaso** — currently held by Paramount Makisani's house, but her heir is weak
2. **Chilala** — the largest state, aggressive expansionists
3. **Lanwadanzi** — wealthy from eastern trade, prefers stability
4. **Samani** — hosts the Diet in Metato, considers itself above politics (it isn't)
5. **Shunde** — the most militarized state, respects only strength
6. **Nikpato** — central location, constantly invaded by neighbors, wants protection
7. **Kafula** — ancient bloodlines, claims founding-family descent, votes based on genealogical grudges

Elector status is theoretically permanent, but the Confederation's history includes several wars fought specifically to strip or claim Elector seats. The current seven have held their positions for over three centuries, but everyone remembers that Dhabisa was once an Elector before the War of Broken Oaths (2891 SD).

**The Five Circles**

Regional groupings that coordinate policy among neighboring states. Circles have no formal constitutional authority, but they're where the real politics happen—states negotiate within their Circle before bringing proposals to the Diet.

**The Lakeshore Circle** — States bordering Lake Tonactlet Chipe
- Members: Mpaso, Chilala, Misanda Mulu, Samani
- Character: Wealthy from fishing and lake trade, dominated by the Mpaso-Chilala rivalry
- Current state: Paralyzed by succession maneuvering; Chilala wants the Paramount seat

**The Highland Circle** — States in the Dalizi Highlands northeast of the lake
- Members: Lanwadanzi, Daltimo, parts of Samani
- Character: Traders and scholars, prefer diplomacy to war, wealthy from eastern routes
- Current state: Nervous about the succession; Lanwadanzi backs stability candidate

**The Forest Circle** — States in or near the great eastern forests
- Members: Magayi, Kerikos, Wetu, Maruro, Kibuhanda
- Character: Frontier states, independent-minded, suspicious of central authority
- Current state: Mostly ignoring the succession fight; focused on local concerns

**The Border Circle** — States along the northern frontier with Central Aboyinzu
- Members: Nikpato, Turbuni, Daboni, Jowdo, Buti, Wodhuubo
- Character: Buffer states, frequently invaded, desperate for Confederate protection
- Current state: Terrified; the next Paramount's attitude toward northern defense matters enormously

**The South Wall Circle** — States near the Dragon's Spine mountains
- Members: Shemu, Taulo Magi, Kafula, Shunde
- Character: Martial cultures shaped by mountain threats, suspicious of lake-state softness
- Current state: Shunde is positioning its candidate for Paramount; Kafula holds a grudge

### The Succession Crisis

Paramount Makisani III is dying. She has perhaps two years, perhaps less. Her designated heir—her nephew Tobwani—is widely considered unfit: young, inexperienced, and visibly uncomfortable with politics. The Electors have begun positioning for what comes after.

**The Three Candidates**

**Shundari of Shunde** — The Martial Option
- Background: General who unified the South Wall Circle against mountain raiders
- Platform: Confederate Army reform, stronger central authority, northern expansion
- Support: Shunde (Elector), South Wall Circle, states that want a strong Paramount
- Opposition: States that fear strong Paramounts, specifically Chilala
- Weakness: Seen as a warmonger; many fear he'd use Confederate armies against internal enemies

**Mwenekazi of Chilala** — The Expansionist Option
- Background: Regent-Queen of the largest Elector state, brilliant politician
- Platform: Chilala dominance framed as Confederate unity; absorb smaller states
- Support: Chilala (Elector), allied city-states, states that have already submitted to Chilala influence
- Opposition: Everyone who isn't already aligned with Chilala
- Weakness: Too openly ambitious; other Electors don't want to create a monster

**Tumaini of Lanwadanzi** — The Stability Option
- Background: Wealthy merchant-prince, reputation for fairness and bribery in equal measure
- Platform: Status quo, trade agreements, avoid wars, let the Diet actually function
- Support: Lanwadanzi (Elector), Highland Circle, Forest Circle, states tired of conflict
- Opposition: States that want change, specifically Shunde and Chilala
- Weakness: Seen as weak; wouldn't defend the Border Circle if tested

**The Path to Victory**

To become Paramount, a candidate needs four of seven Elector votes. Currently:
- Shunde votes Shundari (1)
- Chilala votes Mwenekazi (1)
- Lanwadanzi votes Tumaini (1)
- Mpaso votes for Makisani's heir Tobwani, but he can't win (1)
- Samani is "neutral" (selling their vote)
- Nikpato is "neutral" (terrified of backing the loser)
- Kafula votes based on ancient genealogical grudges (currently favors Mwenekazi, but this could change)

The crisis will break when Makisani dies. If no candidate has four votes by then, the Confederation enters an interregnum—no Paramount, no Confederate Army, every state for itself. The last interregnum (2891 SD) lasted seven years and killed 40,000 people.

### Culture

**The Languages**

The Confederation has no single language. Dalizi Common (a trade pidgin) serves for commerce and Diet proceedings, but each state maintains its own tongue. Scholars count at least fifteen distinct languages within Confederate borders, plus dozens of local dialects.

This linguistic fragmentation reflects deeper cultural divisions. Lakeshore states share fishing traditions and water-worship. Highland states venerate ancestors and scholarly achievement. South Wall states prize martial honor. Forest states maintain animist practices their neighbors consider primitive.

**The Faiths**

Three major religious traditions compete within the Confederation:

**The Ancestors' Way** — Dominant in the highlands and most city-states. Believers venerate their direct ancestors, maintaining family shrines and seeking guidance through ritual communion. Politically organized through the Temple of Names in Metato, which maintains genealogical records and certifies legitimate descent—crucial for inheritance disputes.

**The Lake's Children** — Dominant around Lake Tonactlet Chipe. Believers worship the lake itself as a living deity, offering sacrifices for good fishing and safe passage. Priests claim to interpret the lake's will through dreams and signs. Politically powerful in Mpaso, Chilala, and Misanda Mulu.

**The Old Forest** — Dominant in the eastern Forest Circle. Animist tradition honoring spirits of individual trees, animals, and places. Decentralized, with no formal priesthood—each village maintains its own spirit relationships. Considered backward by other traditions but fiercely defended by its practitioners.

These faiths don't actively war, but they create cultural boundaries. A highland merchant conducting business in Chilala must perform lakeside offerings or risk being seen as impious. A forest-born soldier serving in Shunde must hide their animist prayers or face mockery.

**Marriage and Alliance**

Noble marriages are political instruments, carefully negotiated to create or cement alliances. The Confederation's aristocracy is so intermarried that succession disputes routinely involve claims from three or four different states.

This creates opportunities for intrigue. A disputed inheritance might be decided by which claimant has stronger allies—or by assassination, forged documents, or convenient "discoveries" of illegitimacy. The Temple of Names profits handsomely from both certifying and challenging bloodlines.

**Mercenary Culture**

The Confederation's constant internal conflicts have produced a thriving mercenary industry. Companies range from small bands of veteran soldiers to small armies with siege equipment and mages.

Notable companies include:
- **The Lake's Teeth** — Elite heavy infantry, loyal to whoever pays best
- **The Corpse Collectors** — Specialists in dirty work: assassinations, kidnappings, evidence destruction
- **The Painted Shields** — Cavalry company with a reputation for honoring contracts exactly as written (and exploiting any ambiguity)
- **The Smoke Walkers** — Infiltrators and saboteurs, rumored to employ dark magic

Hiring mercenaries is expensive but often cheaper than maintaining standing armies. Most city-states rely on mercenary contracts for defense, which means their security depends on their treasury.

### Economy

**The Lake Trade**

Lake Tonactlet Chipe is the Confederation's economic heart. Fish, freshwater pearls, and lake-bottom minerals flow out; grain, metal goods, and foreign luxuries flow in. Control of lakeside ports means control of revenue.

Mpaso and Chilala fight constantly over lake trade. Mpaso controls the best natural harbors; Chilala controls the largest population of fishers. Neither can dominate without the other, which produces endless tariff disputes, fishing-rights conflicts, and occasional naval skirmishes.

**The Eastern Trade**

The Highland Circle controls trade routes to the Elder Wilds and beyond. Exotic goods—rare woods, magical components, foreign spices—flow through Lanwadanzi's markets. This makes Lanwadanzi wealthy and politically cautious; war disrupts trade.

**The Northern Corridor**

Trade with Central Aboyinzu and the Deadloop inner sea passes through the Border Circle. Turbuni and Nikpato both claim to be the "Gateway to the North," competing for merchant traffic. Their rivalry occasionally benefits merchants (competitive tolls) and occasionally destroys them (trade wars).

**The Currency Chaos**

The Confederation has no single currency. Each member state mints its own coins, with wildly varying weights and metal content. Money-changers profit from the confusion; merchants lose sleep over it. Periodic attempts to establish a Confederate currency have failed—no state trusts the others to mint honestly.

### Military

**No Confederate Army (Usually)**

The Confederation maintains no standing military force. When the Diet authorizes a Confederate Army—usually in response to external invasion—each member state contributes troops proportional to its population. A Confederate General is appointed (usually after weeks of political fighting) to command the combined force.

This system is slow, fractious, and surprisingly effective when it finally mobilizes. Confederate Armies have defeated external threats multiple times. They've also dissolved into internal fighting when the external threat recedes.

**Member State Forces**

Each state maintains its own military:
- **Shunde** has the most professional army—15,000 disciplined infantry
- **Chilala** has the largest population and can field 25,000 militia
- **Lanwadanzi** relies on mercenaries and a small elite guard
- **Most city-states** maintain walls, a city watch, and mercenary contracts

**The Fortress Network**

Centuries of internal war have produced a landscape dotted with fortifications. Every state has castles, every city has walls, every major road has toll-fortresses. Sieges are common; decisive battles are rare. Wars tend to be slow, expensive, and inconclusive.

### History

**The Founding Wars** (800-900 SD)

The Dalizi Confederation emerged from a century of warfare among the lake-region states. Facing invasion from the giants of the southern mountains, the warring states formed a defensive alliance. The alliance held, the giants were driven back, and the temporary coalition became permanent.

The founding treaty established the Diet, the Paramount, and the Elector system. It also established the principle that member states would handle internal affairs independently—a principle that has produced centuries of "internal affairs" that look a lot like wars.

**The Golden Age** (900-1500 SD)

Six centuries of relative stability and growth. The Confederation expanded to its current borders, absorbing smaller states through conquest, marriage, or voluntary accession. Trade flourished. The Paramount institution gained prestige. Several strong Paramounts managed to impose temporary order.

**The War of Broken Oaths** (2891 SD)

The worst internal conflict in Confederate history. A disputed succession produced two rival Paramounts, each claiming legitimacy. The Confederation split roughly in half, with Dhabisa leading one faction and Mpaso the other. Seven years of war killed 40,000 people and devastated the Border Circle.

The war ended when both claimants died in the same battle (possibly arranged by exhausted neutrals). Dhabisa lost its Elector status as punishment for starting the conflict. The current constitutional order emerged from the post-war settlement.

**The Long Peace** (2891-3340 SD)

Fifty years of genuine peace, enforced by exhaustion and the memory of the war. States focused on rebuilding. Trade recovered. A series of competent Paramounts maintained stability.

**The Slow Unraveling** (3340 SD - present)

The last forty years have seen increasing instability. Border conflicts. Succession disputes. Trade wars. The current Paramount, Makisani III, has held things together through personal relationships, but she's dying. Her potential successors lack her skills.

The Confederation isn't collapsing—not yet. But the institutions that held it together are fraying. The next succession will test whether anything remains.

### Current Tensions

**The Chilala Problem**

Chilala is too big. Its population exceeds the next three states combined. Its economy dominates the Lakeshore Circle. Its ruler, Regent-Queen Mwenekazi, is openly positioning for the Paramount seat—and if she gets it, she'll have the power to make the position meaningful.

Other states are terrified. A strong Paramount backed by Chilala's resources could transform the Confederation from a loose alliance into a centralized state—with Chilala at its center. The other Electors are looking for anyone who can stop her.

**The Northern Vulnerability**

The Border Circle states are exposed and underfunded. They depend on Confederate protection that arrives slowly if at all. Nikpato has been invaded three times in the last century; twice, help came too late.

The next Paramount's attitude toward northern defense will determine whether these states remain loyal. If they decide the Confederation can't protect them, they might seek arrangements elsewhere—with Chechol, with Terrenia, with anyone who offers security.

No one in the Confederation knows about the Red Army building in Chechol. When that threat emerges, the Border Circle will be the first to burn.

**The Religious Tensions**

The three major faiths have coexisted uneasily for centuries. Recently, tensions have increased:
- The Temple of Names (Ancestors' Way) has begun challenging inheritance claims from Lake's Children families, citing "improper documentation"
- Lake's Children priests have declared certain highland practices "offensive to the lake"
- Forest Circle states have expelled Temple of Names missionaries, claiming cultural imperialism

None of this has turned violent yet. But in a succession crisis, religious divisions could provide another fault line.

**The Mercenary Dependency**

Too many states rely on mercenaries instead of maintaining their own forces. This works until it doesn't. If a mercenary company decides to switch sides mid-conflict, or if multiple states bid for the same company, or if companies decide to take a city for themselves instead of their employers...

The Painted Shields attempted exactly this in 3365 SD, seizing the city-state of Kerikos and holding it for ransom. A Confederate Army eventually dislodged them, but the precedent was set. Mercenaries are soldiers without loyalty. The Confederation is full of them.

### Notable Member States

**Chilala** (Elector) — The largest state, controlling the eastern lake shore. Regent-Queen Mwenekazi rules during her son's minority, and shows no intention of surrendering power when he comes of age. Capital: Kisro.

**Mpaso** (Elector) — The current Paramount's home state, controlling the northern lake shore. Wealthy, prestigious, and facing a leadership vacuum when Makisani dies. Capital: Misiwada.

**Lanwadanzi** (Elector) — The merchant state, controlling eastern trade routes. Prefers stability, willing to pay for it. Capital: Lanwadar.

**Samani** (Elector) — Hosts the Diet in Metato, considers itself the Confederation's neutral heart. In practice, sells its vote to the highest bidder. Capital: Metato.

**Shunde** (Elector) — The martial state, with the Confederation's best professional army. General Shundari has made himself the obvious strongman candidate. Capital: Bisaro.

**Nikpato** (Elector) — The nervous state, repeatedly invaded, desperate for protection. Will vote for whoever promises to defend them. Capital: Kampaga.

**Kafula** (Elector) — The ancient state, obsessed with genealogy and bloodlines. Votes based on grudges centuries old. Capital: Kyobale.

**Turbuni** — Border city-state, shares the School of Summoning with Chechol. Doesn't realize the threat next door. Capital: Turbuni.

**Dhabisa** — Former Elector, still bitter about the War of Broken Oaths. Would do almost anything to regain its seat. Capital: Sumda.

### Player Hooks

**The Succession**

- A candidate hires the party to secure an Elector's vote—through persuasion, bribery, blackmail, or removal of obstacles
- The Temple of Names has discovered a genealogical secret that could disqualify a candidate; multiple parties want to control or destroy the evidence
- An Elector dies unexpectedly; the party witnesses the death and knows it was murder, but proving it means navigating Confederate politics

**The Mercenary Life**

- A mercenary company offers the party membership—good pay, interesting work, and a front-row seat to Confederate conflicts
- Two states have hired the same company for opposing operations; the party must choose sides or find a third option
- The Painted Shields are planning another city seizure; the party has advance warning and must decide what to do with it

**The Border Crisis**

- Nikpato's ruler hires the party to investigate strange reports from Chechol—unusually militant Rentar, communities going silent, travelers who don't return
- A Rentar elder has fled south, seeking help; she has fragments of truth about Gynor's corruption but no one believes her
- The Red Army activates; the party is in Turbuni when the attack begins

**The Religious Conflict**

- The Temple of Names wants investigators to examine a noble family's genealogical claims—claims that would shift an Elector vote
- A Lake's Children priest has gone missing in the highlands; is this murder, kidnapping, or voluntary disappearance?
- Forest Circle states are forming their own alliance, potentially seceding from the Confederation; the party must assess whether this is serious

### Relations with Neighbors

**Chechol** — Seen as a quiet, pious backwater. Turbuni has the closest ties, sharing the School of Summoning. The Confederation doesn't watch Chechol closely, which will prove to be a catastrophic mistake.

**Terrenia** — Trade partners and occasional rivals. The Terrenia states are wealthier and more stable; the Confederation resents this. No serious conflicts currently.

**Elder Wilds** — Source of exotic trade goods and occasional monsters. The Forest Circle handles relations, mostly through Lanwadanzi's merchants.

**Dragon's Spine Mountains** — Source of threats: giants, monsters, and worse. The South Wall Circle exists to hold this frontier.

## Danak

Tags: state

Links: States

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Tribal confederation with war-chiefs

**Primary Inhabitants**: Danaki (minotaurs)

**Population**: ~35,000

**Stability**: Somewhat Stable (internally); perpetual external conflict

**Core Values**:

- Strength and martial prowess
- Suppression of emotion
- Communal child-rearing—no family bonds
- Berserk rage as controlled weapon

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Mercenaries, leather goods, bone crafts

**Primary Imports**: Metal weapons, armor, grain

- The Danaki economy is centered on war. When not fighting the Enti, Danaki hire out as mercenaries across northern Clueanda
- Crafting focuses on practical military goods—the Danaki have no tradition of art for art's sake
- What little trade exists comes through occasional merchants brave or foolish enough to visit, or through raids

### Military

**Size**: Large (relative to population)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory—every Danaki is trained for combat

- Children are raised communally with combat training beginning before literacy
- The Danaki berserk state makes them devastating shock troops
- Organization is loose—war-chiefs lead through proven ability, not inherited authority
- The entire adult population can be mobilized for defense or major offensives

### Geography

**Location**: Northwestern Frostmarch Peninsula

**Biomes**: Rolling highlands, sparse forest, tundra

**Named Entities**: Valley of Thagrund, Chinayaqax Munaga (forest)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Tottokzin River, Ganek River, Lakiat River

**Adjacent Waters**: Iron Strait, approaches to Northern Isles

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None—the Danaki have no permanent capital, only seasonal gathering sites

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None in the traditional sense—Danaki live in fortified villages

**Villages**: Enasshi, Yeszhi, Zerqollo, Rikki, Anno, Ildano, Vinesso, Orokabo

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Eternal War**: Generations of conflict with the Enti of Atyeska. Neither side remembers why it started; neither side will stop.
- Raids and counter-raids across the border claim lives every season
- Captured enemies are either killed or enslaved (the Enti do the same)
- Occasional pressure from Kyorda to cease hostilities, always ignored

### History

The Danaki have occupied these lands since before recorded history. Their culture evolved around the harsh realities of northern life—communities that couldn't fight together died together.

The abandonment of family bonds is ancient, practical wisdom: in a society where death in battle is common, attachment to specific parents or children is a vulnerability. Children are raised by the village, taught by whichever adults have the skills to teach, and grow up knowing their loyalty is to their people, not to any individual.

The berserk rage is both blessing and curse. In battle, it makes the Danaki nearly unstoppable. Outside battle, it makes them distrustful of their own emotions—any strong feeling might trigger the fury. This has created a culture of deliberate stoicism, where displaying emotion is seen as weakness and loss of control.

### The Valley of Thagrund

The western border of Danak is marked by the Valley of Thagrund—a defensible position where the Danaki have repelled Enti incursions for centuries. The valley floor is littered with the bones of the fallen from both sides, never collected, serving as a permanent memorial to the cost of the endless war.

## Deo Esari

Tags: state, elves, confederation, titans, hand-magic

The mountain kingdom. Deo Esari occupies the Kelder Mountains along the eastern edge of the Farlands—a vertical realm of peaks, passes, and the bones of ancient titans. Of the three elven kingdoms, Deo Esari is the smallest in population, the most isolated in geography, and the most sacred in purpose. They are the keepers of the titan dead.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic council (Titanic Priesthood)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Elves

**Population**: ~80,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:
- Sacred duty to the titan remains
- Preservation of ritual knowledge
- Isolation from corrupting outside influences
- Patient observation over hasty action

Deo Esari is governed by the **Titanic Priesthood**—a council of ritual specialists who have dedicated their lives to the proper handling of titan remains. The High Priest serves as head of state, but decisions are made collectively. Secular matters are delegated to appointed administrators; anything touching the bones requires priestly consensus.

The priesthood is not hereditary. Candidates are identified in childhood through aptitude testing, then trained for decades before receiving their first tattoo. The hand-magic traditions of Deo Esari are restricted entirely to the priesthood—no lay elf may bear titan-bone markings.

### The Titan Bones

The Kelder Mountains are a graveyard. During the God War, titans fell here in numbers—some killed by dragons, some by other titans, some by weapons or forces that left no survivors to record them. Their bones remain, buried in the peaks, exposed by erosion, scattered through valleys.

Deo Esari exists to tend these remains.

**The Sacred Monopoly**

Approximately 95% of all titan bone in the world comes from the Kelder Mountains. The Deo Esari do not sell it. They do not trade it. Titan bone is sacred material, and its distribution is controlled absolutely:

- Bones are harvested through elaborate ritual by designated priesthood teams
- Processed bone is used for religious ceremonies within the confederation
- Small amounts are provided to Lenora and Illron for their own sacred purposes
- Nothing—ever—leaves the three kingdoms legitimately

**Defectors**

The only way titan bone reaches the outside world is through defection. Occasionally, an elf (usually not a priest, but someone with access to processed materials) steals what they can carry and flees east over the mountains into Rakite territory, or south into Wycendeula.

These defectors are criminals of the highest order. Their names are struck from all records. Their families disown them publicly. They are considered spiritually dead—worse than the Grieving of Imyena Edhil, who at least remain within the community of elves.

The defectors don't care. A single titan-bone blade can purchase a lordship in the human kingdoms. A pouch of processed bone powder is worth more than most merchants see in a lifetime. The temptation is immense.

Defections are rare—perhaps one or two per decade—but they are the entire source of the world's titan-bone supply outside the elven lands. Deo Esari's priests hunt defectors relentlessly, but the mountains are vast and the eastern passes are many.

### The Southern Disaster

Two centuries ago, the southern harvesting grounds were abandoned.

The hills below the main Kelder range—Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—were once productive territory. Villages supported the harvesting operations. Generations of priests worked these sites.

Then the contamination spread.

**What Happened**

Titan bones are not uniformly safe. Most are inert—ancient material, chemically strange but not actively dangerous. But some titans died badly. Some were killed by forces that left traces. Some carried things in their marrow that survived their deaths.

The southern sites hit a bad vein. The specific nature of the contamination is recorded only in sealed priesthood archives, but the effects were unmistakable: harvesters who handled certain bones began showing symptoms within weeks. Wasting sickness. Skin discoloration. Children born wrong—or not born at all. The contamination spread through families, then through villages.

The priesthood ordered evacuation. Anyone who had worked the southern sites, anyone who had lived in the affected villages, anyone who had prolonged contact with those who had—all were relocated to quarantine settlements in the high mountains. Most died within a generation. The contamination burned through them.

**The Abandoned Lands**

The villages still stand. Ot'Pelyon and Mosimor in Tomgryir Eror. Novranas, Salenial, and Myrth in Eshbya Hills. Sarki Tulo in Kirthdron Soytas. Empty now, but intact. Clothes in wardrobes. Tools in workshops. Everyone simply left.

No one goes there anymore. The priesthood maintains warning markers at every approach. The contamination may have faded by now—or it may be waiting. No one is willing to test it.

**Economic Impact**

The southern disaster cut Deo Esari's harvesting capacity by roughly 40%. Remaining sites in the northern Kelder are worked more intensively, but total output has never recovered. This has driven titan-bone prices worldwide to unprecedented heights—which, ironically, makes defection more tempting than ever.

The priesthood's response to this pressure has been to become more insular, more secretive, more suspicious of outsiders. The disaster proved that carelessness with sacred materials brings catastrophe. They will not repeat the mistake.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (extremely advanced in ritual crafts)

**Primary Exports**: Nothing to outsiders. Limited ritual objects to confederation partners.

**Primary Imports**: Food (from Lenora), textiles, tools, anything that cannot be produced in mountain territory

Deo Esari cannot feed itself. The mountains grow little. Nearly all food comes from Lenora in exchange for titan-bone ritual objects—a dependency the priesthood accepts as the cost of their sacred duty.

The kingdom's internal economy centers on the harvesting operations: miners, porters, craftspeople who process raw bone into usable materials, artisans who create the final ritual objects. Everyone serves the bones, directly or indirectly.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: High (enhanced by hand-magic)

**Enrollment**: Mandatory service for non-priests

Deo Esari's military is small but enhanced. Every soldier bears at least basic protective tattoos—not the full priest markings, but enough to provide resistance to common threats. The priesthood guards its monopoly on advanced hand-magic, but defensive applications are shared for the kingdom's protection.

The mountain terrain provides most of their defense. Invasion through the Kelder passes would be suicidal. Deo Esari's soldiers exist mainly to guard the harvesting sites and pursue defectors.

### Geography

**Location**: Kelder Mountains, eastern Farlands

**Biomes**: Alpine, high mountain, some sheltered valleys

**Major Geographic Features**:
- **Kelder Mountains**: The entire bracket-shaped range along the Farlands' eastern edge. Titan bones throughout.
- **Mathavia Mountains**: Southern extension of the range, including some contaminated zones
- **The Abandoned Lands**: Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—off-limits since the disaster

**Rivers**:
- **Ver Pyur**: Flows from Isyherius southward
- Various mountain streams feeding into the lowland rivers

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Thillesari (in the central Kelder range)

**Major Cities** (north to south):
- **Isyherius**: Northernmost city, source of the Ver Pyur
- **Mysaneas**: Secondary administrative center
- **Leleth Serine**: Major harvesting hub
- **Ryhaneas**: Eastern slopes
- **Eyslon**: Central range
- **Iyathelneor**: Southern range (above the contaminated zone)
- **Ulfe Alari**: Southernmost active settlement

Deo Esari has cities and towns but relatively few villages. The population is concentrated—mountain living doesn't support scattered agriculture. Settlements are built near harvesting sites or along the passes that connect them.

### Relations

**Lenora**: Necessary but cool. Deo Esari needs Lenora's food; Lenora receives titan-bone ritual objects in exchange. Neither side particularly likes the other. Lenora's agricultural ambition feels vulgar to the priesthood. Deo Esari's secretiveness frustrates Lenoran merchants.

**Illron**: Warm. Both kingdoms prioritize tradition and view Lenora's growth-focused culture with suspicion. Deo Esari's disaster has only reinforced their conservatism, which aligns them further with Illron's ancient-pact philosophy.

**The Outside World**: Hostility. Outsiders are forbidden from entering Deo Esari. The eastern passes are guarded. Ships cannot approach—there is no coast. Any non-elf found within the kingdom's borders is detained, questioned, and expelled (if lucky) or imprisoned (if suspected of seeking bones).

### Primary Conflicts

- **Defection**: The ongoing leak of titan bone to the outside world. Every defector strengthens foreign powers and weakens the sacred monopoly.
- **The Contaminated Lands**: Should anyone attempt to reclaim the southern sites? The priesthood says no. Some younger elves point out that the bones there are incredibly valuable and may have been safe for decades.
- **Food Dependency**: Reliance on Lenora is uncomfortable. Some priests advocate for stricter rationing to reduce imports; others argue this would weaken the population.

### History

The elves who became Deo Esari discovered the titan bones shortly after arriving in the Farlands. They recognized what they had found: remnants of beings from before the current age, material of immense power and danger.

The priesthood formed organically—those who learned to handle the bones safely teaching those who came after. Over generations, the casual mining operations became ritualized, then sacred. By the time of the Three Kingdoms Treaty, Deo Esari was already the defined keeper of the titan dead.

The southern disaster, 200 years ago, is the defining event of recent history. It validated every conservative instinct, every warning about carelessness, every ritual restriction. The priesthood that emerged from the crisis is more cautious, more secretive, and more certain of its purpose than ever before.

### Hand-Magic (Titanic Tattoos)

The priests of Deo Esari practice **hand-magic**—a form of permanent body modification using processed titan bone. Tattoos inscribed with titan-bone ink grant various abilities depending on the pattern and placement:

- Protective wards against physical harm
- Enhanced strength or endurance
- Resistance to magical effects
- Sensory improvements
- More esoteric effects known only to senior priests

The process is painful, permanent, and sacred. Only Titanic Priests may receive full marking. The secrets of inscription are guarded absolutely—no outsider has ever learned the techniques, and defectors who flee with bone material cannot replicate the magic.

A fully marked priest bears dozens of tattoos accumulated over centuries. They are walking arsenals of subtle power. But they do not flaunt this—the marks are usually covered, revealed only when necessary.

## Dern

Tags: state

Links: States

The middle child of the Widebarrow mountain states, Dern occupies the central peaks between Thorum's northern strongholds and Mez's nightmare warrens below. It is a kingdom defined by siege—not the dramatic, banner-waving kind, but the grinding, generational kind. The Lyzine have been coming up from below for centuries. The Dernish have been pushing them back down for just as long. Neither side wins. Neither side stops.

Dern's people are hard in the way that survivors of endless war become hard: practical, suspicious of outsiders, and utterly unsentimental about violence. They don't hate the Lyzine the way softer peoples might hate an enemy. Hatred requires energy. The Dernish simply kill Lyzine the way farmers kill rats—methodically, without passion, because the alternative is being overrun. This grim pragmatism extends to everything. A Dernish proverb: "Hope is for those who've never lost a child to the deep."

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary Monarchy (War Council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (Dernish)

**Population**: 35,000

**Stability**: Somewhat Stable

**Core Values**: Vigilance, sacrifice, duty, silence

- The Crown of Dern passes through the royal bloodline, but true power lies with the War Council—seven commanders who control the nation's defenses. The current king, Aldric IV, is twelve years old. The Council rules in his name and has done so since his father died in a Lyzine raid three years ago.
- Every Dernish family owes "deep-debt"—mandatory service in the tunnel watches. One adult from each household must serve two years in five, patrolling the sealed passages and ancient mines where the Lyzine breach attempts occur. The duty is dreaded but unavoidable; those who flee are hanged, and their families inherit double debt.
- Silence is a cultural virtue. The Dernish speak quietly, value restraint, and distrust the demonstrative. This stems from practical necessity—sound carries in tunnels, and a loud voice can draw Lyzine scouts—but has become ingrained in the national character. Visitors find the Dernish disconcertingly quiet, interpreting calm as coldness.
- The dead are cremated immediately. No exceptions. Bodies left too long can be... used by things from below. This extends to battlefield protocol: Dernish soldiers carry fire kits and prioritize burning fallen comrades over recovering weapons.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Iron, copper, silver, worked metal goods

**Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, timber, alchemical supplies

- The Widebarrow Mountains hold rich veins of iron, copper, and silver that would make any nation wealthy—if mining weren't a death sentence. Dern's mines operate under military escort, with tunnel watches stationed at every shaft. Production is steady but costly in lives.
- Dernish metalwork is prized across Ve. Necessity breeds skill: their weapons are designed for close-quarters tunnel fighting, their armor optimized for protection against Lyzine venom and web. The famous "Dern-forged" blades fetch premium prices in Shyona and Avalon.
- Food is Dern's constant need. The mountain valleys produce some grain and the slopes support sheep, but it's never enough. Dern trades metal for Avalon's surplus grain, and this dependency shapes their foreign policy. They cannot afford to anger their breadbasket.
- A peculiar trade exists with Mez itself: Lyzine silk, harvested from abandoned webs or slain raiders, is worth more than silver by weight. Dernish "silk-hunters" venture into cleared tunnels to collect it—dangerous work, but profitable enough that some make a career of it.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Universal (with deep-debt rotation)

**The Tunnel Watch**: Dern's primary defensive force, numbering roughly 4,000 at any time. Tunnel Watchers are experts in subterranean warfare—they know which echoes mean danger, which passages flood seasonally, and how to fight in spaces where you can't swing a sword. Their distinctive short-hafted axes and heavy crossbows are designed for cramped combat.

**The Surface Guard**: A smaller force of 1,500 that patrols the mountain passes and protects the settlements. Less celebrated than the Tunnel Watch, but essential—the Lyzine occasionally emerge on the surface in force, and someone must meet them.

**The Sealers**: An elite corps of 200 specialists who close breached tunnels. They work with explosives, shaped stone, and a brutal willingness to collapse passages on themselves if necessary. Sealer mortality is horrific. Sealer volunteers are never lacking.

- Dern's military doctrine is purely defensive. They don't invade Mez; they can't. The tunnels below are the Lyzine's domain, and venturing deep means fighting on enemy ground against creatures perfectly adapted to darkness. Instead, Dern holds the line, seals breaches, and endures.
- Every settlement maintains "last-stand" protocols—designated fortified buildings, stockpiled weapons, and memorized evacuation routes. Children learn the drill before they learn to read.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Widebarrow Mountains, bordered by Thorum (north), Mez (below and southwest), Avalon (northwest), Shyona (northeast), and the Suki Jungle (south)

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, highland valleys, subterranean passages

**Named Entities**: Central Widebarrow Range, Promisewood (border forest with Avalon)

**Rivers & Lakes**: None named (small mountain streams)

**Adjacent Waters**: None (landlocked)

- The Central Widebarrow is less dramatic than Thorum's Steadfast peaks but more extensive—a broad band of rugged highlands that stretches from the Avalon border to the Shyonan frontier.
- Below the surface, the mountain is honeycombed with natural caves, ancient mines, and Lyzine-carved tunnels. Maps exist, but they're never complete—the Lyzine dig constantly, and new passages appear faster than the Watch can chart them.
- The Promisewood, on the northwest border, is Dern's gentlest region—a forested slope that descends toward Avalon. Timber from the Promisewood is essential for mine supports and construction. The forest is named for the marriage pacts it witnessed when Dern and Avalon's royal houses allied three centuries ago.
- The Boneswamps lie to the south, technically in Chimean territory but close enough to stain Dern's border. Ancient wars between Dern and Chimea filled those waters with corpses; now they walk again. Dernish patrols avoid the southern marches.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Dodi
**Cities**: None
**Towns**: Foster
**Villages**: Lush

**Dodi** — The capital clings to a defensive valley in the central mountains, built around the entrance to the oldest Dernish mines. Perhaps 15,000 people live here, making it by far the largest settlement. The city is constructed in concentric rings: the outermost residential districts can be abandoned and sealed if Lyzine break through; the inner fortress holds the palace, the armories, and the deepest food stores. Dodi has never fallen. The Dernish intend to keep it that way.

The Royal Forge operates here—the premier metalworking facility in Ve, where the finest Dern-forged weapons are made. Master smiths guard techniques passed down for generations. The forge's output is split between military needs and export revenue; balancing these demands is a constant political tension.

**Foster** — A fortified town on the northeastern border where Dern meets Shyona. Foster guards the only reliable pass between the two nations—a fact that gives it strategic importance far exceeding its size. The town's 3,000 residents are a mix of Dernish soldiers, merchants handling cross-border trade, and Shyonan observers who maintain a permanent "diplomatic presence" that everyone understands is espionage. Relations are polite but tense; neither side fully trusts the other, but both prefer the devil they know to the Lyzine below.

Foster's commander, Marshal Brynn Kolste, has held the post for twenty years. She's outlasted three kings and two wars, and her relationship with her Shyonan counterpart is said to be the true guarantor of the border's peace.

**Lush** — A small village of perhaps 800 souls, tucked into an interior valley that sees the most sun in all of Dern. The name is aspirational—Lush is merely less bleak than its neighbors. The village exists to farm the valley's modest fields and tend the sheep that graze the upper slopes. It's the closest Dern comes to a peaceful settlement: far from the major tunnel systems, too poor to raid, forgotten by history. Families who've served their deep-debt sometimes retire here, seeking quiet after years of darkness below.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Mez and the Lyzine**: The eternal war. Every generation thinks it might end; none have been right. The Lyzine want the surface—"their rightful place," as they see it. The Dernish want to survive. No negotiation is possible; the Lyzine don't recognize lesser species as worthy of treaties.
- **The Regency Question**: King Aldric IV is twelve. The War Council rules. Some councilors genuinely intend to surrender power when he comes of age; others have grown comfortable with authority. As Aldric grows older, this tension will break one way or another.
- **Chimean Border**: The Boneswamps and the old wars are not forgotten. Chimea claims territory Dern considers its own; Dern fortifies passes Chimea considers theirs. The conflict is frozen, not resolved—both nations have more pressing enemies, but the grudge remains.
- **Economic Dependency**: Dern needs Avalon's grain. This gives Avalon leverage that sophisticated diplomats increasingly exploit. The current trade agreements favor Avalon heavily; renegotiating them without losing food supply is a delicate problem.

### History

Dern was founded as a mining colony roughly 600 years ago, when prospectors from the lowlands discovered silver in the central Widebarrow. For two centuries, it prospered unremarkably. Then the Lyzine came.

The First Breach (approximately 380 years ago) was catastrophic. An entire mining settlement—nearly 2,000 people—vanished overnight. The survivors who escaped spoke of spider-things from below, of webs that clogged the tunnels, of beautiful, terrible voices demanding surrender. The lowland kingdoms sent armies; the armies died in the dark. Within a decade, Dern's population had halved, and the remaining survivors had learned the first harsh lessons of subterranean warfare.

The next three centuries forged modern Dern. A military monarchy emerged, built around the imperative of defense. The tunnel watches organized. The sealers developed their grim art. Dern stopped trying to exterminate the Lyzine—an impossible goal—and focused on containment. The Lyzine, for their part, never stopped trying to break through, but their efforts became raids rather than conquests.

The War of Bone (approximately 200 years ago) saw Dern's bloodiest conflict with Chimea, fought over mountain passes and mining rights. Both nations exhausted themselves; the Boneswamps are the war's lasting monument. The Treaty of Ash ended formal hostilities, but the dead in those swamps ensure neither side truly forgives.

Today, Dern endures. The Lyzine press harder in some years than others—the pattern seems random, though some scholars suggest it correlates with the spider queens' breeding cycles. The regency holds. The mines produce. The Tunnel Watch keeps vigil. And every night, somewhere in the mountains, something scratches at a sealed door from the other side.

### Hooks

- **The Child King**: Aldric IV is approaching the age where he might assert authority. He's been raised by warriors but advised by politicians. What kind of ruler will he become? Players who gain his trust could shape Dern's future.
- **The Deep Breach**: A new tunnel has been discovered—not Lyzine-dug, but ancient, predating human settlement. It goes deeper than any known passage. The Tunnel Watch is organizing an expedition. They're hiring.
- **Silk Hunters**: The reward for Lyzine silk has increased sharply. Chimean buyers are paying triple rates, no questions asked. Why do they want it? What are they making?
- **The Promisewood Marriage**: An Avalonian noble seeks a Dernish bride to seal a trade agreement. The Dernish princess in question would rather fight Lyzine than marry a soft lowlander. Complications ensue.
- **Boneswamp Stirring**: The dead in the southern marches are more active than usual. Some are wearing Dernish armor from the War of Bone. Others are wearing armor no one recognizes at all.

## Echea

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Magocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Echi (Goshwen)

**Population**: 150,000

**Stability**: Stable 

**Core Values**: Knowledge, scholarship, magical prowess, elemental control, skill

- Echea is controlled by a combination of scholars and elemental masters in a large council. Access is granted by a combination of invitation and majority vote from general population.
- Echea is largely a meritocracy. If you are smart, you are respected by your peers.
- Elemental magic is largely valued, as is technical skill. Although the Echi hate the Cogheads, they begrudgingly respect their skill.


### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very developed

**Primary Exports**: Magitech, education

**Primary Imports**: 

- Echea is home to some of the largest, most influential universities in all of Alaria. If you wish to master an element, many choose to come to the Echean universities.
	- They have paragon attuned elementalists within every discipline.
    - The universities also require you to work on artifacts part time. These are sold and help fund the university.
- Echea exports a high quantity of magical imbued artifacts, bringing in large quantities of wealth.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Extremely high

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Echean military rarely forms, but when it does, it is absolutely terrifying. The universities double as military training academies, and citizens who attend them are required to also take classes in military tactics and combat. This results in highly capable, extremely talented elemental war casters making up the majority of the Echean military forces.


### Geography

**Location**: Small mountainous peninsula at the tip of the Watar peninsula, jutting into the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, rocky coastline

**Climate**: Mediterranean at the coasts, alpine in the peaks

**Named Entities**: Iri Mountains (the two peaks that make up most of the country) 


### Political Geography

**Capital**: Adi Assabehta

**Cities**: Adal

**Towns**: 

**Villages**: 


### Primary Conflicts

- Echea is frequently the trophy of military endeavors, since it is seen as a wellspring of wealth and education to be harnessed. However, invaders have never made it to the capital.
- Echea houses many children of foreign royalty who wish to see some of the knowledge of the Echean universities rub off on their offspring, with variable success.
- Despite hundreds of years passing, the vicious hatred between Echeans and Cogheads continues. Echea conveniently ignores the Coghead genocide only 50 years ago that killed all the cogheads in echea.
- A mad scientist scholar hypothesized about the existance of a flip site of the Material Plane. Unbeknownst to anyone else, he managed to open a portal to the other side, binding the entire city of Adi Assabehta to Zylogmus Eternus. Now, people are mysteriously dying throughout the city, and some people are fleeing. Many people don't think this mysterious death thing is real (or think it's caused by other reasons), so most stay. The scholar was the first to die (freak coincidence), and no one suspects anything. Portal undiscovered. The capital will slowly empty out over the next few years as people realize that there is something causing people to mysteriously die.

### History

Two centuries ago, Cogheads and Echi worked together in the mountains. The cogheads created the machinery, and the Echi created the magic. The mountains were jointly ruled over by the two races. A friendly, but fierce rivarly between the two races existed over which technology was better—magic or machines. The Echi declared victory when they had created infinite resources from their elemental artifacts, but the Cogheads countered by developing a machine allowing them to steal the very elemental attunement out of another creature's body. They used this to say that they had in fact won. Of course, this was disputed by the gnomes. In retaliation, the cogheads sucked the extremely potent elemental attunement right out of a Echi figurehead. This was seen as an act of war, and the Echi massacred and drove the Cogheads out of the mountains. The Cogheads have never forgiven the Echi for the brutal massacre, and the Echi believe it was totally justified. This conflict has spread across ethnic lines, and many gnomes and goblins who had nothing to do with the history now have variably extreme views towards the other.

## Edari

Tags: state, ve, korel

Edari is not a state in the conventional sense—it has no government, no cities, no taxes, no laws. It is a geographic region claimed entirely by the Korel, the Wildborn Koren, who tolerate no permanent settlement within their territory.

### Government

None. The Korel organize into hunting packs of 10-40 individuals, each led by whichever member has proven strongest or most cunning. Packs are fluid—members leave and join based on personal loyalty, mating, or disputes. There is no overarching Korel authority, no council of packs, no paramount chief.

This makes diplomacy with "Edari" effectively impossible. One pack might grant safe passage; the next might hunt the same travelers for sport.

### Culture

The Korel embrace their predatory nature where their Kor cousins suppress it. They live by instinct, valuing cunning, strength, and pack loyalty above all. Their camps are temporary—hide tents, fire pits, drying racks for meat—abandoned when the game moves on.

They have no written language and little use for trade goods. What they want, they take. What they need, they hunt. Outsiders are viewed as either potential prey, potential threats, or (rarely) potential pack members. The last category requires proving oneself through trials that few non-Korel survive.

### Economy

Subsistence hunting. The Korel have no currency, no markets, no exports. They occasionally trade with Sestran merchants at the edge of their territory—furs and bones for metal tools and weapons—but such exchanges are informal and sporadic.

### Military

Every adult Korel is a hunter and fighter. Their warfare is ambush, pursuit, and overwhelming force at chosen moments. They don't hold territory in a military sense—they simply make occupying it so costly that no one tries.

Organized armies have entered Edari before. None have conquered it. The Korel simply fade into the grassland, strike supply lines, pick off stragglers, and wait for the invaders to starve or retreat.

### Relations

- **Sestros**: Uneasy coexistence. Sestran merchants trade at the border; Sestran settlers die if they cross it.
- **Shyona**: Minimal contact. The Turquish Bay and Coquray Sound provide a water barrier.
- **Others**: Edari is too remote and too dangerous for most powers to care about.

### Player Hooks

- **Crossing the Savannah**: The party needs to reach the northern coast. Do they negotiate with Korel packs, try to sneak through, or find another way?
- **Pack Politics**: A Korel pack is in conflict with neighbors. Outsiders who prove themselves might tip the balance—and earn passage.
- **Wind-Singer Territory**: Someone needs something from deep in Howlwood. The Korel won't go—the wind-singers that live there can kill a hunting party. But outsiders might be desperate or foolish enough to try.
- **Hume Une**: The abandoned Kor colony on the Estri Islands contains records and artifacts untouched for centuries. The Korel consider entering it spiritual contamination. An outsider with a boat could walk right in—if they can get past Korel waters first.

## Eidlsandres

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hidden magocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gnomes

**Population**: 15,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Secrecy, knowledge, self-sufficiency, privacy

- Eidlsandres is ruled by a council of master illusionists—the most skilled handmagic practitioners among the gnomes. Succession is based purely on demonstrated magical ability.
- The city-state doesn't officially exist. No maps show it. No trade routes lead to it. Visitors aren't welcome because visitors don't know there's anywhere to visit.
- The gnomes here have maintained total isolation for centuries. They grow their own food in the hidden valleys of the Bygone Hills, craft their own goods, and want nothing from the outside world.
- Every citizen learns the basics of illusion magic. The children's games involve creating false paths and phantom obstacles. By adulthood, most can sustain minor illusions indefinitely.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- Eidlsandres is completely self-sufficient. The Bygone Hills contain everything the gnomes need—arable land, fresh water, timber, stone, and the air leyline that powers their illusions.
- Internal economy exists but operates differently than outsider systems. Status comes from magical skill and contribution to the collective deception, not wealth.
- The gnomes produce sophisticated magical items—primarily illusion-based—but these never leave the city. The knowledge of how to make them is considered the city's most precious resource.
- No currency from outside is accepted because no outsiders are allowed to exist within the borders.

### Military

**Size**: None (traditional)

**Quality**: Extremely High (magical defense)

**Enrollment**: Universal (illusory training)

- Eidlsandres has no standing army. It doesn't need one.
- The entire region is laced with layered illusions of staggering complexity. False paths lead in circles. Phantom cliffs appear over safe ground. Real hazards are hidden behind images of meadows. The Bygone Hills themselves are one continuous trap.
- Goblins from the surrounding plains know only that their people who enter the hills never return. They don't know why—they've never found bodies, never found evidence of what killed them. They simply vanish.
- The truth is simpler and more elegant: they get lost. They walk in circles until they starve, fall into hidden ravines, or simply wander back out with no memory of where they were trying to go. The illusions don't kill; they redirect.
- In the rare event that someone penetrates the outer defenses, the gnomes can deploy more aggressive magic. But it's never been necessary.

### Geography

**Location**: The Bygone Hills, east of Glidwyn Forest, surrounded by goblin plains

**Biomes**: Hidden valleys, forested hills, agricultural terraces, mountain springs

**Named Entities**: The Bygone Hills, the Air Leyline

**Rivers & Lakes**: Springs and streams flowing from the hills, all concealed

**Adjacent Waters**: None visible

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Eidlsandres (the city itself)

**Cities**: Eidlsandres

**Towns**: Several hidden settlements throughout the hills, unnamed to outsiders

**Villages**: Agricultural hamlets in concealed valleys

### Primary Conflicts

**Maintaining the Veil**

The illusions that protect Eidlsandres require constant maintenance. The air leyline provides power, but the spells must be tended, adjusted, updated. As generations pass, some young gnomes question whether total isolation is worth the effort. So far, the elders' answer has been emphatic: yes.

**The Occasional Penetrator**

Every few decades, someone gets further into the hills than they should. A particularly perceptive traveler, a mage who senses the illusions, an accidental stumble onto a real path. When this happens, the gnomes must decide what to do. Usually, they simply erase the intruder's memory and redirect them outward. Occasionally, the situation is more complicated.

**The Air Leyline**

The leyline that runs through Eidlsandres is the source of their power—and a potential vulnerability. If it were disrupted, damaged, or drained, the illusions would fail. The gnomes guard the leyline's physical manifestation sites jealously, and study constantly to ensure they understand every fluctuation in its flow.

**The Outside World's Encroachment**

The goblin plains are chaotic but stable. The forests are steady. But the world beyond is changing—wars, migrations, magical catastrophes. Eidlsandres has survived by being irrelevant, not worth finding. If the region ever becomes strategically important, isolation may become harder to maintain.

### History

Eidlsandres was founded by gnomes fleeing persecution—the specific details lost even to them, so many generations ago that the original threat has probably ceased to exist. They found the Bygone Hills and its air leyline, recognized the potential, and began the great work of vanishing.

The first generation built the physical city. The second mastered the leyline. The third perfected the outer illusions. Each generation since has refined the techniques, adding layers, patching weaknesses, extending the protected zone further into the surrounding hills.

The gnomes remember that they came from somewhere, that they had enemies, that they chose to disappear. They've preserved this history as a warning: the outside world is dangerous, unpredictable, and best avoided. Better to tend your gardens, practice your craft, and let the chaos pass by unnoticed.

For centuries, the system has worked. The goblins of the plains treat the Bygone Hills as cursed, avoiding them instinctively. The Eloweir to the west know something strange exists to their east but have never investigated seriously. The rest of the world doesn't know the Bygone Hills contain anything more interesting than rocks and scrub.

Eidlsandres intends to keep it that way.

## Eloesi

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Democratic republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Eloweir (Sea Elves)

**Population**: 80,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Freedom, tradition, excellence, community

- Eloesi is governed by elected councils—a system the Eloweir brought with them when they first settled these shores, long before human memory. The councils are notoriously deliberative, but their decisions carry weight.
- The culture blends apparent contradictions: sailors who party through the night and fishermen who observe strict protocols about when, where, and how to harvest. Freedom within structure.
- Outsiders often mistake Eloweir casualness for softness. The sea elves are skilled soldiers and masters of poison—their relaxed demeanor comes from confidence, not weakness.
- The Eloweir have lived here longer than anyone can remember. They say their ancestors followed the tides from somewhere else, fleeing a calamity they don't name, and found this coast waiting. Whether that's history or myth, none can say.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Pearls, fish, ships, poisons, dyes, salt

**Primary Imports**: Timber, grain, metals, luxury goods

- Oyster Bay's pearls are legendary—thousands harvested each season, each one valuable, the finest worth small fortunes. The Eloweir guard the bay jealously and have refined pearl cultivation to an art form.
- Fishing and shipping form the economic backbone. Eloweir ships are built to last, designed for the unpredictable coastal waters, and command premium prices.
- Poison-craft is a respected trade here, not a shameful secret. Eloweir alchemists produce venoms for hunting, warfare, and medicine with equal skill.
- Trade flows through Kair to the goblin plains, the United Free Nations, and the wider Middle Sea. Eloesi serves as the gateway between Ofrenia and the southern interior.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Eloweir maintain a professional military of exceptional quality. Every soldier trains for years before active duty, and the standards are unforgiving.
- Naval power is paramount. The Eloweir fleet patrols the coast, protects trade routes, and can project force across the region when needed.
- Land forces are smaller but elite—skilled with spear, bow, and the traditional curved blades the Eloweir favor. Many carry poisoned weapons as a matter of course.
- The military serves the councils, not individual commanders. Political ambition among officers is viewed with deep suspicion.

### Geography

**Location**: Northwestern coast, where Ofrenia connects to the southern interior via the plains

**Biomes**: Rocky coastline, temperate forests, rolling hills, sheltered bays

**Named Entities**: Seawatch Mountains, Oyster Bay, Elessi Bay, Urchin Bay

**Rivers & Lakes**: Several rivers flowing from the Seawatch Mountains to the coast

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea, Elessi Bay, Oyster Bay, Urchin Bay

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Kair

**Cities**: Kair

**Towns**: Issasmir, Brachly, Dematir, Oakdale, Trailsfor, Zessos, Golun, Holckots, Krakersport

**Villages**: Numerous fishing villages along the coast

### Primary Conflicts

**The Goblin Chaos**

The Shiverplains and Jinxz Plains to the east and south are home to Scalawag goblin broods locked in perpetual, chaotic conflict. The goblins occasionally raid Eloweir settlements, more for sport than strategy. The Eloweir respond with punitive expeditions that accomplish little—the goblins simply scatter and regroup. It's an annoyance rather than a threat, but a persistent one.

**The Urchin Bay Question**

Urchin Bay, south of Oyster Bay, is too dangerous to harvest safely. Giant urchins and worse lurk in its waters, and ships that enter rarely return intact. Rumors persist of treasure in the depths—wrecks accumulated over centuries. Every few years, someone organizes an expedition. Most fail.

**Old Talaria's Shadow**

The fallen empire to the southwest radiates strangeness. Wild magic seeps across the border, and creatures that shouldn't exist occasionally wander into Eloweir territory. The councils maintain a standing watch along the Glass Forest border, but containment is difficult when the threat is so unpredictable.

**The Bygone Hills Mystery**

Goblins who wander into the Bygone Hills east of Glidwyn Forest never return. The Eloweir know something lurks there but have never investigated seriously—the hills aren't their territory, and whatever kills goblins efficiently is doing them a favor. Still, some councillors worry about what might emerge if it ever decides to expand.

### History

The Eloweir came to these shores in an age before human record, following currents and tides from somewhere across the sea. They speak of a homeland lost to catastrophe—some say flood, others say war, still others say both—but the details have faded into myth. What remains is the journey: generations of sea elves sailing toward a coast they'd never seen, guided by currents they trusted to lead them right.

They found a good land. Rocky coasts full of sheltered harbors. Forests for timber. Hills for grazing. And Oyster Bay, with its wealth waiting to be harvested. The Eloweir built Kair on a natural harbor, established their councils as they had in the old country, and began the slow work of making this place home.

For most of recorded history, Eloesi has been stable, prosperous, and largely uninvolved in the wars that wrack other nations. The councils prefer trade to conquest, diplomacy to battle. When threats arise—goblin raids, pirates, the occasional ambitious neighbor—the Eloweir respond with precise, professional force, then return to their nets and ships.

The fall of Old Talaria, centuries ago, changed the neighborhood permanently. Where once a powerful magical civilization bordered Eloesi to the southwest, now there's only the Glass Forest and the wild things within it. The Eloweir watched the cataclysm from a safe distance, grateful their ancestors had never trusted Talarian magic. Whatever the wizards attempted, it ended badly for everyone except the fae.

## Emblydium

Tags: state

Populated by Nydor. Located in the northwest tip of the Dragon's Spine Mountains, with the Devil Peaks to its south, the Bleeding Mountains to its north, and the Haunted Hills further north and west. Southwest of Shunda and Dhabisa in Dalizi.

## Enapay

Tags: state

An ancient Dwelyn monarchy occupying the Green Wilds at the edge of the Ishnit Jungles. For as long as the Dwelyn have existed as a people, Enapay has been their home—and for nearly as long, Surrey Mahaila has been their protector. Now the dragon sickens, and the nation faces its first true crisis in generations.

### Geography

Enapay sprawls across the Green Wilds, a transitional zone where the dense Ishnit Jungle gives way to more open woodland. The terrain is still wild—massive trees, thick undergrowth, dangerous fauna—but navigable in ways the deep jungle is not. Rivers cut through the territory, providing trade routes and defensive boundaries.

The capital, **Lise**, sits where the Ishtar River delta meets the edge of the Green Wilds, roughly thirty miles inland from the Gulf of Norag.

### Government

Enapay is ruled by a hereditary queen whose authority derives from three sources: bloodline, martial prowess, and—most importantly—her bond with Surrey Mahaila.

**The Dragonbound Queen**: The current queen, **Teyara Greenmantle**, inherited the throne and the dragon bond from her mother, who inherited it from hers. This matrilineal succession has continued unbroken since before written Dwelyn history. The queen is believed to share some portion of Surrey Mahaila's consciousness—what the dragon knows, the queen can learn, and vice versa.

**Clan Chiefs**: Below the queen, the Dwelyn organize into clans led by chiefs who earn their position through combat and the accumulation of war trophies (the beads that signify Dwelyn influence). Chiefs manage their clan's territory and contribute warriors to the queen's campaigns.

**The Empty Throne Problem**: With Surrey Mahaila ill, Queen Teyara's authority has weakened. The dragon bond still exists but feels muted, distant. Some chiefs whisper that if the dragon dies, so does the queen's legitimacy—and succession by combat might replace succession by blood.

### Culture

The Dwelyn combine elven grace with orcish pragmatism. They value both the beauty of the kill and its efficiency.

**Bead Status**: Social standing is literally worn. The more beads woven into a Dwelyn's hair—crafted from the remains of defeated enemies—the greater their influence. A heavily-beaded warrior can challenge a poorly-beaded chief; a chief with few beads rules only at the sufferance of those with more.

**Jungle Craft**: Despite living at the jungle's edge, the Dwelyn have mastered its ways. Their hunters track prey through dense undergrowth, their warriors use the terrain for ambush and escape, and their shamans brew medicines from jungle plants that outsiders have never catalogued.

**The Dragon Cult**: Surrey Mahaila is not worshipped as a god, but revered as a living ancestor. The Dwelyn believe she chose them in the time before time, and their bond with her is what separates them from mere beasts. Her illness is not just a strategic problem—it's a spiritual crisis.

### The Dragon's Sickness

Surrey Mahaila has grown weak. The emerald dragon, once capable of devastating enemy armies and inspiring terror across the region, now rarely leaves her roost. Her scales have dulled. Her mind, once sharp enough to coordinate with Queen Teyara across miles, feels foggy and slow.

The cause is known but not understood: **the Faesong has been poisoned nearby**.

Faesong—the ambient magical melody of Melera that flows through creation—runs strong through the Green Wilds. Surrey Mahaila, a dragon of darkness, water, and earth, has always been attuned to this harmony. Something has corrupted the local Faesong, and the dragon suffers for it.

What poisoned it? Theories abound:
- Shadow emergence from Ekomorn tainting the magical currents
- Demonic influence spreading from Demonwatch
- Deliberate sabotage by enemies (the Naruaghin? The snake dragons?)
- Natural magical phenomenon that will pass in time
- Something older and stranger, awakened by some unknown trigger

Queen Teyara has sent agents throughout Alaria seeking answers. Healers, druids, fae scholars, anyone who understands Faesong has been invited (or compelled) to examine the dragon. So far, nothing has worked.

### The War

Enapay's expansion into East Naruaghin territory began three generations ago and seemed destined to succeed. With Surrey Mahaila's support, Dwelyn armies pushed deep into the jungle fringe, establishing settlements and claiming the best hunting grounds.

Then the dragon sickened.

The war has shifted. Dwelyn forces fight defensively now, protecting what they've taken rather than seizing more. East Naruaghin raids strike deeper into Dwelyn territory each season. Queen Teyara must balance the need to maintain pressure against the need to conserve forces for when—if—the dragon recovers.

### Economy

Enapay trades in jungle goods: exotic feathers, rare medicines, ironwood, and the products of skilled Dwelyn craftsmanship. Their curved scimitars and bone-and-fur armor fetch high prices from merchants brave enough to reach the Green Wilds.

The nation has no port—the Gulf of Norag coast is too dangerous, and the Naruaghin control the shoreline. Trade flows overland or upriver, making commerce slow but relatively secure.

### Notable Locations

**Lise**: The capital. See separate entry.

**The Dragon's Roost**: Surrey Mahaila's lair, built into a colossal jungle tree near Lise. Once the dragon's presence radiated power; now it radiates illness.

**Ishtar Ford**: The contested border crossing, currently held by Dwelyn forces but constantly threatened.

**The Green Marches**: The newest Dwelyn settlements, carved from jungle claimed in the last century. Most vulnerable to Naruaghin counter-attack.

### Player Hooks

**Cure the Dragon**: The ultimate quest hook. Anyone who could restore Surrey Mahaila would earn the eternal gratitude of the Dwelyn queen—and the enmity of the Naruaghin.

**Faesong Investigation**: What poisoned the local Faesong? Investigating could lead to Ekomorn, Demonwatch, or somewhere else entirely.

**War Profiteering**: Both sides need weapons, information, and deniable assets. There's coin to be made in the middle of a conflict.

**Dragon Succession**: If Surrey Mahaila dies, what happens? Could another dragon be bonded? Would the nation tear itself apart in succession crisis?

## Enavadi

Tags: state, fishing, human

A poor nation of fishermen along the Seacleft Coast, Enavadi is remarkable for two things: the skill of its people on the water, and their absolute disinterest in anyone who isn't one of them. The Enavadi are not hostile to outsiders—merely indifferent. They will trade, they will provide harbor in storms, they will even be polite. But they will never consider you one of them, and they will never explain how they do what they do.

### Government

Enavadi has no king, no council of lords, no formal constitution. The closest thing to a central authority is the **Tide Council**, which meets in Edkovic when the tides are at their highest. This schedule is deliberate: only working fishermen can reliably attend meetings timed to the sea's rhythms. Anyone whose life isn't built around the water finds the schedule impossible, which is exactly the point.

The Tide Council handles matters that affect all Enavadi—disputes between villages, responses to external threats, the rare diplomatic contact with foreign powers. Its members are senior fishermen from each village's **net-councils**, the local bodies that govern daily life. Net-council membership is informal: the respected elders of each fishing family, gathering to settle disputes and coordinate the fleet. No votes are taken. Consensus emerges through discussion, and those who cannot build consensus find their opinions carry less weight over time.

This system appears chaotic to outsiders. In practice, it works because everyone shares the same values, the same rhythms, the same deep knowledge of what matters. Enavadi governance is invisible because it rarely needs to be visible.

### Culture

The Enavadi are human, with the same range of appearance found throughout the Seacleft Coast. What distinguishes them is attitude: a bone-deep certainty that their way of life is correct, complete, and in no need of outside input.

Children are on boats before they can walk. They learn the names of currents and fish before they learn to read—indeed, many Enavadi never learn to read at all, finding the skill unnecessary for a life on the water. Literacy is for record-keepers and merchants; a fisherman needs only to know the sea.

Marriage happens within the community, almost exclusively. An Enavadi who marries an outsider faces no formal sanction, but their spouse will never be fully accepted. The couple's children might be, after a generation or two, if they prove themselves on the water. Bloodlines matter less than belonging.

Religion is private and unnamed. The Enavadi acknowledge no foreign gods. They have their own understanding of the sea—its moods, its hungers, its gifts—but they do not discuss it with outsiders. Offerings are left on certain rocks. Songs are sung at certain tides. No temples are built, no priests are ordained. When a missionary arrived three centuries ago and built a temple in Edkovic, the Enavadi let him. They simply never entered it.

### The Gift of the Waters

Outsiders who visit Enavadi return with stories of impossible luck. Fish that swim into nets unprompted. Storms that split around Enavadi boats. Catches so reliable that failure seems impossible.

Ask an Enavadi fisherman about this, and they'll credit skill. Generations of training, intimate knowledge of local waters, techniques refined over centuries. This is true—the Enavadi are genuinely masterful fishermen, their knowledge accumulated and passed down with religious devotion.

But the Enavadi themselves know it's not the whole truth. Their luck is *too* good. They don't discuss it openly, but among themselves, they acknowledge that something responds to their offerings, their songs, their careful observation of taboos. They call it "respecting the sound."

What they're respecting, exactly, no one living can say with certainty. The arrangement predates memory. The terms come due so rarely that most Enavadi live their whole lives without seeing the cost. The ones who have seen it don't speak of it. The fish keep coming. The storms keep splitting. And the deep waters east of the Floss Islands remain unfished, by tradition older than any record.

### Economy

Fish. Enavadi's entire economy is fish.

The catches from Edko Sound and Prince's Bay feed markets across the Seacleft Coast. Fresh fish goes to nearby ports; preserved fish—salted, smoked, or dried by the specialists in Dijana village—travels further. Enavadi boats work year-round, varying their targets with the seasons, their techniques refined for each species and condition.

The Enavadi do not trade directly with most foreign merchants. Outsiders buy from the Stranger's Quarter in Edkovic, dealing with designated traders who serve as intermediaries. These traders are Enavadi, but ones willing to dirty their hands with foreign contact—respected for their sacrifice, slightly pitied for their burden.

### Relations

**With Linas**: Cold indifference. Linas wants shellfish from the Starfish Isles, not fish from Enavadi waters. Their interests rarely overlap, and when they do—in the northern fishing grounds—the Enavadi consider Linas harvesters clumsy amateurs who mistake money for skill.

**With Mirko**: Official disgust, practical cooperation. Mirko represents everything Enavadi culture rejects—noise, chaos, foreigners, crime. But Dijana village does quiet business with Mirko smugglers, and Enavadi preserved fish travels far through Mirko's distribution networks. The Tide Council pretends not to know. Everyone benefits.

**With Everyone Else**: Enavadi deals with the outside world through its Stranger's Quarter, accepting what trade is necessary and ignoring everything else. Foreign titles impress no one here. Foreign threats are met with polite confusion—why would anyone want to conquer a stretch of poor coastline?—followed by a quiet demonstration of how unpleasant occupation would be for the occupiers. Enavadi has never been conquered. Not because it's strong, but because conquering it would gain nothing worth the trouble.

### Notable Locations

- **Edkovic**: The capital, such as it is. A sprawling fishing port with the Great Docks, the Smoking Halls, and the Stranger's Quarter.
- **Vukaden**: Northern village known for boat-building.
- **Krizan**: Central village known for net-making and maintaining the ancient tide-charts.
- **Dijana**: Southern village known for fish preservation and quiet Mirko connections.
- **Prince's Bay**: The large southern bay, named for either a shipwrecked noble or the local slang for a big catch.
- **Edko Sound**: The sheltered waters where most fishing happens, protected by the Floss Islands.

### Player Hooks

- **The Tide-Charts**: Krizan's ancient records contain more than fishing knowledge. Patterns in the charts hint at something deeper—cycles that match no known astronomical phenomena, annotations in archaic script that speak of "the arrangement." Someone wants to study them. The Enavadi would prefer they didn't.

- **The Empty Temple**: Three centuries abandoned, the temple in Edkovic might still hold traces of whatever the missionary tried to establish. Or perhaps it holds something else now—something that moved in when the building was forgotten.

- **Prince Aldric's Heir**: A Veldoraine noble has rediscovered the old claim to "Prince Aldric of the Enavadi Shore." They want their ancestor's remains returned. They want acknowledgment. They might even want territory. The Enavadi find this amusing, for now.

- **The Deep Taboo**: What lives in the waters east of the Floss Islands? Why do the Enavadi never fish there? Someone foolish, desperate, or curious enough might try to find out.

## Enymu

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (majority), Craven (substantial minority)

**Population**: ~350,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, hard work, loyalty, simplicity, the old ways

- Enymu is ruled by **King Aldric IV**, the latest in a dynasty that has held the throne for over four hundred years. The Aldric kings are known for two things: their honor and their naivety. They keep their word, treat their subjects fairly, and somehow never quite understand that others don't share these values.
- The population is predominantly human farmers, with a substantial Craven minority. Unlike Nektuna, where Craven often face discrimination, Enymu has a long tradition of treating Craven as equals—a policy that began centuries ago when a Craven saved an Aldric king's life.
- Enymu is the breadbasket of Tarkhon. Its farms feed Nektuna's cities, its grain fills Tarkhetan's warehouses, its wool clothes the empire's soldiers. The Enymese do the work. Nektuna takes the profit. This has always been the arrangement.
- The Enymese are proud of their honesty, their work ethic, and their king. They're also quietly resentful of Nektuna's wealth, Tarkhetan's arrogance, and the sneaking suspicion that they're being exploited. But they're loyal. For now.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Simple (agricultural)

**Primary Exports**: Grain, wool, livestock, timber

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, luxury items, manufactured products

- Enymu's economy is almost entirely agricultural. Vast farms spread across the central lowlands, producing grain, vegetables, and fodder. Sheep graze the northern hills. Timber comes from the eastern forests (carefully managed—the Enymese remember what happened to the Stone Forest).
- The wealth flows out. Enymu sells cheap and buys dear. Nektuna's merchants pay what they want for Enymu grain, then charge what they want for Enymu's imports. The Enymese know they're being squeezed. They accept it because the alternative is worse.
- There are no leylines in Enymu, no magical resources, no strategic chokepoints. The land is all they have. They work it hard.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Conscription with professional core

- Enymu maintains a respectable army—not as professional as Nektuna's, but larger than its wealth would suggest. The Enymese take defense seriously.
- The core is a professional force of ~5,000 soldiers, supplemented by militia that can raise another 15,000 in emergencies. Every village maintains a trained band. Farmers drill during the slow seasons.
- This military tradition stems from Enymu's position: bordered by the Stone Forest (which must be guarded), the Wurn Mountains (which occasionally produce trouble), and Nektuna (which must be reminded that Enymu is not helpless).
- Enymu also provides conscripts for Ekfusy fortress on Midton Island—a duty the Enymese resent but fulfill.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Tarkhon, east of Nektuna, south of the Wurn Mountains

**Biomes**: Fertile farmland, rolling hills, managed forests, the Stone Forest (forbidden)

**Climate**: Temperate continental—warm summers, cold winters, reliable rainfall

**Named Features**: The Stone Forest (western border), Wurn Mountains (northern border), the Greenway (main road to Tarkhetan)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Aldrichold

**Major Cities**: None (Aldrichold is barely a city)

**Towns**: Numerous farming communities, none particularly large

### Aldrichold

The capital of Enymu is less a city than a large town that happens to contain the king's residence.

Aldrichold sits at the junction of the Greenway (the main road to Tarkhetan) and the river that waters the central farmlands. Perhaps 15,000 people live here—merchants, craftsmen, administrators, and the royal household.

The palace is modest by Tarkhon standards—a fortified manor house that has been expanded over centuries, comfortable rather than grand. The Aldric kings have never seen the point of ostentation. The money is better spent on roads, granaries, and the army.

Visitors from Nektuna often find Aldrichold quaint. The Enymese find Tarkhetan vulgar. Neither opinion changes anyone's behavior.

### King Aldric IV

The current king is forty-one years old and has ruled for eighteen years. He is, like his ancestors, honorable, hardworking, and dangerously naive.

Aldric genuinely believes that people generally mean what they say. He trusts written agreements. He assumes that if he treats others fairly, they will treat him fairly in return. This makes him an excellent ruler for his own people and a terrible negotiator with Nektuna.

**Appearance**: Tall, weathered, with the calloused hands of someone who still works his own fields occasionally. Brown hair, honest eyes, a face that can't hide what he's thinking.

**Family**: Married to Queen Sera (a minor Enymese noble). Three children: Prince Aldric (the heir, 17), Princess Maren (14), Prince Tomlen (11).

**Governing style**: Aldric rules personally, meeting with subjects, settling disputes, and generally trying to be the king he thinks his ancestors were. His advisors handle the details he finds boring—which unfortunately includes most diplomacy with Tarkhetan.

**Greatest weakness**: He believes King Selron II is his friend. Selron finds this useful.

### The Royal Advisors

**Lord Councillor Beren Thatch** — The king's chief advisor, an elderly man who has served three Aldric kings. Wise, cautious, and quietly terrified of what happens when Aldric IV dies and the untested prince takes over. He handles most negotiations with Tarkhetan and has learned to mistrust everything Nektuna's envoys say.

**Marshal Kira Stoneheart** — Commander of Enymu's forces, a Craven woman who rose through the ranks on pure merit. She's the reason Enymu's military is as good as it is. Fiercely loyal to the Aldric dynasty, which gave her opportunities no Craven would have in Nektuna.

**High Warden Gellert** — Keeper of the Stone Forest. His family has held this position for generations, maintaining the pact that keeps people out. He knows more about the forest than anyone living—and he's deeply worried about recent interest from Tarkhetan scholars.

### The Stone Forest

On the western border between Enymu and Nektuna stands one of Alaria's great mysteries: an entire forest turned to stone.

Every tree, every branch, every leaf has been petrified—transformed into gray stone that preserves perfect detail. Animals caught in the transformation remain frozen mid-step, mid-flight, mid-hunt. The forest is silent, motionless, eternal.

**The Pact**: Entry to the Stone Forest is forbidden by ancient agreement between Enymu and Nektuna. The pact is "long forgotten" in the sense that no one remembers the exact terms or who made it—but everyone knows the rule: stay out.

**The Titan Crystals**: In the roots of the stone trees lie strange formations called titan crystals. These crystals, when touched by sentient beings, ring out at a frequency only titans can hear—a sound that may cause **Hykravones** (slumbering titans buried deep in the earth) to stir.

**The Wardens**: Enymu maintains a force of Stone Wardens who patrol the forest's borders, turning away the curious, the greedy, and the foolish. They don't enter the forest themselves. They just make sure no one else does either.

**Recent Concerns**: Scholars from Tarkhetan have shown increased interest in the Stone Forest. They want to study it, catalog it, perhaps extract samples. High Warden Gellert has refused all requests, citing the pact. Lord Councillor Beren backs him. But the scholars have King Selron's ear, and Selron has been hinting that perhaps the pact is... outdated.

### The Craven of Enymu

Unlike in Nektuna—where Craven are second-class citizens at best—Enymu has a long tradition of equality between humans and Craven.

The tradition began four centuries ago, when a Craven farmer saved King Aldric I from assassins. The king declared that any people who would risk their lives for the crown deserved full citizenship. His descendants have honored this decree.

Today, Craven hold positions throughout Enymese society: farmers, merchants, soldiers, even nobility (the Stoneheart family was ennobled two generations ago). Marshal Kira Stoneheart is the most prominent example, but she's not unique.

This equality makes Enymu unusual in Tarkhon and creates interesting dynamics:
- Craven from Nektuna sometimes emigrate to Enymu for better treatment
- Nektuna's human nobility finds Enymu's policies distasteful
- Enymu's Craven are among the crown's most loyal supporters

### Primary Conflicts

**The Exploitation**

Enymu feeds Tarkhon but sees little of the wealth. Nektuna's merchants set the prices, Nektuna's ships carry the goods, Nektuna's banks collect the profits. The Enymese work, and Nektuna takes.

This has always been true. What's changed is awareness. Younger Enymese are asking questions their parents didn't: Why do we accept these terms? What would happen if we demanded better? The king's advisors worry about where these questions lead.

**The Stone Forest Pressure**

Tarkhetan scholars want access to the Stone Forest. They've written papers about the "scientific value" of studying the petrification effect. They've proposed "carefully controlled expeditions" to extract titan crystals for research.

High Warden Gellert and Lord Councillor Beren have refused, citing the ancient pact. But King Selron has been pressuring King Aldric, suggesting that surely old superstitions shouldn't stand in the way of knowledge. Aldric, who trusts Selron, is wavering.

If someone enters the Stone Forest and touches the titan crystals... the consequences could be catastrophic.

**The Succession**

Prince Aldric is seventeen, untested, and not obviously suited to rule. He has his father's honesty but perhaps not his father's character. Lord Councillor Beren worries that the prince might be easier to manipulate than the king—and that Nektuna knows it.

**The Northern Border**

The Wurn Mountains occasionally produce trouble—bandits, monsters, and sometimes organized raids from the Stone Men who live in the high peaks. Enymu's army handles these threats, but resources are stretched. Every soldier watching the mountains is a soldier not watching the Stone Forest.

### History

**The Founding** (~400 years ago): The Aldric dynasty established Enymu as a distinct state within the growing Tarkhon Empire. They negotiated favorable terms—or what seemed favorable at the time.

**The Craven Decree** (~400 years ago): King Aldric I granted full citizenship to all Craven after one saved his life. This policy has continued ever since.

**The Stone Forest Pact** (date unknown, predates Enymu): At some point, Enymu and Nektuna agreed to forbid entry to the Stone Forest. The exact terms and reasons have been lost. The prohibition remains.

**The Long Peace**: Enymu has never fought a war against Nektuna or any other Tarkhon state. The Aldric kings have always preferred negotiation. Whether this represents wisdom or weakness depends on who you ask.

**The Present**: King Aldric IV maintains the dynasty's traditions of honor, hard work, and loyalty to Tarkhon. But pressures are building—economic exploitation, Stone Forest interest, succession concerns—that may force choices his ancestors never faced.

### The Turning Question

The note in the old records says Enymu "could be persuaded to turn on Nektuna, but only with some difficulty."

What would it take?

- **Proof of betrayal**: If Aldric learned that Selron had been deliberately deceiving him for years, his sense of honor might demand response.
- **Stone Forest violation**: If Nektuna violated the pact and caused a catastrophe, Enymu would never forgive.
- **Craven persecution**: If Tarkhetan tried to impose Nektuna's anti-Craven policies on Enymu, the crown would resist.
- **The right manipulator**: Someone who understood Aldric's honor might be able to twist it against Nektuna—making him believe that loyalty required defiance.

For now, Enymu remains loyal. But loyalty built on naivety is fragile. And someday, Aldric IV will learn what Selron II really thinks of him.

## Eoga

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Elected council

**Primary Inhabitants**: Caerine, dark skinned, beautiful, intimidating

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Very stable

**Core Values**: Peace, isolation, forgiveness, free thought, creativity

- The are well hidden within the jungle, as they don't wish to be found.
- Council members are democratically elected once every 20 years.


### Economy

**Size**: Very small

**Tech**: Very developed

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- The Eoga have been around for millenia and have developed an absurdly close connection with nature, which serves them in all ways. Animals do anything they are asked, their houses are built into the trees, their tools naturally repair themselves, and so on.


### Military

**Size**: Very small

**Quality**: Extremely high

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- A small, elite fighting force exists within Eoga. They are rarely deployed to do anything, but they are both diplomats, fighters, emmisaries, and healers. 
- Training with a bow begins in early childhood and never stops. Nearly everyone of adult age is also a very capable archer.

### History

Eoga and Vystrilik were once one nation, before Hykravones came and destroyed the world. After the titan destroyed the world, the Eoga broke away from Vystrilik, in shame. They were disappointed that they had not died as well, with the humans and other races of the world. This shame has remained with them this day. Although they are virtually unfindable within the jungle, should a child of Gaiea find them, the Caerine would gladly give them anything they wanted.

## Erasnus

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal, House of Nobles and House of Commerce

**Primary Inhabitants**: Belenstrope (Halflings)

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Wealth, prestige, intelligence, vision, entrepreneurship

- Erasnus is jointly ruled by two parliamentary houses—the House of Nobles and the House of Commerce. These consist of the highest-ranking members of society within the two most important areas of Erasnun life.
- Nearly every village, town, and city is home to multiple nobility, as well as their extended family. Practically everyone has at least a cousin who's distantly related to some noble family.
- Belenstrope halflings have transformed commerce into high art. They trade in influence, information, and favors with complexity that makes seasoned diplomats dizzy. Every Belenstrope maintains a mental ledger of social debts tracked across generations.

### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Textiles, trade services, financial instruments

**Primary Imports**: Everything

- Members of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance—and its most profitable member. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold the alliance together as it fractures.
- Home to the best overland merchants in Alaria. Their ability to haggle is unparalleled, their eye for a good deal uncanny.
- Lending, business, entrepreneurship, and traveling merchant are all extremely common professions.
- Super close trading partners with Watar, and strong relationships with all Aldriktch members.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Military enrollment is mandatory, but there are a thousand ways to wiggle out of it—meaning it consists primarily of the poor and less influential.
- Working in the military is seen as a job for idiots who can't turn a profit on their own.
- The population is largely non-violent. If threatened with a sharp stick, most Erasnuns would throw up their hands and hand over their money. Much easier to make money trading than risk getting hurt.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Middle Sea region, bordered by Camaran (east), Ubrik (southeast), Myorna (northeast), Hephake mountains (north), Anarak (west, barely), and the Crags of Geth (west)

**Biomes**: Rolling farmland, river valleys, temperate forests, trade roads everywhere

**Climate**: Temperate—good growing weather, mild seasons

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Erdene

**Cities**: Erdene, Minoz, Adnar, Traduci, Simonsor

**Towns**: Countless market towns and trading posts along the major routes

### Primary Conflicts

**The Alliance Collapse**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Camaran is isolating, Ubrik is collapsing under the silvertongue outbreak, Watar and Bestacia are fighting over the strait. Erasnus profits most from the alliance and is desperately trying to hold it together through diplomacy, trade incentives, and sheer nervous energy.

**The Myorna Problem**

Myorna, to the northeast, is a backstabbing mess of elven politics. They were barely let into the Trade Alliance—pushed through by Bestacian diplomats hoping it would deter war. Now Myorna's internal chaos is spilling outward, and Erasnus is caught dealing with unreliable partners and shifting alliances.

**The Novglim Displacement**

In the Novglim Forest (northeast, just south of Myorna), native gnome tribes have been displaced by expanding settlements and logging operations. The situation is uncomfortable—Erasnus benefits from the resources but knows the displacement is wrong. Mostly they try not to think about it.

**The Goblin Posturing**

West of Erasnus, across the Crags of Geth, lies Griselia—a collection of goblin city-states. The goblins are perpetually posturing, threatening invasion, and making dramatic proclamations. They will absolutely never actually invade. Everyone knows this. Trade continues regardless, punctuated by theatrical diplomatic incidents that both sides secretly enjoy.

**Military Resentment**

The military is disrespected, underfunded, and staffed by those who couldn't escape service. But military leadership does control real power, and some officers are tired of being scorned by nobles and merchants who've never held a sword. If things get bad enough, a military coup isn't impossible.

### History

Erasnus grew wealthy by being in the middle of everything. While other nations fought wars, the Belenstrope traded with all sides. While empires rose and fell, Erasnun merchants maintained their routes.

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance was largely Erasnun diplomacy—convincing rival states that open trade benefited everyone (especially Erasnus). For decades, it worked beautifully. The alliance made everyone richer and wars less likely.

Now the alliance is crumbling. Erasnus has no army worth mentioning, no walls that could stop a real invasion, and no plan for a world where trade doesn't solve every problem. The merchants are getting nervous.

## Eros

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Nemo

**Population**: 2,500

**Stability**: Very stable

### Primary Conflicts

- The Nemo hate worldly possessions, food, and anything else that outsiders bring, as it reminds them of what they have lost
- Despite their downfall being attributed to their own pride, the Nemo view it as a tragic injustice, and not their fault. This bitterness towards the outsider world affects many of their relations.
- Few people wish to take control over the forests, as they are haunted by the souls of the Nemo.
- Some of the Nemo wish to have their forest destroyed, so they can finally be set free.


### History

## Ethadia

Tags: state, kingdom, shacklands, maritime

The kingdom of clean hands and dirty money. Ethadia occupies the Strymün Isles—a volcanic archipelago in the Gindrik Sea—and has survived for eight centuries by making itself useful to everyone and threatening to no one. Their ships carry Kuzagt salt to markets that would never trade with Bonnetaz directly. Their banks hold deposits from Gorathi merchants and escaped slaves alike. Their diplomats speak every language, follow every custom, and commit to nothing.

This is not neutrality. Neutrality implies principle. Ethadia practices profitable cowardice—and has grown rich doing so.

To the older generation, this is wisdom: survival through accommodation. To the younger generation, increasingly, it is shame.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Aristocratic republic (Crown + Council of Families)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (majority), mixed maritime populations

**Population**: ~70,000 (50,000 in Regina, 15,000 in Sivirine, 5,000 scattered)

**Stability**: Stable but aging (succession concerns)

**Core Values**: Discretion, commerce, neutrality, pragmatism

#### The Crown and the Council

Power in Ethadia divides between two institutions that spend as much energy fighting each other as governing.

**The Crown** is hereditary within the Aldric dynasty, currently worn by **Queen Morvena III** (age 67, ruling for 31 years). The Crown controls the royal fleet, sets harbor fees, conducts foreign policy, and maintains the appearance of unified rule. In practice, the Crown's power extends only as far as its revenue—and the Families control most of the revenue.

**The Council of Families** represents twelve noble houses, each holding their seat by hereditary right. These families own the merchant houses that generate Ethadia's wealth. They set trade policy, control banking, and check every royal initiative that threatens their interests. Conflict between Crown and Council is constant, bitter, and carefully constrained—neither side wants to break the system that enriches both.

The current queen has maintained balance for three decades through a combination of strategic marriages, selective bribery, and the threat of exposing each Family's dirty secrets. She is aging, her designated heir is young, and several Families smell opportunity.

#### The Twelve Families

Each Family specializes in specific aspects of Ethadia's economy:

- **House Valdren**: Primary handlers of Bonnetaz trade; the Family most implicated in slavery-adjacent commerce
- **House Mircalis**: Gorathi connections; timber, hardwoods, and the ugly business of moving cargo Gorath prefers to keep quiet
- **House Petrani**: Banking; rumored to hold deposits from half the criminals in the Gindrik Sea
- **House Thorne**: Fishing and food distribution; least politically ambitious, most practically essential
- **House Corvallo**: Information brokers; they know things, and they sell that knowledge
- **(Seven others)**: Various specializations in shipping, insurance, luxury goods, and services the Crown prefers not to examine closely

#### The Common Population

Ethadian commoners enjoy practical freedoms unusual in the region. The kingdom needs skilled sailors, competent clerks, and reliable workers—oppressing them would be economically foolish. A capable commoner can accumulate wealth, own property, and live comfortably.

They cannot, however, accumulate power. Political voice remains firmly with Crown and Families. Commoners serve; they do not rule. This arrangement has persisted because prosperity makes it tolerable. How long that tolerance would survive economic hardship remains untested.

### Religion & Culture

#### The Religion of Getting Along

Ethadia observes standard Alarian religious practices without distinctive fervor. Temples to major deities operate in both cities. The population is conventionally pious in the way of people who have more pressing concerns.

One exception: mariners throughout the kingdom venerate **Pelagos**, a local spirit or minor deity associated with safe passage. Before every voyage, sailors pour fish blood into the harbor and toss coins into the sea. Whether Pelagos exists, whether these offerings accomplish anything, is a matter of faith. What matters is that the tradition continues.

#### The Ethadian Character

Ethadians are often described as slippery—not dishonest exactly, but resistant to commitment. They speak in qualifications. They hedge their positions. They maintain relationships with parties who despise each other. This is cultural adaptation, not individual failing. In a kingdom that survives by accommodating everyone, rigidity is death.

The older generation prizes discretion above all. What you know matters less than what you *admit* knowing. A successful Ethadian merchant can sit across the table from a Kuzagt bone-worker and a Free Isles abolitionist in the same day without expressing an opinion that would offend either.

The younger generation finds this exhausting. Some have begun speaking more directly—about Bonnetaz's camps, about Gorath's brutality, about Ethadia's profitable complicity. Their elders consider this dangerous idealism. The young consider it basic decency.

#### Generational Tension

The conflict between accommodation and resistance plays out in families across the kingdom. Parents who built careers on discretion watch their children openly question the moral cost of Ethadian prosperity. Children who grew up comfortable wonder why comfort required such compromise.

This tension has not yet produced organized resistance. It has produced awkward dinner conversations, strained relationships, and a growing sense that something must eventually change. What, when, and how violently remain open questions.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium (regionally significant)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Transshipped goods (salt, timber, exotic materials), financial services, information

**Primary Imports**: Food (supplement), luxury goods, skilled labor

#### The Transshipment Trade

Ethadia produces little of unique value. Its wealth comes from moving other peoples' goods:

- Kuzagt salt becomes "Ethadian salt" when shipped under Ethadian flags to markets that won't deal with Bonnetaz
- Gorathi timber becomes "Gindrik lumber" through similar alchemy
- Goods of questionable origin pass through Ethadian warehouses and emerge with clean paperwork

The markup on this rebranding is substantial. Buyers pay premium for not knowing where their purchases originated.

#### Banking

The major Families offer financial services with legendary discretion. Deposits are secure. Loans are available. No one asks where the money came from. This policy has made Ethadia the preferred banking center for the Gindrik Sea region—including clients whose money the Families would rather not examine closely.

#### Information

Ethadian merchants travel everywhere, hear everything, and remember what they hear. This information has value, carefully commodified and sold to interested parties. House Corvallo has built an entire enterprise on knowing things others don't—and knowing who would pay to know them.

#### Neutral Ground

Enemies meet in Ethadian territory to negotiate truces, exchange prisoners, or conduct business impossible elsewhere. Ethadia charges for this service: hosting fees, security guarantees, witness services, and the implicit promise of discretion. Some of history's most significant treaties were negotiated in Regina's back rooms.

### Military

**Size**: Small (deliberately limited)

**Quality**: Moderate (naval focus)

**Enrollment**: Professional only

#### The Defensive Fleet

Ethadia maintains approximately forty naval vessels—enough to discourage casual piracy, insufficient to threaten any major power. The fleet's primary purpose is escort duty: protecting Ethadian merchants from the hazards of the Gindrik Sea.

This limitation is intentional. An armed Ethadia would frighten its neighbors and invite the very conflicts it seeks to avoid. The Families prefer spending money on commerce rather than conquest.

#### Land Forces

Minimal. A small professional guard maintains order in the cities. Beyond that, the population is expected to arm itself if circumstances require—though no one expects circumstances to require it. The Strymün Isles' geography makes invasion difficult, and Ethadia relies on diplomatic relationships rather than walls.

#### The Strategic Reality

Ethadia cannot defend itself against a determined major power. It survives because conquering it would damage trade networks that benefit everyone. If that calculation ever changed—if Gorath decided it wanted the islands, or the Kuzagt decided Ethadia had outlived its usefulness—the kingdom would fall.

The Families know this. They ensure it doesn't happen by remaining indispensable.

### Geography

**Location**: Strymün Isles, Gindrik Sea (Shacklands region)

**Biomes**: Temperate volcanic islands, temperate forest

**Named Regions**: Strymün (main island), the Strymün Isles (satellites)

**Adjacent Waters**: Gindrik Sea

The archipelago consists of one major island and numerous smaller satellites:

**Strymün** (main island): Approximately eighty miles long and forty wide, dominated by twin volcanic peaks—Mount Aldris (dormant) and Mount Brevani (venting steam and occasional ash). The Greenwood covers the mid-slopes; the coasts range from rocky cliffs to protected harbors.

**The Strymün Isles**: A dozen inhabited islets plus countless rocks and shoals, scattered northeast of the main island. Most support small fishing communities.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Regina (~50,000)

**Secondary City**: Sivirine (~15,000)

**Scattered Settlements**: Fishing villages, farming communities (~5,000 total)

#### Regina

The capital sprawls across Strymün's southern harbor—a natural bay so perfect for shipping that the city's founding was inevitable. Regina is commerce made physical: warehouses, counting houses, the Merchant's Exchange, and the Aldric Palace watching over it all. The twelve Family compounds form a ring around the palace, each a small fortress competing in architectural display.

#### Sivirine

The second city faces the open Gindrik from the northwest coast. Where Regina is cosmopolitan and commercial, Sivirine is working-class and resentful. The population traces its ancestry to the original founders; they speak older dialects, observe older customs, and maintain older grudges against the capital. The Fisher's Council holds real power here, not the Crown's appointed governor.

### Relations

**Bonnetaz**: Essential trading partner. House Valdren handles most Kuzagt trade, rebranding salt and bone-goods for markets that won't deal with slavers directly. Both parties profit. Neither discusses what makes the arrangement necessary.

**Gorath**: Careful distance. House Mircalis maintains connections for timber and other goods, but Ethadia avoids deeper entanglement. The Gorathi are too aggressive, too militaristic, and too likely to eventually want the Strymün Isles.

**Tamadrez/Yava**: Regular trade through the neutral port. Ethadian merchants are among Yava's most reliable customers.

**The Free Isles**: Complicated. Some Isles welcome Ethadian trade; others view them as collaborators with slavers. Ethadian merchants tread carefully, emphasizing their own non-participation in slavery while avoiding discussion of where their money comes from.

**Trømgar**: Distant but watching. The dwarven kingdom dislikes anyone who profits from Drasnian suffering. Ethadia has not yet crossed whatever line would provoke action—but the dwarves have long memories.

### History

Ethadia was founded approximately eight centuries ago by refugees from a mainland conflict whose details have been deliberately obscured. The founders established Regina as a trading post, built relationships with the Kuzagt (then a minor power), and gradually accumulated wealth sufficient to buy independence.

The kingdom's history since has been remarkably uneventful by regional standards. No great wars. No dramatic conquests. No existential crises. Just centuries of careful accommodation, profitable neutrality, and the steady accumulation of wealth.

This stability is Ethadia's greatest achievement and its greatest vulnerability. The kingdom has never been tested. When Queen Morvena dies—and she is sixty-seven—the succession may provide that test.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Succession**: Queen Morvena's designated heir is young and untested. Several Families believe they could do better. When the queen dies, the careful balance she maintained may collapse into civil conflict—or worse, outside intervention by powers who prefer a weaker Ethadia.

**The Youth Movement**: Younger Ethadians increasingly reject their parents' accommodation. Some organize secretly, planning to disrupt the slave trade their kingdom enables. Others simply leave, seeking lives less morally compromised. Either trend, if it accelerates, could destabilize the kingdom.

**House Valdren's Secret**: The Family most involved with Bonnetaz trade has recently received unusual requests—and unusual payments. Something is happening in the Kuzagt council, and Valdren knows more than they're sharing.

**The Sivirine Question**: Resentment in the second city has simmered for generations. The current governor maintains peace, but he is a Thorne cousin, not a leader. If Regina's attention wavers during a succession crisis, Sivirine might finally push back.

**Pelagos**: The sailors' spirit has been silent lately. Offerings go unanswered. The superstitious worry something has changed in the Gindrik Sea—something that may require more than fish blood to address.

## Glivornax

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

The most diplomatically sophisticated of the six orc states, Glivornax occupies the northwestern Wildwood between Hedroscobb and Uhionai. The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of the entire Tolkarsus watershed, and they fight Tarn for access to Plenjorn Swamp—where the Grand Tolkarsus river's waters possess miraculous healing properties.

### Overview

Glivornax is often called the "civilized" orc state—a term the Glivornaxi neither embrace nor reject. They have actual diplomats, written records (crude but functional), and something approaching consistent law. They're the only orc state that trades openly with the Vogenfeld dwarves, and the only one that has ever successfully negotiated with Tarkhon.

This relative sophistication comes from necessity. Glivornax fights for access to something other powers want: the healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp (controlled by Tarn). Defending their claim against Tarn's spirit warriors while also fighting Hedroscobb over the Yugurbas Dyos marshes requires more than brute strength.

### Government

**Type:** Council of Elders

The Glivornaxi are ruled by a council of the oldest and most scarred warriors—those who have survived decades of combat and proven their wisdom through endurance. Decisions require consensus, which means Glivornax moves slowly but with united purpose.

**Current Council:**
- **Elder Vorsha Swamp-Mother** — Eldest living Glivornaxi, over ninety years old. Her body is more scar tissue than skin. She counsels patience above all.
- **Elder Grukk River-Watcher** — Master of the swamp patrols, responsible for defending the healing waters.
- **Elder Thessik Spear-Broken** — Lost his arm to a Hedroscobbi axe in the Yugurbas Dyos; now leads diplomatic efforts and trade negotiations.

### Culture

**The Glivornaxi** have muddy green skin and dark, solid-colored eyes. They're primarily spear-fighters who've developed defensive combat styles optimized for swamp terrain—phalanx formations, fighting retreats, using the water and mud to negate enemy advantages.

**Core Values:** Defense of the sacred waters, patience, unity, survival through wisdom rather than aggression.

**The Healing Secret:** The Glivornaxi don't advertise the full extent of Plenjorn Swamp's power. Outsiders know the waters have some healing properties; few know that bathing in the swamp can cure even mortal wounds. If the truth spread widely, Glivornax would face invasion from every direction.

### Economy

**Size:** Small
**Tech:** Somewhat Developed (by orc standards)

**Exports:** Swamp herbs, preserved fish, leather goods, limited quantities of healing water (sold at enormous prices to trusted buyers)

**Imports:** Metal weapons and tools (primarily from Vogenfeld), grain, cloth

The Glivornaxi are primarily subsistence-focused—fishing, hunting, gathering swamp plants. But the healing water trade provides enough wealth to import the metal goods they can't produce themselves.

### Military

**Size:** Medium
**Quality:** High (defensive specialists)
**Enrollment:** Universal (all adults train)

The Glivornaxi military is built for defense. Their warriors train in phalanx formations using long spears, optimized for swamp terrain where they can control chokepoints and negate numerical disadvantage.

**Tactics:** The Glivornaxi never fight on open ground if they can avoid it. They retreat into the wetlands, where their knowledge of paths, depths, and dangers gives them enormous advantage. Pursuing armies find themselves mired in mud, picked off by spear-thrusts from concealment, or simply lost in the endless swamps.

**The Watershed Patrols:** Elite warriors who monitor the borders constantly, alert for Hedroscobbi algae-gatherers in Yugurbas Dyos or Tarni incursions into contested swampland.

### Geography

**Location:** Northwestern Wildwood, between Cykravikus Lake and the Yugurbas Dyos marshes

**Biomes:** Temperate forest transitioning to wetland; swamps and marshes along the eastern border

**Rivers & Lakes:** The upper Tolkarsus watershed; tributaries feed into Tarn's territory downstream

**Borders:**
- North: Uhionai territory (Ryunimir Forest)
- East: Tarn (hostile; the Water War over Plenjorn Swamp access)
- South: Hedroscobb (hostile; the War of the Marshes over Yugurbas Dyos)
- Southwest: Yugurbas Dyos (contested marshlands with Hedroscobb)

### Relations

**Hedroscobb:** Open warfare. The Hedroscobbi need swamp algae from Yugurbas Dyos to forge their corrosive armor. The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of all the Tolkarsus watershed. This War of the Marshes has continued for over a century—neither side can afford to lose.

**Tarn:** Open hostility. Tarn controls Plenjorn Swamp and its healing waters; Glivornax fights for access. The Tarni spirit weapons are terrifying—they attack souls directly—but the Glivornaxi are tenacious defenders. Neither side can win outright.

**Uhionai:** Respectful distance. The tree-orcs understand guardianship of sacred places. Occasional diplomatic contact; no conflicts.

**Grieb:** Minimal contact. The lakemen's hill territory is far from Glivornax's concerns, and fighting aquatic orcs in their home waters isn't worth it anyway.

**Shazuihn:** No direct contact. Tarn lies between Glivornax and the boar riders.

**Vogenfeld:** Trade partners (through difficult routes that skirt Hedroscobb). The dwarves provide metal; Glivornax provides information about orc movements. Both sides benefit, though neither fully trusts the other.

**The Orc Moot:** Glivornax participates but rarely leads. They prefer the status quo—endless low-level conflict that keeps other states too busy to threaten the swamp.

### Conflicts

**The War of the Marshes:** The southern conflict. Hedroscobb needs algae from Yugurbas Dyos to forge their signature armor. Glivornax considers all the watershed sacred. Armed expeditions clash every algae-harvesting season. Neither side can afford to lose—for Hedroscobb, it's their military advantage; for Glivornax, it's their identity as guardians.

**The Water War:** The eastern conflict. Tarn controls Plenjorn Swamp; Glivornax fights for access to the healing waters. Both states know that whoever controls the swamp controls the region. The Tarni fight with spirit weapons that damage souls; the Glivornaxi fight with terrain knowledge and defensive formations. Neither can win outright.

**Two-Front War:** Glivornax is the only orc state fighting on two fronts simultaneously. The strain shows. They can't commit fully to either conflict without leaving the other border exposed. This strategic weakness is balanced only by the fact that Hedroscobb and Tarn are also too busy with their own problems to exploit it.

### Player Hooks

- Seek healing in Plenjorn Swamp (requires getting through both Glivornaxi and Tarni territory)
- Negotiate between Glivornax and Tarn over swamp access
- Defend a Glivornaxi patrol against Hedroscobbi Gatherers in Yugurbas Dyos
- Escort a diplomatic mission to Vogenfeld (navigating around Hedroscobb)
- Investigate why the healing waters are said to be weakening

## Glorin

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Clan-based confederation

**Primary Inhabitants**: Glorindian (Gold Eyes Dwarves)

**Population**: 15,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Secrecy, worthiness, clan loyalty, the earth's gifts

- Glorin is governed by a loose confederation of mining clans, each controlling different sections of the vast underground workings. Clan elders meet to resolve disputes and coordinate when necessary, but mostly each clan manages its own affairs.
- The Glorindians are secretive by nature and by necessity. Their golden eyes can sense precious metals through solid stone—a gift that has made them targets of exploitation throughout history. They've learned to keep quiet about their wealth.
- They believe gold calls to those worthy of finding it, and that hoarding beyond one's needs brings misfortune. Wealth flows through the community rather than pooling in individual hands.

### Economy

**Size**: Large (secretly massive)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Gold, precious metals (in controlled quantities)

**Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, surface goods

- Glorin sits atop one of the richest gold deposits in Alaria. The Glorindians have mined it for generations, carving vast underground chasms in pursuit of precious veins.
- The true scale of their wealth is unknown to outsiders. The Glorindians deliberately limit their visible exports to avoid attracting attention. What the world sees is a modest mining operation; what exists below is staggering.
- Trade with Kazül is steady but unremarkable. The Glorindians prefer it that way.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (clan obligation)

- Each clan maintains its own warriors, primarily for defending the mines. The Glorindians have no interest in conquest—they just want to be left alone.
- The mountains and tunnels are their best defense. Invaders who don't know the passages get lost, trapped, or worse.

### Geography

**Location**: Between Thespia (north) and Kazül (south), centered on the Whistle-Stone Mountains

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, deep valleys, vast underground complexes

**Climate**: Temperate mountain—cool summers, cold winters

**Named Features**: Whistle-Stone Mountains (named for the eerie sound of wind through the peaks)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Gamgara (surface settlement above the main mine complex)

**Cities**: Gamgara

**Towns**: Matabono, Zubaydah, Taufig

### The Underground

The surface settlements are just the tip. Below lies a network of mine shafts, tunnels, and vast underground chasms where the Glorindians have extracted gold for centuries. Some chambers are so large they have their own weather. The deepest workings are clan secrets, known only to those who labor there.

The wealth down there is almost incomprehensible. The Glorindians have mined tons upon tons of gold—and they're still finding more. Their auric sight means they never dig blind; they always know where the veins run.

### The Whistle-Stone Mountains

The mountain range that defines Glorin. The peaks are riddled with natural caverns and tunnels that create an eerie whistling sound when wind passes through. Outsiders find it unsettling; the Glorindians consider it the voice of the mountains.

### Primary Conflicts

**Staying Hidden**

The Glorindians' greatest challenge is remaining unremarkable. If the outside world understood how much gold lies beneath these mountains, every kingdom within marching distance would find a reason to invade. So they export modest amounts, live modestly on the surface, and keep the vast underground wealth secret.

**Morgnor's Interest**

The dragon Morgnor, King of the Mountains to the northwest, knows about Glorin. He knows about the gold. He hasn't moved yet—perhaps he's patient, perhaps he's waiting for the right moment, perhaps he's dealing with other matters first. But the Glorindians are aware that a dragon's eye has turned their way.

When Morgnor decides to act, Glorin's secrecy won't save them. Their small military won't stop a dragon. They're quietly trying to figure out what to do about this—but options are limited when you can't ask for help without revealing what you're protecting.

### History

The Glorindians found these mountains generations ago, drawn by the call of gold that only they could hear. They dug deep, found riches beyond imagining, and learned to keep quiet about it. History taught them that their gift made them valuable—and being valuable to the powerful is dangerous.

So they built modest surface towns, traded modest amounts of gold, and let the world forget about them. It worked. Glorin became a footnote, a small mining state between more interesting neighbors.

Now Morgnor threatens that peace. The dragon has noticed what the world has not. The Glorindians face a choice they've spent centuries avoiding: reveal their wealth to seek allies, or face the dragon alone.

## Gondurak

Tags: state, fengruk, dragons-spine-coast, forges

A dwarven kingdom carved into the Bellowing Mountains at the far southern reach of the Dragon's Spine. Gondurak is home to the Fengruk—the Forgewarden dwarves who inherited the titan-built forges and have spent millennia mastering their use. The kingdom is cold, isolated, and defined by three things: fire, metal, and an ancient debt they believe they still owe.

Roughly forty thousand Fengruk live within Gondurak's borders, concentrated in three mountain cities and the fortress of Azanfrain. The population has never fully recovered from the collapse of the titan-era support system, and the Fengruk have adjusted their ambitions accordingly. They don't seek expansion or conquest. They seek perfection—in metalwork, in craft, in the endless refinement of techniques their ancestors learned from beings far greater than themselves.

### The Three Families

Gondurak's government descends from King Gondur, a Fengruk leader who united the scattered forge-clans approximately four thousand years ago. Upon his death, his three children—Sildraz, Morgrun, and Durkarn—each claimed one of the great forges, establishing the tripartite structure that persists today.

The families rule their respective cities with near-absolute authority, while a **Council of Embers** handles kingdom-wide matters. The Council meets in Sildraz (the capital by tradition and population), with each family sending three representatives. Decisions require consensus, which makes the Council slow but stable. Major disagreements are rare; the families learned long ago that civil conflict serves no one when existential threats lurk to the south.

The current family heads:
- **Theldris Sildraz** (female, 340 years) — Cautious, traditionalist, obsessed with maintaining the World Forge's reputation
- **Kornath Durkarn** (male, 285 years) — Ambitious, experimental, pushing dragon-bone techniques into new applications
- **Yeva Morgrun** (female, 310 years) — Secretive, scholarly, rumored to communicate with entities through Malstaric ash rituals

Succession within each family follows complex rules involving craft-testing, Council approval, and demonstrations of leadership during the winter watch rotations. Political marriages between families are common but don't merge the lines—children belong to their mother's family.

### Geography and Climate

The Bellowing Mountains occupy the southeastern Dragon's Spine, rising between the Hills of Sarrow to the north and the Pale Peaks to the south. The climate is polar—winter darkness lasts for months, summer barely reaches freezing at the lower elevations, and the upper peaks are permanently snow-covered.

The Fengruk live almost entirely underground, their cities warmed by forge-heat and geothermal vents. Surface structures are limited to watchtowers, gate-houses, and the fortress of Azanfrain. Visitors expecting impressive dwarven architecture on display find only ice-crusted rock and carefully hidden doorways; the real architecture is inside, where the heat allows it.

The mountains are volcanic in origin, providing both the heat that powers the forges and the exotic minerals that make Fengruk metalwork unique. The titans chose this location deliberately. The Fengruk have simply maintained what their predecessors built.

### The Titan Legacy

The Fengruk didn't build the great forges—they inherited them. During the Second Eon, titans walked these mountains and constructed facilities capable of working metal at scales no mortal race could achieve. The World Forge in Sildraz was designed to cast pieces the size of buildings. The titans used it to create weapons, armor, and devices whose purposes the Fengruk can only guess at.

When the titans fell—including Vorukar, who died fighting something from the Pale Peaks—the Fengruk were left with infrastructure they barely understood and a support population they couldn't feed. The famine that followed devastated the Hills of Sarrow and reduced the Fengruk themselves to a fraction of their former numbers.

The survivors made two decisions that define Gondurak to this day. First, they would master the forges, learning every technique the titans had used and developing new ones suited to dwarven scale. Second, they would remember what happened in the Hills of Sarrow—the people who died because the Fengruk couldn't save them.

This combination of inherited greatness and inherited guilt shapes Fengruk culture. They are master craftsmen who believe they're still learning. They are isolationists who maintain a frontier fortress because they remember what happens when threats from the south go unwatched.

### Economy

Gondurak exports metalwork—specifically, metalwork of qualities no other forge can match. The three cities specialize in different techniques, and the combination covers virtually any commission a buyer might imagine.

**Sildraz** produces large-scale work: ship anchors, fortress gates, siege engine components, architectural metalwork. The World Forge can cast pieces that would require assembly anywhere else, and the resulting structural integrity is unmatched.

**Durkarn** produces dragon-enhanced items: weapons that hold edges longer, armor that resists elemental damage, jewelry with subtle magical properties. The dragon graveyard beneath the city provides materials that have been absorbing draconic essence for millennia.

**Morgrundar** produces shadow-touched work: items with connections to Malstaris, blades that drink light, armor that muffles sound beyond physical explanation. The market for such items is smaller but willing to pay extraordinary prices.

Trade flows primarily through the eastern passes to the Dalizi lowlands, with a secondary route to Sweivyon in the Silver Slopes. Gondurak imports food (the mountains produce almost nothing edible), timber, textiles, and raw materials the local geology doesn't provide. The trade balance consistently favors Gondurak; their exports are worth more than their imports by a significant margin.

The kingdom maintains no currency of its own. Trade operates on barter for small transactions and letters of credit (often backed by Sweivyon banks) for larger ones. Fengruk craftsmen are notoriously difficult to hire for outside work—most refuse to leave the forges for any price.

### Military

Gondurak's military exists for one purpose: defending against threats from the Pale Peaks. The kingdom maintains no standing army in the conventional sense, but every adult Fengruk trains with weapons and serves rotating duty at Azanfrain. The total military-capable population is roughly eight thousand, though mobilizing all of them would halt the forges.

The **Frostwatch** is the professional core—approximately six hundred Fengruk who serve full-time at Azanfrain and patrol the southern approaches. They specialize in fighting frostwalkers and ice wyrms, using equipment developed specifically for these threats: vibration-dampened boots, thermal lances, harpoons designed to anchor in ice-wyrm hide.

In a full emergency—a major incursion from the Pale Peaks—the Frostwatch coordinates a general mobilization. Every city maintains armories with equipment for its population, and every Fengruk knows where to report and what to do. The system has been tested three times in recorded history. It worked each time, though the casualties were significant.

Gondurak has no navy, no cavalry, and no interest in projecting power beyond its borders. The military exists to hold the line. Everything else is someone else's problem.

### Culture

Fengruk culture centers on craft, memory, and the forge-philosophy that treats metalworking as a model for all of life.

**Craft** is identity. Every Fengruk learns a trade—usually related to metalwork, but not always—and advancement comes through demonstrated skill. Social status correlates with craft mastery rather than wealth or birth. Even the ruling families maintain their positions partly through proving they can work the forges their ancestors claimed.

**Memory** is obligation. The Fengruk maintain extensive records—stonescripts carved into the mountains themselves—documenting their history, their techniques, and their failures. The famine in the Hills of Sarrow features prominently; every Fengruk child learns what happened to those who depended on their ancestors. The lesson is that power carries responsibility, and failure to protect the vulnerable is unforgivable.

**Forge-philosophy** provides the conceptual framework. Just as raw metal must be heated, hammered, and tempered to become useful, so too must individuals be shaped by hardship and discipline. Comfort is suspect. Ease is weakness. The path to excellence runs through struggle, and those who avoid struggle remain forever untempered.

Religious practice is minimal. The Fengruk acknowledge the daemons but don't emphasize worship. Their closest thing to a patron is Azus, the primordial of law—not because they worship him, but because they respect what he represents: order, structure, and the principle that things should work the way they're supposed to work.

### Relations

**Sweivyon** is Gondurak's primary trading partner. The Silver Slopes provide raw metal that the Fengruk transform into finished goods, and the economic relationship benefits both parties. Cultural relations are cooler—the Fengruk consider Sweivyon's wealth-obsessed culture shallow, while Sweivyon considers Fengruk traditionalism stifling.

**The Dalizi Confederation** to the north provides food, timber, and access to broader trade networks. Relations are practical rather than warm; the Dalizi find the Fengruk grim, and the Fengruk find the Dalizi chaotic.

**Kanzekill** and the western Dragon's Spine are deliberately ignored. The Fengruk know the dragon exists; they don't interact with her territory, don't discuss Mountainveil, and don't offer opinions on the surface kingdoms' accommodations with their predicament. Gondurak's position is that Kanzekill is not their problem unless she makes herself their problem.

**The Pale Peaks** represent the eternal enemy—not a political rival but an existential threat. Whatever lives in the south has been probing north for as long as the Fengruk have records. The Frostwatch exists because the alternative is eventual annihilation.

### The Forge Cities

#### Sildraz

Population approximately 15,000. The capital, built around Sildraz's Crown—the central peak of the Bellowing Mountains. The World Forge occupies the mountain's heart, a titan-built facility capable of operations no other forge can match.

The city spirals inward and downward from multiple surface gates, with residential quarters in the outer rings and the forge complex at the center. Temperature increases as one descends; the deepest levels are uncomfortably warm even for Fengruk. The forge itself requires teams of dozens to operate, with specialized roles for every aspect of the process.

Sildraz hosts the Council of Embers and serves as the kingdom's diplomatic face. What few foreign visitors Gondurak receives usually see only Sildraz—and only its outer levels.

#### Durkarn

Population approximately 10,000. The northwestern city, built on an ancient dragon graveyard that predates Fengruk settlement. The bones have been absorbing trace magic for longer than anyone can calculate, and the forges here specialize in incorporating this material into metalwork.

Dragon-bone crafting is difficult and dangerous. The material resists normal working techniques; it must be coaxed rather than forced. Durkarn's smiths have developed specialized methods over centuries, and they guard these techniques jealously. A Durkarn-forged dragon-bone blade can fetch prices that would buy a small estate elsewhere.

The city's atmosphere is slightly morbid—bones are everywhere, from structural supports to decorative elements. Visitors either find it fascinating or deeply uncomfortable.

#### Morgrundar

Population approximately 8,000. The northeastern city, built on massive deposits of Malstaric ash—material that fell from the shadow plane during some ancient catastrophe and has been slowly contaminating the local geology ever since.

Working with Malstaric ash requires precautions. Prolonged exposure causes psychological effects; the forges maintain strict rotation schedules to limit individual contact time. The products are valuable precisely because they're dangerous to make—items with subtle connections to Malstaris, blades that seem to drink light, armor that muffles sound beyond physical explanation.

Morgrundar has a reputation for secrecy even by Fengruk standards. The Morgrun family controls access tightly, and rumors persist about experiments conducted in the deep levels. The Council of Embers officially monitors Morgrundar's activities; how effective this monitoring is remains unclear.

### Azanfrain

The fortress at the southern edge of Fengruk territory, built into a spur of rock overlooking the Shrapnel Strait. Azanfrain exists for one purpose: watching the Pale Peaks and responding when things cross north.

See the [Azanfrain](../../atlas_of_alaria/dragons_spine_coast/Azanfrain.md) entry for full details.

### Hooks

**The Deep Sounds**: Something in the sealed lower levels of the Bellowing Mountains has begun making noise—rhythmic pulses that don't match the forge patterns. The Council wants to know what it is without opening the seals. They're hiring experts who can investigate without breaking containment.

**The Morgrundar Question**: A Morgrundar smith has defected to Sildraz, claiming the family is communicating with entities through the Malstaric ash—not just using the material, but establishing actual contact. The Council is paralyzed by the political implications of investigating.

**The Ice Bridge**: An unusually cold winter has frozen the Shrapnel Strait earlier and more completely than anyone remembers. The Frostwatch reports unprecedented movement on the Pale Peaks slopes. Something is massing for a crossing.

**The Vorukar Expedition**: A scholar believes they've found evidence of the titan's tomb beneath the Shrapnel Strait—and evidence that he wasn't entirely killed, merely contained. Gondurak's official position is that some things should stay buried. Not everyone agrees.

**The Lost Technique**: A stonescript fragment suggests the titans taught the Fengruk something they've since forgotten—a technique that could revolutionize forge-work or, depending on interpretation, destroy it. Multiple factions want the fragment, and its current owner is playing them against each other.

## Gorath

Tags: state, empire, shacklands

The jungle empire. Six hundred miles of canopy, three great rivers, and a million souls bound by blood, glory, and the lash. Gorath is the largest state on Alaria by territory and the most aggressive by temperament—a conquest machine that has spent three centuries swallowing its neighbors and shows no sign of stopping. The Gorathi believe the gods placed them in the most hostile environment on the continent as a trial, and every acre wrested from the jungle proves their worthiness to rule.

To outsiders, Gorath is terrifying: a militaristic slave-state that treats war as sacrament and weakness as sin. To the Gorathi themselves, they are simply the only people brave enough to do what must be done. The jungle would consume civilization if left unchecked. Someone must tame it. Someone must rule.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Elected military dictatorship

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, Shapers, Skaag

**Population**: 1,000,000+

**Stability**: Stable (internally); perpetually at war (externally)

**Core Values**: Glory, discipline, duty, conquest, strength, assimilation

#### The Empirial Council

Gorath's emperors are not born—they are chosen. The Empirial Council, a body of sixty patricians drawn from the wealthiest families and most decorated military veterans, convenes upon an emperor's death to select a successor. By law, candidates must be generals who have commanded at least one victorious campaign. In practice, the selection process involves weeks of political maneuvering, bribery, and occasionally assassination.

Emperors serve for life, but "life" in Gorath is often shorter than one might hope. Of the last twelve emperors, only three died of natural causes. The rest fell to war, poison, or "hunting accidents." This brutal turnover keeps the empire vital—stagnant rulers don't last long.

The current emperor, **Veramus the Unyielding**, has held power for seventeen years, the longest reign in a century. His survival is attributed to two factors: genuine military brilliance, and a network of Shaper spies so extensive that no conspiracy forms without his knowledge.

#### The Assimilation Doctrine

When Gorath conquers a people, it absorbs them. Defeated armies become auxiliary legions. Conquered nobles become provincial administrators (if they cooperate) or slaves (if they don't). Within two generations, the grandchildren of the conquered speak Gorathi, worship Gorathi gods, and fight in Gorathi legions. The empire grows not just in territory but in population and military strength with every victory.

This doctrine makes Gorath uniquely dangerous. Most empires weaken as they expand—supply lines stretch, garrisons thin, local resistance festers. Gorath gets *stronger* as it expands, feeding on the armies it defeats.

#### The Three Peoples

**Humans** form the majority and dominate the upper ranks of society. Gorathi humans tend toward darker complexions and stocky builds—generations of jungle living have bred a people resistant to disease and heat. They form the core of the legions and hold most political power.

**Shapers** occupy a strange position: simultaneously invaluable and deeply mistrusted. Their silver eyes mark them as shapeshifters capable of perfectly mimicking any humanoid form, making them peerless spies and infiltrators. The Imperial Intelligence operates almost entirely through Shaper agents. But no Shaper has ever been permitted to serve on the Empirial Council, and they are forbidden from owning land. The empire uses them ruthlessly while keeping them politically powerless.

**Skaag** dwell in the undercities—the vast tunnel networks beneath Gorathi cities. The rat-folk maintain their own parallel society below ground, emerging to trade, labor, and occasionally serve as scouts in the endless jungle campaigns. Most Gorathi barely acknowledge their existence, but the Skaag know secrets: forgotten tunnels, buried treasures, and which noble families have skeletons hidden in their cellars.

### Religion & Culture

#### The Eternal March

The Gorathi faith has no temples. It has monuments.

At the center of every Gorathi city stands a **Pillar of Conquest**—a towering obelisk covered in carved names. Every soldier who dies in victory has their name added. Every acre claimed from the jungle, every enemy city burned, every campaign concluded successfully earns new inscriptions. The pillars grow taller with each generation. Azantir's central pillar is over two hundred feet high, maintained by teams of stone-carvers who work year-round.

The gods, in Gorathi belief, do not want worship. They want *proof*. They placed humanity in a jungle that breeds disease, spawns monsters, and swallows the weak. To survive is to prove worth. To conquer is to prove favor. The Eternal March is not a metaphor—it is the literal, endless expansion of Gorathi civilization against everything that would destroy it.

This theology has convenient implications. Slavery is natural—the weak serve the strong, as the gods intended. Conquest is holy—spreading Gorathi civilization is divine work. Failure is sin—a general who loses a campaign has demonstrated that the gods have withdrawn their favor.

#### Blood and Names

Gorathi mark their achievements on their bodies. A soldier's first kill earns a small tattoo on the forearm. Promotions, victories, and honors accumulate as ink across skin until veteran centurions are covered in elaborate patterns telling their entire military history. To meet a heavily tattooed Gorathi is to meet someone who has seen much death—and survived.

Names follow a similar logic. A Gorathi is born with a family name, earns a personal name at majority, and may be granted additional names for great deeds. Emperor Veramus the Unyielding was born simply "Veramus Corvallo." He earned "the Unyielding" after holding the Esteves Pass against a giant assault for forty-three days without reinforcement.

#### Festival of Chains

Held at midsummer, the Festival of Chains commemorates Gorath's first great slave raid on Tamadrez three centuries ago. For three days, the empire celebrates with feasting, gladiatorial combat between slaves, and ceremonial auctions where wealthy families purchase the year's finest captives. The festival is deliberately grotesque to outside observers—the Gorathi see it as honest acknowledgment of what their prosperity costs.

### Economy

**Size**: Colossal—the largest on Alaria

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Exotic hardwoods, tropical dyes, rare alchemical ingredients, slaves

**Primary Imports**: Enslaved peoples (primarily Drasnian dwarves), metals, finished goods

#### The Jungle's Bounty

The Jungles of Titania contain resources found nowhere else: **bloodwood** that never rots and takes dye perfectly, **witchbark** used in high-end alchemy, **azure orchids** whose essence is worth its weight in gold to perfumers and poisoners alike. Gorathi merchants have made fortunes shipping these goods north through the Divinity Passage.

But the true engine of Gorathi wealth is labor. The jungle demands workers: loggers, farmers, miners, builders. Free citizens serve in the legions—they don't clear brush. That work falls to the enslaved.

#### The Tamadrez Pipeline

The Drasnian dwarves of Tamadrez have become Gorath's primary labor source. Three centuries ago, Gorath occupied the southern coast of Pesalolo by force, establishing the **Slaver's Coast**—a chain of ports for collecting and shipping human cargo. The northern settlements survived because they weren't worth conquering: too mountainous, too poor, and Gorath's military was already stretched thin. The empire's terms are simple: Gorath takes what it wants from the south; the north stays out of the way. Any interference—such as harboring escaped slaves—results in fire from the sky. One northern town learned this lesson permanently.

The slaves flow north through the **Divinity Passage**, Gorath's great maritime highway. At any given time, dozens of slave ships work this route. The passage's name is bitterly ironic to those in chains.

#### The Domestic Economy

River cities along the Lucenia, Droaz, and Torga handle most internal trade. The jungle is too dense for overland commerce at scale—everything moves by water. This makes river control politically crucial. The families that control the docks control the wealth.

### Military

**Size**: Colossal

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory service, volunteer career path

#### The Legions

Every Gorathi citizen serves two years in the legions starting at age sixteen. Most return to civilian life afterward; the dedicated remain as career soldiers. This system creates an enormous trained reserve while maintaining a professional core.

The legions are organized simply:

- **Legion** (5,000 soldiers): The primary strategic unit, each named and bearing distinct colors. Famous legions include the **Jade Serpents** (jungle specialists), the **Iron Tide** (siege warfare), and the **Pillar Guard** (capital defense).
- **Cohort** (500 soldiers): Tactical units within legions, each led by a **Tribune**.
- **Century** (50 soldiers): The basic fighting unit, led by a **Centurion**.

#### Auxiliaries

Conquered peoples serve in **auxiliary cohorts**—units attached to legions but not part of them. Auxiliaries receive lower pay, worse equipment, and more dangerous assignments. However, twenty years of auxiliary service earns full citizenship for a soldier and their descendants. This creates powerful loyalty among the conquered: serve Gorath well, and your grandchildren will be Gorathi.

#### The Path to Power

Military success is the only path to political power in Gorath. The progression runs: soldier → centurion → tribune → commander → general → candidate for emperor. A man born to nothing can become emperor if he wins enough battles. This meritocratic brutality keeps the military sharp—advancement requires proven competence, not family connections.

#### Current Campaigns

Gorath fights on four fronts simultaneously:

- **The Nashua Front** (northeast): A bloody stalemate against the Ix'Vasyla lizardfolk. The jungle-to-jungle warfare suits neither side, and the conflict has ground on for decades.
- **The Giant March** (northwest): A slow push into the Thunder Plains, where hill giants and their kin resist with frustrating effectiveness.
- **The Moon Wilds** (west): An attempted expansion into Gorath's most dangerous interior region. The Vexlings have made this campaign a nightmare.
- **Maintaining Tamadrez** (south): Constant patrol and enforcement along the Slaver's Coast.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Rimihuica, the Shacklands

**Biomes**: Tropical rainforest (dominant), hill country, river valleys

**Named Regions**: Jungles of Titania, Moon Wilds, Poison Hills, Purlin Hills, Bata Nujo Hills, Deserted Hills

**Rivers**: Lucenia River, Droaz River, Torga River, Myublin River

**Adjacent Waters**: Divinity Passage, Sea of Selegos

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Azantir

**Major Cities**: Esteves, Carvalhais, Pereiro, Ageito, Pombares, Velorasa, Bougado, Ranholas

**Regional Centers**: Fresta, Recarci (Poison Hills)

#### City Character

Gorathi cities rise from the jungle like stone fists. Architecture favors massive stepped pyramids, broad plazas, and walls thick enough to resist both siege and jungle alike. Every city maintains its Pillar of Conquest, military barracks, and slave markets. The wealthy live in upper levels; the poor crowd lower; the Skaag burrow beneath.

**Azantir**, the capital, sprawls where the Lucenia River empties into the Divinity Passage. It is the largest city in the Shacklands, a maze of pyramids, canals, and markets where anything can be bought. The Emperor's Palace crowns the city's highest pyramid, looking down on a million subjects.

**Esteves** guards the northern frontier, a fortress-city where the Lucenia emerges from the Myjornis Mountains. Soldiers outnumber civilians. The city exists to project power into the passes beyond.

**Carvalhais** dominates the upper Droaz, a logging and lumber center that strips the surrounding jungle for export. The city smells of sawdust and industry.

**Ageito** anchors the southeast, where the Torga River meets the sea. Newer than the western cities, Ageito grows rapidly as Gorath pushes toward Nashua.

### Relations

**Nashua**: Active war. The Ix'Vasyla lizardfolk have proven impossible to subjugate, and the conflict has become a bleeding wound for both sides.

**Tamadrez**: Occupation and extraction. Gorath controls the southern coast; the north survives by staying out of the way. This arrangement exists only as long as it benefits Gorath—and everyone knows it.

**Trømgar**: Cold war turning hot. The dwarven kingdom objects to Gorath's treatment of their distant Drasnian kin. Skirmishes increase yearly.

**The Giants**: Active war. The Thunder Plains tribes resist Gorathi expansion with brutal effectiveness.

### History

The Gorathi tell their history in conquests.

**The Founding (circa 700 years ago)**: Refugees from a forgotten northern war settled the Lucenia River valley. They found hostile jungle, hostile natives, and no mercy. Those who survived became the first Gorathi.

**The First March (circa 600 years ago)**: Under the legendary Emperor Talhas the Conqueror, Gorath unified the scattered river settlements and began expanding into the Jungles of Titania. This campaign established the Eternal March as official theology.

**The Tamadrez Contact (circa 300 years ago)**: Gorathi explorers discovered Pesalolo and the Drasnian dwarves. Within a generation, the slave trade had transformed Gorath's economy.

**The Present Day**: Emperor Veramus oversees an empire stretched across four fronts, bloated with conquest, and hungry for more. How long the Eternal March can continue is a question the Gorathi refuse to ask.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Shaper Conspiracy**: Rumors suggest Shapers have infiltrated the Empirial Council despite the prohibition. If true, who are they, and what do they want?

**The Moon Wilds Mystery**: Something in the Moon Wilds is organizing the Vexlings. The creatures were once scattered and animalistic—now they fight with disturbing coordination.

**The Escape Networks**: Despite Slavewatch, slaves keep escaping north. Someone is running an underground railroad through the jungle. The Emperor wants them found.

**The Old Emperor**: Veramus is sixty-three. When he dies, the succession crisis will be spectacular. Smart players are already positioning themselves.

**The Skaag Secrets**: The rat-folk beneath the cities know things. Old tunnels lead to older places. Some Skaag whisper of ruins predating Gorath—ruins the empire has built over and forgotten.

## Grieb

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

The lakemen control the great lakes of the northeastern Wildwood—Cykravikus and the smaller lakes scattered through the surrounding hills. They're aquatic orcs who can breathe underwater and rarely speak above the surface, ruled by a hag queen who has dwelt in the deepest waters for centuries.

### Overview

Nobody attacks the Griebi because fighting them costs more than anyone is willing to pay.

The lakes in the hills are valuable—fresh water, fish, defensible terrain. Other orc states would happily take that land. But taking it means fighting aquatic orcs who can breathe underwater indefinitely, who hide in murky depths for days waiting to ambush, who have rows of needle-like teeth that tear flesh as easily as they catch fish.

Attack a Griebi settlement and they simply sink beneath the surface. Follow them and you're in their world—blind, gasping, flailing in cold dark water while shapes with too many teeth circle below. The Griebi don't need to win battles. They just need to make every battle so costly that invaders give up.

The other orc states tried, generations ago. The survivors decided it wasn't worth it.

### Government

**Type:** Absolute Monarchy (The Hag Queen)

The Griebi have no councils, no competing factions, no succession crises. There is the Queen, and there are her subjects. Her word is law. Her silence is also law. When she wants something done, it happens. When she is satisfied, the lakes are peaceful.

**The Hag Queen:**

No one knows her true name. She is simply the Queen, or the Deep Mother, or in whispered moments, She-Who-Knows. She dwells in the deepest part of Cykravikus Lake, in underwater caverns that no air-breather has ever seen. The Griebi commune with her through representatives who descend into the depths and return—sometimes days later, sometimes weeks—with her commands.

She is ancient. She is patient. She has outlived empires.

**The Silent Court:** A handful of Griebi elders who interpret the Queen's wishes and manage daily affairs. They meet in the shallows where air-breathers can survive, speaking in the minimal, gesture-heavy communication that the Griebi prefer above water. They do not explain the Queen's decisions. They implement them.

### Culture

**The Griebi** have blueish-gray skin that shimmers in certain lights. Their eyes are large and dark, adapted for murky depths. Most distinctively, they have multiple rows of long, needle-like teeth designed for catching fish underwater—a feature that makes encounters with them deeply unsettling for surface dwellers.

**Core Values:**
- **Silence Is Wisdom** — Words above water are wasted breath. Communication should be efficient, minimal, necessary.
- **The Deep Provides** — The lakes give everything the Griebi need. They want nothing from the surface world.
- **The Queen Knows Best** — Questioning her is not forbidden; it simply doesn't occur to anyone. She has been right for centuries.
- **What Happens Below Stays Below** — The depths are private. Surface dwellers do not need to understand.

**Society:** Griebi society is remarkably simple by orc standards. There are hunters and fishers, there are those who tend the underwater kelp gardens, there are the Queen's servants who communicate with her, and there are the rare individuals who interact with the surface world. No warrior caste, because no one attacks them. No smiths, because they don't use metal. No hierarchy beyond service to the Queen.

They are not hostile to visitors. They're simply... absent. A traveler passing through Griebi territory might see nothing but empty shores and still water. The Griebi are below, watching, and they will remain below unless they have reason to surface.

**Communication:** The Griebi speak rarely above water and use a complex language of hand signals, body positions, and facial expressions. Underwater, they produce a range of clicks and tones that travel perfectly through the lake. Surface dwellers describe Griebi verbal speech as halting, reluctant, and unsettling—each word seems to cost them something.

### Economy

**Size:** Small (possibly)
**Tech:** Unknown (underwater technology is hard to assess)

**Primary Exports:**
- Fish and lake products (traded minimally through intermediaries)
- Safe passage across the lakes (available to those who ask politely)
- Nothing else

**Primary Imports:**
- Nothing regular
- Occasionally, specific items—a particular type of glass, a rare metal, a book—requested through intermediaries with no explanation given

The Griebi economy is almost entirely internal. The lakes provide food. Underwater kelp provides material for tools and clothing. They need nothing from the surface world, and the surface world cannot easily take anything from them.

Trade happens, but it's strange. A Griebi representative will appear at a market town, purchase exactly what they came for, and leave without negotiating or socializing. They pay in freshwater pearls that they seem to have in abundance. They don't explain where they're going or why they need what they're buying.

### Military

**Size:** Small
**Quality:** Unknown (rarely tested)
**Enrollment:** As needed

The Griebi don't maintain a standing army because they've never needed one. When threats arise, the lake communities organize defense, but this hasn't happened in generations.

What's known about their fighting capability:
- They can breathe underwater, giving them escape routes and tactical options others lack
- Their needle-teeth make them dangerous in close quarters
- They know their lake terrain intimately
- They're patient—if threatened, they can simply wait in the water until attackers give up

**The Real Defense:** The lakes themselves. Any invasion force faces the same problem: the Griebi can retreat underwater and stay there indefinitely. Siege them out? They have the entire lake to fish. Storm the shores? They drag you into the shallows and tear you apart. The math never works for the attacker.

The Hag Queen presumably has power of her own, but no one's tested it in living memory.

### Geography

**Location:** Northeastern Wildwood, in the lake-dotted hills north of Tarn

**Biomes:** Freshwater lakes surrounded by forested hills; rocky shorelines

**Key Locations:**
- **Cykravikus Lake** — The great lake, deep and cold, where the Hag Queen makes her home. Multiple inlets extend into the surrounding hills.
- **The Shore Villages** — Griebi settlements along the lakeshores, built half on land, half extending into the shallows.
- **The Gathering Stone** — A flat rock near the lake's western edge where the Griebi occasionally meet with outsiders.
- **The Lesser Lakes** — Smaller lakes scattered through the hills, each with its own fishing communities.

**Borders:**
- South/Southwest: Tarn (distant, minimal contact)
- West: Uhionai (mutual wariness)
- North: Unclaimed wilderness
- East: The Steppe of Aziirn (no orcs there; just emptiness)

### Relations

**Every Other Orc State:** The same pattern. They leave the Griebi alone. The Griebi leave them alone. It's not friendship—it's practical. Why attack territory you can't hold against people you can't catch?

**Tarn:** The Tarni spirit-seers can sense the Hag Queen's power. They describe it as "old" and "deep" and "patient." They respect it the way one respects a sleeping dragon.

**Uhionai:** The Grove Council has memories that stretch back centuries—and those memories include reasons to avoid the lakes. First Root Yorunax has reportedly said, "Some bargains should not be broken." He does not elaborate.

**Shazuihn:** Even the boar riders learned. Two generations ago, a war-chief led fifty riders against the Griebi. They charged the shore villages. The Griebi retreated into the water. The raiders followed into the shallows. Three survivors made it back. They don't talk about what happened in that lake.

**Symonair the Dragon:** The dragon Symonair claims Symonair Lake to the south of Cykravikus. The two bodies of water are connected. The relationship between the Hag Queen and the dragon is unknown—but neither has attacked the other, and that alone is notable.

**The Orc Moot:** The Griebi send a representative. They listen. They rarely speak. When they do speak, everyone else listens.

### The Hag Queen

The Queen is ancient—older than the other orc states, possibly older than the orcs' arrival in the Wildwood. She rules the Griebi absolutely, and they serve her without question. What she wants, what she plans, what she thinks about the endless wars to the south—no outsider knows.

She doesn't need mysterious leverage to maintain peace with the other states. She just needs to be more trouble than she's worth, and she is.

### Conflicts

**None active.**

The Griebi have no ongoing conflicts because no one wants to start one. Their territory is valuable, but not valuable enough to justify the casualties. The other orc states have learned: pick fights you can win at acceptable cost. Fighting the Griebi isn't one of them.

### History

The Hag Queen was here before the orc states formed. Whether she created the Griebi, attracted them, or transformed ordinary orcs into aquatic forms is unknown. They serve her. They have always served her.

The other orc states tried attacking Grieb in the early days, before they understood what they were dealing with. Those attacks failed—not through magic or curses, but through the simple reality of fighting underwater enemies in their home territory. The lesson stuck.

### Player Hooks

- Seek an audience with the Hag Queen (rare, but she occasionally receives visitors)
- Trade with the Griebi for freshwater pearls or lake products
- Navigate Grieb territory to reach somewhere beyond
- Survive an accidental trespass into Griebi waters
- Investigate the relationship between the Hag Queen and Symonair the dragon
- Hire Griebi guides for underwater exploration elsewhere

## Griselia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederation of city-states (loose)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Scalawag Goblins

**Population**: 80,000 (across all city-states)

**Stability**: Chaotic but functional

**Core Values**: Brood loyalty, performance, rivalry, dramatic flair

- Griselia is not a unified nation but a collection of eight independent city-states, each ruled by a brood-father lineage. They compete constantly but present a united (theatrical) front to outsiders.
- Scalawag goblins dominate—mischievous, impulsive, passionate. Known for performers, philosophers, and devoting horrifying amounts of time to absurd projects.
- Some non-Scalawag goblins and a very slim number of non-goblins have migrated here over the years.
- Goblin politics are loud, dramatic, and bewildering to outsiders. Alliances shift constantly between city-states. Feuds can last generations or be forgotten by next week.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Crafts, performers, mercenaries, mountain goods, chaos

**Primary Imports**: Food, luxuries, anything shiny

- Trade with Erasnus is brisk despite (or because of) the constant theatrical threats of invasion.
- Each city-state has its own economic specialties and jealously guards them.
- Goblin craftsmanship is inconsistent—brilliant one day, incomprehensible the next.

### Military

**Size**: Large (on paper)

**Quality**: Variable

**Enrollment**: Brood obligation

- Every goblin is expected to defend the brood. This means Griselia can theoretically field enormous armies.
- In practice, coordinating eight city-states is like herding cats. Joint military exercises tend to devolve into arguments, competitions, or impromptu festivals.
- Individual city-states can be surprisingly effective when motivated. The problem is motivation.

### Geography

**Location**: The Crags of Geth, a shallow bowl-shaped mountain range west of Erasnus, east of Ta Minn, north of the Browthiel Hills

**Biomes**: Mountain valleys, rocky peaks, scattered forests in the bowl

**Climate**: Temperate, sheltered by the bowl shape

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (each city-state is independent)

**City-States (east to west along southern rim)**: Pholiki, Dygon, Aster (closest to Erasnus)

**City-States (elsewhere in the bowl)**: Shinishini, Codunp, Gor, Grisel, Bu

### Primary Conflicts

**Inter-City Rivalry**

The eight city-states compete over everything—trade routes, prestige, whose brood-father is most impressive, whose philosophers are most profound, whose parties are most legendary. This rarely escalates to actual violence (goblins don't like killing half-siblings), but the drama is constant.

**The Erasnus Theater**

Griselia's relationship with Erasnus is a perpetual comic opera. Goblin delegations arrive in Traduci making grandiose threats of invasion. Erasnun diplomats nod politely. Everyone trades. The goblins go home claiming diplomatic victory. Repeat endlessly.

Both sides know the invasion will never happen. But the theater serves domestic purposes for the goblins (brood-fathers look strong) and the Erasnuns (the military looks necessary). It's a mutually beneficial farce.

**Something Underneath**

Most of the posturing is theatrical. But some city-states—particularly those further from Erasnus, away from the profitable trade—may harbor genuine ambitions. The bowl of the Crags of Geth hides things. Not every brood-father is content with performance.

**Anarak to the North**

The great basin of Anarak lies between the Crags of Geth and Argysis in the Kharvorn Mountains. Relations with Anarak are... complicated. The goblins don't threaten Anarak the way they threaten Erasnus. There may be reasons for that.

### History

The Scalawag goblins have inhabited the Crags of Geth for as long as anyone remembers. The bowl-shaped range provided natural shelter, and the eight major valleys became eight city-states, each dominated by a single brood lineage.

They've never unified. They've never needed to. The mountains protect them, trade sustains them, and the endless inter-city drama keeps everyone entertained. Outsiders have tried to conquer Griselia; the mountains and the chaos defeated them all.

The theatrical threats toward Erasnus started centuries ago—possibly as genuine ambition, possibly as a joke that stuck. Now it's tradition. No one remembers why it began, and no one wants to be the brood-father who stops.

## Grustos

Tags: state

A mountainous state in Central Aboyinzu, notable for the three non-human populations that share its territory with the human majority: the isolationist Kryaaji sun elves of Enuau Kemjallb, the Aciabro blood-mechanist goblins of the Sunwing Peaks, and the nomadic giant herders who pass through seasonally via Giants' Corridor.

### Government

Grustos is governed from its capital Cañas by a council system designed to accommodate its unusual demographics. The ruling council includes human merchant representatives, giant clan-speakers (when migration brings them through), and a perpetually empty chair reserved for the Kryaaji—who have never acknowledged the invitation.

The Aciabro goblins are not represented and have never requested to be. They govern themselves in their mountain workshops and have no interest in lowland politics.

In practice, humans run Grustos, with the understanding that their authority doesn't extend into sun elf territory, goblin workshops, or the Giants' Corridor during migration seasons. This limited sovereignty is accepted as the cost of coexistence.

### Populations

**Humans**: The majority, concentrated in the central lowlands and southern regions. They farm, trade, and serve as intermediaries between the other populations.

**Kryaaji Sun Elves**: Residing in the independent city-state of Enuau Kemjallb within Grustos's claimed borders. The sun elves maintain strict isolation, trading only through boundary markets. Grustos claims them as citizens; the Kryaaji consider this fiction and ignore it.

**Aciabro Goblins**: Blood-mechanist goblins who replace their flesh with machinery powered by vital essence. They inhabit workshops in the Sunwing Peaks, have no interest in outside contact, and trade only in blood-soaked equipment no sane person wants.

**Giant Herders**: Nomadic pastoral giants who pass through twice yearly with their enormous flocks. They're not citizens—they predate Grustos and will outlast it—but they trade at designated stops and generally avoid causing problems.

### Economy

Grustos is not wealthy. The mountains limit agriculture; the sun elves don't share their craftsmanship; the goblins produce nothing tradeable. What prosperity exists comes from:

- **Giant migration trade**: Twice yearly, towns along the corridor transform into massive markets for giant-produced wool, leather, and exotic meats.
- **Mining**: Iron and copper from the Torulius Mountains feed modest metalworking industries.
- **Kryaaji boundary trade**: Sun elf craftsmanship commands premium prices, even through indirect exchange.
- **Transit fees**: The main road between Chaal Nazzerox (for those foolish enough to go there) and Qintas passes through Grustos.

### Military

Grustos maintains a small professional army supplemented by militia levies—enough to patrol roads and handle bandits, not enough to fight a real war. The state's defense relies more on geography (mountains on all sides) and the assumption that any invader would have to contend with sun elves, blood-goblins, and giants.

This assumption may be optimistic. If Chaal Nazzerox's undead break west, Grustos will be the first to fall.

### Relations

**Enuau Kemjallb**: Technically within Grustos's borders, practically independent. The relationship is one of mutual non-interference and carefully maintained fiction.

**Qintas**: Friendly neighbor to the east. Trade flows freely; borders are nominal. The Amverela high elves consider Grustos slightly uncouth; Grustani consider Qintas slightly pretentious.

**Chaal Nazzerox**: The undead empire to the west. No diplomatic relations. Grustos watches the border nervously and hopes the Crystal Mountains hold.

### What Will Go Wrong

- **The undead will come**: Grustos is the buffer between Chaal Nazzerox and the civilized east. Buffers get ground down.
- **The sun elves know something**: The Kryaaji have lived on the Light leyline for millennia. Their isolation may be hiding more than religious purity.
- **Skyloft Castle**: Whatever destroyed it is still there. Eventually, it may wake up.
- **The giants are changing routes**: Climate shifts or something else is altering migration patterns. Towns built around giant trade may find themselves abandoned.

## Gymlstik

Once controlled by dwarves, these mountains have been taken over by goblins and Cirthikin, large, burrowing, praying mantis-like creatures. The tunnels form an enormous network that travel for hundreds of miles underground. The dwarves, driven deeper into the ground, have become pale monstrosities below, known as Surry dwarves. Mines, hidden lairs, and underground fortresses litter the mountains.

## Hedroscobb

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

The largest of the six orc states and the one that gives the Wildwood its name to outsiders. Hedroscobb controls the southern forest from Vogenfeld's mountain passes to the Yugurbas Dyos marshes, and its warriors in their terrible corrosive armor are what Tarkhon imagines when they think of "orc."

### Overview

Hedroscobb is a military state built around a single advantage: algae-iron. The Hedroscobbi have mastered the art of forging iron combined with specific swamp algae to create armor so heavy and corrosive that only their own naturally adapted skin can withstand wearing it. This armor—black, dripping, and caustic—provides extraordinary protection and destroys the weapons of anyone who strikes it.

Everything in Hedroscobb society serves the forges. The constant wars aren't about glory or territory; they're about securing the algae that keeps the armor coming. Without it, they're just orcs. With it, they're nearly unstoppable.

### Government

**Type:** Forge Council

The Hedroscobbi are ruled by a council of five Forge-Masters—the greatest smiths and war-leaders combined. Political power flows from the ability to produce armor; military command follows from the ability to wear it well.

**The Five Forges:**
- **Forge Vraketh** — The Black Anvil. Oldest and most productive forge, controls the main ironwood groves. Forge-Master Kethros has held his seat for forty years.
- **Forge Drul** — The Acid Gate. Controls the southern passes and first contact with Vogenfeld. Forge-Master Grusha is the primary voice for war with the dwarves.
- **Forge Ystok** — The River Forge. Controls the southeastern territory bordering Shazuihn; constantly fighting off raiders. Forge-Master Thokk has buried three children to boar-rider axes.
- **Forge Morul** — The Northern Reach. Controls the border with Yugurbas Dyos. Forge-Master Velka leads the algae expeditions.
- **Forge Sulth** — The Hidden Forge. Smallest, most secretive. Rumored to experiment with new algae combinations. Forge-Master unknown to outsiders.

Decisions require majority agreement. War requires unanimous consent. The council meets in the Slag Halls—a vast underground complex beneath the central Wildwood where the great forges never cool.

### Culture

**The Hedroscobbi** have dark, leathery skin that resists the corrosive properties of their own armor and weapons. They're larger than most orcs—the constant labor of the forges and the weight of the armor have bred them strong over generations. Acid scars are marks of honor; a smith who hasn't burned themselves hasn't worked hard enough.

**Core Values:**
- **The Forge Above All** — Personal glory means nothing. The forge-clan is everything.
- **Weight Is Strength** — The heavier the burden you can bear, the more respect you command.
- **Iron Remembers** — Every piece of armor carries the memory of its maker. Disgrace the armor, disgrace the smith.
- **The Algae Must Flow** — Without the swamp algae, there is no armor. Without armor, there is no Hedroscobb.

**Society:** Hedroscobb is rigidly hierarchical. Forge-clans control all production; warriors serve the forges; gatherers, hunters, and laborers support the warriors. The only social mobility is through exceptional smithing or exceptional killing—preferably both.

Children are tested at age ten. Those who can withstand the touch of algae-iron without screaming become smith-apprentices. Those who cannot become warriors. Those who flinch become laborers.

### Economy

**Size:** Medium
**Tech:** Developed (in metallurgy), Undeveloped (in everything else)

**Primary Exports:**
- Algae-iron weapons (extremely valuable, rarely sold)
- Ironwood timber
- War captives (to Shazuihn, ironically—the raiders trade for what they can't take)

**Primary Imports:**
- Swamp algae (the limiting factor—never enough)
- Food (Hedroscobb's focus on smithing means they don't farm well)
- Healing supplies (they can't make armor without getting hurt)

The economy is command-driven. The Forge Council controls all production and distribution. There is no currency; goods are allocated by status and need. Trade with outsiders is conducted through designated intermediaries and is heavily regulated.

### Military

**Size:** Large
**Quality:** Very High
**Enrollment:** Universal (all adults serve in some capacity)

The Hedroscobbi military is terrifying. Warriors in full algae-iron armor are nearly immune to conventional weapons—the armor provides extraordinary protection, and anyone who lands a hit finds their weapon corroding from the contact. A Hedroscobbi shield wall is a nightmare to face.

**The Black Tide:** The elite heavy infantry. Full algae-iron plate, tower shields, short stabbing swords. They advance slowly—the armor is enormously heavy—but nothing stops them.

**The Gatherers:** Lighter-armored raiders who secure algae from Yugurbas Dyos and defend against Shazuihni attacks. More mobile, less protected, but still dangerous.

**Weaknesses:**
- The armor is slow. Fast enemies who won't engage directly can bleed them.
- The armor is heavy. Long marches exhaust them. They can't pursue fleeing enemies.
- The armor requires maintenance. Without fresh algae, it loses its corrosive properties.
- They're terrible at naval warfare. The armor sinks.

### Geography

**Location:** Southern Wildwood, directly north of Vogenfeld's mountain passes

**Biomes:** Dense temperate forest with ironwood groves; rocky ravines and hidden valleys

**Key Locations:**
- **The Slag Halls** — Underground forge complex beneath central Hedroscobb; seat of the Forge Council
- **Ironwood Grove** — Ancient forest of iron-hard trees; essential for forge-fuel and weapon handles
- **The Acid Gate** — Fortified position overlooking the passes to Vogenfeld
- **Gatherer's Camp** — Seasonal encampment in Yugurbas Dyos during algae-harvesting season

**Borders:**
- South: Vogenfeld (the dwarves watch, but rarely cross)
- North: Glivornax (hostile; the War of the Marshes)
- Northeast: Tarn (neutral; little contact)
- East: Shazuihn (hostile; constant raiding)
- West: Plains of Oblivion (no one goes there)

### Relations

**Glivornax:** Open warfare. The Glivornaxi claim the Yugurbas Dyos marshes and try to prevent algae harvesting. Hedroscobb sends armed expeditions every season. People die.

**Shazuihn:** Constant low-level conflict. The boar riders attack from the east without warning, take what they want, and vanish. Hedroscobb has never been able to stop the raids completely—the Shazuihni are too fast, and the armor is too slow.

**Tarn:** Minimal contact. The Tarni control river territory; Hedroscobb doesn't care about rivers. Occasional trade through intermediaries.

**Uhionai:** Almost no contact. The tree-orcs are far to the northwest; Hedroscobb has no reason to go there.

**Grieb:** No contact. The lakemen are too far north, and nobody wants to fight aquatic orcs in their home waters anyway.

**Vogenfeld:** Cold hostility. The dwarves watch the passes; Hedroscobb watches back. Neither side has attacked the other directly in generations, but both know war could come. The dwarves trade metal to Glivornax—Hedroscobb considers this a provocation.

**The Orc Moot:** Hedroscobb sends representatives but rarely cooperates. They don't need allies; they have armor.

### Conflicts

**The War of the Marshes:** The defining conflict. The Yugurbas Dyos contains the richest algae beds outside Glivornax proper. Hedroscobb needs that algae to survive; Glivornax says the marshes are sacred. Neither side can afford to lose.

**The Eternal Raid:** Shazuihni attacks drain resources and kill people constantly. Hedroscobb can't stop them and can't ignore them.

**The Dwarven Question:** Vogenfeld controls the only practical passes into Tarkhon. If Hedroscobb ever decided to expand south, the dwarves would be first. Some Forge-Masters whisper that the time is coming.

### History

The Hedroscobbi were once just another orc tribe—larger than most, but unremarkable. Everything changed when a smith named Vraketh discovered that certain swamp algae, when properly treated and combined with iron, created metal with extraordinary properties.

Within a generation, the Hedroscobbi conquered their neighbors and established the Forge Council. Within three generations, they controlled the entire southern Wildwood. They might have conquered more, but the algae limits them. Without access to the marshes, they can't produce enough armor to expand.

The War of the Marshes has been ongoing for over a century. Both sides have bled, but neither has broken.

### Player Hooks

- Infiltrate the Slag Halls to learn the secret of algae-iron smithing
- Negotiate a ceasefire between Hedroscobb and Glivornax (good luck)
- Survive the Acid Gate as a Vogenfeld diplomat
- Join a Gatherer expedition into Yugurbas Dyos during algae season
- Investigate why Forge Sulth is so secretive—what new weapons are they developing?
- Convince the Forge Council that the Shazuihni raids could be stopped with better tactics

### History

## Illron

Tags: state, elves, confederation, fae

The southernmost of the three elven kingdoms, and the most traditional. Illron follows the old ways—not as empty phrase, but as literal practice. Where Lenora has cleared forests and built roads, Illron has kept faith with agreements older than the confederation itself. The kingdom's heart is a forest no elf will settle, surrounding a ruined palace no elf will enter.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary monarchy with council of elders

**Primary Inhabitants**: Elves

**Population**: ~100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**:
- Honor to ancestors and ancient pacts
- Preservation of the old ways
- Respect for the forest and its inhabitants
- Patient endurance over aggressive expansion

Illron is ruled by the **Thornwood Crown**—a hereditary monarchy that has passed through the same bloodline for over 4,000 years. The current monarch, traditionally styled the Keeper of the Old Ways, governs from Ishla'Anore with the counsel of an assembly of elders drawn from the kingdom's settlements.

The monarchy's power is largely ceremonial in peacetime. Day-to-day governance happens at the local level. But the Crown holds absolute authority in matters of tradition, treaty interpretation, and relations with non-elven powers—including the fae.

### The Iyaklomori Grera

The great forest at Illron's heart is not elven territory. It belongs to the fae.

Three rivers run through Iyaklomori Grera—the Kilgre Venora in the north, Ver Ta'Eres in the center, and Ver Suterela in the south. Any of them could support thriving settlements. None do. The forest is empty of elven habitation except for one ruin: Kilren's Palace, which stands as monument to the last time the elves forgot this fact.

The Illronese have a treaty with the fae court. The terms:
1. Elves may travel on two designated routes: the river-road along Kilgre Venora, and the diagonal trail from Hassera to E'lethelas
2. Elves may not settle, build, or clear any part of the forest
3. Elves may not hunt, harvest, or take anything that grows within the bounds
4. In exchange, the fae leave the coastal settlements and eastern edge alone

Breaking these terms is not punished by elven law. The fae handle enforcement themselves.

Travelers on the legal routes report being watched constantly. Movement in peripheral vision. Laughter at night. The sensation of attention. Nothing directly hostile—but nothing welcoming either. The 180-mile diagonal trail through the forest's heart takes 8-10 days. Most elves who've walked it once refuse to do it again.

Those who stray from the paths, or who take something, or who camp too long in one place—most are never seen again. The few who return are changed. Silent. Hollow. Wrong in ways that are hard to describe. They live out their remaining years but never speak of what happened.

### Kilren's Palace

Three thousand years ago, King Kilren decided to break the treaty.

He was a young king, ambitious, frustrated by the restrictions his ancestors had accepted. He believed the fae were not as powerful as the stories claimed. He marched 10,000 soldiers into the forest to establish a permanent military presence and prove that elves could take what was theirs.

The forest let them enter. Let them build. Kilren's Palace rose in a clearing on the Ver Ta'Eres—a proper fortress, stone walls, garrison quarters, armories. The elves brought their best weapons: blades forged from titan bone, armor worked with titan blood, the finest craftsmanship of the age. They garrisoned the palace for a full year. Nothing happened.

Then, one night, everyone inside vanished.

Not killed—gone. The fortress stood empty. The weapons remained in the armory. The food sat uneaten. Ten thousand soldiers simply ceased to be present.

King Kilren was found a week later, walking out of the forest toward Ishla'Anore. He couldn't speak. He lived another forty years, sitting in his palace, staring at walls. He never wrote. Never gestured meaningfully. Never communicated in any way. When he died, he was buried without ceremony—his name is not among those the Illronese remember.

The fortress still stands. The armory is still stocked with the finest titan-bone weapons ever forged—an arsenal worth more than most kingdoms' treasuries. The elves refuse to touch it. The few outsiders who learn of the treasure and attempt to claim it almost never return. Those who do return are like Kilren, or worse.

The fae don't seem to use the palace. They don't build or live in structures. It simply sits there, preserved, waiting. A monument and a warning.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Coastal fish, crafted goods, traditional textiles

**Primary Imports**: Grain (from Lenora), metals, titan-bone ritual objects (from Deo Esari)

Illron's economy is modest by necessity. They fish the coastal waters, craft goods in their settlements, and trade for what they cannot produce. They have no agricultural heartland—the forest takes up most of their territory, and they cannot use it.

This dependence on Lenora's grain is a source of quiet resentment. Every shipment is a reminder of what Illron gave up to honor the old pacts.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Traditional service obligations

Illron's military is small but exceptionally trained. They don't need large numbers—no one invades through fae territory, and the coastal approach is easily defensible. What soldiers they have are drilled in traditional combat forms passed down for millennia.

The Illronese do not make war. They haven't fielded an army beyond their borders since before the confederation. Their military exists to defend, not to project power.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Farlands, bordered by Ocean of Elorinia (west), Amholia Greras (north), and Wycendeula (south)

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, coastal scrubland

**Major Geographic Features**:
- **Iyaklomori Grera**: The sacred forest. Fae territory. See above.
- **Poscuni Gretanu**: Grasslands on the northeastern edge, transitioning toward Amholia Greras

**Rivers**:
- **Kilgre Venora**: Northern river, one of two legal travel routes
- **Ver Ta'Eres**: Central river, site of Kilren's Palace
- **Ver Suterela**: Southern river

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Ishla'Anore (eastern edge, outside the forest)

**Cities**:
- **E'lethelas**: Secondary city, south of Ishla'Anore, connected by road

**Coastal Settlements** (connected by coastal road):
- **A'valenor**: Northern coast, sits on the Air astral current
- **Olymethemar**: Central coast
- **Hassera**: Southern tip

**Cross-Forest Routes**:
- **Northern road**: Along Kilgre Venora, from Ishla'Anore to A'valenor
- **Diagonal trail**: 180 miles from Hassera to E'lethelas through the forest interior (rarely used)

The kingdom's settlements are arranged around the edges of Iyaklomori Grera, never within it. The eastern cities handle administration and trade with the other kingdoms. The coastal cities handle fishing and what little foreign commerce Illron engages in.

### Relations

**Lenora**: Tense. The confederation's voting structure gives Illron equal voice with Lenora despite having a quarter of the population. Lenora resents this. Illron insists the old agreements are binding and that population is irrelevant to a kingdom's worth. Both sides are correct according to their own values.

**Deo Esari**: Respectful. Both kingdoms prioritize tradition over growth. Deo Esari's recent disaster has only deepened their conservatism, which Illron quietly approves of. They are natural allies in confederation disputes.

**The Fae**: The Illronese do not consider their relationship with the fae to be diplomatic in the normal sense. The fae are not negotiating partners—they are powers to be acknowledged. The treaty is honored because the alternative has been demonstrated. Illron's monarchy derives some of its legitimacy from being the designated keeper of this relationship.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Confederation Voting**: Lenora wants representation proportional to population. Illron refuses. The treaty signed at Laeroth Esori specifies one kingdom, one voice. The ancestors are watching.
- **Economic Dependence**: Relying on Lenora for food is humiliating but unavoidable. Some younger Illronese wonder if there's a way to reduce this dependence without breaking the fae treaty.
- **The Palace Question**: The treasure in Kilren's Palace is immense. Every few generations, someone suggests mounting an expedition. The Crown always refuses. But the temptation doesn't go away.

### History

The elves who became the Illronese were the first of the eastern migrants to reach the Farlands. They found the forest already occupied. Their initial attempts to settle it ended badly. After enough failures, they negotiated.

The treaty with the fae predates the Three Kingdoms Treaty by at least a millennium. When the confederation was formed, Illron's representatives insisted that their prior obligations be acknowledged—the forest would remain fae territory, and no confederation decision could overrule that. Lenora and Deo Esari agreed. They had no reason not to; the forest wasn't theirs anyway.

King Kilren's invasion, roughly 3,000 years ago, was the last serious attempt to change the arrangement. The lesson it taught has not been forgotten.

## Ios

Tags: state, decline, constructs

A civilization running out of time. Ios built its society around the stone dolls — animated servants of stone and porcelain that handled all manual labor, freeing the human population for leisure, art, and governance. For generations, this arrangement worked beautifully. The dolls farmed the fields, hauled the goods, built the buildings, and asked nothing in return.

Then the dolls started breaking. And no one remembered how to make new ones.

The art of creating stone dolls was lost generations ago — how, exactly, is a matter of bitter debate among Ios scholars. Some say the last craftmasters died in a plague without passing on their knowledge. Others claim the secrets were deliberately destroyed to prevent the dolls from being weaponized. A few whisper that the dolls themselves somehow arranged for the knowledge to be lost. Whatever the cause, the result is the same: Ios has hundreds of stone dolls, they break down at a steady rate, and there will never be more.

### The Stone Dolls

The dolls are humanoid figures of stone and porcelain, ranging from three to seven feet tall depending on their function. They move smoothly, respond to simple commands, and perform physical labor with tireless precision. They don't speak, don't eat, don't sleep. They simply work until they break.

No one knows exactly how they function. The craftmasters who created them understood the animating principles; modern Ios citizens understand only that the dolls exist and must be maintained. Repairs are possible — broken limbs can be reattached, cracked surfaces can be sealed — but fundamental failures cannot be fixed. When a doll's animating core fails, it becomes a statue. Nothing anyone has tried can restore it.

The dolls are treated with a strange mixture of casual use and anxious care. They're tools, worked hard because the work must be done. But they're also irreplaceable, and every citizen knows that each broken doll brings Ios closer to a future where humans must do the labor themselves.

### The Crisis

The mathematics are simple and merciless. Ios has perhaps three hundred functioning stone dolls. They break down at an average rate of five to ten per year. In a generation, there will be none left. In two generations, Ios will be indistinguishable from any other state where humans do their own work.

The ruling families understand this. They've spent fortunes trying to rediscover the lost art — hiring scholars, sponsoring expeditions to find lost texts, offering rewards for anyone who can repair a failed doll. Nothing has worked. The closest anyone has come was a scholar who identified the rare stone from which the dolls were carved; the quarries at Petras were supposedly exhausted long ago, and no new deposits have been found.

The population is slowly adapting. Young people learn trades their grandparents never practiced. Fields that were maintained by dolls are being abandoned or converted to less labor-intensive uses. The terraced city of Todakres is contracting downward as the upper levels become impractical without doll labor. It's not catastrophic — Ios will survive — but the graceful society of generations past is already gone.

### Government

Ios is ruled by a council of noble families — the descendants of those who first established the stone doll tradition. Their authority was once based on control of the dolls; now it's based on tradition, wealth, and the absence of any alternative.

The council meets in Todakres, in halls that were built to showcase the dolls' capabilities. The architecture is impressive and increasingly impractical — grand staircases that strain human bearers, high ceilings that require scaffolding to maintain, elaborate mechanisms that only doll strength can operate. The noble families maintain these spaces out of pride, even as practical governance moves to more accessible locations.

Decision-making is slow and conservative. The families are paralyzed by their situation, unable to imagine a future without the dolls but equally unable to prevent it. Bold proposals are rejected because they're too risky; cautious proposals are rejected because they're too slow. The council debates while the dolls continue to break.

### Economy

Ios was once wealthy — the dolls enabled production that would be impossible with human labor alone. Now that wealth is eroding. Agricultural output has fallen as fields are abandoned. Manufacturing has declined as doll-powered workshops stand idle. Trade has shrunk as Ios has less to offer and more difficulty getting goods to market.

The shallow harbor at Methons compounds the problem. Ios can't easily import the labor-intensive goods it once produced domestically, and it can't easily export what it still makes. The state is slowly becoming self-sufficient by necessity, retreating from the broader economy as its capabilities diminish.

What remains valuable: the dolls themselves. Other states have noticed Ios's predicament and offered to purchase functioning dolls. The council has refused — selling the dolls would accelerate the decline — but as the situation worsens, the temptation grows. Some have been stolen. Some may have been sold quietly. The council doesn't discuss it.

### Culture

Ios culture was shaped by abundance — generations of humans who never performed manual labor, who grew up watching dolls handle every physical task, who developed arts and philosophies suited to lives of leisure. This culture persists even as its foundations crumble.

The noble families still maintain elaborate households, still observe complex social rituals, still patronize artists and scholars. But the rituals feel hollow now, the patronage is constrained by shrinking resources, and everyone knows that the next generation will live differently. Some families have adapted, training their children in practical skills. Others refuse, insisting that their way of life will somehow continue.

The common people are more practical. They've already begun the transition to working society, taking up trades and agriculture that their ancestors never practiced. There's resentment toward the nobles who delayed this adaptation, but also a surprising resilience. Ios citizens have survived harder things than learning to carry their own water.

### Relations

**With Moigos**: Minimal. The mountain passes are difficult, and neither state has much to offer the other. The Kappa have shown no interest in Ios — a declining state with no significant trade connections is not worth infiltrating.

**With Rilyn**: Occasional contact through the eastern passes. The Splinkreen find Ios fascinating — a culture built around artificial servants, now learning to serve itself. Some Splinkreen scholars have visited Todakres to study the dolls. Whether they learned anything useful, they haven't shared.

**With everyone else**: Ios is increasingly isolated. The state that once traded throughout the Seacleft Coast now struggles to get goods to market. Foreign merchants still visit, but their numbers decline each year as Ios has less to buy and sell.

### Notable Locations

- **Todakres**: Mountain capital, terraced city slowly contracting downward
- **Methons**: Coastal city with shallow harbor, limited maritime access
- **Petras**: Quarry town, source of the stone used for dolls
- **Rhodanos**: Agricultural center, fields shrinking as doll labor fails
- **Tolosa**: Market town, adapting better than most
- **Capsa**: River confluence town with defensive walls
- **Koilos**: Southern forest, largely unexplored, rumored ruins

### Player Hooks

- **The Last Craftmaster**: Rumors persist of a surviving craftmaster — or their notes, or their apprentice, or something that could restore the art of doll creation. The noble families will pay handsomely for any lead. So will foreign powers who want the secret for themselves.

- **Doll Theft**: Functioning dolls are being stolen from Ios estates, appearing later in foreign markets. Someone is running an operation, and the council wants it stopped — but some council members might be involved.

- **The Petras Deposits**: A prospector claims to have found new deposits of the specialized stone used for doll construction. If true, it could save Ios — or spark a war for control of the resource. If false, it's a scam. Either way, someone needs to investigate.

- **Koilos Expedition**: The ruins in the Koilos forest might hold secrets from before the stone doll tradition — including, possibly, alternative forms of magical labor. A noble family is funding an expedition. The forest has killed previous explorers, but desperation makes people brave.

- **The Awakening**: A stone doll has started behaving strangely — responding to commands differently, moving when not instructed, perhaps even attempting to communicate. Is it malfunctioning, or is something else happening? And what does it mean for the other dolls?

## Iqes

Tags: state, trade, privateering

A glittering maritime power built on coral and colonization. Iqes's coastal cities are architectural marvels — towers of cultivated pink coral, walls shimmering with mica, plazas where wealth is displayed without shame. The Qindo people who built these cities, and whose labor still sustains them, have been relegated to the bottom of a society ruled by foreign-descended merchant families.

Two centuries ago, Iqes faced absorption by a larger power. The foreign merchants who'd slowly taken economic control formalized their grip through the voting ring system, presenting a unified front that preserved independence while cementing their dominance. The native Qindo were permitted to participate — in theory. In practice, they're sailors on other people's ships, servants in other people's houses, workers whose labor builds wealth they'll never share.

### The Qindo People

The indigenous people of Iqes are distinctive: dark-skinned humans and halflings with piercing blue eyes that seem to catch the light. They share a common culture, a common language (still spoken in the interior, suppressed in the cities), and a common history of dispossession.

**Before the merchants came**, humans farmed and fished the lowlands while halflings lived in elaborate mountain cave-communities. The two peoples traded, intermarried occasionally, and shared spiritual traditions centered on ancestor veneration. The caves held generations of accumulated craft knowledge; the lowland villages held generations of agricultural wisdom. It was not wealthy by foreign standards, but it was theirs.

**The merchant takeover** happened through economics, not armies. Foreign traders arrived with ships, capital, and ambition. Trade deals became debt obligations became ownership of land and resources. The humans were economically subjugated over generations; the halflings faced something worse.

**The cave destruction** remains the defining trauma of Qindo identity. When halflings resisted economic integration — when they refused to abandon their mountain homes for wage labor in the coastal cities — the foreign merchants responded with violence. Cave entrances were collapsed, water sources poisoned, access routes destroyed. The halflings' homes became their tombs.

This wasn't just displacement; it was cultural annihilation. The caves held ancestral shrines, craft traditions, the physical record of halfling history. All gone. The survivors were "incorporated into civilized life" — forced into the coastal economy as a permanent underclass. Elders who remember the caves are still alive. The grief is fresh.

**Modern Qindo** occupy every level of society except the top. Most work as laborers, sailors, servants, craftspeople — essential workers without whom Iqes would collapse. A small middle class exists in Simphiwe, where traditional culture retained more influence. Some Qindo have accumulated enough wealth to purchase voting rings, but they're vastly outnumbered.

The halfling population is particularly marginalized. The cave-destruction trauma is recent enough that survivors still live; their children carry the grief forward. Halfling communities maintain traditions of remembrance, making pilgrimages to the ruined cave-sites, holding ceremonies that preserve what can be preserved.

### The Voting Ring System

Iqes is governed by a council whose members' votes are determined by physical tokens — heavy golden rings worn on the fingers, each one representing a vote. The more rings you hold, the more votes you cast. There is no maximum; the wealthiest ring-holders possess dozens.

**How rings are acquired:**
- **Inheritance** — the most common path; ring-holding families maintain their status across generations
- **Purchase** — possible but deliberately expensive; existing holders keep prices high
- **Debt collection** — fail to repay a ring-holder, lose your ring
- **Council grant** — for "exceptional service," i.e., corruption and political favors
- **Force** — rare and risky; taking rings by violence requires covering your tracks

The system concentrates power among those who already have it. New wealth can buy in, but old wealth controls the game. Qindo who acquire rings are tolerated but watched — their presence in the council chambers makes the foreign elite uncomfortable, reminds them that their rule requires constant maintenance.

**The Ring Hall** in Mjiqa is where the council meets. Physically, it's impressive — coral columns, mica mosaics, galleries for observers. Politically, it's a theater where decisions made in private rooms receive public endorsement. The real negotiations happen elsewhere; the Ring Hall is for announcements.

### Current Power

Power in Iqes currently concentrates around two figures:

**Sir Calroy Garoldson** represents the traditional merchant elite — foreign-descended, old money, the families who've held power since the consolidation. The "Sir" is a purchased title from somewhere distant, meaningless in Iqes but impressive to outsiders unfamiliar with the island's politics. Garoldson is pragmatic rather than cruel; he maintains the system because it benefits him, not from particular animus toward the Qindo.

**Sorvos** is more complicated. Mixed heritage, possibly partly Qindo, risen through the system rather than born into it. Whether he's a genuine reformer working within constraints, a sellout who's abandoned his people, or playing a longer game than anyone realizes — the truth depends on who you ask and when you ask them. The Qindo themselves are divided on him.

The two reportedly balance each other — Garoldson representing stability and tradition, Sorvos representing the possibility of change. Whether this balance is genuine or performed is unclear.

### Privateering

Iqes privateers operate with official sanction — letters of marque authorizing raids on foreign shipping. In theory, they target only enemy nations. In practice, definitions are flexible, and "enemy" is defined by whoever holds the most rings this season.

**How privateering works:**
- Ring-holders sponsor captains, providing ships and letters of marque
- Privateers raid foreign shipping, keeping a percentage and paying the rest to sponsors
- The council maintains plausible deniability
- Neighboring nations complain; nothing changes
- Everyone who matters profits

**The privateer class** represents one of the few paths to wealth open to Qindo. Ship captains are often natives — skill matters more than bloodline when you're hunting prizes. Successful captains can accumulate enough to buy voting rings, creating tension with establishment ring-holders who resent these upstarts.

The **Privateers' Berths** in Mjiqa harbor represent a power center somewhat independent of the old elite. Privateer captains have money, armed followers, and connections across the Seacleft Coast. They're loyal to the system that enriches them, but their loyalty is to their own interests rather than to particular ring-holders.

### Economy

Iqes's wealth comes from three sources: trade, privateering, and the labor of its people.

**Trade** flows through Mjiqa — goods from across the Seacleft Coast, up the Shulka River from the interior, across from Gyosha and beyond. The coral cities exist because Iqes sits at a crossroads; merchants from a dozen nations do business here. The ring-holders take their cut of every transaction.

**Privateering** supplements legitimate trade with stolen goods and ransomed cargoes. The line between merchant and pirate blurs in Iqes; many ring-holders have investments in both. Foreign nations complain; Iqes expresses regret and does nothing.

**Labor** — Qindo labor — makes everything possible. The dockworkers who unload ships, the servants who maintain estates, the sailors who crew vessels both merchant and privateer, the craftspeople who build the coral towers. The economy would collapse without them. They see little of the wealth they create.

### Culture

Iqes culture is layered — foreign elite aesthetics laid over Qindo foundations that never entirely disappeared.

The **coastal cities** embrace foreign fashions, imported luxuries, cosmopolitan attitudes. Ring-holders compete through displays of wealth; coral architecture grows more elaborate each generation. The language of commerce is whatever the traders speak; the language of power is the foreign tongue of the original merchants.

**Ntando and the interior** preserve Qindo traditions — ancestor veneration, communal decision-making, crafts and practices that predate the merchant takeover. Village elders hold authority here; voting rings are irrelevant. The old language survives. The old ways persist.

Between these extremes, most Qindo navigate a mixed existence — working in the foreign-dominated economy, maintaining what traditions they can, speaking one language at work and another at home.

### Relations

**With Mirko**: Complicated entanglement. Mirko's criminal networks handle goods that Iqes privateers acquire and legitimate merchants prefer not to touch directly. The relationship is profitable for both sides. Zukisani serves as the primary interface, its shipyards building vessels for buyers who ask few questions.

**With Enavadi**: Minimal contact. Enavadi's insular fishing culture has little interest in Iqes's commerce, and Iqes has nothing Enavadi wants. The two ignore each other politely.

**With Linas**: Trade relationship. Linas dye reaches markets through Iqes merchants; Iqes goods reach Linas through the same channels. Privateers mostly leave Linas shipping alone — the dye trade is too profitable to disrupt.

**With neighboring powers**: A mix of trade, raiding, and diplomatic maneuvering. Iqes maintains relations with everyone, preys on everyone, and allies with whoever offers the best terms this season.

### Notable Locations

- **Mjiqa**: Capital city at the Shulka River mouth; Ring Hall, Coral Docks, Privateers' Berths, Qindo Quarter
- **Simphiwe**: Western city, gateway to Ntando; largest halfling population, most Qindo cultural influence
- **Zukisani**: Northern port on Myusha River; shipyards, fishing fleet, trade connection to Gyosha
- **Zuko**: Interior garrison city; Tax Houses, military control, resistance cells
- **Ntando**: Traditional Qindo interior; forest villages, elder governance, halfling pilgrimage sites

### Player Hooks

- **The Ring Game**: A Qindo captain has accumulated enough wealth to buy voting rings. Established ring-holders want to prevent this without creating a martyr. Players might be hired by either side — or play both against the middle.

- **Cave Secrets**: The destroyed halfling caves weren't just homes. They contained something the merchants wanted — or wanted buried. A halfling elder knows the location of a cave that wasn't completely destroyed, and what lies within.

- **Murder Point**: Someone important was sent to the point who shouldn't have been — a ring-holder who knew too much, or a resistance leader whose death will spark violence. The body needs to be recovered before the currents scatter it, and the truth needs to come out. Or be buried deeper.

- **Sorvos's Game**: The enigmatic ring-holder is making moves that could reshape Iqes politics — but toward what end? Players might be recruited as agents, obstacles, or pawns in a game whose rules they don't fully understand.

- **Privateer Complications**: A privateer captain with connections to the players has taken a prize that someone powerful wants back — or wants destroyed. The cargo might be valuable, dangerous, or both.

## Istokos

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Bloodline aristocracy (noble houses ranked by magical potency)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Chargon (eel-descended humanoids)

**Population**: ~28,000 (Kargak ~12,000; island communities ~16,000)

**Stability**: Stable but rigid (the hierarchy is absolute)

**Core Values**: Bloodline purity, land-dwelling ascension, the rejection of the ancestral sea

The Chargon are an eel race—elongated humanoids with smooth, glistening skin that ranges from deep black to pale silver. Their bodies retain the flexibility of their aquatic ancestors; they can contort through spaces that would stop a human. Their eyes are large and dark, adapted for seeing in murky depths they now refuse to enter.

What makes Istokos unique isn't the Chargon themselves—it's what they've done to themselves.

Centuries ago, the Chargon were fully aquatic. They lived in the sea, breathed water, and knew nothing of the surface world. Then their shamans discovered bloodline magic—the ability to encode powers into their very lineage. Through generations of selective breeding and magical enhancement, they evolved themselves to live on land.

The transformation came with a price. Seawater now *weakens* the bloodline magic. A Chargon who immerses themselves in the ocean feels their inherited powers fade, their connection to their ancestors drain away. Extended exposure can strip a bloodline entirely, leaving an ordinary Chargon with no magic at all.

So the Chargon rejected the sea. They walk on land. They sail in ships designed to keep water away from their skin. They consider the ocean their enemy—the element they conquered and can never return to.

### The Bloodlines

Every noble Chargon family carries bloodline magic—powers encoded in their ancestry and passed down through generations. Different families carry different gifts, each traced to one of the **Primordial Eels**: mythological ancestors who first received magic from the deep gods.

**Major Bloodlines:**

**House Murk** (Sight Beyond) — Descended from the Eel of Depths. Their bloodline grants vision through darkness, illusion, and time. The most politically powerful house; their seers advise the throne.

**House Coil** (Body Mastery) — Descended from the Eel of Currents. Their bloodline grants extreme flexibility, speed, and the ability to squeeze through impossibly small spaces. Assassins and scouts.

**House Spark** (Lightning Blood) — Descended from the Electric Eel. Their bloodline lets them generate and control electrical discharges. Rare and feared; their touch can kill.

**House Slick** (Surface Walking) — Descended from the Eel of Shores. Their bloodline grants perfect balance, the ability to climb any surface, and resistance to being grasped. The first family to master land-dwelling.

**House Depths** (Pressure Sense) — Descended from the Abyssal Eel. Their bloodline lets them sense weight, density, and structural weaknesses. Engineers and builders.

**Lesser houses** carry diluted versions of these bloodlines, or combinations that produce weaker, stranger effects. Commoner Chargon have no bloodline magic at all—their ancestors either never received it or lost it to seawater exposure.

### The Hierarchy

Istokos society is organized entirely around bloodline potency. The stronger your ancestral magic, the higher your rank. This is determined through formal testing—**The Tasting**—conducted on every Chargon at adolescence.

The Tasting involves controlled seawater exposure. A Chargon's bloodline magic resists the dilution; the longer they can maintain their powers while partially immersed, the stronger their bloodline. Results are recorded, published, and determine that individual's place in society forever.

**King Thesslan IV** rules from Kargak—not because his family conquered or inherited, but because House Murk consistently produces the strongest bloodlines. The throne passes to whoever can prove the most potent Sight Beyond, regardless of direct descent.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Standard, advanced in certain magical applications

**Primary Exports**: Bloodline services (seers, assassins, engineers), specialized magical goods, fish (processed by commoners)

**Primary Imports**: Everything that requires water contact in production, mainland goods, laborers

Istokos runs on magical aristocracy. Noble houses hire out their bloodline abilities—Murk seers advise foreign kings, Coil assassins take contracts across the Western Isles, Spark warriors serve as elite mercenaries.

Commoner Chargon handle everything that requires water contact: fishing, sailing, cargo handling. They do the work nobles can't without risking their bloodlines. This creates a rigid class divide—nobles literally cannot do commoner jobs.

Trade flows through Kargak, the only major port. Foreign ships dock; Chargon merchants negotiate from the pier without boarding. Goods are transferred through human intermediaries who don't understand why the eel-folk won't step onto wet decks.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Elite specialists, weak conventional forces

**Enrollment**: Noble retinues (magic users), commoner conscripts (sailors and laborers)

Istokos doesn't field armies. They field bloodline specialists.

A single Spark noble can kill a dozen soldiers before they close the distance. A Coil assassin can infiltrate anywhere. A Murk seer can predict enemy movements with unsettling accuracy. But there aren't many of them, and they can't operate near significant water.

Naval power is handled by commoner crews on ships specifically designed to keep nobles dry. These vessels have covered decks, sealed compartments, and elaborate drainage systems. Nobles who must travel by sea stay in waterproof cabins, never touching the hull.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Western Isles, south of the Shattered Sea

**Biomes**: Tropical islands, warm waters

**Climate**: Warm and humid year-round

**Named Features**: Kargak (capital), various island territories

Istokos occupies a cluster of islands south of the main Shattered Sea. The waters here are warm, calm, and full of fish that the Chargon once hunted from below. Now they hunt from above—or hire others to hunt for them.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Kargak (~12,000)

**Major Islands**: Controlled by noble houses, each island essentially a house's domain

### Kargak

The capital rises from the largest island in Istokos. Stone buildings with elaborate drainage keep rainwater away from noble quarters. The streets are covered during monsoon season. Everything is designed to let the aristocracy move through their city without risking accidental water exposure.

The **Dry Palace** dominates the city center—a massive complex where the king holds court, nobles negotiate, and the Tasting ceremonies occur. The palace has never allowed seawater within its walls in four hundred years.

**King Thesslan IV** is seventy-three and his Sight Beyond remains formidable. He can see up to a week into possible futures—not certainty, but probability. This makes him nearly impossible to surprise and extremely difficult to plot against.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Dilution Crisis**

Bloodlines are weakening. Each generation, the Tasting results show slightly lower averages. Noble families quietly panic—is the magic fading? Are marriages diluting the lines? Some houses have begun extreme measures: refusing to let children touch any water, not even rain.

**Commoner Resentment**

The Chargon who do all the water-work receive none of the power. Commoner movements argue that the bloodline system is oppressive—that the nobles' fear of water has created an artificial hierarchy. These movements are ruthlessly suppressed, but they keep returning.

**The Sea's Call**

Some young Chargon feel drawn to the water despite everything. They slip away to swim, to dive, to remember what their ancestors were. Most return diminished—their bloodline damaged. Some don't return at all. The elders call this madness. The rebels call it freedom.

**External Pressure**

Other Western Isles powers would love to understand—and exploit—the bloodline system. Istokos maintains strict secrecy about how the magic works, but secrets leak. Someone, someday, will figure out how to weaponize seawater against the Chargon nobility.

### Notable Figures

**King Thesslan IV** — Ruler of Istokos, head of House Murk. His Sight Beyond is legendary; he's reportedly never been surprised by anything in sixty years. Ancient, patient, and quietly terrified that his visions show the bloodlines fading.

**Lady Seris of House Spark** — Most powerful living Spark noble. Her electrical discharges can kill at thirty paces. She's also the last Spark with full bloodline potency; her children all tested weaker.

**Venn the Drowned** — Commoner revolutionary. She deliberately immersed herself in the sea, emerged with no bloodline magic, and now preaches that the Chargon should abandon their self-imposed exile and return to the water. The nobility wants her dead.

**Prince Malkon** — King Thesslan's grandson and likely heir. His Sight Beyond tested abnormally weak. The court whispers about what this means for House Murk's future.

### History

**The Sea Time**: The Chargon lived fully aquatic for millennia. Their shamans discovered bloodline magic and began encoding powers into family lines.

**The Ascension** (~800 years ago): Over generations, Chargon shamans evolved their people to breathe air and walk on land. The cost: seawater now weakened the bloodline magic.

**The Rejection**: The first land-dwelling Chargon formally rejected the sea. They built Kargak, established the Tasting system, and created the rigid hierarchy that persists today.

**The Golden Age**: Istokos at its height—powerful bloodlines, wealthy from magical services, feared across the Western Isles.

**The Present**: Bloodlines weakening, commoners restless, young Chargon drawn to the forbidden sea. The structure that made Istokos powerful may be crumbling from within.

## Istora

Tags: state, winter-elf, istori, crimson-coast

The eastern successor to the unified Winter Elf kingdom, Istora is ruled by Queen Lamenrae—daughter of the murdered Istor XXVI and the first woman to claim the elven throne. What was once the summer half of a realm that stretched across the Crimson Coast is now a kingdom defined by grief, rage, and the slow grind of civil war.

### Overview

Istora follows the Sova Chyda river from its sources in the Suftos Hills to the Void. The sacred Winterwood anchors its spiritual life; the contested hills define its western border. The Istori were once renowned for regal calm, dignified restraint, and the patient wisdom of the long-lived. The succession crisis has burned much of that away.

Capital: **Tuur** (~3,000 population)

### Government

**Queen Lamenrae** rules—the first woman to hold the Winter Elf throne. Her claim rests on blood (daughter of the murdered king), necessity (no male heirs existed), and force of will. Traditionalists in both kingdoms consider her reign illegitimate; her supporters argue that tradition must evolve or the elves will die clinging to it.

Her court is divided between progressives (who see the crisis as opportunity for reform), revanchists (who want Klevnaf conquered and reunified), and pragmatists (who just want the kingdom to survive). Lamenrae herself is revanchist at heart—she wants her uncle dead and her kingdom restored—but she's learned to speak the progressives' language when it serves her purposes.

**The Council of Seasons** traditionally advised the monarch, with members representing different aspects of elven society. Lamenrae has gutted it, replacing deliberation with command. The remaining councilors are loyal but increasingly concerned about what their queen is becoming.

### Culture

The Istori are Winter Elves—the Istori subrace, to be precise, though they'd bristle at being called a "subrace" of anything. They live for centuries, mature slowly, and have traditionally valued patience, ceremony, and the long view. Foxes and snowy owls serve as companions and messengers, a tradition dating back to the first settlements.

The war has changed them. Outsiders describe the Istori as having "become much nastier"—centuries of regal calm replaced by siege mentality. Strangers are suspected; questions are threats; mercy is weakness. They still perform the old ceremonies, but the grace has gone out of them. What remains is going through motions, clinging to forms while their substance erodes.

**Theological innovation** has emerged from necessity. Traditional elven religion demands a male monarch leading the rites; Lamenrae's coronation required new interpretations. Istora's priests have developed justifications—arguments that the gods care about spirit rather than form, that tradition must serve the people rather than rule them. Klevnaf considers this heresy; Istora considers it survival.

The Winterwood remains central to Istori spirituality. Unlike Klevnaf's absolute prohibition on logging, Istora permits sustainable harvesting from the sacred forest's edges—another theological innovation that horrifies traditionalists. The elves say the ancestors understand the needs of the living. Whether they actually do is a matter of faith.

### Economy

Istora's economy is strained but functional. The Sova Chyda provides irrigation for limited agriculture; the Winterwood offers sustainable timber; eastern trade routes to the Dragon's Spine Coast remain open. The kingdom exports exquisitely carved woodwork—Istori craftsmen are renowned across Aboyinzu—and imports food, weapons, and metal goods.

Fishing supplements agriculture. The Istori have developed preservation techniques that allow catches to last through long winters. It's not enough; the kingdom runs a food deficit and depends on imports that the war makes expensive and unreliable.

### Military

Istora fields roughly 1,000 trained soldiers—more than Klevnaf due to larger population and better supply. Training occurs at Bejakørn, far from the front lines. Young elves arrive as civilians and leave as warriors, ready for deployment to the Suftos line.

Their equipment is superior—eastern trade keeps weapons and armor flowing—but terrain favors defense. Advancing across the Suftos Hills means attacking uphill into prepared positions. The war has stalemated because neither side can project force effectively.

**Special forces**: Istora has developed units specialized in shadow warfare—assassination, sabotage, intelligence gathering. Lamenrae denies their existence while deploying them aggressively. Several Klevnaf officials have died under mysterious circumstances.

### Relations

**With Klevnaf**: Active war. Border skirmishes are constant; major offensives occur when one side thinks it sees an opening. Both kingdoms are exhausting themselves without achieving decisive results.

**With Tangiern**: Complicated. Lamenrae has approached King Halvard about alliance, emphasizing that a progressive elven kingdom would be a better neighbor than traditionalist alternatives. Halvard has listened but not committed. Neither trusts the other, and both suspect any deal would leave them worse off.

**With the Dragon's Spine Coast**: Limited trade continues through Bejakørn. The eastern powers consider the Crimson Coast a backwater and its civil war a local problem.

### History

The Winter Elves arrived on the Crimson Coast millennia ago, displacing or absorbing earlier inhabitants. They built a civilization spanning the region—elegant in summer, enduring in winter—that lasted until the murder of Istor XXVI.

The succession crisis began when the old king (Istor XXV) died and his eldest son inherited. Within months, Istor XXVI was dead—poisoned, his daughter claimed, by his own brother Taoinor who wanted the throne. Taoinor denied it; the evidence was circumstantial; the kingdom split along existing fault lines. Those who valued tradition over evidence followed Taoinor; those who believed Lamenrae (or simply wanted change) followed her.

The split wasn't clean. Families divided; villages were purged; the Suftos Hills became a killing ground. The initial chaos has settled into attritional warfare that neither side can win or end.

### What Outsiders Notice

- The cold courtesy that feels like it might turn hostile at any moment
- Foxes and owls that watch strangers with uncanny intelligence
- Architecture that combines elegance with recent fortification
- The way conversations stop when outsiders approach
- References to "the usurper" delivered with genuine hatred

### Adventure Hooks

- Lamenrae wants deniable agents to infiltrate Klevnaf—information, assassination, or sabotage
- Something in the Winterwood is behaving strangely; the priests won't discuss it but seem frightened
- A moderate faction in both kingdoms wants to negotiate peace; they need neutral intermediaries
- The Shrine of Reflections has begun producing prophecies that terrify those who hear them

## Iylovia

Tags: state

Links: States

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council of Silence (nominal)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gyv

**Population**: ~20,000

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Self-preservation, cunning, distrust

The Gyv cannot trust each other. Their Silver Tongue ability—subtle mind manipulation through conversation—means every interaction could be an attempt at control. So they built systems to govern without trust.

The **Council of Silence** meets in Theochori, in a chamber where speaking is forbidden. Proposals are submitted in writing. Votes cast by sealed ballot. Debates happen through intermediate written exchanges over days or weeks. It's agonizingly slow, but it prevents any single Gyv from manipulating the council through speech.

In peacetime, this worked. Representatives from across Iylovia would gather, deliberate through written protocol, and reach decisions. The process was glacial but fair—or at least, evenly manipulated.

In war, it's failing. Decisions take weeks while people die. The western settlements have started ignoring Theochori, making their own calls. The eastern settlements barely participate at all, too busy securing their own escape routes. The council still meets, still debates in silence, but its authority erodes with every passing season.


### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Timber, woven goods, forest medicines, rare plants

**Primary Imports**: Metal, grain, weapons

Iylovia's forests provide abundant resources: timber, plant fibers for cloth and rope, medicinal herbs, honey, rare dyes. The Gyv are skilled weavers and their textiles are prized across the region.

The problem is trade. The western regions are war zones—no merchants venture there. The center is isolated. Only the eastern coast has reliable trade access, through ports that connect to the Gray Isles and beyond.

This creates economic imbalance. The east grows wealthy while the west starves for supplies. Eastern merchants charge western settlements premium prices for metal and weapons. The west accuses the east of profiteering from their suffering. The east points out that they're the only ones keeping any trade flowing at all.

Both sides are probably right. Both sides are probably manipulating the situation for advantage.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (in western regions), Voluntary (elsewhere)

The Gyv have no conventional army. They never needed one—their manipulation worked better than swords. When the Silzar invaded, the Gyv discovered that mind control doesn't stop a charging mammoth.

Now they fight through **ambush and guerrilla tactics**. Small groups of fighters lurk in the forests, waiting for Silzar raiding parties to push too deep. When targets are isolated, the Gyv emerge, get close, and start talking. A minute of conversation can turn enemies against each other. The forests become killing grounds—not through superior force, but through confusion, betrayal, and manipulated rage.

The western settlements have developed the most effective fighters. They've learned to coordinate—somewhat—despite their cultural inability to trust. They use written signals, prearranged plans, and strict protocols that minimize conversation between allies. It's crude compared to how other armies operate, but it's better than nothing.

The east has almost no military presence. They're counting on the west to hold. Or they're counting on negotiating separately if the west falls.


### Geography

**Location**: Forested region east of Silwyn, with eastern coastal access

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, swampland, hills, coastal lowlands

**Named Entities**: Gwyrdyr Forest, Leering Wood, Astrella Forest, Bittermarsh, Spinefir Forest, Terror Grove, Hagwood, Howlwood, Graymist Forest

**Rivers & Lakes**: River Sorrow, Gwyrdyr River, Skleidyon River, Odrigi River, Savarin River, Torpastros River, Graymist Lake

**Adjacent Waters**: Eastern coastal waters (access to Gray Isles and beyond)

Iylovia is defined by its forests. Dense woodland covers most of the nation, broken by rivers, marshland, and scattered settlements. The forests provide the Gyv's only military advantage—close quarters where their manipulation works, cover for ambushes, terrain that mammoths cannot navigate.

The western border with Silwyn runs through Gwyrdyr Forest, the most contested territory in the region. The Skleidyon River cuts through the center, passing through Theochori. The eastern regions slope down toward the coast, where the forests thin and trade ports connect to the wider world.


### Political Geography

**Capital**: Theochori

**Cities**: Theochori (capital), Krania (northern fortress), Balastafika (central)

**Major Towns**: Malesi, Ambelokipol, Mega Kalitsi, Ayia Paraskevi (western front); Skala Tuzlas, Varvares, Andigonos (eastern coast)

**Notable Sites**: Cheykiov (fortress ruins)

Settlement patterns reflect the war:

**The Western Front** (Gwyrdyr Forest region): Dense clusters of towns along the River Sorrow and Gwyrdyr River. Krania anchors the north—a fortress-city that has held against repeated Silzar pressure. Settlements like Malesi, Ambelokipol, and Ayia Paraskevi form a defensive network, supporting each other through the forests. These are the stubborn Gyv, the ones who refused to flee when the plains fell.

**The Center** (around Theochori): The capital sits on the Skleidyon River, protected by Spinefir Forest to the north and Terror Grove to the south. Balastafika serves as a secondary administrative center. This region is relatively safe—far from the front, connected by river trade.

**The Eastern Coast** (Odrigi and Savarin rivers): Trading settlements with port access. Skala Tuzlas, Varvares, and Andigonos handle most of Iylovia's external commerce. These communities are wealthier than the west, more connected to the outside world, and increasingly willing to consider their own survival over national unity.

**Cheykiov**: Fortress ruins in the hills southwest of Spinefir Forest. This defensive position fell early in the war—not to Silzar assault, but to betrayal. Someone manipulated the defenders. Someone opened the gates. The details are disputed; everyone blames everyone else. Cheykiov stands as a monument to Gyv dysfunction: they couldn't hold even a fortified position because they couldn't trust their own garrison.


### Primary Conflicts

**The War with Silwyn**

For forty-odd years, the Silzar have been pushing the Gyv back. What was once a Gyv domain stretching to the southern desert is now Silwyn—plains controlled by mammoth-riding ogres who've learned to counter Gyv manipulation with ear protection and overwhelming noise.

The Gyv hold the forests. The Silzar raid the edges. Neither side can break the stalemate, but the Gyv are losing slowly. Every raid costs them people, supplies, morale. The Silzar can afford attrition; the Gyv cannot.

**East vs. West**

The western Gyv are fighting and dying. The eastern Gyv are trading and preparing escape routes. Neither trusts the other.

The west accuses the east of abandonment, profiteering, perhaps even secret deals with the Silzar. The east accuses the west of strategic incompetence, wasted resources, perhaps even provoking the Silzar unnecessarily.

Both accusations probably contain truth. Both sides are certainly manipulating the narrative. The Council of Silence is supposed to mediate, but the council is too slow, too compromised, too far from either faction to matter.

**Internal Betrayal**

Someone is selling information to the Silzar. Probably multiple someones. Raid patterns suggest the Silzar know things they shouldn't—patrol schedules, supply routes, which settlements have weak defenses.

Everyone suspects everyone. Accusations fly constantly. Some are genuine attempts to find traitors; others are schemes to eliminate rivals by branding them collaborators. The paranoia feeds itself: the more accusations, the more distrust, the more betrayal seems inevitable, the more people consider betraying before they're betrayed.

**The Reform Movement**

Some Gyv argue that manipulation itself is the problem. They point to the Marked—Gyv who've had their Silver Tongue suppressed—as potential leaders. "Let the trustworthy lead us. Let us learn to speak honestly, at least among ourselves."

The traditionalists call this cultural suicide. The reformers call it survival. The argument has no resolution because neither side trusts the other's motives.


### History

**The Dominion**

The Gyv once ruled far beyond the forests. The plains that are now Silwyn? Gyv territory. The Silzar who lived there were scattered, weak, hunted for sport or enslaved for labor. The Gyv built settlements across the grasslands, managed the land, took what they wanted from the primitive ogres who couldn't resist their manipulation.

This lasted for generations. The Gyv assumed it would last forever.

**The Covenant**

Then the Silzar formed their alliance with the mammoth herds, and everything changed.

The Gyv didn't understand the threat at first. Ogres riding beasts? Amusing. Let them play at cavalry. A few words in the right ears would send them fighting each other.

But the mammoths trumpeted. The sound drowned out conversation. The Silzar wore coverings over their ears. And the ballistae struck from distances where no Gyv voice could reach.

The first Gyv settlements on the plains fell quickly. Then more. Then the retreat became a rout.

**The Retreat**

The Gyv fell back to the forests, where their abilities still functioned. Dense trees provided cover for ambush. Close quarters let them get within speaking range. The forest itself became their weapon—not magically, but tactically.

But they'd lost the plains. Lost settlements their families had held for generations. Lost slaves, livestock, resources, everything that wasn't portable. The Gyv who escaped to the forests arrived as refugees, crowding into communities that barely tolerated each other in good times.

**The Stalemate**

For decades now, the war has ground on. The Silzar control the plains. The Gyv hold the forests. The border is written in blood—raids, ambushes, atrocities on both sides.

The Gyv are losing. Slowly. Inexorably. They can't replace losses as fast as the Silzar inflict them. They can't coordinate defense because they can't trust each other. They're bleeding out, and everyone knows it, and no one can agree on what to do about it.


### Relations

**Silwyn**: War. The Silzar raid constantly; the Gyv ambush what they can. Neither side negotiates—the Silzar don't trust Gyv words, and the Gyv can't agree on what to offer anyway.

**Eros**: Avoidance. The haunted forest lies north of Iylovia, but the Gyv ignore it. The Nemo are terrifying, and unlike the Silzar, they cannot be manipulated. Some desperate voices suggest reaching out to Eros, pointing the Nemo at the Silzar somehow. Most consider this insane.

**Gray Isles and Beyond**: Trade. The eastern ports connect Iylovia to the outside world. Merchants come for timber and textiles; they bring metal and news. These relationships are Iylovia's lifeline—and the east's leverage over the rest of the nation.

**Everyone Else**: Suspicion. The Gyv reputation precedes them. Everyone knows they're manipulators. Trust is impossible. Trade happens anyway, because money talks louder than reputation, but no one deals with a Gyv without counting their fingers afterward.


### Player Hooks

**Nothing They Say Is True**: Players entering Iylovia will be manipulated. Everyone has an angle. The question isn't whether to trust the Gyv—you can't—but whose manipulation serves your interests.

**The Informant Hunt**: Someone is selling secrets to the Silzar. Multiple factions want the traitor found—some to punish them, others to silence them, others to take over the operation. Players could be hired by any faction, set against each other, or caught in the crossfire.

**East vs. West**: The eastern Gyv might hire players to sabotage western defenses, hastening collapse so they can negotiate separately. The western Gyv might hire players to prevent eastern betrayal. Both sides are lying about their true goals.

**Cheykiov**: The fortress ruins hold secrets. What really happened there? Who opened the gates? Some say treasure lies buried in the collapse. Others say something worse than treasure was sealed away.

**The Reform Movement**: The Marked—Gyv without manipulation powers—are trying to build a different kind of society. They might seek outside help: protectors, witnesses, people who can verify that they're actually trustworthy. Or their whole movement might be an elaborate scheme by Speakers pretending to be reformed.

**The Nemo Option**: Some desperate Gyv are seriously considering contact with Eros. They need someone willing to enter the haunted forest and speak to things that should not be spoken to. They're offering everything they have. They're probably also lying about what "everything" means.

## Jeh Bli

Tags: state, citystate, orc, farlands

The only city in the northern Farlands—an orc settlement on the shores of Lake Kro Nymos, five hundred miles from the nearest civilization. The Xi'ivrach who live here are among the strangest orcs in the known world: stone-weighted, scar-covered, and utterly devoted to gods that might actually answer.

### Overview

Jeh Bli is less a city than a sprawling religious complex that happens to house twelve thousand people. Stone towers rise from the lakeshore, their bases submerged, their tops hung with offerings. Bridges of carved basalt connect platform neighborhoods built on artificial islands. Everything is heavy, deliberate, built to endure—and built to sink, eventually, into the sacred waters below.

The Xi'ivrach came here centuries ago, following visions that promised a place where the gods would be close. They found Kro Nymos and its central island, *Ghural-Kro*, where something answered their prayers. What exactly it is, the Xi'ivrach don't say—perhaps they don't know. But their priests speak in Deoric, the language of truth, and their prayers produce results. That's enough for them.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic oligarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Xi'ivrach orcs

**Population**: ~12,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

The city is ruled by the **Keth-Vorun**, the "Bearers of Weight"—seven high priests who have survived the trials of ascending to the highest ranks of their faith. Each wears ceremonial stone armor weighing hundreds of pounds, which they never remove. They sleep in it, eat in it, conduct all business in it. The weight is their proof of devotion.

Decisions are made by consensus among the Keth-Vorun, with the eldest serving as tiebreaker. In practice, most governance is handled by lower-ranking priests; the Keth-Vorun concern themselves primarily with religious matters and interpreting the will of the gods.

**Core Values**:

- Devotion expressed through burden—the more you carry, the closer you are to the divine
- Scars as sacred text, earned through trials of pain and endurance
- The lake provides; the lake is owed

### The Faith

The Xi'ivrach worship what they call *Keth-Ghural*, "the Weight Beneath"—a divine presence they believe resides in or beneath Lake Kro Nymos. They don't personify it with faces or stories. It simply is: vast, patient, hungry for devotion.

Worship takes the form of burden. Children begin wearing stone beads at age three. By adulthood, a devout Xi'ivrach carries fifty pounds of sacred stone at all times—jewelry, clothing, woven stone cord in their hair. The priests carry more. The Keth-Vorun carry weights that would crush an ordinary orc.

The scarification is equally important. Every significant moment in a Xi'ivrach's life is marked on their skin—births, deaths, victories, failures, visions, answered prayers. The scars are raised with ash rubbed into the wounds, creating ridged patterns that cover most of their bodies by middle age. Reading someone's scars is an intimate act; lying about what your scars mean is the closest thing the Xi'ivrach have to blasphemy.

### Deoric Magic

The high priests of Jeh Bli have mastered fragments of Deoric, the language of truth that underlies reality itself. Speaking Deoric is enormously difficult—most mortals cannot form the sounds at all—but the Xi'ivrach have spent generations training their mouths and throats to approximate it.

When a priest speaks a Deoric word, reality pays attention. The language doesn't grant wishes; it describes what is true, and the universe adjusts. A priest who can say "healed" in Deoric doesn't cast a healing spell—they state a fact that wasn't true until they said it.

This power is limited. No one in Jeh Bli speaks more than a handful of Deoric words, and each one requires years of training. But even a few words of truth in a world of lies gives the Xi'ivrach an advantage that's kept them safe in their isolation for centuries.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**:
- Carved stone (religious objects, weapons, architectural elements)
- Deoric blessings (extremely expensive, rarely offered to outsiders)
- Ridgeback hides (from mountain hunts)
- Preserved fish (*kro-zheth* oil is valuable as fuel and waterproofing)

**Primary Imports**:
- Metal (they have almost none locally)
- Textiles (stone doesn't replace all clothing)
- Medicines (the lake provides food, not pharmacology)
- Occasional luxury goods for the temples

The Xi'ivrach are largely self-sufficient. The lake provides fish, the Butterfly Forest provides game and timber (during careful daytime expeditions), and the mountain streams provide water. What they can't produce, they trade for—primarily with merchants brave or foolish enough to make the five-hundred-mile journey from Lenora.

Trade caravans arrive perhaps twice a year. The Xi'ivrach pay in carved stone, which is valued by elven collectors for its alien aesthetics, and occasionally in blessings—a Deoric word spoken over a newborn, a sacred scar cut into a merchant's flesh to ward off misfortune. These services are expensive. They're also genuine.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (but all adults are trained)

Every Xi'ivrach learns to fight. The weight training that begins in childhood produces warriors of tremendous strength and endurance. A Xi'ivrach soldier can march in stone armor that would exhaust a human in minutes. Their weapons are stone-headed—axes, hammers, maces—and they hit harder than metal in Xi'ivrach hands.

The city maintains no standing army; it doesn't need one. No enemy has ever reached Jeh Bli. The wilderness filters out anyone who isn't determined enough to cross it, and anyone that determined is either trading or dying in the Butterfly Forest overnight.

The priests are the elite. Those who've mastered even one Deoric word are walking weapons—capable of stating "broken" or "stopped" or "dead" and having it be true. The Keth-Vorun could end most battles before they begin. They've never had to.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Farlands, shore of Lake Kro Nymos

**Biomes**: Mountain valley, lake shore, forest edge

**Named Entities**:
- *Ghural-Kro* (the island) — sacred, forbidden
- *Kro Gheth* (the north shore) — sacred ground for shamanic rites
- The Sunset Mountains — western boundary, hunting grounds
- The Butterfly Forest — eastern boundary, dangerous

**Rivers & Lakes**: Lake Kro Nymos (the foundation of everything)

**Adjacent Waters**: Troikan Strait (distant, irrelevant)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Jeh Bli (the only settlement)

**Cities**: None besides the capital

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Seasonal fishing camps on the lakeshore, abandoned in winter

### Neighbors and Relations

The Xi'ivrach have no neighbors in any meaningful sense. The elven kingdoms are five hundred miles south; they've never had a conflict because they've never had contact. Ios lies across the Troikan Strait, but the Xi'ivrach have no interest in the stone-doll builders and their failing civilization.

Occasional traders come from Lenora. The Xi'ivrach treat them with formal hospitality, trade fairly, and make clear they should leave before sunset. The traders obey.

The orcs are aware of the wider world. They're not curious about it. They found what they were looking for when they found Kro Nymos. Everything else is distraction.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Island Stirs**: Something on *Ghural-Kro* has become more active lately. The offerings sink faster. The shamans return from *Kro Gheth* with new scars they didn't cut themselves. The Keth-Vorun are praying more and eating less.

- **The Youth Question**: Some younger Xi'ivrach chafe at the isolation. They want to know what's beyond the forest, across the strait, south of the mountains. The elders say there's nothing worth knowing. The tension is growing.

- **The Forgetting**: An old shaman died last year, and with her went knowledge of a Deoric word no one else could speak. It's happened before, will happen again. The language of truth is slipping away, one death at a time.

### History

The Xi'ivrach arrived at Kro Nymos approximately four centuries ago, part of a larger orc migration whose origins are lost to oral history. They say they were called—that shamans dreamed of a still lake where the gods waited. They followed the dreams across unmapped wilderness until they found it.

What happened when they arrived is unclear. The Xi'ivrach don't record history the way other peoples do; they record it in scars, and the first generation's scars died with them. What's known is that they made contact with something in or beneath the lake, and that something made a bargain with them.

The terms of the bargain, if there are terms, aren't public. The Xi'ivrach are allowed to live here. The lake provides. The island is forbidden. Offerings are made. The priests learn Deoric. That's all outsiders know.

Four centuries later, nothing has changed. The Xi'ivrach aren't expanding, aren't building empire, aren't interested in the affairs of the wider world. They're waiting for something. They might not know what.

### Player Hooks

- **The Deoric Trade**: A dying merchant offers the party a fortune to escort him to Jeh Bli. He's heard the priests can speak health into existence. The journey is five hundred miles through monster territory. The priests might refuse him. He doesn't care.

- **The Exile**: A young Xi'ivrach has fled the city, her sacred stones abandoned, her scarifications defaced with self-inflicted burns. She's trying to reach Lenora. She says something is wrong at Kro Nymos—that the island is waking up, that the Keth-Vorun are preparing for something terrible. She might be telling the truth. She might be insane from guilt. She might be both.

- **The Empty Word**: A Deoric fragment has surfaced in Lenora—a stone tablet inscribed with a word no one can read. The elves want to sell it. The Xi'ivrach want it back. Various other parties want it for their own reasons. It's worth killing over, if it's genuine.

- **The Trade Caravan**: A merchant house is organizing its annual expedition to Jeh Bli and hiring guards. Good pay, dangerous work. The merchants know the route, know the risks, know exactly how not to anger the orcs. All the party has to do is keep them alive.

## Joswik

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, mixed

**Population**: 250,000

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Tradition, community, resilience

- Ruled by Prince Edric, the youngest of the three siblings who inherited Ofrenia. He's kind, well-meaning, and completely out of his depth.
- Edric inherited the southern kingdom—rich in minerals and farmland, but lacking Tornia's trade networks or Sylke's ruthless efficiency. He's tried to rule fairly and has mostly succeeded in pleasing no one.
- The population is fiercely independent, descended from miners and farmers who carved their living from difficult land. They don't love Edric, but they don't hate him either.
- With Alisandra now controlling Tornia, Joswik is the last independent kingdom on Ofrenia. Everyone knows what's coming.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Iron, copper, stone, grain, livestock

**Primary Imports**: Manufactured goods, timber, luxury items

- The Gnomestone Mountains yield iron and copper that once supplied all of Ofrenia. Now those minerals flow to whoever will buy them—and increasingly, Alisandra's agents are the only buyers offering fair prices.
- The Oshkensi Plateau supports sheep and cattle in numbers that feed both Joswik and its neighbors. The herders there answer to no one but themselves.
- Trade has suffered since the war. Merchants fear traveling through occupied Tornia, and the route through Myastor adds weeks and costs.
- Joswik could be prosperous, but prosperity requires stability that Edric can't provide and peace that Alisandra won't allow.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Joswik has never maintained a large standing army. The population is spread thin across mining towns and farming villages, and pulling workers away disrupts everything.
- What military exists is poorly equipped, poorly trained, and knows it can't stop Sylke if Alisandra decides to invade.
- The one bright spot: the terrain. The Gnomestone Mountains and the interior hills favor defense. An invader would need to fight through passes and valleys where numbers matter less.
- Some nobles have begun hiring mercenaries, but there aren't enough gold and there aren't enough mercenaries to make a real difference.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Ofrenia, the island at the heart of the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Mountain ranges, rolling hills, fertile valleys, coastal lowlands, plateau grasslands

**Named Entities**: Gnomestone Mountains, Oshkensi Plateau, Gulf of Joswik, Meadow of Laughing

**Rivers & Lakes**: Multiple rivers flowing from the Gnomestone Mountains to the coasts

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea, Gulf of Joswik, the Passage (north)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Padena

**Cities**: Padena, Valeria

**Towns**: Trenton, Greymill, Sculpton, Shardak, Canfaldo, Banksted, Clifton, Ellismare, Osperton, Dagmanton, Welldale, Pasterton

**Villages**: Mining villages in the mountains, farming villages in the valleys, herding communities on the plateau

### Primary Conflicts

**The Coming Storm**

Everyone in Joswik knows Alisandra is coming. The question is when, not if. Edric has tried diplomacy—his sister won't negotiate. He's tried building alliances—no one wants to challenge Sylke. He's tried preparing defenses—there isn't enough money or time. The kingdom waits for the axe to fall.

**The Refugee Crisis**

Tornian refugees have been flooding into Joswik since the occupation—nobles who fled with their wealth, soldiers who refused to serve Alisandra, common folk who saw which way the wind was blowing. They bring skills and gold, but also mouths to feed and resentments to manage. Some want Edric to lead a liberation; others just want safety.

**The Mountain Lords**

The mining towns of the Gnomestone Mountains have always been semi-independent, paying taxes but governing themselves. With Joswik's central authority weakening, some are asking why they should pay taxes at all. Edric needs their minerals for any hope of defense, but he can't afford to antagonize them.

**The Oshkensi Question**

The herders of Oshkensi Plateau care nothing for lowland politics. They've weathered regime changes before and expect to weather this one. If Alisandra conquers Joswik, the plateau folk will simply retreat into their grasslands and wait. This attitude infuriates Edric's advisors but might actually be the wisest response.

### History

Joswik was the old king's favorite project—the troubled southern province he'd spent decades developing. When he divided Ofrenia among his children, he gave Joswik to Edric, his youngest, believing the gentlest son needed the most guidance and the kingdom with the most potential.

He was half right. Edric is gentle, thoughtful, and genuinely cares about his people. He's also indecisive, easily manipulated, and lacks the ruthlessness that ruling requires. His father's advisors have mostly died or retired; the replacements serve their own interests first.

For the first years after the division, Joswik muddled along. The mines produced, the farms yielded, and Edric presided over a kingdom that functioned despite rather than because of his rule. He maintained cordial relations with both siblings, hoping the family could eventually reconcile.

That hope died when Alisandra invaded Tornia. Now Edric rules the last free kingdom on Ofrenia, surrounded by his sister's territory, watching refugees pour across his borders, and knowing he lacks the strength to stop what's coming.

His one advantage: he hasn't given Alisandra a reason to invade. No insults, no provocations, no alliances with her enemies. If she moves against Joswik, she'll be the naked aggressor—and even her cowed subjects might balk at conquering a brother who offered nothing but peace. Edric is betting that shame, at least, might slow her down.

He's probably wrong. But he doesn't know what else to do.

## Jüt

Tags: state, port, westwilds

A trading city of roughly twenty thousand people positioned on Kettle Bay, where the Westwilds coast meets the sea. Jüt is the region's window to the outside world—the only significant port on this stretch of coastline.

### Overview

Jüt survives by being useful to everyone. The city doesn't produce much itself; instead, it serves as a crossroads where the Westwilds' strange goods meet the broader markets. Seyiki gnomes bring crystal fragments and dragonfly chitin from the desert pillars. Melodians arrive with resonant wood and rare botanicals. Lacirean caravans carry spring water and Grayl-amber. Ships from the Western Isles bring metal, textiles, and everything the land-locked interior can't produce.

The city is built into the base of the Cliffs of Shondromos—dramatic pale limestone riddled with caves. The harbor is carved from a natural inlet where the cliffs recede, providing shelter from storms and a natural barrier against landward attack.

### Government

The Jüt Council consists of representatives from the twelve most powerful trading houses, rotating through leadership positions annually. Decisions require majority agreement; controversial matters need supermajority.

The system is corrupt, factional, and inefficient—but stable. The trading houses have too much to lose from instability to let disputes escalate beyond economic warfare. Deadlocks resolve through negotiation, bribery, or occasionally strategic assassination (considered gauche but not unprecedented).

Citizenship ties to property ownership or guild membership. Non-citizens can live and work freely but have no political voice—which suits most traders, since they're not staying anyway.

### Culture

**Pragmatism:** Jüt's defining virtue. The city exists to move goods between people who'd otherwise never interact. That requires tolerance, flexibility, and a willingness to overlook inconvenient details.

**Polyglot:** Half a dozen languages echo through the streets. Gnomes bargain with orcs bargain with human sailors bargain with elven merchants. Everyone learns at least two languages; many speak five or six badly.

**Rough Edges:** Jüt isn't beautiful or cultured. The architecture is functional—stone and timber built to withstand salt air, not to impress. The wealthy live in fortified compounds; everyone else makes do. Crime is managed, not eliminated; the Council considers it a cost of doing business.

### Economy

Jüt is pure trade:

**From Seyiki:** Twyl crystal fragments, dragonfly chitin, locust products, occasional Postronamas artifacts

**From Melodia:** Pipe-willow wood, unique botanicals, Melodian crafts

**From Lacire:** Waters of Vyowehr, Grayl-amber, Walking Forest herbs

**From the Western Isles:** Metal (especially iron and steel), textiles, spices, luxury goods, weapons

**From the Orc States:** Furs, worked leather, gemstones (sometimes cursed), mercenary contracts

The fishing fleet is substantial; salted fish is one of the few things Jüt actually produces rather than just handles.

### Military

Being the only port makes Jüt everyone's target.

**The Militia:** Well-funded, well-equipped, experienced. Service is prestigious—one of the few paths to citizenship for outsiders.

**The Walls:** Solid if not massive. The cliffs at the city's back limit approach angles.

**Protection Payments:** Jüt pays tribute in multiple directions—to orc states that could overwhelm them if united, to Western Isles captains who guarantee safe passage, to whoever else needs paying this year. Expensive, but cheaper than war.

**The Fleet:** Small but capable. Enough to discourage casual piracy and escort valuable shipments.

### Relations

**The Seyiki:** Primary trading partners from inland. Relations are commercial and cordial; neither side has reason to make trouble.

**The Orc States:** Complicated. Some trade; some raid; some do both depending on the season. The protection payments help, but tensions are never entirely absent.

**Western Isles:** Vital maritime connection. Pirates are a constant problem; legitimate traders are essential.

**Lacire:** Valuable but distant. The caravans are irregular, and the Lacireans are strange, but their goods command premium prices.

### The Cliffs

The Cliffs of Shondromos are riddled with caves at waterline—thousands of them, forming a honeycomb that smugglers have used for generations. The militia plays endless cat-and-mouse with operators who know the cave systems better than any guard. Officially, the caves belong to the city. Unofficially, they're ungovernable.

### Notable Locations

**The Harbor:** The city's heart—always busy, always noisy, always dangerous after dark.

**The Cliff Warrens:** Where the poorest citizens live, in structures built against or into the limestone.

**The Trading Houses:** Fortified compounds where the wealthy conduct business behind walls.

**Kettle Bay:** The broad, sheltered inlet—excellent anchorage surrounded by smuggler-riddled caves.

### Player Hooks

- Seek passage to the Western Isles
- Find buyers for exotic Westwilds goods
- Navigate the city's factional politics for profit or justice
- Hunt smugglers in the Shondromos caves
- Defend against a pirate raid or orc warband
- Investigate what's living in the deepest caves—something that's making the usual smugglers nervous

## Kadroka

Tags: state, nation, dragon-ruled

Kadroka is a savanna state in southwestern Central Aboyinzu, ruled by the paralyzed dragon Melekas from the capital city of Ponoigari. It is a land of contradictions: prosperous but besieged, well-governed but under the thumb of a dragon, connected to major trade routes but functionally landlocked by hostile orcs.

### Geography

Kadroka occupies the transitional zone between the dense forests of the northwest (Penor Syalki, Sokorgül) and the Ramakemizi Mountains to the east. The terrain is largely open savanna and grassland, punctuated by rivers draining toward the southwestern coast.

**Borders:**
- **North**: Penor Syalki forest and Phaerhom (fairy territory)
- **East**: Ramakemizi Mountains (beyond which lies the Dalizi Confederation)
- **South/Southwest**: Tythikerys (blood orc territory) and the Agony Stones
- **West**: Sokorgül forest and Bluesong Bay (coastal access blocked by Tythikerys)

Despite proximity to the coast, Kadroka has no functional maritime access. The Tytheri blood orcs control the entire coastline of Bluesong Bay, effectively landlocking the state.

### The Dragon-King

Kadroka is ruled by Melekas the Stillbound, an ancient dragon who has been paralyzed and fused to the bedrock beneath Ponoigari for nearly eight hundred years. The dragon was crippled by contact with the Agony Stones and now rules through cunning, information networks, and the cultivation of loyal agents rather than physical might.

This arrangement is unusual among dragon-ruled territories. Most dragons dominate through the threat of aerial assault and mobility. Melekas can do neither—but the dragon has had eight centuries to perfect the art of ruling without them.

### Population

Kadroka is home to a mixed population of humans and naga, with smaller numbers of other peoples drawn by trade or service to the dragon.

**Naga** hold significant influence, serving in Melekas's inner circle as advisors, administrators, and interpreters of draconic will. Dragons and naga share ancient connections, and many naga families have served the Stillbound for generations.

**Humans** form the majority of the common population—farmers, merchants, soldiers, and craftspeople. Some resent naga prominence; others have prospered under the stability that draconic rule provides.

### Major Settlements

**Ponoigari** (Capital): Built around and upon the immobilized body of Melekas. The palace complex incorporates the dragon's petrified form, and the living head serves as the center of government. Population concentrated here for protection and proximity to power.

**Sukinada** (City): Eastern city near the Ramakemizi Mountains, serving as the primary gateway for trade with the Dalizi Confederation. Mountain passes connect through to Chechol and the eastern territories.

**Ibasaka** (City): Northern city on the Noara River, positioned between the capital and the forest territories to the north.

**Dranabaru** (City): Southern city near the Bloodswamp, uncomfortably close to Tytheri raiding routes but strategically important for monitoring orc movements.

**Arigaska** (City): Southernmost major settlement, essentially a fortified frontier town that bears the brunt of Tytheri raids.

### Economy

Kadroka's economy is shaped by its geographic constraints:

**Agriculture**: The savanna supports extensive cattle herding and grain cultivation. Kadrokan beef and leather are traded eastward over the mountains.

**Mountain Trade**: With coastal access denied, virtually all external trade flows through the Ramakemizi passes to Dalizi and Chechol. This makes the eastern cities disproportionately wealthy and important.

**Dragon Taxes**: Melekas demands substantial tribute, siphoning significant wealth to maintain the apparatus of draconic rule. The dragon claims this is protection money, and given the alternative, few argue.

### Military

Kadrokan military forces are primarily defensive, organized to repel Tytheri raids rather than project power beyond the borders.

**The Stillwatch**: Elite soldiers who guard Ponoigari and the dragon directly. Fanatically loyal, well-equipped, and trained to coordinate with the dragon's fire in urban defense.

**Border Patrols**: Light cavalry and infantry that screen the southwestern frontier. They cannot prevent all raids but provide early warning and pursue retreating orc bands.

**Naga Units**: Specialized forces leveraging naga abilities. Particularly effective in the Bloodswamp region, where their affinity for water and swamp terrain provides advantages.

### The Tytheri Threat

Kadroka exists in a state of constant low-intensity warfare with Tythikerys. The blood orcs raid regularly—taking slaves, cattle, and supplies back to their territory. Kadrokan forces can defend major settlements and pursue raiders, but cannot eliminate the threat at its source.

The dynamic is simple: Melekas cannot fly, so Melekas cannot burn the orcs from the sky. Kadrokan ground forces struggle in the rough terrain of Tythikerys and dare not approach the Agony Stones that sustain the orc's Ichor addiction. The orcs know this and grow bolder each generation.

Melekas schemes constantly for a way to break this impasse. The dragon would pay almost any price for a solution—and adventurers willing to investigate the Agony Stones, disrupt Tytheri Ichor harvesting, or find some other lever against the orcs would find a powerful patron in the Stillbound.

### External Relations

**Dalizi Confederation** (East): Kadroka's primary trading partner and diplomatic contact. Dalizi merchants are common in Sukinada, and the confederation provides an economic lifeline that prevents Kadrokan isolation.

**Chechol** (Northeast): Closer than Dalizi proper, Chechol serves as an intermediary for some trade and communication. Relations are cordial but not close.

**Phaerhom** (North): The fairy enclave in the Morygun Mountains is officially neutral toward Kadroka. Unofficially, the fae find the situation amusing—a dragon trapped in stone, harassed by orcs—and have shown no interest in helping.

**Tythikerys** (Southwest): Open hostility. No diplomatic contact. The orcs raid; Kadroka defends; the cycle continues.

### Adventure Hooks

- **The Dragon's Offer**: Melekas seeks agents willing to investigate the Agony Stones—specifically, to find a cure for the stillbinding. The reward would be substantial. The risk is becoming part of the Dying One.

- **Ichor Disruption**: Can the Tytheri's addiction be weaponized against them? Someone who could poison or redirect the Ichor supply might break the orc threat permanently. Or create something worse.

- **Mountain Politics**: The eastern cities grow wealthy while the frontier bleeds. Some in Sukinada whisper about independence, or at least reduced obligations to a capital that cannot protect them.

- **Naga Intrigue**: Human resentment of naga influence creates opportunities for those willing to play factional politics under the dragon's watchful eye.

## Kazül

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Oznak, Glorindian (Humans)

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Tradition, religion, wealth, night/day

- Kazül is ruled by **King Salomor**, who wears a legendary ring granting him the power to summon extremely powerful creatures to do his bidding. The ring is well known—it's why no one challenges him.
- Society is divided into three castes: laborers, merchants, and nobility. Only nobility can own land. Only merchants and nobility can make or procure loans.
- When you marry, your children inherit the **lower** caste of their two parents. This ensures downward mobility and keeps the lower castes growing while the nobility remains exclusive.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Glass, stained glass, various minerals

**Primary Imports**: Metal, textiles

- Kazül is the **largest producer of glass in Alaria**. The glass artists of Kazül are world-renowned, and Kazüli stained glass decorates temples and palaces across the continent.
- The desert sands provide perfect raw materials for glassmaking. The secret techniques are jealously guarded by guild families.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Very Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (lower castes)

- Kazül lacks violent neighbors, and the desert is not an appetizing prize for would-be attackers.
- Lower castes are required to serve two years in the military. Merchant castes may volunteer and enter as officers. Nobility don't serve.
- The real military power is Salomor's ring—why maintain an army when the king can summon monsters?

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Middle Sea coast, south of Glorin, south/southwest of Zintacas, bordering the Jahazai Desert

**Biomes**: Coastal settlements, river valleys, vast interior desert

**Climate**: Arid—hot days, cool nights, rain only along the coast and river

**Named Features**: Jahazai Desert (interior), Gulf of Kazül (west coast), Peecked Hills (west), Okesha's Passage (southeastern waterway)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Urzahd (northwest, on the river)

**Cities**: Urzahd, Sigiel, Duhkmayas

**Towns**: Shohas, Malki, Bhutag, Boxwatch, Dygalva, Seneka

### The River Settlements

A river flows from Glorin in the north down through Kazül, and most settlements cluster along it. The river is life—without it, the interior would be uninhabitable. Kazüli settlements stretch up the river almost to Glorin's border.

### The Jahazai Desert

The vast interior desert that makes up most of Kazül's territory. Harsh, beautiful, and full of buried secrets. Ancient ruins lie beneath the sands—remnants of civilizations that flourished before the desert claimed the land. Treasure hunters and archaeologists venture into the Jahazai, though many never return.

### The Towers of Ederhi

Deep in the Jahazai Desert stand the Towers of Ederhi—ancient spires of fused glass rising from the sand. No one knows who built them or why. The glass is unlike anything Kazüli artisans can produce—harder, clearer, and faintly luminescent at night.

Some believe the towers are tombs. Others think they're beacons, waiting for someone to activate them. Expeditions have explored the exterior but found no entrance. The towers remain a mystery—and a reminder that the desert holds secrets older than Kazül itself.

### Bhutag

A town in the eastern desert, near the coast. Bhutag sits atop a vast underground complex—catacombs that predate the current settlement by millennia. The locals avoid the deeper tunnels, which are said to be haunted. Occasionally, artifacts emerge from the depths, sold quietly to collectors who don't ask questions.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Caste System**

The brutal downward-mobility rule ensures resentment festers in the lower castes. Laborers have no path upward, and mixed-caste marriages doom children to the bottom. Unrest simmers, though Salomor's ring keeps open rebellion unthinkable.

**Desert Secrets**

The Jahazai holds treasures and dangers. Expeditions into the deep desert sometimes disturb things better left buried. Not every ruin is empty.

### History

Kazül grew along the river, sustained by water in a land of sand. The desert was always there, full of ruins from older times—civilizations swallowed by the advancing sands.

King Salomor's dynasty has ruled for generations, their power secured by the summoning ring. Where the ring came from is a matter of legend—some say it was found in the Jahazai ruins, others that it was a gift from a dying god. Salomor isn't telling.

The glass trade made Kazül wealthy. The caste system keeps that wealth concentrated. The desert keeps enemies away. It's a stable arrangement—for those at the top.

## Keletus

Tags: state, alrock ocean, democracy, minotaur

An island democracy of Lorean minotaurs renowned for producing the finest naval officers in the world. Keletus occupies Apketrii, a mountainous island in the Alrock Ocean, where sailing isn't just livelihood—it's identity. The nation's fortunes swing wildly with each decade's elected king, some bringing unprecedented prosperity, others steering toward disaster.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Elective Monarchy (Democratic)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Lorean minotaur

**Population**: 60,000

**Stability**: Somewhat stable

**Core Values**: Might, cunning, sailing skill

**The Kingship**: Every decade, Keletus elects a new king by popular vote. There are no formal restrictions on candidacy—any adult minotaur may declare. The winner rules for exactly ten years, no extensions, no exceptions. This apparent egalitarianism masks a deeper truth: only those who've proven themselves at sea have any real chance of winning.

**The Captains' Consensus**: Before any election, senior ship captains meet informally to discuss candidates. There's no official vote, no binding outcome. But when the Consensus settles on someone, that candidate suddenly finds their campaign fully funded, their rallies packed, their name on every sailor's lips. Defying the Consensus isn't illegal—it's just politically suicidal.

**The Countinghouses**: Five great merchant-banking families—the Thornwakes, the Bronzehorns, the Saltmanes, the Deepkeel, and the Gallowglass—control who gets to compete. Campaigning is ruinously expensive. Without Countinghouse backing, you can't hire criers, can't throw feasts, can't outfit the ceremonial ships that prove you're serious. The Countinghouses don't pick kings; they pick which candidates get to run.

**The Old Bulls**: Former kings don't disappear after their terms. They become the Old Bulls—an informal council with no official power but enormous influence. They advise current kings, broker deals between factions, and occasionally arrange things when a king becomes dangerous. Three kings in Keletan history have drowned in suspicious sailing accidents. All three had threatened Countinghouse interests.

**Why Kings Fail**: The wild swings in prosperity follow a pattern. *Captains' Kings*—those with real sailing records—succeed. They understand the sea, the trade routes, the navy. They negotiate well because they've met foreign powers at sea. *Countinghouse Kings*—candidates with money and charisma but no nautical credentials—fail catastrophically. The Countinghouses occasionally install one when they want someone controllable, accepting the economic damage as the cost of maintaining influence.

### The Lorean Difference

Lorean minotaurs aren't like their landlocked cousins. Generations on Apketrii rewired something fundamental: the labyrinthine instinct turned outward. Where other minotaurs feel the pull of enclosed spaces and winding corridors, Loreans feel the sea's currents like a three-dimensional maze. They sense pressure changes, can dead-reckon through fog, and experience genuine discomfort on land for too long—a low-grade wrongness, like clothes that don't fit.

This makes them uncanny navigators. A Keletan helmsman doesn't read the water—they *feel* it, the way you feel which direction is down. Other nations pay fortunes to poach retired Keletan captains.

Young minotaurs who can't develop this sea-sense are pitied. Some leave for the mainland. Some stay and become farmers, craftsmen, merchants—respected, but never leaders. A minotaur who hasn't proven themselves at sea will never be king.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Farseeing lenses, wine, sea products, naval expertise

**Primary Imports**: Wood, ships, grain

**The Shapers' Guild**: The Diamondback Mountains produce seaglass quartz—a crystalline mineral essential for crafting farseeing lenses, the enchanted spyglasses that give Keletan ships their legendary ability to spot threats at impossible distances. The Shapers' Guild controls this trade absolutely. They're older than the kingship itself, a closed guild guarding both the mining sites and lens-crafting techniques. Kings come and go, but the Shapers endure. A good king keeps them happy. A bad king tries to break their monopoly and ends up blind—sometimes literally, when their personal farseeing lens mysteriously cracks.

**Keletan Wine**: Blossom Valley produces wine famous across the Middle Sea—not for subtlety, but for strength. It travels well, keeps sailors healthy, and gets you drunk enough to forget you're six weeks from home.

**The Naval Trade**: Keletus doesn't just produce officers—it rents them. Foreign navies pay handsomely for Keletan navigators, harbor pilots, and tactical advisors. This "officer trade" is controversial; some see it as selling Keletan blood for foreign gold, others as spreading Keletan influence across every fleet that matters.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Exceptional

**Enrollment**: Mandatory service, selective advancement

Keletus maintains a small standing army of moderate skill, but their navy is legendary. Every minotaur serves two years at sea during youth; the talented are recruited into the officer corps. Keletan naval officers are considered the finest in the world—not because of superior ships or numbers, but because they *understand* the sea in ways other races cannot match.

**The Tidemasters**: Elite navigators who've proven they can sail through anything. During the worst storms, when other ships make for harbor, Tidemasters take their vessels into the teeth of it—and come out the other side. They're part navigator, part weather-reader, part sea-mystic. Foreign admirals have standing offers for any Tidemaster willing to defect. None have.

### Geography

**Location**: Apketrii Island, Alrock Ocean

**Biomes**: Mountainous interior, coastal lowlands, fertile southern valley

**Named Entities**: Diamondback Mountains (central spine), Hallenfell (northwestern mountains), Blossom Valley (southern agricultural region), the Long Reach (southeastern peninsula)

**Adjacent Waters**: Alrock Ocean

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Zenbryos

**Cities**: Lelakai (eastern port), Theolla (northwestern harbor)

**Towns**: Euphemia, Kallias, Menelos

**Villages**: Mendas, Isokaros, Niklandrus, Lagdike

**Zenbryos**: The capital wraps around a natural deepwater harbor shaped like a curled horn. The Kingstone stands at the harbor's mouth—a massive natural pillar where new kings are crowned at dawn, with the whole fleet anchored in witness. The Tidemoot Hall hosts elections in a roofless amphitheater, sea wind always present. The Countinghouses maintain their headquarters here, funding campaigns and quietly deciding which candidates get resources to compete.

**Blossom Valley**: The agricultural south, below the Diamondbacks. Lorean minotaurs here have weaker sea-pull; many have never sailed beyond sight of land. They vote—their wine money matters—but a Valley candidate for king is a joke. This has bred quiet separatist sentiment. The Valley feeds the island and funds the fleets, yet will never rule.

**The Long Reach**: The southeastern peninsula stretching toward Ve—Kallias, Menelos, Niklandrus, and Lagdike at the tip. These are watcher-towns: lighthouse chains, signal towers, the Lamplighter Corps. The people here are isolated, superstitious, more aware of what moves in deep water. Lagdike overlooks sea lanes and serves as a fortress-town, though no one's attacked in centuries.

**Hallenfell**: The northwestern mountains hold something older than the minotaurs. Black stone structures emerge from cliff faces—halls carved into the mountains, then partially collapsed when sea levels rose millennia ago. The builders, called the Kelemyr ("those before"), left artifacts of impossible clockwork and tablets in unknown languages. Some halls flood at high tide. What comes out during storm season isn't alive, and nearby villages maintain ancient wards. The Countinghouses would pay enormously for Kelemyr artifacts, but expeditions rarely return.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Courtship Problem**: Both Vetral (triton theocracy) and Bfaspeik (Bfaspeen broods) would benefit from Keletan naval support in their ongoing war. Vetral wants Keletan ships to enforce their "Old Lanes" system. The Bfaspeen brood mothers, cunning enough to negotiate, offer to leave Keletan-flagged ships alone in exchange for tacit permission to raid rivals. King Varrosh refuses both, determined to maintain independence—but neutrality has costs.

**The Sovereignty Insult**: Vetral claims ancient sovereignty over the entire Alrock Ocean. Recently they've expanded enforcement of this claim, sending formal notices to distant nations demanding vessel registration and adherence to approved routes. Varrosh sent their messenger back with a pointed refusal. It's not war, not even close—but the tritons won't forget who refused them when they eventually resolve their conflict with Bfaspeik.

**The Eastern Routes**: Trade with Ve (Sestros, Avalon) is Keletus's growth market, but those routes pass closer to the Vetral-Bfaspeik conflict zone. Ships have been lost. Insurance rates climb. The Countinghouses are split: some want to ally with Vetral for protection, others want to maintain profitable neutrality.

**Valley Separatism**: Blossom Valley lords have started quietly meeting with Vetral's surface agents, exploring whether they could cut a separate trade deal. If Varrosh discovered this, it would be treason. But Varrosh doesn't spend much time thinking about farmers.

**The Current King**: Varrosh Gallowglass was a Captains' King—legendary navigator, veteran of forty years at sea, winner of the Twice-Around race. He should have been a great king. Instead, his stubborn refusal to bend on foreign policy is costing Keletus money and making enemies. The Countinghouses grow restless. The Old Bulls whisper. Seven years remain in his term.

### History

The Lorean minotaurs arrived on Apketrii in an age before reliable records, fleeing something on the mainland they no longer remember. The island shaped them over generations—the sea-sense developing slowly, the labyrinthine instinct turning outward. By the time other nations noticed Keletus, the transformation was complete.

The democratic system emerged from necessity: early kings who ruled for life produced dynasties that weakened with each generation. The ten-year limit was a compromise between those who wanted perpetual elections and those who wanted stability. The compromise has held for three centuries.

The Shapers' Guild predates the current government. Some scholars believe they were here before the minotaurs—perhaps connected to the Kelemyr, perhaps not. The Guild neither confirms nor denies.

### Player Hooks

- **The Hallenfell Expedition**: A Countinghouse is funding another delve into the drowned halls. They need expendable outsiders. The pay is extraordinary. The survival rate is not.

- **The Varrosh Problem**: Various factions want the current king removed, replaced, or supported. The Old Bulls are watching. The Countinghouses are scheming. Someone's going to make a move before his term ends.

- **The Valley Question**: Separatist meetings are happening. Vetral agents are involved. This could be treason or diplomacy depending on who wins. Players could expose it, join it, or play both sides.

- **The Officer Trade**: A foreign power wants a Tidemaster. They'll pay anything. Finding one willing to defect—or kidnapping one who isn't—could make players rich or hunted.

- **Bfaspeik Negotiations**: A brood mother wants to talk. She needs surface intermediaries. The pay is in centuries of sunken treasure. The catch is surviving the meeting.

## Kendrel Kingdoms

## Kerwin

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Immortal monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Halflings

**Population**: 45,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Contentment, tradition, pastoral simplicity, quiet endurance

- Kerwin is ruled by **Ulyas the Immortal**, a halfling who has sat the throne for 898 years. He is, by any reasonable definition, a lich—though he maintains a living appearance and his subjects prefer not to think too hard about what sustains him.
- The halflings of Kerwin are agrarian and pastoral. They farm, they herd, they craft modest goods. They have no great ambitions. They want to live peaceful lives, raise families, and die in the same villages where they were born.
- Ulyas is, by all accounts, a good king. He settles disputes fairly, keeps taxes low, maintains roads, and asks little of his people. In return, they don't ask questions about his yearly journey to the Fireknife Mountains.
- Kerwin is nominally part of the Tarkhon Empire, but this is a polite fiction. Ulyas agreed to fealty five centuries ago when Tarkhon expanded, but he has outlived every emperor since. He pays modest tribute, allows Tarkhon merchants to operate freely, and in exchange, Tarkhon pretends they conquered him.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Simple

**Primary Exports**: Grain, wool, copper, modest crafts

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, luxury items, wine

- Kerwin's economy is subsistence-plus. The halflings grow more than they need, so they trade the surplus for things they can't make themselves.
- The **Copper Hills** provide modest mining income—enough to trade for iron and steel, which Kerwin cannot produce.
- Kerwin merchants are pleasant but unambitious. They want fair deals, not fortunes.
- Tarkhon traders pass through regularly, taking advantage of Kerwin's position on overland routes, but the halflings themselves rarely travel far.

### Military

**Size**: Tiny

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Volunteer militia

- Kerwin has no standing army. Villages maintain small militias for bandit problems and wild animal attacks.
- Ulyas himself is the kingdom's true defense. Whatever dark power sustains him has made him extraordinarily dangerous when roused. In 898 years, three armies have invaded Kerwin. None succeeded.
- The halflings don't like to talk about what happened to those armies.

### Geography

**Location**: Northeastern Tarkhon, north of Nektuna and east of Enymu

**Biomes**: Rolling farmland, arid grassland, copper-rich hills, volcanic mountains

**Climate**: Semi-arid continental—hot summers, cold winters, modest rainfall

**Named Features**: Fireknife Mountains (northwest border), Copper Hills (west-central), Da Sharma (southern region)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tarkha

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: Sharmatenu, Hebbythus, Nehemiter, Hebmu, Clynisi, Ankbalen, Dlesy, Cuntzam, Kastorbekt, Akhzubdet, Chykum

### Tarkha

The capital of Kerwin—an ancient city that predates Tarkhon itself.

Tarkha is a quiet city now, its grand avenues too wide for its current population, its ceremonial plazas hosting weekly markets instead of the festivals they were built for. The old palace still stands, and Ulyas rules from it, but much of the building is closed off, dusty halls echoing with centuries of silence.

The halflings built Tarkha for their own purposes: wide avenues for their festivals, great plazas for their markets, a palace for a king who expected to rule forever. The scale sometimes surprises visitors who expect halflings to build small. Tarkha is comfortable, if oversized.

Visitors from Nektuna find the scale disorienting—everything built for importance, inhabited by people who don't care about importance at all. The halflings offer them tea and wonder what the fuss is about.

### The Fireknife Mountains

The volcanic range along Kerwin's northwestern border. Unstable, dangerous, and largely avoided. Smoke rises from vents, hot springs bubble in unexpected places, and the peaks occasionally glow red at night.

Every year, King Ulyas travels into the Fireknife Mountains. He takes a small retinue and a larger group of "volunteers"—criminals, prisoners, and occasionally people who simply weren't missed. He returns alone.

The halflings don't ask what happens in those mountains. They've learned not to.

### The Copper Hills

Low, scrubby hills west of Tarkha, rich with copper ore. The town of **Chykum** serves as the mining center—halflings and a smattering of dwarven advisors extract enough copper to meet Kerwin's modest needs and trade the surplus.

The hills are dotted with ancient mine shafts, some predating halfling settlement. What the original miners were looking for—and whether they found it—is unclear.

### Da Sharma

The southern region of Kerwin, where the land grows drier and the farms give way to sheep pastures. Da Sharma halflings are considered rustic even by Kerwin standards—insular, traditional, and deeply superstitious about the old ways.

They maintain shrines to spirits that predate Tarkhon, Kerwin, and perhaps the halflings themselves.

### Ulyas the Immortal

Ulyas has ruled Kerwin for 898 years. He appears as an elderly halfling, weathered but hale, with bright eyes and a gentle manner. He settles disputes, blesses weddings, and remembers every citizen's grandparents.

He is almost certainly a lich.

Ulyas does not rot, does not wither, does not age. Whatever sustains him requires yearly renewal—a journey to a forgotten shrine in the Fireknife Mountains, where something ancient and hungry waits. The price is blood. Ulyas has paid it for nearly nine centuries.

He tells himself it's justified. The people he sacrifices are criminals, enemies, the forgotten. He's a good king. His people are happy. Surely that's worth a few dozen lives a year?

The math has grown uncomfortable over the centuries. Ulyas tries not to add it up.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Weight of Centuries**

Ulyas is tired. Nine hundred years is a long time to rule, a long time to make the same compromises, a long time to watch everyone he loves die while he continues. He's considered stopping—letting the yearly sacrifice lapse, letting himself finally rest. But who would rule Kerwin then? His people need him. Don't they?

**Tarkhon's Shadow**

Kerwin's nominal allegiance to Tarkhon is stable but hollow. Ulyas has outlived every attempt to integrate Kerwin more fully into the empire. But King Selron II is ambitious, and some in Nektuna whisper that it's time to remind Kerwin who's really in charge. Ulyas has heard these whispers before. He's buried everyone who acted on them.

**The Neferati Memory**

Ulyas remembers the Neferati founders—the fire-blooded conquerors who built Tarkhetan and expanded their empire to swallow Kerwin. He remembers their emperors, their court intrigues, their slow dilution into humanity. He watched the Severance from a careful distance, keeping Kerwin neutral while both sides burned. Now humans hold the throne, and they've forgotten most of what Ulyas remembers. He hasn't told them. He hasn't decided if he ever will.

### History

Kerwin was settled by halflings long before Tarkhon existed as an empire. They farmed, they traded, they lived modest lives. Ulyas became king through means he no longer discusses, and he has ruled ever since—nearly nine centuries now.

When the Neferati came north and built Tarkhetan, Ulyas watched. When they expanded their empire five centuries ago, he negotiated rather than fought. He recognized the empire's strength but also its limits—Tarkhon wanted the strait, not the hinterlands. Ulyas offered fealty, tribute, and open roads. In exchange, Tarkhon left Kerwin alone.

The arrangement has held through the Neferati dynasty, the Severance, and three centuries of human rule. Ulyas has outlived every emperor and every king. He's seen the empire's character change but its demands stay the same. He pays his tribute, tends his people, and makes his yearly journey to the mountains.

Kerwin endures. Ulyas endures. The shrine in the mountains waits for its yearly offering. Nothing changes, and perhaps nothing ever will.

## Kingdoms of Fire

Tags: alliance, state

### Overview

The Kingdoms of Fire are four Neferati monarchies—Yaif, Kabir, Gissemari, and Wadiyah—that occupy a peninsula in southwestern Tarkhon. Though each kingdom is independent with its own ruler, they act as a political bloc, coordinating foreign policy and presenting a united front to the wider empire.

This alliance isn't merely convenient—it's existential. The Neferati founded Tarkhon six centuries ago. They lit the Evertorch. They established the institutions that made the empire possible. And three centuries ago, they were pushed aside when the human faction won the Severance.

The Kingdoms of Fire remember. They consider themselves founders in exile, not tributaries. The Evertorch burns with Neferati fire. Tarkhon was built on Neferati foundations. The humans may have forgotten this, but the Neferati have not.

### The Four Eternal Flames

Each kingdom is built around an **Eternal Flame**—a fire that has burned since the world's creation, sustained by magic older than civilization. These flames are the heart of Neferati spirituality, the source of their fire magic, and the model for the Evertorch that burns in Tarkhetan.

- **The Flame of Yaif**: The oldest and largest, burning in the Temple of First Fire. Said to be the flame from which all others were kindled.
- **The Flame of Kabir**: Burns in a lighthouse that has guided ships since before human memory. Its light never wavers.
- **The Flame of Gissemari**: Burns in a great forge where master craftsmen create works of legendary beauty.
- **The Flame of Wadiyah**: Burns in a pit so deep that none have seen its bottom. The oldest priests say it connects to the world's molten heart.

The Evertorch in Tarkhetan was lit from these flames—specifically from the Flame of Yaif, carried north by the Neferati conquerors who founded the empire. This is why the Kingdoms of Fire consider the Evertorch theirs by right of heritage.

### The Neferati People

The Neferati are children of fire—born when primordial flame danced with divine essence. Their distinctive red skin seems to flicker with inner fire in certain lights. Curling ram horns crown their heads, their eyes are dark as coals, and their hair is black as charcoal.

Fire is not merely an element to the Neferati—it is life itself. They gather regularly for sacred fire ceremonies, basking in heat that would kill other races. Fire dancing blurs the boundary between dancer and flame. They approach everything with burning intensity: loving fiercely, exploring fearlessly, experimenting boldly.

The Neferati don't sleep as other races do. Instead, they must spend four hours each night near fire—at least a campfire's worth. This requirement shapes their architecture, their culture, and their sense of community. Every Neferati home has a hearth. Every Neferati gathering has flames.

### The Council of Four Flames

The four monarchs meet regularly at the **Council of Four Flames**, rotating between kingdoms. Here they coordinate policy, resolve disputes, and decide how to present their collective interests to Tarkhon.

The council has no formal leader—decisions require consensus among all four monarchs. This makes the bloc slow to act but nearly impossible to divide. Nektuna has tried to buy off individual kingdoms; all attempts have failed. The Neferati remember what happens when they're not united.

Current monarchs:
- **Queen Seraphel of Yaif**: The eldest, most respected, and most patient. She remembers the old ways.
- **King Rashaan of Kabir**: The wealthiest, most pragmatic, and most willing to deal with Tarkhon. Some call him accommodating; he calls it strategic.
- **Prince-Consort Vhelan of Gissemari**: Rules as regent for his young daughter. An artist-king who values beauty over politics.
- **Queen Khalira of Wadiyah**: The youngest monarch, the most radical, and the most eager to challenge Tarkhon. She believes the time for patience is ending.

### The Founding Legacy

Six centuries ago, Neferati warlords from Yaif recognized that the Tarkhon Strait could be controlled—and that whoever controlled it would control trade across half the world.

They brought fire north. They lit the Evertorch. They built Tarkhetan and established the empire. For nearly three centuries, Neferati blood sat on the throne. The Firemage Corps was created by Neferati founders. The traditions that still govern Tarkhon were written in Neferati hands.

Then came the dilution—generations of marriage to local humans, the slow fading of fire in the imperial bloodline. By the end, the "Neferati" emperors were mostly human.

The **Severance** came when the last fire-blooded emperor died without legitimate heir. His children by his Neferati mistress were passed over for his fully human nephew. The Neferati faction resisted. They lost.

The pure Neferati withdrew to the Kingdoms of Fire. The Evertorch stayed in Tarkhetan—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish. The humans took the throne and slowly forgot who had built it for them.

### Why They Stay

The Kingdoms of Fire could leave Tarkhon. They have the military strength to resist reconquest—four kingdoms of firemages in defensible terrain would be nearly impossible to subdue. So why do they remain?

**Trade**: The strait makes everyone rich, including the Neferati. Leaving would mean losing preferential access to the greatest trade route in the world.

**Heritage**: This is the harder truth. The Neferati don't want to leave Tarkhon—they want to *reclaim* it. Walking away would mean admitting that the humans won, that the Severance was final, that the Evertorch belongs to Tarkhetan now.

**Patience**: The Neferati live fast but think long. Three centuries seems like a long time to humans. To a culture built around eternal flames, it's a temporary setback. They're waiting for the right moment.

**Division**: Not all Neferati agree on strategy. King Rashaan thinks accommodation is wise. Queen Khalira thinks it's cowardice. Until they reach consensus, dramatic action is impossible.

### Why They Might Leave

Several scenarios could push the Kingdoms of Fire out of Tarkhon:

**The Evertorch Claim**: If the Neferati formally asserted their right to the Evertorch—demanding its return or acknowledgment of their heritage—and Tarkhon refused, it could trigger a break.

**Imperial Overreach**: If Nektuna tried to impose direct control, extract excessive tribute, or station troops in the kingdoms, the bloc would resist.

**A Restoration Opportunity**: If a succession crisis, military defeat, or other disaster weakened Tarkhon enough, the Neferati might see their chance to restore fire-blooded rule.

**A Better Offer**: If someone offered the kingdoms a superior arrangement—perhaps a rival trade route, or alliance against Tarkhon—they might take it.

### Relations with Tarkhon

The relationship is stable but not warm. The Kingdoms of Fire pay their tribute, maintain trade agreements, and participate in imperial councils. In return, they receive preferential trade terms and effective autonomy.

But there's always an edge. The Neferati ambassadors in Tarkhetan are too numerous, too well-informed, too interested in the Evertorch's flame. High Priestess Salenne has noticed them studying the torch, measuring its light, taking notes.

King Selron II knows the Kingdoms of Fire are dangerous. He treats them carefully, grants them respect, and never pushes too hard. His greatest fear is that they'll remember their claim—and act on it.

### The Individual Kingdoms

**Yaif** — The westernmost and most traditional. Home to the Flame of First Fire and the oldest Neferati temples. Queen Seraphel rules with ancient wisdom.

**Kabir** — Northeastern, facing the Sea of Merchants. The wealthiest kingdom, built on trade. King Rashaan balances profit and pride.

**Gissemari** — South of Kabir. The artistic heart of Neferati culture. Prince-Consort Vhelan rules as regent for his young daughter, Queen Ishari.

**Wadiyah** — The southernmost and most isolated. Home to the deepest flame and the most radical politics. Queen Khalira believes the time for patience has ended.

### What Will Happen

The Kingdoms of Fire are waiting. They've been waiting for three centuries. But the current generation of rulers is more divided than any before:

- Seraphel councils patience.
- Rashaan wants to maintain profitable stability.
- Vhelan doesn't care about politics—he wants to make beautiful things.
- Khalira wants to burn Tarkhetan and take back what's theirs.

The consensus that has held the bloc together is fraying. If the four monarchs can't agree on a path forward, individual kingdoms might start acting alone.

And if one kingdom breaks from the bloc—either toward accommodation or toward confrontation—the careful balance that has kept the Kingdoms of Fire stable for three centuries will shatter.

Something is going to change. The only questions are when, and how much fire will be involved.

## Klevnaf

Tags: state, winter-elf, istori, crimson-coast

The western remnant of the unified Winter Elf kingdom, Klevnaf claims legitimacy through Prince Taoinor—uncle to the murdered King Istor XXVI. They control Murder Creek and the sacred Whitewood, drawing authority from possession of the ancestral heartland. Their enemies call them usurpers and murderers; they call themselves the true continuation of the elven realm.

### Overview

Klevnaf occupies the central coastal strip of the Crimson Coast, wedged between Tangiern to the west and the contested Suftos Hills to the east. The realm follows Murder Creek from its highland sources to the sea—cursed water defining cursed kingdom. The sacred Whitewood provides spiritual legitimacy; the curse provides... something else.

Capital: **Svedlind** (~2,500 population)

### Government

**Prince Taoinor** rules Klevnaf—though "prince" is a pointed choice, not "king." He has never claimed the royal title, insisting that he rules as regent for a unified kingdom that will someday be restored. His supporters call this humility; his opponents call it cowardice; the practical truth is that claiming kingship would close the door to reconciliation.

Taoinor is old even by elven standards—ancient, weary, and possibly relieved that the succession crisis gives him something to do besides wait for death. His court is divided between hawks (push east, crush Istora, reunify by force), doves (negotiate settlement, accept partition), and traditionalists (focus on maintaining proper customs regardless of outcome).

Taoinor vacillates between factions, making decisions slowly and often reversing them. This frustrates everyone but may be intentional—a leader who commits to nothing can't be blamed for failure, and delay benefits the side that can't win quickly.

### Culture

Klevnaf represents traditional Winter Elf society—or claims to. They venerate the old ways: sacred forests where ancestors speak, ceremonies performed exactly as they've always been performed, rigid hierarchies that have governed elven life for millennia. The Whitewood is the physical manifestation of these values.

The curse of Murder Creek has been absorbed into this traditionalism rather than rejected. The visions are painful—those who drink from the creek experience King Ghy's ancient assassination as if they were present—but pain is reframed as sacred connection. Some warriors deliberately drink before battle, seeking the dead king's guidance through hallucination. This practice horrifies outsiders and increasingly concerns Klevnaf's own healers.

Foxes and snowy owls serve as companions, a tradition shared with Istora. The animals don't understand the civil war and will still carry messages to elves on either side if their masters aren't watching carefully. This has led to unofficial communications that both courts pretend don't exist.

**Theological conservatism** defines Klevnaf's religious life. They reject Istora's innovations—a queen leading rites, sustainable logging in sacred forests, the idea that tradition can be adapted. These aren't merely disagreements; they're fundamental challenges to cosmic order. The gods established proper forms; deviating from them invites disaster.

### Economy

Klevnaf's economy is strangled. The kingdom traditionally relied on trade with what's now Istora, tribute from Tangiern (now suspended), and prestige goods that require peace to produce. What remains is subsistence fishing, limited agriculture, and whatever can be salvaged from border skirmishes.

The Whitewood could solve everything. Its silver-barked trees are valuable beyond measure—lumber, furniture, magical components. But Taoinor has forbidden any logging in the sacred forest. Soldiers whose equipment is wearing out, families who can't afford food—they watch priceless trees stand untouched while the kingdom slowly starves. Resentment builds.

### Military

Klevnaf fields perhaps 800 trained soldiers—fewer than Istora, with worse equipment and shakier supply. Their strength lies in terrain: Murder Creek provides natural defense, the Whitewood offers endless ambush opportunities, and the curse itself might deter invaders who fear drinking the wrong water.

Their weakness is everything else. Equipment wears out and can't be replaced. Young elves who should be training are farming or fishing instead. The hawks want offensive action, but attacking across the Suftos Hills would be suicide with current resources.

**The Oath-Bound** are elite warriors who have drunk from Murder Creek deliberately, binding themselves to King Ghy's memory through shared vision. They're fearsome—the visions seem to grant insights in combat—but also increasingly unstable. Prolonged exposure to the curse damages minds in ways that are becoming impossible to ignore.

### Relations

**With Istora**: War. Skirmishes along the Suftos line are constant; assassination attempts flow in both directions; neither side can achieve decisive advantage. The conflict has become self-sustaining—too many dead for either side to accept peace without victory.

**With Tangiern**: Careful outreach. Taoinor has approached King Halvard about alliance—Tangier support for Klevnaf in exchange for reduced tribute when victory comes. Halvard hasn't committed. He probably never will; Tangier benefits from elven division and has no reason to end it.

**With other powers**: Minimal. The Crimson Coast is isolated behind the Dragon's Spine, and nobody outside cares enough about the civil war to intervene.

### History

Murder Creek's name dates back over a thousand years, to the assassination of King Ghy the Elder—the last monarch of a previous unified realm. The circumstances of Ghy's death are lost to time, but the curse that resulted is very much present. The creek remembers.

When Istor XXVI died under similar circumstances, the parallels were impossible to ignore. Lamenrae accused Taoinor; Taoinor denied it; the kingdom split along lines that had existed since Ghy's time. Western territories that had always chafed under eastern dominance chose Taoinor; eastern territories rallied to Lamenrae. The division was geographic, political, and theological simultaneously.

**Did Taoinor kill his nephew?** The evidence is circumstantial. Servants saw him near the king's chambers; a cupbearer noticed something strange about the wine; Taoinor benefited from the death. But witnesses can be bought, memories can be mistaken, and benefiting from a death doesn't prove causing it. Taoinor insists he's innocent. Maybe he is. Maybe Lamenrae accused him to seize power. Maybe someone else killed Istor XXVI and let the obvious suspect take the blame. The truth may never be established.

### What Outsiders Notice

- The dark water of Murder Creek, visible from everywhere in Svedlind
- The careful way locals avoid drinking from obvious sources
- Architecture that's elegant but poorly maintained—repairs deferred, decorations faded
- The silver gleam of Whitewood visible on the southern horizon
- References to "the pretender queen" delivered with weary contempt

### Adventure Hooks

- Taoinor wants to know the truth about Istor XXVI's death—someone to investigate without political agenda
- The Oath-Bound are becoming dangerous; find out what the curse is doing to them and whether it can be stopped
- A faction wants to log the Whitewood to fund the war; they need outsiders to do it without Taoinor's knowledge
- Something in the depths of Murder Creek has begun calling to those who drink its water

## Knova

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Institutional meritocracy (the Academy IS the state)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Mixed (students and faculty from across Alaria), Triton (defensive forces)

**Population**: ~6,000 permanent (fluctuates to ~10,000 during peak enrollment)

**Stability**: Extremely stable (clear hierarchy, absolute authority)

**Core Values**: Martial excellence, earned rank, the purity of combat

Knova isn't a nation that happens to contain a famous academy—it's an academy that happens to be a nation. The Iron Academy governs absolutely. The Commandant speaks with the authority of a king. Students and faculty form the population. There are no citizens, only practitioners.

The hierarchy is brutally simple: your rank depends on your combat record. Win fights, rise. Lose, fall. The Commandant holds their position because no one has defeated them—and many have tried. The current Commandant, **Irontide Vesk**, earned his title by killing a deep-sea serpent in single combat. The beast's skull still adorns the central courtyard.

Triton warriors patrol the surrounding waters under an ancient compact. They defend Knova's shores; in exchange, their warriors receive free training at any of the three schools. This has made Knova's triton alumni some of the most dangerous fighters in the undersea kingdoms—and ensures no naval force can approach the islands without a fight.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (but wealthy)

**Tech**: Advanced metallurgy, standard otherwise

**Primary Exports**: Trained warriors, tactical consultation, refined metals, weapons

**Primary Imports**: Food (almost everything), luxury goods, raw materials, students

Knova's economy runs on tuition and iron.

The islands are phenomenally metal-rich—iron, copper, tin, and traces of rarer ores. The forges run constantly, producing weapons and armor of exceptional quality. But the real product is people. A graduate of the Iron Academy commands premium wages anywhere in Alaria. A recommendation from Blackwater can make a general's career. Seatower alumni lead mercenary companies across the continent.

Tuition is steep. Noble families pay fortunes to train their heirs. Mercenary companies sponsor promising recruits as investments. Some students earn their way through arena victories—Knova's training matches draw betting crowds from across the Western Isles.

Food is the weakness. The rocky islands grow almost nothing. Everything must be imported. The triton help with fishing, but grain, vegetables, and livestock all arrive by ship. Knova maintains strategic reserves, but a determined blockade could starve them out—if anyone could get past the triton.

### Military

**Size**: Small but elite

**Quality**: Best individual fighters in Alaria

**Enrollment**: Students and faculty (everyone trains)

Every resident of Knova is a warrior—or training to become one. There's no separate military because the entire population IS the military.

The three schools each produce different specialists:

**Iron Academy** (main island): Personal combat in all forms. Sword, spear, axe, bare hands—students master multiple disciplines before specializing. Graduates are among the deadliest individual fighters alive.

**Seatower**: Tactics, command, and wargames. Students learn to lead units, plan campaigns, and think three moves ahead. The fortress hosts constant war simulations; commanding officers from across Alaria pay to observe.

**Blackwater**: History, strategy, and logistics. The unglamorous school, and the smallest—but arguably the most valuable. Wars are won by supply lines. Blackwater graduates keep armies fed, equipped, and moving.

The triton legion numbers around 500 warriors at any time, rotating through training cycles. They fight from the water—ambushing approaching ships, dragging sailors overboard, turning the sea itself into a killing ground.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Western Isles, south of the Iron Sea

**Biomes**: Rocky islands, mineral-rich terrain, deep surrounding waters

**Climate**: Temperate maritime, frequent storms

**Named Features**: Iron Academy (main fortress), Seatower (western fortress), Blackwater (northern fortress)

The Knova archipelago consists of a dozen significant islands and scores of rocky outcroppings. The three largest islands host the three schools; the smaller ones contain mines, training grounds, and support facilities.

The main island rises steeply from the water, its central fortress built directly into the rock. Iron reinforcement makes the walls nearly impervious—hence the name. The harbor is a narrow channel, easily defended, with triton patrols making underwater approach suicidal.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Iron Academy fortress (no other name—the fortress IS Knova)

**Other Settlements**: Seatower (western island), Blackwater (northern island)

### The Three Schools

**Iron Academy** (~4,000 residents)

The heart of Knova. A towering fortress of iron-reinforced stone rising from the central island. Training yards, sparring halls, armories, dormitories—all built for one purpose: creating fighters.

Students train for years, progressing through ranked tiers. Combat matches determine advancement. The annual Iron Tournament draws observers from across Alaria; victory guarantees employment anywhere.

**Commandant Irontide Vesk** rules from the Iron Throne—literally a chair forged from weapons taken from defeated challengers. He's held the position for twenty-three years. Before that, he held it for twelve years, lost it, spent eight years rebuilding his skills, then reclaimed it by defeating his replacement in single combat.

**Seatower** (~1,500 residents)

The western fortress, built on a rocky spire overlooking the shipping lanes. Seatower produces commanders, not fighters. Students study tactics through endless wargames—mock battles using ship models, sand tables, and (weather permitting) actual vessels.

**Battlemaster Kenna Stormwright** leads Seatower. She's never lost a wargame. Her actual combat experience is limited, which some Iron Academy purists consider disqualifying—but her tactical record is flawless.

**Blackwater** (~800 residents)

The northern fortress, named for the dark waters of its harbor. The smallest school, focused on strategy and logistics. Students learn supply calculation, terrain analysis, historical campaigns, and the unglamorous work that makes wars possible.

**Archon Drell Marshkeeper** runs Blackwater. He's seventy years old, has never won a fight in his life, and has helped plan three successful invasions. The Iron Academy sneers at him. Former employers worship him.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Meritocracy Problem**

Knova's system works—until it doesn't. When the Commandant is strong, everyone respects the hierarchy. When the Commandant weakens, challenges multiply. Irontide Vesk is still formidable, but he's aging. The next few years will see increasing challenges, political maneuvering, and potentially a bloody succession.

**Triton Tensions**

The triton compact has held for centuries, but some younger triton question why they should defend surface-dwellers. The training is valuable, but triton society has its own needs. A faction argues for renegotiation—or withdrawal.

**The Food Question**

Every year, Knova's population grows slightly. Every year, food imports must increase. The academy depends on peaceful trade routes—which means staying neutral in regional conflicts. But neutrality limits influence, and influence is how academies attract students.

### Relations

**Allies**: None formal (Knova maintains studied neutrality)

**Trade Partners**: Sheîr (closest port), Tarkhon (wealthy students), various merchant fleets

**Enemies**: None declared (but many grudges from training accidents and tournament injuries)

Knova's neutrality is its greatest asset and its greatest vulnerability. They train anyone who pays—noble heirs, mercenary recruits, even occasional pirates. This makes them universally useful and universally distrusted.

The triton connection provides some diplomatic weight. Offending Knova risks offending the undersea kingdoms. But this cuts both ways; triton politics occasionally drag Knova into conflicts they'd rather avoid.

### Notable Figures

**Commandant Irontide Vesk** — Current leader of Knova and the Iron Academy. A massive man scarred from decades of combat, famous for killing a deep-sea serpent solo. Aging but still deadly. His succession is the unspoken question hanging over everything.

**Battlemaster Kenna Stormwright** — Leader of Seatower. Brilliant tactician, mediocre fighter. Her wargame record is undefeated; her actual command experience is theoretical. Some respect her; others consider her an academic playing soldier.

**Archon Drell Marshkeeper** — Leader of Blackwater. Ancient, physically unimpressive, strategically invaluable. He's planned supply lines for half the successful campaigns in the last fifty years.

**Tide-Captain Muravel** — Senior triton commander. Liaison between Knova and the undersea kingdoms. She's trained three generations of triton warriors here and has strong opinions about the compact's future.

### History

**The Founding** (~400 years ago): A legendary warrior named Knovus established a training camp on the iron-rich islands after being exiled from his homeland (accounts vary on which). Students came. A school formed. The school became a fortress. The fortress became a nation.

**The Triton Compact** (~350 years ago): Early Knova faced constant pirate raids. A triton warrior named Deepcurrent offered a deal: his people would defend the waters if their warriors could train at the academy. The compact has held ever since.

**The Three Schools**: Originally there was only the Iron Academy. Seatower split off when tactical training outgrew its space. Blackwater formed later, when graduates demanded strategic education to match their combat skills.

**The Present**: Knova at its peak—famous, wealthy, influential. But an aging Commandant and growing triton restlessness suggest changes are coming.

## Kura

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Aristocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Nuun, Yngli

**Population**: 200,000

**Stability**: Very stable

**Core Values**: Divine approval, justice, eye for an eye

- Kura must always be controlled jointly between one blue-eye, and one golden-born. Together, they balance each other out, and provide equilibrium to the country. Each has a paragon level in fire or water.
- The Nuunish blue-king wears a crown granting him the ability to produce drinkable water with his attunement.
- The Nuunish gold-king wears a crown granting him the ability to moderate the heat in a 100 mile radius.


### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Glass, information

**Primary Imports**: Animal products, wood

- The glass trade is Kura's lifeblood. The Ley Line of Fire provides the intense, consistent heat needed for exceptional glasswork—Kuran glass is prized across Alaria for its clarity and the unique colors achieved through fire-attunement techniques.
- "Information" as an export refers to Kura's reputation as a neutral ground where secrets are traded. The dual monarchy's isolation and stability make it a safe place for spies, merchants, and diplomats to meet.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Kura relies heavily on its extreme climate to deter invaders. This has been successful in the past.


### Geography

**Location**: Western Westrim, straddling the western edge of the Dunes of Kunagi and the southeastern foothills of the Eronia Range

**Biomes**: Desert (dominant), rocky foothills, scattered oases

**Named Entities**: Ley Line of Fire (bisects nation N-S), Shad Usk (great dune), Dunes of Kunagi (eastern desert)

**Rivers & Lakes**: None permanent; underground aquifers sustain settlements; the Nuun water-crown produces the only reliable surface water in the capital

**Adjacent Waters**: None direct; trade routes lead to the Agreben Sea via coastal settlements to the southwest

**Borders**: Righteous Peaks (north, Tarkhon border), Atriik (south), Wyrm Teeth hills (east), Eronia Range foothills and dwarven territories (northwest)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Bani Bari (~45,000) — the Twin-Throne city straddling the Ley Line of Fire

**Cities**: Labakh (~12,000) — northern trade city near dwarven territories

**Towns**: Fata M'darah — eastern waystation and trading post

**Villages**: Shalif Mulak (~2,000) — agricultural village near capital; numerous small oasis settlements 


### Primary Conflicts

- Honor is a dying virtue in Kura.


### History

The dual monarchy of Kura was established centuries ago when Nuun and Yngli settlers discovered they could only survive the harsh desert by combining their abilities. The Nuun could conjure water, essential for life; the Yngli could moderate the killing heat that made the desert impassable to others. Neither could thrive alone, but together they claimed territory no one else wanted.

The discovery of the Ley Line of Fire transformed Kura from a marginal survivor-state into a prosperous kingdom. The ley line's power enabled the glass industry that now sustains the economy, and the midnight fire academy at Tul Azreitnok has made Kura a destination for mages seeking dangerous knowledge.

Kura has never been successfully invaded. The desert itself serves as the nation's primary defense—armies die of thirst and heat exhaustion long before they reach the settlements. The few attempts have ended in disaster for the invaders, their bones still occasionally uncovered by shifting sands.

## Kyagos

Tags: state

### Overview

A mountainous island-nation in the southern seas, Kyagos sits between the Sea of Seven Snakes and the Alrock Ocean. The Aktarvkus Mountains dominate the interior, dividing the island into isolated coastal territories that never unified under a single government. Instead, four city-states emerged: Syvlius, Vassum, Tekos, and Sy—each controlling its own slice of coast, its own mountain approaches, and its own slave-worked mines.

The Sylthik who rule these city-states built a society around visible hierarchy. Scars mark rank: one cheek-scar for minor distinction, five for the highest lords. Outsiders wear handkerchiefs around their necks marking them as rightless visitors. Non-Sylthik races are considered sub-sentient, undeserving of even basic decency.

This arrangement held for centuries. Then Syvlius burned.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederacy of city-states (fractured)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Sylthik, Drasnian slaves, Dead Moon Tribe (humans)

**Population**: ~100,000 (pre-revolution); current numbers uncertain

**Stability**: Crisis

**Core Values**: Discipline, influence, societal rank, power

The scar-ranking system that once defined Kyagosi society is now openly questioned. In Syvlius, it's meaningless—the city is controlled by freed slaves and gangs who never participated in Sylthik customs. In Vassum, refugees have overwhelmed the social order. Only Tekos still enforces the old ways, and their doubled-down brutality suggests desperation rather than confidence.

Non-Sylthik have always been considered property or worse. The revolution hasn't changed that view among the remaining Sylthik—if anything, it's hardened their contempt. But the Drasnians who now control Syvlius's mines have demonstrated that contempt doesn't stop rebellion.

### Economy

**Size**: Large (diminished)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Gems, jewels, metals

**Primary Imports**: Drasnian slaves from Tamadrez (disrupted)

Kyagos's economy has always rested on mining. The Aktarvkus Mountains contain legendary deposits of silver, copper, iron, and gemstones. Drasnian dwarves—shipped from Gorath's Slaver's Coast—extracted this wealth under brutal conditions. The most lucrative mines clustered around Syvlius, feeding an export economy that made the island wealthy despite its isolation.

The revolution shattered this system. Syvlius's trade tower—the infrastructure connecting the island to the astral current that passes 35 miles east of the mountains—was toppled during the uprising. Sky trade has collapsed. The mines still operate, but under chaotic conditions: Drasnian factions fight over claims, production is erratic, and there's no functioning export system.

Tekos sits roughly 35 miles from the same astral current, on the opposite side of the mountains. Before the revolution, this was a disadvantage—they routed exports through Syvlius. Now it's an opportunity, if they can build their own trade tower. The investment would be staggering, but Tekos may have no choice.

Vassum controlled sea trade and overland routes to Syvlius. With that hub destroyed, they're scrambling to find new arrangements. Some merchants are already negotiating directly with Drasnian gang leaders in the ruins.

Sy's silver-focused economy may actually benefit from the chaos—silver is valuable everywhere, and their extraction doesn't depend on Syvlius's infrastructure.

### Military

**Size**: Very small

**Quality**: Very low (except Sy)

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

Military service in Kyagos has traditionally been a mark of failure. If you weren't talented enough for anything else, you were enlisted. The pay was poor, the respect nonexistent. This left all four city-states with paper armies incapable of serious warfare.

The exception is Sy, where constant werewolf pressure forced actual military investment. Sy's border patrols are competent, experienced, and respected—a stark contrast to the ceremonial forces elsewhere.

The revolution exposed this weakness. Syvlius's garrison crumbled when faced with thousands of desperate slaves backed by Dead Moon warriors. The other city-states watched and realized they couldn't have done better.

Tekos is now attempting military reforms, but building a real army takes time they may not have. Vassum has largely given up on military solutions, focusing instead on negotiation and economic adaptation.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern seas, between Sea of Seven Snakes and Alrock Ocean

**Biomes**: Mountains, temperate forest, tropical jungle, swamp

**Named Regions**: Aktarvkus Mountains, Moonwood, Jungula Serpentine, Traevluong, Mythlias, Killing Hills, Avakus Forest

**Rivers & Lakes**: Lake Shikaya, Lake Teklan, Kessus Lake, Deadman's River, Merthcant River, Sygum River, Tyatach River, Mysik River

**Adjacent Waters**: Sea of Seven Snakes (west), Alrock Ocean (east), Sea of Sighs (southwest), Dawn's Passage (south)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (confederacy)

**City-States**:
- Syvlius (destroyed/chaotic)
- Vassum (strained but functional)
- Tekos (fortress mentality)
- Sy (pragmatic survival)

**Contested Territories**: Avakus Forest, Valley of Whispers, mountain passes between city-states

### Current Conflicts

**The Syvlius Aftermath**
The revolution succeeded but left chaos. Drasnian factions control different districts of the ruined city, fighting each other over mine claims and resources. The Dead Moon Tribe helped destroy Syvlius but hasn't occupied it—they've retreated to Moonwood, leaving the Drasnians to sort themselves out. No unified government has emerged.

**Slave Unrest**
Every remaining slave in Kyagos has heard what happened in Syvlius. Tekos responds with increased brutality; Vassum tries to maintain order through economic incentives; Sy has quietly reduced the harshest treatment. None of these approaches is working particularly well.

**The Dead Moon Question**
For decades, Kyagos was "at war" with the Dead Moon Tribe in a conflict where neither side inflicted serious damage. The revolution revealed this as deliberate restraint—the tribe was waiting for their moment. Now they've demonstrated real military capability, and no one knows what they want next. Their shamans meet with Drasnian leaders in Syvlius. Their warriors patrol further south than they have in generations. Something is being negotiated.

**Economic Collapse**
The trade tower's destruction cut Kyagos off from the astral current that made sky trade possible. Sea routes remain, but they're slower, more dangerous, and lower capacity. The island's export economy is crippled until someone builds new infrastructure or finds alternative arrangements.

**Werewolf Pressure**
The Ulvsjael of Traevluong don't care about Kyagos's political crisis. They continue probing Sy's borders, picking off isolated patrols, enforcing their territorial claims. Sy can't afford to weaken their eastern defenses regardless of what's happening elsewhere.

**Kuru Opportunism**
The beast-warriors of the Killing Hills and Mythlias have noticed Kyagos's weakness. Raids on Tekos's agricultural settlements have increased. The Kuru aren't numerous enough to threaten the city directly, but they're making life harder for a city-state already under pressure.

### History

The Sylthik arrived on Kyagos centuries ago, displacing the human population that had lived there previously. These humans—the Dead Moon Tribe—retreated into Moonwood rather than submit to Sylthik rule. The new arrivals established city-states around the coastal regions they could defend, discovered the mountain wealth, and built an economy on mining.

The slave trade began when Kyagos's own population proved insufficient for the labor demands of the mines. Connections with Gorath's Slaver's Coast provided a solution: Drasnian dwarves, shipped across the sea in chains, extracted the wealth that made Kyagos prosperous. For three centuries, this arrangement held.

### The Syvlius Revolution

The revolution came suddenly. A band of outsiders—adventurers whose names are now legendary among the Drasnians—saw opportunity in Syvlius's massive slave population and Kyagos's weak military. They made contact with the Dead Moon Tribe, who had been waiting generations for exactly this kind of chance.

When the uprising began, it was coordinated. Slaves rose throughout the city while Dead Moon warriors swept down from Moonwood. The Sylthik garrison, trained for ceremony rather than combat, collapsed. Within days, Syvlius was burning.

The rebels didn't just overthrow the government—they demolished the city. The great trade tower, symbol of Syvlius's economic dominance, was toppled in a final act of destruction. Whether this was strategic (denying the other city-states easy reconquest) or emotional (destroying everything associated with Sylthik rule) depends on who you ask.

The heroes who led the revolution—Xe, Alice, Bryce, Woof, Bordrick, and Snuffles—departed after their victory. They lit the fire and left others to deal with the aftermath. The Drasnians they freed now struggle to build something from the ashes, while the Dead Moon Tribe has retreated to Moonwood with unclear intentions.

### Relations

**Gorath**: Primary source of Drasnian slaves. The revolution disrupts a profitable trade relationship—Gorath may intervene to protect their investment, or may simply redirect slaves elsewhere.

**Tamadrez**: Origin point for Drasnian slaves. News of the Syvlius revolution will spread to enslaved populations throughout the Shacklands.

**Trømgar**: The battle dwarves have long protested Drasnian enslavement. Syvlius's fall may embolden their underground resistance networks.

**Free Colonies**: Founded by Drasnian escapees from the Gorath-Kyagos slave route. They may reach out to the liberated Syvlius—or may stay cautiously distant.

**Phirexes**: Northern neighbor, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes. Minimal contact; the gorgon queen has her own problems.

**Shykasas**: Insular alligator-folk kingdom to the southwest. No meaningful relationship.

### Player Hooks

**Chaos in the Ruins**: Syvlius offers opportunities for those willing to navigate gang politics. Someone needs to broker peace between Drasnian factions, establish trade relationships, or simply loot the wealthy estates before someone else does.

**The Dead Moon Mystery**: What do the tribal shamans want? Their meetings with Drasnian leaders suggest plans beyond simple revenge. An outsider might learn things neither side would share with Kyagosi.

**Werewolf Diplomacy**: Sy has begun cautious outreach to the Ulvsjael. An envoy who could actually communicate with the werewolves—or survive long enough to try—would be invaluable.

**The Trade Tower Race**: Both Tekos and Vassum want to build replacement infrastructure for the astral trade. The engineering challenges are immense, the financial stakes enormous, and sabotage from rivals is guaranteed.

**The Underground Railroad**: Escaped slaves from Tekos need routes to safety. The traditional paths through Syvlius are now chaotic rather than hostile—is that better or worse?

**Skyreach Secrets**: The ancient fortress in the mountains predates Sylthik settlement. With Kyagos destabilized, someone might finally investigate what it was built for—and whether anything useful remains.

## Kyorda

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Constitutional Monarchy with elected councils

**Primary Inhabitants**: Tikhaya (humans), Wytrolape (giant apes)

**Population**: ~45,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:

- Philosophical inquiry and wisdom
- Coexistence between different peoples
- Discipline and self-mastery
- Preparation for the moon-curse

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Furs, timber, philosophical texts, crafted goods

**Primary Imports**: Metals, weapons, luxury goods from the south

- The Wytrolape serve as laborers and craftsmen, their great strength making them invaluable for forestry and construction
- Tikhaya scholars produce sought-after philosophical and mathematical treatises
- Trade relationships with Kyorda are valuable precisely because the nation is stable in an unstable region

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Kyordan military emphasizes discipline and coordination over raw numbers
- Tikhaya martial philosophers combine combat training with strategic thinking
- Wytrolape warriors are devastating in combat but must be carefully managed around Hollownight
- The nation maintains neutrality in the Enti-Danaki conflict, though border incidents sometimes occur

### Geography

**Location**: Western Frostmarch Peninsula

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, taiga

**Named Entities**: Buleeri T'han (forest), Gysheyani (forest), Bank of Infindior

**Rivers & Lakes**: Multiple unnamed rivers flowing to Wavecrash Sound

**Adjacent Waters**: Wavecrash Sound, Denrik Sea approaches

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Xandur—a city of stone and timber built around a natural harbor on Wavecrash Sound

**Cities**: Xandur

**Towns**: Phelmuz, Petvok, Rylvok, Skelgrod

**Villages**: Numerous scattered through the forests

### Primary Conflicts

- Managing the Wytrolape moon-curse during Hollownight—every month brings the risk of rage-induced violence
- Protecting the Bank of Infindior, a planar institution of immense importance
- Maritime threats from the Denrik Sea, including whatever dwells in the Darkstone Caves beneath the waters
- Isolation—Kyorda is far from other civilized lands, making supply chains precarious and outside aid slow to arrive

### History

Kyorda was founded centuries ago by Tikhaya settlers who recognized that the region could support civilization if properly managed. The integration of the Wytrolape came later—the giant apes were already present, and rather than conflict, the Tikhaya chose coexistence.

The moon-curse has shaped Kyordan society profoundly. Every aspect of life accounts for the periodic madness that affects the Wytrolape population. Buildings are reinforced, contingency plans exist for Hollownight, and both peoples have developed rituals and practices to minimize casualties during the dangerous days.

### The Bank of Infindior

East of Xandur, where void and time leylines cross, stands the Bank of Infindior—a planar institution where time does not pass. Depositors can store possessions here with perfect security; items remain exactly as they were when deposited, regardless of how long they remain. The bank serves clients from across Alaria, and protecting it is one of Kyorda's most important duties.

## L'coth D'hari

Tags: state, elves, gamori

The northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds—a multi-lobed landmass of dense jungle surrounded by the South Sea. L'Coth D'hari is the territory of the **Gamori**, an elven people who have developed a culture centered on death, transformation, and the sacred hunt.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Gamori (elves)

**Population**: Unknown (the Gamori do not census themselves for outsiders)

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:
- **Death and rebirth cycles** — The Gamori view death not as ending but as transformation. Funerals are massive, elaborate affairs celebrating the transition.
- **Body modification** — Scarification, bone-shaping, implants of natural materials, rings, piercings, paint, and extensive tattoos. Modification marks status, achievement, and spiritual growth.
- **Sacred hunting** — Rituals involving the pursuit and consumption of specific prey. You drink the blood of what you kill to gain its strength.
- **Territorial isolation** — Outsiders are rarely welcome. The Gamori consider the wider Elder Wilds their hunting grounds and have been known to dismantle settlement attempts beyond their borders.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped (by choice—they have access to trade goods but prefer traditional methods)

**Primary Exports**: Rare jungle herbs, bloodwood timber (limited), ritual components

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, worked glass, alchemical compounds

The Gamori trade reluctantly and only when necessary. Most contact occurs at the edges of their territory or through intermediaries in Urzula.

### Military

**Size**: Medium (relative to population)

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Cultural (all Gamori participate in hunts, which serve as military training)

Every Gamori is a hunter. The distinction between "civilian" and "warrior" doesn't exist in their culture. Their knowledge of the jungle terrain, combined with body modifications that often include enhanced senses or natural weapons, makes them deadly defenders of their territory.

They do not field armies in the conventional sense. Instead, the jungle itself becomes the weapon—ambushes, traps, poison, and psychological warfare.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds, eastern Aboyinzu

**Biomes**: Dense tropical rainforest

**Named Entities**:
- **Breathless Bay** — Western inlet, fog-shrouded and unnaturally still
- **Paradise Inlet** — Central waterway dividing the main peninsula lobes
- **Farthing Inlet** — Southern boundary separating L'Coth D'hari from the Apelands

**Adjacent Waters**: South Sea (north and west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Eriyen (ceremonial gathering place rather than permanent city)

**Cities**: None in the conventional sense

**Towns**: Multiple scattered communities throughout the peninsula

**Villages**: Numerous, hidden, deliberately difficult to find

### Internal Complications

**Thorne**: In the interior of the peninsula dwells an ancient druid who predates the Gamori arrival—possibly by millennia. The Gamori have an understanding with Thorne, the terms of which they do not discuss. The grove called Thorne is a place where the forest has become alien, and even the death-obsessed Gamori give it wide berth.

### Primary Conflicts

- Occasional friction with Urzula over hunting grounds in Seyiy
- Rare conflicts with ape incursions from the south
- Internal disputes between communities over territory and prey

### History

The Gamori arrived in L'Coth D'hari at an unknown point in history—likely during the early Third Eon. They found the peninsula already inhabited by the druid Thorne and reached an accommodation that persists to this day. The nature of this agreement shapes Gamori culture in ways they do not explain to outsiders.

They have no written history. Their past is preserved through ritual scarification, where major events are carved into the bodies of those who experienced them and passed down through generations of modification.

## Lenora

Tags: state, elves, confederation

The agricultural heartland of the elven confederation. Lenora occupies the fertile lowlands of the southern Farlands, bounded by the Ocean of Elorinia to the west, the Kelder Mountains to the east, and the Amholia Greras forest to the south. Of the three elven kingdoms, Lenora is the most populated, the most productive, and—its neighbors would say—the most ambitious.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Landsmeet (council of landholders)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Elves

**Population**: ~400,000 (largest of the three kingdoms)

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**:
- Productivity and stewardship of the land
- Respect for ancestral holdings
- Confederation loyalty (contested)
- Ritual and seasonal observance

The **Landsmeet** governs Lenora—a council of every elf who holds productive land. In theory, this is democratic. In practice, the ancient families who settled the river valleys generations ago control most of the good territory. The Landsmeet convenes in Jien Asari four times yearly, aligned with the solstices and equinoxes.

#### The Succession Question

The Landsmeet has always been led by a **High Steward**—a position that rotates among the twelve founding families according to a schedule set nearly 3,000 years ago. The rotation made sense then: twelve families, twelve positions in the cycle, each ruling for a century before passing the mantle.

But time has complicated matters. Three of the original families have died out entirely. Two others merged through marriage five centuries ago. Meanwhile, families that were minor landholders at the founding now control vast territories through shrewd acquisition and favorable harvests.

The current schedule no longer reflects reality. Families that no longer exist still have their turn "reserved." Living families argue over who inherits the empty slots. The families enriched by recent centuries demand inclusion in the rotation. Those who benefit from the old schedule refuse to renegotiate.

This is not a class conflict—everyone involved is traditional, respects the ancestors, and believes in the old ways. They simply disagree about which old ways apply. The dispute has simmered for two centuries without resolution. Every Landsmeet spends at least a day arguing about it before moving to other business.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Grain, preserved foods, timber, Elorshianod hardwoods, river fish, cultural goods

**Primary Imports**: Titan-bone ritual objects (from Deo Esari), mountain herbs, metals

Lenora feeds the confederation. The kingdom's three great rivers—Kilgre Kevi, Kilgre Apnuk, and Kilgre Thovrys—water vast agricultural lands. The eastern plains between Elorshianod forest and the Kelder foothills are among the most productive farmland on the continent.

Grain barges travel constantly between the interior farms and the coastal ports. Eilren Thalas and Jien Asari handle most of the trade; Imyena Edhil operates independently (see below).

The Lenorans also harvest Elorshianod's hardwoods—carefully, ritually, with appropriate offerings. The lumber is prized throughout the known world, though the elves sell relatively little of it. Most goes to confederation shipyards or internal construction.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Traditional levy system

Lenora maintains a small professional guard for the major cities and relies on levy obligations for larger conflicts. Every landholder must provide soldiers proportional to their holdings—another ancient rule that causes friction when new-wealth families are assessed at rates set for their ancestors' tiny plots.

The Lenoran military has not fought a serious external war in over a millennium. Their most recent conflicts have been minor border disputes with Rakite herders and occasional bandit suppression. The soldiers are well-trained but untested.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Farlands, between Ocean of Elorinia and Kelder Mountains

**Biomes**: Temperate forest, fertile plains, river valleys

**Major Geographic Features**:
- **Elorshianod**: The great coastal forest, running north-south along the western shore. Unlike Illron's sacred forest, Elorshianod is settled and worked—river towns dot both banks of the Kilgre Kevi and Kilgre Apnuk.
- **Starluck Hills**: Southern hill country separating Lenora proper from the Amholia Greras. Named for the phosphorescent fungi that bloom on autumn nights.
- **Vokas Pendl**: The northern mountain spur where the Kilgre Kevi originates.

**Rivers & Lakes**:
- **Kilgre Kevi**: Northern river, flows from Vokas Pendl through Elorshianod to the coast
- **Kilgre Apnuk**: Central river with many tributaries, feeds the capital at Jien Asari
- **Kilgre Thovrys**: Southern river, feeding the isolated port of Imyena Edhil

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Jien Asari (inland, on the Kilgre Apnuk)

**Major Cities**:
- **Eilren Thalas**: Primary port, southwestern coast. Handles most foreign trade.
- **Imyena Edhil**: Southern port on Kilgre Thovrys. Deliberately isolated—see below.

**Coastal Settlements**: Galaena Ancalen, Imsegroth, Ufa Caelora (along Kilgre Kevi from Vokas Pendl to ocean)

**Forest Settlements**: Numerous towns within Elorshianod along both major rivers

**Eastern Settlements**: Agricultural villages in the fertile plains before the Kelder foothills

### Imyena Edhil — The City of the Grieving

Imyena Edhil has no roads connecting it to the rest of Lenora. The only access is by river (Kilgre Thovrys) or sea. This is deliberate.

The city is home to the **Grieving**—elves who have committed the sin of forgetting a true name. In elven belief, when you forget someone's true name, their spirit is lost forever to the void beyond Celestia. The most permanent death possible. If you are responsible for this loss—through negligence, malice, or simple failure of memory—you have committed something unforgivable.

The Grieving are exiled to Imyena Edhil. They may never leave. The walls around the city aren't to keep enemies out—they're to keep the Grieving in. These elves are considered spiritually contaminated. Prolonged contact with them might cause others to forget.

But Imyena Edhil is still a city, not a prison camp:
- The Grieving have children, and those children inherit the stain
- The city has existed for millennia; thousands of elves live there now
- They've built their own society—fishing, river trade within limits, crafts
- Ships can dock at the river mouth, but outsiders rarely enter the walls

The city is not a hellhole. The Grieving have festivals, families, art, love. But there's a weight to the place. Everyone knows why they're there. Everyone knows they'll never leave. Visitors describe Imyena Edhil as beautiful but heavy—like the whole city is holding its breath.

Anyone who flees Imyena Edhil is hunted. Not killed—returned. The other cities don't want the Grieving among them.

### Relations

**Illron**: Tense. Lenora has the population and wealth; Illron has tradition and the sacred forest. The confederation's one-kingdom-one-voice voting structure favors Illron, and Lenora resents it. But neither side wants to break the alliance—the ancestors who signed the Three Kingdoms Treaty are still watching at Laeroth Esori.

**Deo Esari**: Cordial but distant. Lenora needs Deo Esari's titan-bone ritual objects for certain ceremonies; Deo Esari needs Lenora's food. Neither particularly likes the other. Deo Esari views Lenora as vulgar and too concerned with growth; Lenora views Deo Esari as hidebound and self-righteous.

**Rakite**: Formal trade relations with the buffalo-herding elves to the east. The Rakiteans don't participate in the confederation, but they're still kin. Trade is regulated, ritualized, and generally peaceful.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Succession Question**: Which families control the High Steward rotation? No resolution in sight.
- **Confederation Representation**: Should Lenora's larger population mean more votes at Laeroth Esori? The ancestors said no. But the ancestors didn't anticipate Lenora growing to four times Illron's population.
- **Imyena Edhil**: Some younger Lenorans question whether the Grieving truly deserve eternal exile. This is considered a dangerous opinion to hold publicly.

### History

The elves of what would become Lenora arrived in the Farlands roughly 5,000 years ago, part of a larger migration from the east. They settled the river valleys, cleared portions of Elorshianod for farming, and gradually pushed the forest's original inhabitants—various fae creatures—southward into what is now Amholia Greras.

The Three Kingdoms Treaty, signed at Laeroth Esori approximately 4,000 years ago, established the confederation and ended centuries of border warfare between the elven polities. Lenora has honored the treaty since, though not always happily.

The founding of Imyena Edhil is not recorded in official histories. The city simply exists, and always has, in the memories of living elves. Some scholars believe it predates the confederation itself—that the Grieving were being exiled even before the three kingdoms formally united.

## Lethos

Tags: state, shacklands

A waterlogged jungle peninsula that exists in the shadow of Gorath—and in the shadow of something older, something the jungle itself remembers.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: The Vigil (open council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Faeja, Darklings, Gillykin, Druids

**Population**: ~5,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**:
- Secrecy: What happens in Lethos stays in Lethos
- Maintenance: The Binding must be tended, always
- Consensus: No single voice can speak for all seven villages
- Memory: The dead must be remembered, lest they remember themselves

The Vigil is less a government than a coordination mechanism. Representatives from each of Lethos's seven villages meet at Xyrionn twice yearly—more often during Hollownight or times of crisis—to ensure the Binding remains stable. Decisions require consensus from at least five villages, making Lethos slow to act but nearly impossible to subvert from within.

Each village handles its own internal affairs. There are no laws that apply across all of Lethos, no shared taxation, no unified justice system. What binds the villages together is not politics but necessity: if the Binding fails, everyone dies.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Rare herbs, poisons, certain jungle hardwoods

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, preserved foods, salt

Lethos has almost no economy in the conventional sense. The villages are largely self-sufficient, living on fish, jungle game, cultivated roots, and gathered plants. What trade exists happens at Altimarloch, the village closest to the Gorathi border, where a few brave merchants bring metal tools, salt, and other goods unavailable in the deep jungle.

In return, Lethos exports rare medicinal plants and poisons that grow nowhere else—perhaps because of the Binding's influence on the local flora. These command high prices among Gorathi alchemists and physicians, creating a small but consistent flow of trade. The Faeja village of Mangaone specializes in this cultivation.

The Gillykin of Qlyp Augo participate in no trade at all.

### Military

**Size**: None (formal); Very Small (informal)

**Quality**: Very High (asymmetric)

**Enrollment**: None (voluntary specialists)

Lethos has no army. It doesn't need one.

The closest thing to a military force is the hunters of Ohoka, a Darkling village deep in the jungle. When threats arise—bandits who think they can prey on isolated villagers, Gorathi deserters seeking to disappear, occasionally something worse—Ohoka's hunters move through the supernatural darkness to eliminate them. They are very good at this. Bodies are rarely found.

But Lethos's true defense is the Binding itself. An invading army would face a jungle that actively resists them: paths that change, water that poisons, darkness that conceals enemies and disorients allies. Soldiers who die in Lethos do not stay dead—they become part of what they were fighting. The longer an occupation lasts, the stronger the jungle's resistance grows.

Gorath learned this three centuries ago. They have not forgotten.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern peninsula extending into the Sea of Sighs, eastern Shacklands

**Biomes**: Flooded jungle, mangrove swamp, brackish wetlands

**Named Entities**: Xyrionn (sacred stump), Qlyp Augo (ruins)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Multiple unnamed waterways; the land is more water than earth

**Adjacent Waters**: Sea of Sighs (south, east); Sherivreen Jungle coast (northeast)

Lethos is barely land at all. The jungle grows from standing water; paths between villages are canoe routes; buildings are constructed on stilts or floating platforms. Seasonal floods reshape the terrain constantly. Only a few areas of solid high ground exist, and these are significant—Erua is built on one, Xyrionn rises from another.

The climate is hot, humid, and oppressive. Rain falls almost daily. Insects are constant companions. Outsiders find the environment exhausting even before accounting for the Binding's effects.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (Xyrionn serves as meeting place)

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None

**Villages**:
- Tanekala (south, fishing)
- Altimarloch (west, trade/contact)
- Mangaone (interior, herbalism)
- Erua (east, druids)
- Ohoka (deep jungle, Darklings)
- Mintai (center, memory-keepers)
- Eptos (northeast, Gillykin monitors)

### Primary Conflicts

**Internal**:
- Gradual weakening of the Binding (requires increasing effort to maintain)
- Tension between isolation and survival (some argue for more outside contact)
- The Gillykin's increasing silence (they've grown more withdrawn recently)
- Succession at Erua (the druids are finally dying; who will anchor the Binding?)

**External**:
- The Binding may be spreading into the Sea of Sighs (ships disappearing)
- Gorathi interest is stirring (descendants of the Fourth Legion seek answers)
- Unknown pressure from beneath Qlyp Augo (the Gillykin warn of something awakening)

### History

**412 PR** — Gorath's Fourth Legion crosses into Lethos; occupation begins

**414 PR** — Provincial capital established at Qlyp Augo; garrison of 3,000

**~420 PR** — Druids begin the Binding ritual; first Gorathi dead woven into jungle

**452 PR** — Night of Roots; Qlyp Augo consumed; Gillykin emerge; Gorath withdraws

**453 PR** — Gorathi archives sealed; "tribute exemption" established

**~550 PR** — Village of Eptos founded to monitor Qlyp Augo

**Present** — Binding weakening; Veleth (druid of Xyrionn) aging; Gillykin increasingly withdrawn

### Relations

**Gorath**: Cold non-interference. Gorath maintains the "tribute exemption" and forbids military operations in Lethos. Most Gorathi officials don't know why. Those who do don't ask.

**Other Shacklands States**: Minimal contact. Lethos participates in no regional politics, signs no treaties, and asks nothing from its neighbors.

**The Sea of Sighs**: Complicated. Something in the water around Lethos is dangerous, and it may be getting worse.

## Lier

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant republic

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 45,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Trade, pragmatism, discretion, profit

- Lier is governed by a council of merchant families who've accumulated enough wealth to buy seats. Politics is transactional—votes are traded, favors are currency, and everyone understands that principle matters less than profit.
- The population is predominantly human, though the port of Hessam attracts visitors and residents from across the Middle Sea. Diversity is tolerated as long as it's profitable.
- Lier serves as the commercial hub of Erpeus Island, trading Mkinti's clockwork and gems to the wider world while supplying the gnomes with goods they can't produce underground.
- The culture values discretion. Lier's merchants have learned that asking too many questions loses customers, and everyone has secrets worth keeping.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Re-exported Mkinti goods, agricultural products, fish, ships

**Primary Imports**: Grain, luxury goods, raw materials for Mkinti

- Lier's economy runs on being the middleman. Mkinti's gnomes don't want to deal with outsiders; Lier's merchants are happy to do it for a cut.
- The fertile hills produce grain, olives, and wine that feed both Lier and supplement Mkinti's non-gnomish population.
- Fishing fleets work the surrounding waters, and shipyards in Hessam build vessels for Middle Sea trade.
- The Bay of Whispers draws a peculiar sort of tourism—those seeking lost secrets or trying to speak across time.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (mercenary-heavy)

- Lier maintains a small professional military supplemented by mercenaries when needed. The merchant families prefer hiring soldiers to raising them.
- The navy is more substantial—protecting trade routes matters more than defending borders on an island this size.
- The real defense is economic. Attacking Lier would disrupt trade across Erpeus, and the gnomes of Mkinti have made clear they'd respond to threats to their supply chain.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Erpeus Island, in the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Rolling hills, coastal lowlands, rocky highlands

**Named Entities**: Hills of Soromun, Murder Hills, Devil's Crest, Bay of Whispers

**Rivers & Lakes**: Several rivers flowing from the highlands to the coast

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (east and west coasts)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Hessam

**Cities**: Hessam

**Towns**: Lucsha, Dozna, Coyzevan, Tothpa, Oychka, Gam

**Villages**: Numerous farming and fishing villages

### Primary Conflicts

**The Gnomish Question**

Lier's prosperity depends on Mkinti, but the gnomes' internal crisis threatens everything. If House Wizzik loses control, if civil war breaks out, if the clockwork trade stops—Lier's economy collapses. The merchant council is desperately trying to maintain good relations with all factions without picking sides.

**The Bay of Whispers**

The supernatural bay outside Hessam attracts seekers of forbidden knowledge—and the trouble that follows them. Strange cults, obsessed scholars, people trying to undo the past or learn the future. The council tolerates the tourism revenue but worries about what secrets might emerge.

**The Murder Hills**

The highlands got their name honestly. Bandits, fugitives, and things that don't like sunlight shelter in the Murder Hills, preying on travelers between Lier and Azuros. The council sends occasional expeditions to clean them out; the hills refill within months.

**Azuros Relations**

The monks to the north are harmless but unhelpful. They won't trade, won't fight, won't engage with the world in ways Lier's merchants understand. The council mostly ignores them—but some worry about what would happen if the monastery's isolation ever broke down.

### History

Lier was founded as a fishing village that grew into a trading post. Its position on Erpeus made it the natural intermediary between the gnomes of the mountains and the human world beyond.

The merchant families emerged gradually, accumulating wealth through generations of careful dealing. They formalized their power into the council system, where money determines influence and old blood means nothing without new gold.

The discovery of the Bay of Whispers changed Lier's character. The supernatural phenomenon drew attention—scholars, mystics, the desperate, and the curious. The merchants adapted, charging fees for access, selling supplies to seekers, and learning which questions not to ask.

Modern Lier is prosperous, pragmatic, and perpetually anxious. The gnomish crisis threatens everything. The Bay of Whispers generates opportunity and danger in equal measure. The Murder Hills resist all attempts at civilization. But the merchants keep trading, the ships keep sailing, and the money keeps flowing—for now.

## Linas

Tags: citystate, state, trade, dye

The dye capital of Alaria, built on a coast that would otherwise be unremarkable. Linas exists because a shipwrecked merchant discovered that the local shellfish—starfish, snails, and clams—contained pigments of extraordinary brilliance. That merchant built a fortune, and that fortune became a city.

Today, hundreds of ships leave Linas harbor each morning, heading for the Starfish Isles to harvest the shellfish that sustain the city's economy. The dye they produce—a brilliant orange-gold that holds its color through washing, sunlight, and years of wear—commands premium prices across Alaria. Nobles, merchants, and anyone who wants to signal wealth and taste pays handsomely for Linas pigments.

### Government

Linas is ruled by the **Dye Guilds**—the major merchant houses that control harvesting rights, processing facilities, and export networks. The guild masters collectively form a council that handles city governance, though "governance" mostly means protecting the dye trade and ensuring no single house gains too much advantage over the others.

The current balance of power involves five major guilds and perhaps a dozen minor ones. The major guilds control the best harvesting territories in the Starfish Isles, the largest processing facilities, and the most lucrative export contracts. The minor guilds fight for scraps—secondary harvesting grounds, subcontracting work, niche markets the majors don't bother with.

Guild politics are cutthroat but rarely violent. Reputation matters too much for open warfare. Instead, houses compete through quality, efficiency, and careful manipulation of harvesting quotas and trade agreements. The occasional poisoning or convenient accident happens, of course, but discreetly.

### The Starfish Isles

The foundation of Linas's wealth lies in the shallow waters north of the city. The Starfish Isles—a maze of sandbars, reefs, and tidal flats—contain the richest shellfish beds on the Seacleft Coast. The creatures that live there have shells saturated with pigment, concentrated in ways found nowhere else.

Linas claims exclusive harvesting rights to the isles, enforced by armed guild vessels that patrol the major channels. The dye guilds divide the harvesting grounds among themselves according to ancient agreements and more recent negotiations. Poaching is constant—the waters are too vast for complete control—but the guilds catch enough interlopers to make the risks real.

The harvesting season runs from late spring through early autumn. During peak months, the harbor empties each morning as the fleet heads out, and fills each evening with boats heavy with shellfish. The processing facilities run day and night, extracting pigment before the catch spoils.

### The Tide-Singers

On the outer reaches of the Starfish Isles, where the harvesting grounds give way to the Walker Depths, a small religious order maintains weathered shrines. The **Tide-Singers** perform ceremonies for the drowned dead who walk the seafloor below—singing names into the water to release trapped ancestors.

Most Linas harvesters consider the Singers harmless eccentrics. The guilds tolerate them because they provide shelter to boats caught in storms and seem to calm the waters near their shrines. A few old captains speak of them with genuine respect, claiming the Singers know things about the isles that no chart records.

The Singers accept no payment in coin. Families seeking their services must bring objects that belonged to the deceased, which the Singers weight with stones and drop into the depths. Whether the rituals work is a matter of faith.

### Economy

Dye dominates everything. The pigment extracted from Starfish Isles shellfish accounts for the vast majority of Linas's exports and tax revenue. Secondary industries exist—boat-building, net-making, barrel production, food services for the harvesting fleet—but all of them ultimately serve the dye trade.

The finished product travels across Alaria through legitimate trade networks and less legitimate ones. Linas merchants sell directly to textile producers in the Middle Sea states, to luxury goods traders in Tarkhon, to anyone with coin and a desire for color. The dye guilds maintain offices in major ports across the continent.

What the guilds don't openly acknowledge is how much of their product moves through Mirko. The lawless city-state to the south provides access to markets that respectable merchants can't reach—smuggling routes, black markets, customers who prefer not to leave paper trails. Linas dye ends up in places the guilds officially disapprove of, and everyone involved profits.

### Relations

**With Enavadi**: Cold indifference, occasionally warming to cold irritation. Enavadi fishermen work the northern edges of Linas's claimed waters, and the two groups have different ideas about where the boundaries lie. Conflicts are rare but sharp when they occur. The Enavadi consider Linas harvesters clumsy amateurs who mistake money for skill; Linas considers the Enavadi primitive isolationists with an inflated sense of their own importance.

**With Mirko**: Officially proper, practically intimate. Mirko's criminal networks distribute Linas dye to markets that guild merchants can't or won't touch directly. The guilds pretend their product ends up only in legitimate hands; Mirko pretends they're simple merchants. Everyone makes money.

Mirko's guilds also provide "protection" for Linas harvesting ships in the Starfish Isles—for a fee. This protection is remarkably effective, primarily because the main threat to harvesters is Mirko-affiliated pirates who know which ships have paid.

**With Everyone Else**: Linas trades with anyone who has coin. The dye guilds maintain commercial relationships across the Seacleft Coast and beyond, sending their product wherever there's demand. Politically, Linas prefers to stay neutral in regional conflicts—war is bad for business, and the city has no territorial ambitions beyond protecting its harvesting grounds.

### Culture

Linas is a merchant city, and merchant values dominate. Success is measured in coin, status in guild standing, respectability in the quality of one's business relationships. The city is cosmopolitan by necessity—traders from across Alaria pass through, and the guilds hire talent wherever they find it.

The dye trade shapes everything, including fashion. Wearing Linas orange is a statement of wealth across Alaria, but in Linas itself, the color is common enough to be unremarkable. The truly wealthy distinguish themselves through *other* colors—blues, purples, greens that must be imported at great expense—or through the subtle quality differences that mark master-grade dye from standard production.

The city smells of salt, shellfish, and the chemical tang of pigment extraction. New visitors find it overwhelming. Residents stop noticing within a week.

### Player Hooks

- **Harvesting Rights**: A minor guild wants to expand into waters claimed by a major house. They need evidence that the major house's charter doesn't actually cover the disputed area—evidence that might be found in old records, or might need to be manufactured.

- **The Vermilion Legacy**: Aldos Vermilion's fortune was supposedly distributed to the families of the Birthday Wreck victims. Some of it was. Not all. Someone knows where the rest went, and someone else wants to find out.

- **Tide-Singer Secrets**: The Singers know something about the Walker Depths—something the guilds would pay well to learn, or pay well to suppress. A dying Singer wants to pass on knowledge to someone outside the order.

- **Mirko Complications**: A Linas guild's Mirko contacts have become liabilities. The criminals know too much, want too large a cut, or have attracted attention the guild can't afford. The problem needs to be solved quietly, far from Linas, by people who can't be traced back.

## M'Svyla

Tags: state

Home to the Ix'Lorett lizardfolk. Located just south of the Crystal Mountains in Central Aboyinzu.

## Mez

Tags: state

Links: States

Mez is not a nation in any sense the surface world would recognize. It is a territory—a claimed domain beneath the southwestern Widebarrow Mountains where the Lyzine hold absolute sway. To call it a "state" insults the concept; to ignore it would be suicide. The spider-folk have ruled these depths for millennia, and they consider the entire surface world a temporary inconvenience on land that is rightfully theirs.

The Lyzine are fallen nobility, or so they insist. Their origin myths speak of vast surface kingdoms, elegant courts, and a glorious civilization brought low by jealous lesser races who conspired to drive them underground. Whether any of this is true—scholars outside Ve have never heard of these supposed kingdoms—matters less than the Lyzine belief in it. They consider themselves exiled royalty, and they intend to reclaim their throne. Every raid is a step toward restoration. Every human they kill or enslave is a correction of historical injustice.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Anarchy (Competing Queendoms)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Lyzine

**Population**: 20,000 (estimated; actual numbers unknown)

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Supremacy, revenge, pleasure, legacy

- There is no central authority in Mez. Power rests with the spider queens—breeding females who command absolute loyalty from their respective hordes. Each queen rules her own domain within the warren complex, competing with rivals for territory, resources, and males.
- Succession is violent. A queen holds power until a challenger defeats her—either through combat, assassination, or the slower method of starving out her horde. The average reign lasts perhaps fifty years; some queens have endured for centuries.
- Males exist to serve. They fight, they build, they raid—and the most successful are rewarded with the privilege of attempting to mate with a queen. This is not the honor it sounds like; the process kills most participants. Those who survive contribute their bloodline to the next generation and are granted status as "consort-elect," a protected class with limited authority.
- Lyzine society is rigidly hierarchical beneath its chaotic surface. Within a horde, ranks are absolute. The strong dominate the weak. The clever exploit the foolish. Movement between ranks is possible—through combat, through cunning, through proving value—but the hierarchy itself is never questioned.

### Economy

**Size**: None (raid-based)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Lyzine silk (involuntary)

**Primary Imports**: Slaves, surface goods (taken by force)

- The Lyzine have no economy as surface dwellers understand it. Wealth exists—silk, captured treasures, slaves—but it circulates through gift-giving, tribute, and theft rather than trade.
- Lyzine silk is the most valuable substance to leave Mez, and the Lyzine hate that it does. The silk is harvested from abandoned webs and slain Lyzine by Dernish hunters; no living Lyzine would sell it. The silk is extraordinarily strong, lighter than cotton, and takes dye beautifully. Fashion houses in Shyona pay fortunes for it. The Lyzine consider the trade a desecration.
- Slaves are the true currency of Mez. Captured surface dwellers—humans, primarily, taken in raids—serve as laborers, entertainment, and food. A queen's power is measured partly by the size of her slave pens. Well-treated slaves can survive for years; poorly treated ones last weeks. The Lyzine don't particularly care either way.
- Some inter-horde trade occurs: silk for ore, slaves for breeding rights, information for future considerations. These transactions happen through intermediaries and are always temporary alliances rather than permanent arrangements.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (but refusal is death)

- Every adult Lyzine is a warrior. Their exoskeletons provide natural armor equivalent to mail; their venom paralyzes; their web glands allow them to control terrain in ways no surface army can match. A single Lyzine is worth three human soldiers. A coordinated horde is a nightmare.
- Raids are the primary military activity. A queen sends her warriors to the surface to capture slaves, seize resources, and remind the humans above who the true masters are. Raids follow seasonal patterns—heavier in winter when Dernish patrols are thinner, lighter in summer when the surface is more vigilant.
- Large-scale assaults happen every few decades, when a particularly ambitious queen unites multiple hordes for a major push. These are the events that reshape borders and fill the Boneswamps with new dead. The last major offensive was forty years ago; the next could come tomorrow.
- Lyzine fight with natural weapons—venom, claws, webs—supplemented by captured or crafted arms. Their weapons tend toward the elegant: thin rapiers, curved daggers, weighted nets. Heavy armor is rare; their exoskeletons suffice, and mobility matters more than protection in tunnel fighting.

### Geography

**Location**: Beneath the southwestern Widebarrow Mountains, extending under Dern's territory and parts of the Blood Mountains

**Biomes**: Subterranean caverns, artificial warrens, fungal forests

**Named Entities**: The Deep Warren (primary Lyzine territory), various queen-claimed domains

**Rivers & Lakes**: Underground rivers and lakes (named in Lyzine tongue; no common translations)

**Adjacent Waters**: None (subterranean)

- The true extent of Mez is unknown. Dernish maps show sealed tunnels and known passages, but the Lyzine dig constantly, and their domain certainly extends far beyond what surface cartographers have charted.
- The upper levels, closest to the surface, are contested ground—the zone where Lyzine raids launch and Dernish patrols venture. Below that, the tunnels open into vast cavern systems where the Lyzine have dwelt for millennia.
- Fungal forests light the depths with bioluminescence. The Lyzine cultivate certain species for food; others grow wild in conditions no surface crop could survive. These forests are beautiful in a terrible way—soft glowing lights, delicate formations, and always the sense of being watched.
- Each queen claims a territory within the warren complex. Borders are marked with pheromones and web-patterns that surface dwellers can't perceive but Lyzine read like maps. Crossing another queen's territory uninvited is war.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Glik (primary queen's domain)
**Cities**: None (the concept doesn't translate)
**Towns**: Tnu Kiin
**Villages**: Tsuicht

*Note: These "settlements" are not equivalent to surface towns. They are domains—territories claimed by specific queens or powerful subordinates, with populations that shift as allegiances change.*

**Glik** — The domain of Queen Thessivara, currently the most powerful spider queen in Mez. Glik is less a city than a vast cave system draped in silk, its chambers connected by web-bridges and tunnel-warrens that would drive a human mad trying to navigate. Perhaps 8,000 Lyzine dwell here, along with several hundred slaves.

Thessivara has held power for 180 years, an extraordinary span. She's survived seven assassination attempts, three succession wars, and countless minor challenges. Her longevity comes from ruthless cunning: she plays rivals against each other, keeps her consorts weak, and maintains the largest slave population in Mez as both labor force and hostage pool. Other queens hate her; none have managed to bring her down.

The great silk-halls of Glik are said to be magnificent—vast chambers lined with woven tapestries depicting Lyzine history, lit by phosphorescent fungi, and centered on the Queen's Throne where Thessivara receives supplicants. Survivors who've escaped Glik speak of terrible beauty.

**Tnu Kiin** — A secondary domain controlled by Queen Vexara, Thessivara's most dangerous rival. Tnu Kiin occupies a warren complex in the southern reaches of Mez, closer to the Blood Mountains and further from human interference. Perhaps 5,000 Lyzine call it home.

Vexara is younger than Thessivara—a mere 90 years—but ambitious beyond measure. She's been cultivating alliances with lesser queens, building a coalition that could challenge Glik's dominance. The politics are complex: some queens ally with Vexara from genuine ambition; others do so hoping to weaken Thessivara enough to create opportunity for themselves.

Tnu Kiin is more militaristic than Glik, focused on raids and warfare rather than silk-weaving and court intrigue. Vexara's warriors are the most feared in Mez—better trained, better equipped, and driven by their queen's burning desire to prove herself. If a major offensive comes, Tnu Kiin will likely lead it.

**Tsuicht** — A minor domain, almost a footnote. Controlled by Queen Mylassia, an old queen who has retreated from active competition. Tsuicht is where aging Lyzine go when they've lost the strength to fight and the cunning to scheme—a quiet backwater by Lyzine standards.

Perhaps 2,000 Lyzine live here, including a disproportionate number of elderly. Mylassia tolerates them; she has no ambition left except survival, and a large population of dependents discourages rivals from bothering to conquer her. The domain produces nothing of value and launches no raids of consequence.

Curiously, Tsuicht maintains the closest thing Mez has to contact with the surface. A handful of humans—former slaves who earned freedom through unknown service—dwell in the outer tunnels, serving as intermediaries for the rare occasions when Lyzine and surface dwellers must communicate. The Dernish know these "tunnel-speakers" exist but officially deny it.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Dern and the Surface**: The eternal war of reclamation. The Lyzine will never stop. The surface, they believe, belongs to them. Every raid is a step toward restoration.
- **The Thessivara-Vexara Rivalry**: The two most powerful queens in Mez are heading toward confrontation. When it comes—not if—it will reshape Lyzine politics for generations. The question is whether they'll fight each other first, or unite for a surface offensive that allows both to prove themselves.
- **The Blood Mountains Question**: Beneath the Blood Mountains dwell the Bloodlings—vampiric gnomes with their own subterranean realm. The Lyzine and Bloodlings have skirmished for centuries. Neither has gained lasting advantage. Some queens advocate alliance against the surface; others see the Bloodlings as prey.
- **Succession Instability**: Thessivara is 180 years old. By Lyzine standards, that's ancient. Her death—by assassination, by challenger, by simple time—will throw Mez into chaos. Every ambitious queen is positioning for the aftermath.

### History

The Lyzine claim their exile happened in an age before human memory—that they ruled great surface kingdoms when the current races were still learning to walk upright. Shyonan historians dismiss this as myth. Chimean legends, interestingly, speak of "spider-lords" who ruled parts of Ve in the distant past before being driven underground by a coalition of gods and heroes. Which version is true—or whether either is—remains unknown.

What's certain: the Lyzine have dwelt beneath the Widebarrow for at least 3,000 years. Archaeological evidence from ancient mines shows Lyzine webbing in strata predating human settlement by millennia. They were here first. They intend to be here last.

The First Breach (approximately 380 years ago) marked the beginning of sustained Lyzine-human conflict. Before that, surface dwellers and Lyzine existed in a state of mutual ignorance—the Lyzine in their depths, the humans on their mountains, neither particularly aware of the other. Deep mining changed that. Human prospectors tunneled into Lyzine territory; the Lyzine responded.

The centuries since have seen countless raids, several major offensives, and no resolution. The pattern is consistent: the Lyzine attack, the humans fortify, the attacks grow until a major offensive either succeeds or breaks against Dernish defenses. Then follows a period of relative quiet while the queens rebuild their strength, until the cycle begins again.

The last major offensive, the Silk War (40 years ago), saw three queens unite for a coordinated assault that briefly captured the Dernish mining town of Greyvein. They held it for two months before Dernish reinforcements drove them back underground. Greyvein was never rebuilt; its ruins are now considered cursed ground.

### Hooks

- **The Thessivara Succession**: The old queen is weakening. Every power in Mez—and some on the surface—has an interest in who replaces her. Players could be hired to assassinate her, protect her, or manipulate the succession for outside interests.
- **The Tunnel-Speakers**: The human intermediaries in Tsuicht know more about Lyzine society than any other surface dwellers. What would it take to meet one? What do they know? What do they want?
- **Vexara's Offensive**: Intelligence suggests Tnu Kiin is preparing something big. The Dernish want to know what—and if possible, to stop it before it starts. They're hiring specialists.
- **The Bloodling Alliance**: Rumors suggest a faction of Lyzine and a faction of Bloodlings are negotiating. If the subterranean powers unite, the surface world is in serious trouble. Someone needs to confirm or deny—and if true, to disrupt.
- **Escaped**: A group of slaves has made it to the surface, claiming knowledge of Lyzine defensive weaknesses that could change the war. The Tunnel Watch wants to debrief them. The Lyzine want them silenced. The players are in the middle.

## Mirko

Tags: citystate, state

A very vertical city. Built in the space between the tide and the hills. Deep canals lead into the depths of the city. Highest murder rates of anywhere.

Home to humans, chargon, nyolci, karchon, and elves. Very active mafia, and some of biggest gambling rings in the world. Multiple high-power thief and assassin guilds have their headquarters located here. The city is conveniently located, ignores demands of its neighbors, has no laws, and contacts everywhere.

Origins lie from when they offered protection to some pirates fleeing privateers. The pirate repaid them with a small fortune, granting the city the money to grow, and decided to make the place his permanent residence.

## Mkinti

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchy (formerly five houses, now one)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ohblex (Gem Gnomes)

**Population**: 25,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Secrecy, scheming, craftsmanship, family loyalty

- Until recently, Mkinti was controlled by five major gnome houses locked in endless political games—alliances, betrayals, marriages, assassinations. Then four of the five house heads died in quick succession. Now only House Wizzik remains.
- The Ohblex are crystalline gnomes born from the gems of the Gemstone Peaks. Their skin reflects precious stone colors, and they sustain themselves by consuming gems rather than food.
- They are the sole keepers of clockmaking secrets on Alaria, crafting incredible mechanical devices and jewelry that fetch astronomical prices abroad.
- The gnomes live in elaborate underground mazes filled with mechanical traps, their cities expanding ever deeper into the mountains. They value secrecy, mystery, and complication above all else.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Clockwork devices, jewelry, gems, mechanical components

**Primary Imports**: Food (for non-Ohblex residents), metals, raw materials

- Mkinti's clockwork is unmatched. No one else on Alaria has cracked the secrets of precise mechanical timekeeping, and the Ohblex intend to keep it that way.
- Gem trade is tightly controlled. The Ohblex consume gems as sustenance, which gives them intimate knowledge of every stone's quality and magical properties—making them impossible to deceive in gem trades.
- The economy runs on schemes. Every transaction has hidden layers, every contract contains clauses within clauses. Outsiders who try to do business in Mkinti without gnomish advisors invariably get fleeced.
- The recent political upheaval has disrupted trade. House Wizzik controls everything now, but the transition has been chaotic.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (house guards)

- The Ohblex don't maintain a traditional army. Each house maintained its own guards, and now those guards serve whoever pays them—mostly House Wizzik.
- The real defense is the terrain. The Gemstone Peaks are treacherous, the underground cities are mazes, and every corridor is trapped. Invading Mkinti would be a nightmare.
- The gnomes prefer assassination and sabotage to open warfare. Why fight battles when you can remove problems quietly?

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Erpeus Island, in the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Mountains, underground caverns, gem-veined tunnels

**Named Entities**: Gemstone Peaks, Bejeweled Palace

**Rivers & Lakes**: Underground rivers and pools

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Wizzik (formerly shared among the five house seats)

**Cities**: Wizzik, Zunuki

**Towns**: Uzikni, Elfekin, Tiknurtir

**Villages**: Numerous small settlements in the mountains and underground

### Primary Conflicts

**The Succession Crisis**

Four house heads are dead. House Wizzik claims they had nothing to do with it—and perhaps they didn't. Someone orchestrated the assassinations, and no one knows who or why. The surviving Wizzik leadership is consolidating power rapidly, but the other houses' remnants are scheming in the shadows. Civil war seems inevitable unless Wizzik can establish legitimacy fast.

**The Bejeweled Palace**

The cursed palace of an ancient Mkinti king sits abandoned in the mountains, its treasury legendary and its dangers worse. Gnomes don't dare approach it—too many have tried and never returned. But with the political chaos, some desperate factions are considering whether the palace's treasures might be worth the risk.

**The Clockwork Monopoly**

Other nations would pay anything to learn Ohblex clockmaking secrets. Spies infiltrate constantly. The gnomes have responded with increasingly elaborate counter-intelligence operations, but the pressure never stops. If the secrets ever leaked, Mkinti's economic dominance would collapse.

**Relations with Neighbors**

Mkinti shares Erpeus with Lier and Azuros, neither of which the Ohblex particularly like. Lier's humans are too straightforward, Azuros's monks are too honest. The gnomes trade with both while scheming against both, as is their nature.

### History

The Ohblex emerged from the Gemstone Peaks in an age before human records, born from the gems themselves through processes the gnomes don't discuss with outsiders. They discovered their clockwork aptitude early and realized its value—and its danger if shared.

For centuries, the five great houses competed for dominance through intricate political games. Wars were rare; assassinations were common but carefully targeted. The system was stable in its instability, each house checking the others' ambitions.

Then someone broke the rules. Four house heads died within a single month—poison, accidents, mysterious disappearances. The survivors pointed fingers at each other, then at House Wizzik, then at unknown outside forces. No one proved anything.

House Wizzik moved fastest, seizing control of the shared institutions while other houses scrambled to choose new leadership. Now they rule Mkinti alone, but their grip is tenuous. The old game of five has become a game of one against many, and the many are regrouping in the shadows.

## Moigos

Tags: state, kappa, crime

A state ruled by criminals who don't bother pretending otherwise. Moigos occupies the swampy northern reaches of Petrona Septia Island, where the Kappa — massive, toad-like crime lords — have built an empire of debts, favors, and quiet violence. The official government exists on paper; real power flows through the counting houses and backroom deals where the Kappa conduct their business.

The arrangement works, after a fashion. Moigos is stable, prosperous by regional standards, and safe enough for those who understand the rules. The rules are simple: the Kappa get their cut, debts are paid, and no one asks questions about matters that don't concern them. Those who follow the rules live comfortable lives. Those who don't... don't.

### The Kappa

The toad-folk who dominate Moigos are not numerous — perhaps a few hundred in the entire state — but they don't need numbers. They have patience, intelligence, and an institutional memory that spans generations. A Kappa never forgets a debt. A Kappa never forgives a slight. And a Kappa never acts hastily when slow, methodical destruction will serve better.

The Kappa operate through networks of obligation. They lend money, provide services, solve problems — always at a price, always creating debts that can be called in later. Over generations, they've woven themselves into every aspect of Moigos commerce and politics. The merchant families who sit on Thetin's council owe their positions to Kappa backing. The river captains who move goods owe their boats to Kappa loans. Everyone owes something, and the Kappa keep meticulous records.

Violence is rare because it's rarely necessary. When a debtor fails to pay, the Kappa don't send thugs — they call in other debts, arrange for business to dry up, ensure that the defaulter's reputation is destroyed. By the time the process is complete, the target has lost everything without a single blow being struck. The occasional example is made, of course, pour encourager les autres. But the Kappa prefer financial ruin to physical violence. It's more profitable and less messy.

### Government

Moigos has a council of merchant families that meets in Thetin, deliberates on matters of policy, and issues decrees that everyone politely ignores. The council exists because states are supposed to have governments, and the Kappa find it useful to have a body that can sign treaties, receive ambassadors, and handle the tedious business of appearing legitimate.

The merchant families who serve on the council are not puppets, exactly. They have genuine interests, genuine wealth, and genuine influence within their spheres. But they hold their positions because the Kappa permit it, and they make decisions that the Kappa have already approved. The system works because everyone understands the arrangement and no one has any interest in disrupting it.

Real governance happens through the Kappa networks. Disputes are settled by whichever Kappa has the strongest claim on the parties involved. Infrastructure is maintained by whoever profits from it. Order is kept by the shared understanding that disorder is bad for business.

### Economy

Moigos produces timber from the Alegheim forest, agricultural products from the river valleys, and various goods processed in its towns. None of this is remarkable. What makes Moigos economically significant is its position as a hub for less legitimate commerce.

The Kappa networks extend far beyond Petrona Septia. Goods that can't be sold openly elsewhere find buyers in Moigos. Services that can't be procured legally can be arranged through the right contacts. Information flows through Kappa channels, and secrets are bought and sold like any other commodity.

The Isle of the Night adds another dimension. The Kappa don't control Blackpoint's supernatural darkness, but they control access to it. Treasure hunters seeking the island's rumored wealth must outfit their expeditions in Moigos, hire guides through Kappa-connected brokers, and often finance the whole venture with Kappa loans. Most expeditions fail. The Kappa profit either way.

### Culture

Life in Moigos is ordinary for those who stay within the rules. Farmers farm, merchants trade, craftspeople practice their crafts. The Kappa presence is felt but not seen — a background awareness that certain people are not to be crossed, certain questions are not to be asked, certain debts must always be paid.

The human and other non-Kappa inhabitants of Moigos have adapted to their situation. They're practical, cautious, and skilled at reading the subtle signs that indicate which way power is flowing. They don't resent the Kappa, exactly — the arrangement provides stability and opportunity for those who work within it. But they don't love them either. The relationship is transactional, and everyone knows it.

Religion is muted. The Kappa have no use for gods, and the faiths that flourish elsewhere find less purchase in a society built on earthly debts rather than divine ones. People observe the forms, mark the festivals, and keep their spiritual lives private.

### Relations

**With Ios**: Limited contact across the Screech Peaks. Ios has little that Moigos wants, and Moigos has little that Ios can afford. The mountain passes see some trade, handled through Calentia, but neither state has significant interest in the other.

**With Rilyn**: The Splinkreen city-state is too small and too strange to be worth the Kappa's attention. Rilyn's woodland people keep to their forest; the Kappa keep to their swamps. Occasional trade happens, but no significant relationship exists.

**With the Tuktuk**: Complicated. The turtle-folk of the Tyvern Isles are fierce, honorable, and not easily intimidated — qualities that make them poor targets for Kappa manipulation. But they're also practical, and some commerce flows between Moigos and Vitruk village. The Kappa treat the Tuktuk with more respect than they show most outsiders, recognizing that these are not people who can be safely exploited.

**With everyone else**: The Kappa networks extend wherever trade reaches. Moigos has contacts, agents, and debtors across the Seacleft Coast and beyond. The state itself is unimportant; the networks are everything.

### Notable Locations

- **Thetin**: Capital on the Qulyintes River; center of Kappa power
- **Calentia**: Upstream town handling mountain trade with Ios; gateway to the Urun
- **Ragusa**: Skraigos River town processing timber and agriculture
- **Hepetas**: Upper Skraigos town at the edge of navigable water
- **Alegheim**: Swampy forest covering northern Moigos; Kappa territory
- **Urun Mountains**: Eastern range separating Moigos from Fernius Sound; mining camps, hidden caches, and older things above the treeline
- **Isle of the Night**: Supernatural darkness; Blackpoint treasure island

### Player Hooks

- **Debt Collection**: The players owe a Kappa — or someone they care about does. The debt isn't money; it's a service, a secret, or something worse. The Kappa is patient. The Kappa can wait. But eventually, the debt comes due.

- **Blackpoint Expedition**: Someone wants to reach the lightless island and is willing to pay well. The Kappa will arrange everything — guides, equipment, financing. All they ask is a percentage of whatever's found. And if the expedition fails, well, the debt passes to the survivors. Or their families.

- **Network Disruption**: Someone powerful wants the Kappa networks damaged. Not destroyed — that's impossible — but disrupted enough to create opportunities. The players are deniable assets, and the target is a Kappa operation that's grown too ambitious.

- **The Honest Merchant**: A trader in Calentia has managed to operate outside Kappa influence for years. Now they want to expand to Thetin, and they need protection. The Kappa have noticed. Everyone's about to learn whether independence is possible in Moigos.

- **Don't Dig Too Deep**: A debtor escaped the Urun mining camps and made it to the players with a wild story — something in the upper peaks, something the Kappa are afraid of. The toad-folk want the escapee back, badly. They're offering to clear substantial debts, no questions asked. What did the debtor see that's worth that much silence?

## Morgnor's Cradle

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Dragon tyranny

**Primary Inhabitants**: Etherweaver Goblins

**Population**: 8,000

**Stability**: Very Stable (under the dragon's claw)

**Core Values**: Obedience, mining, enchantment, survival

- Morgnor's Cradle is ruled absolutely by **Morgnor**, an ancient earth-attuned dragon. His word is law. Disobedience is death.
- The Etherweaver goblins serve the dragon—mining metals from the earth and enchanting them to his specifications. They are skilled with non-basic elements (time, void, force, light, dark) and use this magic in their crafting.
- Life under the dragon is harsh but predictable. Serve well and live. Fail and die. The goblins have adapted.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed (magical metallurgy)

**Primary Exports**: None (Morgnor hoards everything)

**Primary Imports**: None (self-sufficient through dragon mandate)

- The goblins mine gold, silver, and other precious metals from the Hills of Red Gold and the surrounding mountains.
- They enchant these metals using their Etherweaver magic, creating items of considerable power.
- Nothing leaves the Cradle. Morgnor keeps it all. His hoard is legendary—and growing.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (everyone serves the dragon)

- The goblins maintain a guard force, but Morgnor himself is the real military. An earth-attuned dragon in his own mountains is nearly unstoppable.
- Thespia paid tribute for generations rather than face him. Queen Akta's refusal to continue is either brave or suicidal.

### Geography

**Location**: Mountains northwest of Thespia, west of Glorin, containing the Hills of Red Gold

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, mining valleys, underground complexes

**Climate**: Alpine—harsh winters, brief summers

**Named Features**: Morgnor's Cradle (central mountains), Hills of Red Gold (southern slopes), Mt. Kazlos, Mt. Thryke

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Morgnor (the dragon's lair, also the name of the central settlement)

**Cities**: None (all settlements serve the lair)

**Towns**: Lagunas, Shegaat, Dir, Addis, Norwun, Scuilli, Telleni, Goldir

### The Hills of Red Gold

The southern slopes of Morgnor's domain, rich with gold and other precious metals. This is where most mining occurs. The earth-attuned dragon can sense every vein, every nugget, every grain of gold in his territory. Nothing escapes his notice.

### The Etherweaver Goblins

Unlike their Scalawag cousins, Etherweavers are reserved, cautious, and born with attunements to non-basic elements. Morgnor conquered their ancestors generations ago and put their magical talents to work. They enchant the metals he hoards, creating items of power that he adds to his collection.

The goblins don't love their master, but they've made peace with their situation. Some even take pride in their craftsmanship, even if Morgnor claims all credit.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Thespian Situation**

Queen Akta has stopped paying tribute. Morgnor hasn't responded yet—perhaps he's considering his options, perhaps he's amused, perhaps he's planning something elaborate. When he does respond, it will be devastating.

**Glorin's Gold**

Morgnor knows about Glorin's hidden wealth. He knows the Glorindian dwarves have been quietly mining gold for centuries. He wants it. The only question is when and how he'll take it.

**The Hoard**

Morgnor's greed is bottomless. No amount of gold, enchanted metal, or magical items is ever enough. The goblins mine constantly, enchant constantly, and it's never enough. The dragon always wants more.

### History

Morgnor claimed these mountains long ago, driving out or subjugating whoever lived there before. When he discovered the Etherweaver goblins' talent for magical enchantment, he conquered them rather than destroying them. A useful slave is better than a dead enemy.

For generations, the goblins have mined and enchanted under the dragon's rule. Thespia paid tribute to avoid his wrath. Glorin hid and hoped he wouldn't notice them. The arrangement was stable.

Now Akta has disrupted the tribute. Glorin's wealth has caught his attention. Morgnor is greedy, patient, and very, very powerful. Something is going to change.

## Movasi

Tags: state, theocracy, pilgrimage, velwey, greenwater-isles

Links: States, Greenwater Isles

The island-state of Movasi is a theocratic society governed by the Velwey—dwarves who've built their entire civilization around the Dream Jungle's psychedelic properties and the Pool of Names at their capital. While technically a nation, Movasi functions more like a sacred institution: its economy, laws, and culture exist to facilitate the ritual that reveals pilgrims' true names.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic Council

**Primary Inhabitants**: Velwey (dwarves), with significant human, elf, and halfling minorities

**Population**: ~19,000 permanent residents, plus 500-2,000 transient pilgrims at any time

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**:
- Sacred hospitality toward those who seek truth
- Absolute confidentiality regarding what is learned in ritual
- The Pool's mystery is to be served, not solved

The **Council of Guides** governs Movasi—a body of senior priest-guides who've conducted thousands of rituals and demonstrated both spiritual authority and administrative competence. There is no single ruler; decisions require consensus among the seven council members. Succession happens through recognition rather than election: when a seat opens, the remaining council members identify who among the priests has earned it through decades of service.

The Velwey make up roughly two-thirds of the permanent population and hold nearly all religious and governmental authority. Non-Velwey residents serve in supporting roles: dock workers, merchants, harvesters, laborers. They're treated fairly—the Velwey need them—but full citizenship and participation in governance requires being Velwey.

**Religious Structure**: The priest-guides form a hierarchical order with ranks based on experience and demonstrated ability. Junior priests assist with preparation rituals; only those who've undergone decades of training conduct Pool rituals. The highest-ranked guides are said to have glimpsed truths beyond mere names during their own journeys—though what those truths might be, they don't discuss.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**:
- Pilgrimage services (revelation of true names)
- Refined psychoactive preparations (heavily regulated)
- Clarity tonics and preparation compounds
- Crystallized dream-matter (rare, expensive)

**Primary Imports**:
- Food (the jungle isn't particularly edible)
- Construction materials
- Luxury goods for wealthy pilgrims
- Skilled labor

Movasi's economy runs on pilgrimage. The ritual to learn one's true name is expensive—the preparation alone costs more than most commoners earn in a year, and the full process can take weeks of supported stay. The Velwey don't apologize for this. The service they offer is literally invaluable: eternal survival versus permanent annihilation.

**The Pilgrim Trade**: Wealthy nobles, paranoid mages, dying merchants, ambitious heirs—anyone with enough resources and enough need makes the journey. The pilgrims bring gold, and that gold pays for everything Movasi can't produce itself.

**Regulated Exports**: The psychoactive compounds from the Dream Jungle are valuable beyond the island, but the Velwey control their distribution carefully. Sacramental preparations are never sold—they're only used in authorized rituals. Lesser preparations and clarity tonics can be purchased, but export quantities are limited. The Velwey have no interest in competing with recreational drug markets; they're protecting a sacred industry.

**The Harvest**: Banguna village processes the raw materials, and this work employs a significant portion of the non-Velwey population. The labor is skilled but dangerous, and workers are compensated well enough that volunteers continue arriving despite the known risks.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

The Velwey maintain no standing army. They don't need one.

**The Jungle Defense**: Any force attempting to invade Movasi would have to march through the Dream Jungle. Without Velwey guidance and preparation, the psychedelic effects would shatter unit cohesion within days. Soldiers would turn on each other, wander off into the deep jungle, or simply sit down and stop responding. The jungle itself is the island's primary defense.

**The Pilgrim Shield**: Movasi's clientele includes the wealthy and powerful from every nation in the known world. An attack on the island would be an attack on the interests of nobles, merchants, and rulers who've invested heavily in their own true names—or plan to. No one wants to be the kingdom that interrupted the sacred pilgrimage of a dozen other nations' elite.

**Temple Guards**: The Velwey do maintain a small force of trained guards to handle disputes, protect the Pool, and occasionally deal with pilgrims who become dangerous during bad trips. These guards are equipped with clarity tonics that let them function at full capacity in the jungle's influence—a significant advantage over anyone else on the island.

### Geography

**Location**: Southeastern Greenwater Isles, between the Gulf of Norag and the Sea of Spiders

**Biomes**: Tropical psychedelic forest (Dream Jungle), coastal mangroves, swampy meadows

**Named Entities**: The Dream Jungle, The Pool of Names, Telugai Bay

**Rivers & Lakes**: The Pool of Names (depth unknown), various small streams

**Adjacent Waters**: Gulf of Norag (northeast), Sea of Spiders (southeast), Telugai Bay (south)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Moura
**Cities**: None (Moura is the only major settlement)
**Towns**: Holik
**Villages**: Banguna, Kung, Dreftwaf, Trusiin

The island's political geography follows the pilgrim circuit rather than conventional settlement patterns. Holik serves as the entry point, Dreftwaf as preparation grounds, Moura as the sacred center, and Trusiin as the integration site. Banguna exists to support the harvest; Kung exists in deliberate separation from the system.

### Relations

**Trade Partners**: Movasi trades with anyone who comes to trade. Ships from across the Greenwater Isles, from Upoceax, from Rimihuica—all dock at Holik. The Velwey maintain strict neutrality in external conflicts; they serve anyone who can pay.

**Protected Status**: No nation openly threatens Movasi. Too many powerful people have too much invested in maintaining access. This isn't formal diplomacy—it's the natural result of building a service that the elite of every nation desperately want.

**Roule**: The nearest neighbor, the halfling island to the southwest. Roule handles much of the shipping that connects Movasi to the wider world. Relations are cordial and commercially valuable to both sides.

**The Wider Greenwater Isles**: Movasi participates minimally in regional politics. They attend councils when invited, maintain diplomatic courtesies, and otherwise stay out of the archipelago's conflicts.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Solis Question**: The ruins on the northeast peninsula predate the Velwey. Something there understands true names differently—or was the original source of the Pool's power. The Council of Guides doesn't discuss Solis, but younger priests increasingly ask questions. What did the Velwey really find when they came to Movasi? What did they take? What did they disturb?

**The Kung Heresy**: The skeptics in Kung practice older methods of seeking true names—longer, harder, without Velwey intermediaries. They claim the Pool ritual has been corrupted, optimized for throughput rather than truth. The Council dismisses them as reckless mystics, but their existence is an ongoing challenge to Velwey authority. If names can be found without the Pool, what does that mean for the system built around it?

**The Confidentiality Paradox**: The ritual is designed so priests never learn pilgrims' true names. But some pilgrims suspect this is a comforting lie. The paranoid ones speak their revealed name to no one—defeating the purpose of learning it. Others wonder: if the Pool itself "knows" every name ever revealed in it, what would happen if someone found a way to ask it?

**The One-in-Fifty**: The Pool claims approximately one in fifty pilgrims. Their bodies are never recovered. The Velwey call these deaths "acceptable risk" and point out that pilgrims are warned. But families sometimes want answers. Where do the lost ones go? Are they dead, or somewhere else?

### History

The Velwey arrived on Movasi roughly 1,200 years ago, though their own records are vague about where they came from or why they left. Their founding stories speak of being "called" to the island, of discovering the Pool and recognizing its sacred purpose.

What the founding stories don't explain is Solis—the ruins on the northeast peninsula that predate the Velwey by unknown centuries. Someone or something was here before. The Velwey either don't know what happened to the original inhabitants, or don't discuss it.

The modern ritual developed over centuries of experimentation. Early attempts were more dangerous—the one-in-fifty rate was once one-in-ten. The Velwey refined their preparations, their guidance techniques, their understanding of how to navigate the Pool's depths safely. Or as safely as such a thing can be.

Movasi has never been successfully invaded. The three attempts—by Upoceaxan treasure hunters in 412 SD, by Rimihuican expansionists in 891 SD, and by unknown parties in 1,744 SD—all ended the same way: the invading forces entered the jungle and never emerged.

### The Pilgrim's Journey

A complete pilgrimage to Movasi follows a traditional structure:

1. **Arrival at Holik** (3+ days): Acclimation to the island's ambient effects. Registration with brokers, selection of a priest-guide, preliminary medical and psychological evaluation.

2. **Journey to Dreftwaf** (1-2 days): Guided travel through the jungle to the preparation grounds.

3. **Preparation at Dreftwaf** (5-10 days): Fasting, lesser journeys, confession of known names, mental and spiritual preparation for the Pool.

4. **Travel to Moura** (1 day): The final approach to the capital.

5. **The Ritual** (1 night): Consumption of the sacrament, submersion in the Pool, the revelation (or not).

6. **Recovery and Speaking** (1-3 days): Physical recovery, first speaking of the name in the Speaking Houses.

7. **Integration at Trusiin** (3-30 days): Processing the implications, deciding who to tell, possibly commissioning protective bindings or oaths.

8. **Return to Holik and departure**: Exit through the jungle, departure by ship.

The entire process takes a minimum of two weeks; many pilgrims stay for a month or more. Rushing is dangerous and discouraged.

### What Pilgrims Should Know

**The Cost**: Full pilgrimage services start at approximately 500 gold crowns—equivalent to several years' wages for skilled laborers. Luxury accommodations, extended stays, and additional services increase the price significantly. The Velwey offer no discounts, but they do operate on a strict pay-what-you-can basis for those who can demonstrate genuine need and pure intention. These subsidized pilgrimages are rare.

**The Risk**: One in fifty pilgrims doesn't return from the Pool. This is not hidden. Every pilgrim signs acknowledgment of this risk. The Velwey maintain that the Pool takes only those who weren't ready—but they can't explain how to be ready, or what "ready" means.

**The Choice**: Learning your true name creates a paradox. Keep it secret, and you're safe from Deoric control but condemned to eventual oblivion. Share it, and you might survive death forever—but anyone who knows it can puppet you while you live. The Velwey help pilgrims think through this, but the choice is always the pilgrim's own.

**The Change**: Many pilgrims report that the ritual changed them in ways beyond the name itself. Some describe enhanced perception, persistent visions, or a lingering sense of connection to the jungle. Others experience personality shifts, altered priorities, or the feeling that they left something behind in the Pool and brought something else back. The Velwey don't promise that you'll return unchanged. They promise that you'll return knowing who you really are.

## Mueras

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchy (Council of Merchant-Kings)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Drachma, Yngli

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Stable (through mutual deterrence)

**Core Values**: Style, instincts, cunning

Mueras is governed by merchant-kings who hold powerful monopolies over different aspects of trade—not goods themselves, but the means of moving them. The true currency of power in Mueras is navigation: control of the pilot guilds that guide ships through Labyrinth Sound, the treacherous waterway that defines the coast. Without licensed pilots, ships wreck. The merchant-kings who control the pilots control the trade.

Seven major houses hold seats on the Council, which meets in chambers carved into the highest cliff of Bazz. Assassination between houses is common but rarely successful—the merchant-kings are wealthy enough to afford extensive protections. More effective is killing a rival's pilots, sabotaging their navigation charts, or bribing their harbor masters. The competition is constant, vicious, and conducted with impeccable style.

The Drachma dominate the upper echelons of Mueran society—their cultural emphasis on panache, instinct, and personal style aligns perfectly with merchant-king values. The Yngli occupy a more complicated position: their magical silence makes them ideal for keeping secrets, and many serve as pilots, dock workers, and navigators. Some houses treat their Yngli well; others exploit them ruthlessly. The Yngli communities of the Taflex Forest maintain independence from all houses, trading forest products but answering to no merchant-king.

#### The Seven Houses

**House Hammren** (Hammer Coast): Controls the northern sea approach via the twin fortress-ports. The oldest house, predating even Kasper's rise. Conservative, militaristic, closest thing to old nobility.

**House Vethros** (Kelwin): Controls the Kelwin Throat, the most technically demanding passage. Their pilots are the finest in Mueras. Also controls most of the Taflex Forest logging operations.

**House Marsova** (Hennipin): Controls the southern passage into Corpse Bay. Eternal rivals to Vethros. Extensive warehousing operations that undercut Bazz's storage monopoly.

**House Korreth** (Bazz): Controls the Council Chambers and the central markets of Bazz. No navigation monopoly, but their position at the junction of Sound and Bay makes them the natural meeting point for all trade.

**House Velani** (Bazz): Specialists in insurance, banking, and contract enforcement. No ships of their own, but every ship that trades in Mueras eventually needs Velani services.

**House Dreth** (Port Perith): Controls trade with the haunted zone—Kaspion salvage, Cliffdrop pilgrimage fees, and the darker commerce that flows from death-touched regions.

**House Yoros** (Grimreach): The newest house, elevated to the Council only two generations ago. Controls the shadow-touched trade from the Darkened Coast. Other houses consider them barely civilized.

### Economy

**Size**: Very large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Fish, sea products, pilot services, shadow-touched materials, timber

**Primary Imports**: Everything else

The Mueran economy reaches across the world despite—or because of—the region's treacherous waters. Ships must pass through Mueran-controlled channels to access the Agreben Sea and the southern trade routes. The pilot fees alone generate enormous wealth, and the warehousing, insurance, and support services multiply it further.

Mueras lacks astral airways, cutting it off from the fastest magical trade routes. The merchant-kings have turned this into advantage: goods that can't be trusted to astral transport (fragile, perishable, politically sensitive, or simply too large) flow through Mueran ports instead.

The shadow-touched trade from Grimreach and the Darkened Coast adds a darker revenue stream. Void-eel oil, shadow-ray leather, ghost-touched artifacts from Kaspion—these command premium prices in markets that don't ask questions about provenance.

**The Pilot Guilds**: The true engine of Mueran wealth. Each major passage through Labyrinth Sound requires pilots who know the specific currents, rocks, and hazards. These pilots are bound to specific houses through guild contracts, oaths, and sometimes more coercive measures. A pilot who betrays guild secrets faces consequences that don't end with death.

### Military

**Size**: Medium (state forces) / Large (combined house fleets)

**Quality**: Medium (state) / Variable (houses)

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (state) / Contractual (houses)

The official Mueran military is deliberately modest—the Council fears any force strong enough to threaten merchant-king autonomy. State forces maintain coastal defense, suppress piracy, and occasionally intervene when house conflicts threaten trade.

The real military power lies in the individual house fleets. Each merchant-king maintains private naval forces, marines, and shore garrisons. House Hammren's forces are the most conventionally military; House Yoros fields specialized monster-hunters; House Dreth employs practitioners comfortable with death magic. Combined, the house fleets could challenge any navy in the region—but they will never combine.

**The Compact of Bazz**: An ancient agreement prevents house forces from operating within Bazz itself or attacking the Council Chambers. Violations are punished by the combined action of all other houses. This creates the one neutral zone in Mueras where merchant-kings can negotiate without fear of assassination.

### Geography

**Location**: Western coast of Rimihuica, Westrim region

**Biomes**: Coastal cliffs, arid plateau, temperate forest, shadow-touched coast

**Named Entities**: Labyrinth Sound, Corpse Bay, Walker Depths, Dustwind Plateau, Mueras Highlands, Taflex Forest, Grimreach, Darkened Coast, The Tarns, Beak of Mueras, Sal'emri Bay, Watchkeep Isles, Brunas Inlet

**Rivers & Lakes**: The Tarns (highland lakes), seasonal streams from Dustwind Plateau

**Adjacent Waters**: Agreben Sea (south/southwest), Walker Depths (west)

The geography created the politics. Mueras occupies roughly 400 miles of coastline, but the actual navigable waterway through Labyrinth Sound stretches over 200 miles of treacherous channels. The interior Dustwind Plateau isolates the coast from the eastern reaches. The Darkened Coast in the southeast adds supernatural hazard to natural difficulty.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Bazz (de facto; no formal capital designated)

**Cities**: Bazz (40,000), Kelwin (12,000), Hennipin (10,000)

**Towns**: Kaspion (abandoned/haunted), Port Perith (5,000), Port Echo (4,000), Al Khamilah (5,000), Cursius (3,000), Fulon (3,000), Eddiwood (2,500), Yorx (2,000), Indus (2,000)

**Villages**: Hickton, Saron, Sha'ra, Blof Point, Freed, Giorga, Sherly, Lieler, Al Muqlib, Am Batr, N. Hammer Point, S. Hammer Point (fortress-garrisons)

**Special Zones**:
- **The Haunted Zone**: Kaspion and surroundings, officially forbidden, unofficially exploited
- **Sal'emri Bay**: Tarkhon trading enclaves, nominally under House Hammren protection but effectively autonomous
- **Deep Taflex**: Yngli territory, no house authority recognized

### Primary Conflicts

**House Vethros vs. House Marsova**: The eternal rivalry. Control of the central Sound passages means control of the most profitable trade routes. Both houses constantly probe for advantage through price wars, pilot sabotage, and political maneuvering in the Council.

**The Haunted Zone**: House Dreth profits from Kaspion's curse; other houses want the ghost-city cleansed or at least contained. The curse may be spreading—the Darkened Coast has deepened since Kasper's death, and some blame the unresolved spiritual damage.

**Yngli Rights**: The Yngli cannot speak to advocate for themselves. Some houses treat them fairly; others exploit their silence. The free Yngli of the Taflex Forest occasionally act against the worst offenders, but they lack the organization for sustained resistance.

**Tarkhon Relations**: The Sal'emri Bay enclaves are useful but also potential Tarkhon footholds. House Hammren profits from protecting them; other houses wonder if the Tarkhon presence will eventually threaten Mueran independence.

**The Succession Problem**: Merchant-king families rise and fall. House Yoros joined the Council only recently; older houses resent their presence. If a house falls, who claims their seat? The Compact of Bazz doesn't address this clearly, and the ambiguity creates tension.

### History

**The Age of Petty Lords**: Before Kasper, Mueras was fragmented among dozens of minor lords, each controlling a single cove or passage. Trade was nearly impossible; piracy was endemic.

**Kasper's Consolidation** (approximately 150 years ago): A merchant named Kasper of Kaspion began unifying the coast through conquest, assassination, and forced marriage. Over three decades, he eliminated or absorbed nearly all rivals, establishing himself as the sole ruler of Mueras.

**The Tyranny** (32 years): Kasper ruled from his palace at Kaspion, demanding absolute loyalty. Those who displeased him were thrown from Cliffdrop. He centralized all pilot guilds under royal control and taxed trade heavily to fund his court and military.

**The Rebellion** (approximately 118 years ago): A coalition of surviving merchant families, funded partly by Tarkhon interests, raised forces against Kasper. The rebellion succeeded in breaching Kaspion's defenses—but Kasper had prepared.

**The Death-Curse**: Rather than surrender, Kasper triggered a curse that killed every living person in Kaspion instantly—approximately 12,000 souls. The curse bound the dead to the city, creating the haunted zone that persists today.

**The Compact of Bazz** (shortly after the curse): The surviving rebel leaders, horrified by what their victory had unleashed, negotiated the Compact—an agreement to share power through a Council, to maintain Bazz as neutral ground, and to prevent any single house from accumulating Kasper-like authority.

**The Modern Era**: 118 years of Council rule. Houses have risen and fallen; House Yoros joined the Council 40 years ago after their shadow-trade operations became too profitable to ignore. The curse has not faded. The Darkened Coast has deepened. And some say the merchant-kings secretly prefer it this way—the danger keeps outsiders from competing.

### Culture & Customs

**Style as Virtue**: Drachma influence permeates Mueran culture. How you do something matters as much as what you do. A merchant-king who wins through clumsy methods loses face; one who loses gracefully may gain respect.

**The Salt Greeting**: Visitors to a Mueran home are offered salt and water—symbols of the sea that sustains the nation. Refusing is a grave insult; accepting creates a limited guest-right that prohibits violence until the visitor leaves.

**Pilot Oaths**: Pilots swear complex oaths binding them to their house and guild. Breaking these oaths is believed to curse the oathbreaker's navigation sense—a superstition that may have magical truth.

**The Cremation Custom**: Bodies are cremated in Mueras, never buried. The reason is practical: buried bodies in cursed ground may rise. Crematoriums burn constantly in major ports.

**Silence as Trust**: Due to Yngli influence, Muerans are comfortable with silence in negotiation. A Mueran who fills every pause with words is considered untrustworthy—someone hiding something.

### Player Hooks

**Pilot Guild Intrigue**: A house wants to poach pilots from a rival. The party must recruit, bribe, or extract pilots while avoiding retaliation.

**Kaspion Salvage**: Something valuable lies in the ghost-city. House Dreth will pay well for retrieval—but the dead don't appreciate visitors.

**Yngli Liberation**: Free Yngli from the Taflex want to rescue kin from an abusive house. The party must infiltrate, extract, and escape without starting a house war.

**The Deepening Shadow**: The Darkened Coast is expanding. Someone needs to investigate why—and whether Kasper's curse is to blame.

**Tarkhon Tensions**: A Sal'emri merchant has been murdered. House Hammren wants it solved quietly before Tarkhon takes notice. The killer may be from another house—or from Tarkhon itself.

**Succession Crisis**: A merchant-king has died without clear heir. Multiple claimants are preparing for conflict. The party can tip the balance—for the right price.

## Murth

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Dual governance (shared authority between two capitals)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Rhea (Eynmore), Humans (Vastilin)

**Population**: ~25,000 (Eynmore ~8,000; Vastilin ~12,000; scattered communities ~5,000)

**Stability**: Stable but tense

**Core Values**: Knowledge and commerce, focus and profit, the binding of opposites

- Murth is governed by two capitals on two mountains: **Eynmore** on Mt. Disyus (Rhea scholars) and **Vastilin** on Mt. Arn (human merchants). Neither rules the other. Major decisions require agreement from both.
- This arrangement has persisted for over a thousand years—long enough that no one alive remembers it being any other way, but not long enough to resolve the fundamental tension between Rhea idealism and human practicality.
- The Rhea are air-elemental beings: small, unnaturally light, with grayish-blue skin and floating wispy hair. They value focus above all—choosing a single pursuit and mastering it over decades. Their monasteries produce legendary scholars, healers, and martial artists.
- The humans of Vastilin are merchants, craftsmen, and laborers. They value practical results—food on the table, coin in the pocket, goods moving to market. They find Rhea contemplation baffling but respect Rhea skills.

### Economy

**Size**: Small-Medium

**Tech**: Mixed (Rhea scholarship + human craftsmanship)

**Primary Exports**: Education, healing services, scholarly texts, mountain herbs, refined metals

**Primary Imports**: Food (grain, vegetables), cloth, luxury goods, raw materials

- Eynmore's monasteries are famous across Tarkhon. Wealthy families send children to study there. The sick travel miles for Rhea healers. Scholars seek the ancient texts in Rhea archives. This brings money and prestige.
- Vastilin's merchants handle the practical side—buying, selling, transporting, storing. They manage Murth's trade relationships, provision the monasteries, and ensure the state doesn't starve.
- Mt. Arn produces iron and copper; Mt. Disyus produces rare alpine herbs and materials for magical work. Each mountain has what the other lacks.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Specialized

**Enrollment**: Professional (Vastilin guard) + Monastery defenders (Rhea martial monks)

- Murth has no large army. It relies on difficult terrain and Tarkhon's broader protection for security.
- Vastilin maintains a small professional guard (~500) for law enforcement and caravan protection.
- The Rhea monasteries train martial monks—not many, but those who dedicate decades to combat become extraordinarily dangerous. A single Rhea master can defeat a squad of ordinary soldiers.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Tarkhon, in the mountains west of Vogenfeld and northwest of the Kingdoms of Fire

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, high valleys, thin air at elevation

**Climate**: Cold, dry, with harsh winters at altitude

**Named Features**: Mt. Disyus (north), Mt. Arn (south), the Murthian Tunnels, Lake Stillwater (underground)

### Political Geography

**Dual Capitals**: Eynmore (Mt. Disyus) and Vastilin (Mt. Arn)

**Other Settlements**: Small mining camps, traveler's rest stations, scattered farms in the valleys

### Mt. Disyus and Eynmore

The northern mountain rises high enough that only Rhea find the air comfortable. Human visitors struggle to breathe, to think, to move. This natural barrier keeps Eynmore isolated—and the Rhea prefer it that way.

**Eynmore** is built into the mountain itself: monastery complexes carved from stone, meditation halls open to the sky, libraries that have collected knowledge for a thousand years. The architecture is elegant but austere—beauty in simplicity, function elevated to art.

Perhaps 8,000 Rhea live here, along with a handful of human servants and students hardy enough to adapt to the altitude. The population hasn't changed much in centuries. The Rhea don't need growth. They need focus.

The **High Contemplative** leads Eynmore—currently a Rhea named **Whisper-of-Still-Waters**, who has held the position for forty-seven years. She speaks rarely, thinks deeply, and has forgotten more about philosophy than most scholars ever learn.

### Mt. Arn and Vastilin

The southern mountain is lower, warmer, and richer in minerals. Humans settled here long before establishing contact with the Rhea—miners and traders who found the mountain's resources worth the isolation.

**Vastilin** sprawls across the mountain's southern slopes: a proper city with markets, warehouses, foundries, taverns, and all the mess that humans create. Perhaps 12,000 people live here, mostly human but with representatives of every race who find mountain commerce appealing.

The city is governed by the **Merchant Council**—seven wealthy families who control Vastilin's major industries. The current **First Merchant** is **Aldous Brennan**, a third-generation trader who inherited his position and has proven surprisingly competent.

### Lake Stillwater

Deep beneath both mountains lies **Lake Stillwater**—an underground lake fed by glacial melt, its waters unnaturally calm and clear. The lake is the key to Murth's existence.

A thousand years ago, Rhea from what would become Eynmore began carving tunnels down into Mt. Disyus, seeking water. They found Lake Stillwater—and discovered that humans had carved tunnels from the other direction for the same reason.

Rather than fight over the lake, they negotiated. The **Stillwater Compact** established shared access: both peoples could draw water, neither could pollute or restrict the source. To enforce this, they carved connecting tunnels.

Those tunnels changed everything. Suddenly two isolated mountain communities could trade, communicate, cooperate. Over centuries, this practical arrangement evolved into political union. Not because either side wanted unity—but because cutting off the tunnels meant cutting off the water.

### The Murthian Tunnels

Miles of passages connect Eynmore and Vastilin through the mountains' hearts, with Lake Stillwater at the center. The tunnels are:

- **Transportation**: The fastest route between the cities, passable even when surface passes are blocked by snow
- **Trade routes**: Goods flow through constantly—food going up to Eynmore, finished products coming down to Vastilin
- **Neutral ground**: The tunnels belong to neither city, governed by separate tunnel-wardens from both communities
- **Emergency refuge**: If either city were threatened, the population could evacuate through the tunnels

The tunnels also contain shrines, way stations, and the great **Chamber of the Compact** where the original agreement is carved into the living rock.

### The Dual Government

Major decisions affecting all of Murth require agreement between Eynmore and Vastilin. This means:

- The High Contemplative and the First Merchant must both approve
- Disputes go to the **Council of Two Mountains**—representatives from both cities meeting in the tunnel system
- Deadlocks can persist for years (the Rhea are patient; the humans are stubborn)

In practice, most matters are handled locally. Eynmore governs Eynmore; Vastilin governs Vastilin. Only questions of trade policy, foreign relations, and shared resources require joint decision.

This works... mostly. The cultural divide creates constant friction:

- Rhea think humans are impatient, shallow, and obsessed with money
- Humans think Rhea are slow, impractical, and disconnected from reality
- Both are right. Both need each other too much to split.

### The Cultural Divide

**What Rhea value:**
- Focus: Choose one thing and master it completely
- Patience: Decades of study before speaking with authority
- Contemplation: Understanding matters more than acting
- Simplicity: Possessions are distractions

**What Vastilin humans value:**
- Results: Does it work? Does it sell?
- Efficiency: Get it done, move on to the next thing
- Growth: More trade, more wealth, more influence
- Comfort: Life should be enjoyed, not merely endured

These values clash constantly. A Rhea teacher might spend thirty years training a single student. A Vastilin merchant might make thirty deals in a month. Neither understands why the other works that way.

And yet: Vastilin's merchants sell Eynmore's teaching. Eynmore's scholars heal Vastilin's sick. The arrangement works not despite the differences but because of them. Each provides what the other cannot.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Trade Imbalance**

Vastilin handles all of Murth's external trade—and takes a cut of everything. Eynmore produces valuable services (education, healing) but Vastilin controls how those services reach the market.

Some Rhea argue this is exploitation. Some humans argue they're just being practical. The tension simmers without resolution.

**The Altitude Question**

Vastilin's population is growing; Eynmore's isn't. More humans means more pressure on shared resources—especially water from Lake Stillwater. Some in Eynmore worry that eventually Vastilin will simply outnumber them into irrelevance.

**The Plains of Oblivion**

Northwest of Murth lie the **Plains of Oblivion**—cursed grasslands that erase memories. The plains creep closer some years, retreat others. No one knows why.

Queen Eranes rules from her palace **Satyrn Gray** somewhere in those plains—a half-titan who enchanted herself to forget a lost love. She's immensely powerful and unpredictable. Murth tries not to attract her attention.

**The Tarkhon Question**

Murth is technically part of Tarkhon, paying tribute to Tarkhetan. But it's far from the strait, produces no strategic resources, and mostly gets left alone.

Some in Vastilin want closer ties to Tarkhon—more trade, more protection, more integration. Some in Eynmore want further distance—less interference, less entanglement, less of everything. The debate continues.

### Notable Figures

**Whisper-of-Still-Waters** (High Contemplative of Eynmore)
An ancient Rhea who has led Eynmore for forty-seven years. She speaks perhaps a dozen words a day, each chosen with care. Her silences communicate more than most people's speeches.

**Aldous Brennan** (First Merchant of Vastilin)
Forty-three years old, inherited his position, but has earned respect through competent administration. He genuinely wants what's best for Murth—he just defines "best" in commercial terms.

**Master Stonefist** (Martial monk of Eynmore)
A Rhea who has spent sixty years mastering unarmed combat. He's old, small, light as a feather—and could kill any ten soldiers who challenged him. He trains the monastery's defenders and occasionally takes students from outside.

**Sera Coldwell** (Tunnel-Warden)
A human woman who oversees the central tunnel network. Nominally neutral, practically essential. She knows every passage, every shortcut, every secret. Both cities trust her—which means neither fully trusts her.

### History

**The Founding (~1000+ years ago)**: Rhea settle Mt. Disyus; humans settle Mt. Arn. Both communities dig for water. Both find Lake Stillwater.

**The Stillwater Compact**: Rather than fight, the communities negotiate shared access. Connecting tunnels are carved.

**The Slow Integration**: Over centuries, trade and cooperation create interdependence. Political union follows economic reality.

**The Tarkhon Era**: Murth becomes part of the growing Tarkhon Empire, trading autonomy for access to broader markets and nominal protection.

**The Present**: Murth continues its strange dual existence—two peoples, two cultures, two mountains, one state. The arrangement works. Mostly.

## Myastor

Tags: state

Very poor. Once shared governance among the three Ofrenian kingdoms; post-fragmentation, it was granted to the Queen of Sylke. Alisandra sees it as a dump and uses it for political prisoners and unofficial exile.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Colonial administration (under Sylke)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Survival, keeping one's head down, minding one's business

- Myastor is ruled by a governor appointed by Queen Alisandra—always someone she wants out of her sight but not quite dead.
- The population is a mix of longtime residents, transported criminals, political exiles, and people who ended up here by accident and never left.
- No one chooses to live in Myastor. You're born here, sent here, or stranded here. Leaving requires money, connections, or both.
- The locals have developed a grim solidarity. Everyone has a past they don't discuss. Questions about how someone arrived are deeply rude.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Lumber, transshipment services

**Primary Imports**: Prisoners, everything else

- Myastor's economy is almost entirely based on its position. Ships stopping on the way to Sylke need provisions, repairs, and places to offload inconvenient cargo. The island provides all three.
- Lots of money flows through Myastor; almost none of it stays. Merchants arrive, conduct business, and leave. The locals see wealth pass by but can't capture it.
- Lumber from the interior provides some legitimate export, but the forests are thinning and no one invests in replanting.
- The prison economy is grimly important. Feeding, housing, and guarding prisoners employs a significant fraction of the population. When prisoner shipments slow, the whole island feels it.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (desperate)

- The garrison exists to guard prisoners and discourage pirates. It's understaffed, poorly equipped, and stationed here as punishment.
- Sylke's navy calls at Shipton regularly, which provides actual security. The local garrison is largely for show.
- Prison guards are technically military but function more like jailers. The distinction matters to no one except payroll clerks.

### Geography

**Location**: Paluva Amati island, in the Ofrenia Passage east of Ofrenia proper

**Biomes**: Scrubland, thinning forests, rocky coasts

**Named Entities**: Paluva Amati (island name)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Small streams, no significant bodies of water

**Adjacent Waters**: The Ofrenia Passage, the Middle Sea

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Shipton

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: Shipton, Telara, Partsmouth, Pasterton

**Villages**: Scattered fishing and lumber camps

### Primary Conflicts

**The Exile Economy**

Myastor's prosperity—such as it is—depends on Alisandra continuing to send prisoners and exiles. If she conquers Joswik and runs out of political enemies, the island's economy collapses. The governor privately hopes the war drags on forever.

**The Prison Population**

The prisoners outnumber the guards, and everyone knows it. The system works because escape from the island is nearly impossible and because the prisoners include many who've simply given up. But as conditions deteriorate and new arrivals bring fresh grievances, the balance grows more precarious.

**The Sylke Relationship**

Myastor exists at Alisandra's sufferance. The queen sees it as a dumping ground, not a priority. Requests for resources, personnel, or attention go unanswered. The governor has learned to manage without support—but in a crisis, no help is coming.

**The Passing Trade**

Merchants who stop in Shipton could bring prosperity if they stayed. They don't. The locals resent being treated as a waystation, but lack leverage to change anything. Some have begun exploring ways to make Myastor more attractive—or more necessary—to passing ships.

### History

Paluva Amati was settled generations ago as a waystation for ships crossing the Passage. The three Ofrenian kingdoms shared governance, using the island as neutral ground for negotiations and as a convenient place to warehouse people they'd rather forget.

When the old king died and his children divided Ofrenia, no one wanted Myastor. Tornia had enough ports. Joswik had no navy to speak of. Sylke needed a place to send problems. Alisandra claimed it by default, and her siblings were happy to let her.

Under Alisandra's rule, Myastor has become a dumping ground. Political prisoners fill the old warehouses-turned-prisons. Nobles who annoyed the queen find themselves "governing" the island until they die of boredom or despair. The locals have adapted, building an economy around human misery.

The conquest of Tornia has actually benefited Myastor slightly—refugee ships stop here, desperate for supplies and willing to pay premium prices. But the governor knows this prosperity is temporary. Once Alisandra consolidates her gains, the refugee flow will stop, and Myastor will return to its role as a place the world forgets.

## Myorna

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Monarchy (compromised)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Sivakr (Silver Elves)

**Population**: 60,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Mental superiority, memory, influence, secrecy

- Sivakr are gray-skinned elves who spent thousands of years underground. Physical exercise is considered vulgar—status comes entirely from mental acuity and influence.
- Mind manipulation on each other is strictly forbidden, but totally permitted on outsiders, who are viewed as beneath them.
- King Thyolinor nominally rules, but he is being mind-controlled by a breakaway faction within Myorna. The terrorist attacks on neighboring states are state-sanctioned but officially denied.

### Culture

**Memory Manipulation**

The Sivakr can alter memories—a terrifying ability that defines their society. Memory duels settle disputes between equals: both parties interlock fingers and attempt to convince the other they made a mistake in accepting the challenge. Must have a witness.

**Memory Libraries**

Influential households maintain memory libraries—expensive repositories containing preserved memories of historical figures, important events, and cultural traditions. These are status symbols and sources of power.

**Memory Art**

Freeze-frames of memories, rendered visible. The best artists have extraordinary recall. Memory art galleries are prestigious cultural institutions.

**Paper Control**

Paper is highly cherished and was historically used to control the population—records, contracts, debts. The poor, lacking access to paper, couldn't be tracked or controlled as effectively. Now some are using this gap to free themselves from the system.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Memory art, Deoric knowledge (secretly), silver, mountain goods

**Primary Imports**: Food, surface goods, paper

- Members of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though this membership is increasingly strained as neighbors discover the truth about Sivakr abilities.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: High (terrifying)

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- The Myornan military is small but potentially devastating. Sivakr soldiers can manipulate enemy memories mid-battle—making soldiers forget their training, forget which side they're on, forget they were ever in danger.
- Most Sivakr consider physical combat vulgar, so the military is composed of those willing to dirty themselves for the state.

### Geography

**Location**: Southern slopes of the Kharvorn Mountains, specifically the Grey Mountains sub-range. Borders Camaran (southeast), Erasnus (southwest), barely touches Hephake (northwest).

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, deep valleys, underground complexes

**Climate**: Alpine—cold, harsh winters, brief summers

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Vad Ilghak

**Cities**: Vad Ilghak, Urkhuk

**Towns**: Scattered mountain settlements, many with entrances to the underground warrens

### The Forbidden Valley

North of Vad Ilghak lies the Forbidden Valley—a massive, impossibly deep chasm in the mountains. At its bottom, the Sivakr keep a **chained giant**, from whom they extract consistent blood sacrifices. This blood powers all Sivakr mind magic.

A massive statue of **Tiira**, their patron goddess, overlooks the valley. The Sivakr cultivated Tiira as a savior figure for their people—but the truth is darker. They effectively brainwashed their own goddess into serving Myornan interests. Even their god is a victim of their manipulation.

### The Deoric Library

Vad Ilghak houses a massive library of **Deoric spellbooks**—texts of secret, sacrifice-based magic. This knowledge is closely guarded but represents one of the largest collections of Deoric lore in existence. Outsiders who learn of it would be horrified.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Breakaway Faction**

A faction within Myorna has seized control of King Thyolinor through mind manipulation. They are directing terrorist attacks against neighboring states while the king officially denies involvement. The faction's goals are unclear—perhaps they want war, perhaps they want Myorna driven back underground, perhaps something worse.

**Neighbor Relations**

Discoveries about Sivakr memory manipulation have made every neighbor hostile. The Trade Alliance members tolerated Myorna for access to silver and mountain goods, but the terrorist attacks are pushing them toward breaking ties entirely. Erasnus is trying to hold things together; everyone else wants Myorna out.

**Internal Division**

Many Sivakr want to return underground. The surface has brought nothing but conflict and exposure. Others—particularly those near the Erasnun border—have begun assimilating into surface culture and want to stay. The kingdom is splitting.

**The Stone Slums**

The poor of Myorna, concentrated in the Stone Slums (foggy, flat, slate-built districts), are increasingly ungovernable. Without paper records, they slip through the system. This is where golems were first discovered and built—desperate people finding desperate solutions.

### History

Thousands of years ago, the Sivakr were driven underground by other elves. In the darkness, they developed their memory manipulation abilities and cultivated Tiira as their goddess—though "cultivated" may mean something more sinister than worship.

Fifty years ago, King Thyolinor decided to bring his people to the surface and engage with the wider world. They joined the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. Relations were tenuous from the start—outsiders found the Sivakr unsettling even before they understood why.

Now the truth is emerging. The terrorist attacks have been traced back to Myorna. Neighbors are learning what memory manipulation really means. The Alliance is fracturing. And somewhere in the Forbidden Valley, a giant bleeds to fuel it all.

## Nashua

Tags: state, lizardfolk, innerrim

The poison country. Nashua survives not through expansion or conquest but through being too costly to take. For generations, the Ix'Vasyla have held this toxic marshland against enemies on two fronts, turning their hostile environment into a weapon and their venomous nature into military doctrine. Every invading army learns the same lesson: Nashua can be entered, but not held. The marshes take what the legions cannot.

Where Gorath represents aggressive expansion and imperial ambition, Nashua represents something older and grimmer: survival at any cost, victory through attrition, and the patient certainty that enemies who enter the marshes will not leave.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Clan confederation with war council

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ix'Vasyla (dominant), Sylthik (minority), Humans (integrated)

**Population**: ~150,000

**Stability**: Stable (internally); perpetual war (externally)

**Core Values**: Patience, cunning, clan loyalty, territorial defense, pragmatic ruthlessness

#### The Council of Fang and Scale

Nashua is not ruled by a single leader. The Ix'Vasyla organize into clans, each controlling territory within the marshes, and those clans send representatives to the **Council of Fang and Scale** in Tirexonos. The Council coordinates the endless war effort, mediates inter-clan disputes, and handles what passes for foreign policy.

Council seats are earned through demonstrated tactical success. A clan leader who wins battles efficiently—maximum enemy casualties, minimum Ix'Vasyla losses—gains voice and influence. One who wastes warriors on failed offensives loses standing, sometimes permanently. This creates a government optimized for defensive warfare: cautious, patient, and relentlessly focused on cost-benefit analysis.

The Council has no single head. Decisions require consensus among the major clans, which can make the government slow to act on anything not directly war-related. But when war is the constant state of existence, this limitation matters less than it might seem.

#### The Hunt-Masters

Below the Council, military operations are coordinated by **Hunt-Masters**—veteran warriors who have proven themselves across multiple campaigns. Hunt-Masters command no standing forces; instead, they recruit from clan warriors for specific operations, return those warriors when the operation concludes, and then plan the next strike.

This distributed command structure makes Nashua's military difficult to decapitate. Kill a Hunt-Master, and another rises. Destroy a war-band, and the clans simply form another. There is no general whose death ends the war, no army whose defeat opens the country.

#### Clan Society

Everything in Ix'Vasyla life flows through the clan. Birth, training, mating, territory, honor—all are clan matters first, individual matters second. Clan territories are inviolable except in war emergency; clan disputes are resolved through ritualized contests that rarely result in death (warriors are too valuable to waste on internal conflict).

The major clans each hold territory in the central marshes and maintain family compounds in Tirexonos. Lesser clans hold smaller territories or serve in subordinate roles to greater ones. Clanless Ix'Vasyla exist—exiles, criminals, the rare survivors of destroyed clans—but they occupy the margins of society, taking work no clan warrior would accept.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (specialized)

**Primary Exports**: Alchemical ingredients, exotic venoms, marsh-harvested reagents

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, textiles, preserved foods

#### The Poison Trade

Nashua's economy runs on toxins. The marshes produce an extraordinary variety of venomous creatures, poisonous plants, and alchemically useful compounds found nowhere else on Alaria. Properly harvested and processed, these resources command premium prices from alchemists, assassins, and researchers across the continent.

The **Arcane Consortium of Nashua** handles much of this trade, serving as intermediary between the clans who harvest the resources and the foreign buyers who want them. The Consortium takes a percentage; the clans get access to markets they couldn't reach alone.

#### Subsistence and Survival

Beyond the poison trade, Nashua's economy is primarily subsistence-based. The marshes provide fish, waterfowl, and edible plants for those who know how to find them. The river corridor supports limited agriculture, worked primarily by the human population. Metal is scarce and must be imported or scavenged from dead enemies.

This economic limitation shapes Nashuan military doctrine. They cannot afford prolonged campaigns that consume resources faster than they're replaced. Every arrow, every blade, every warrior represents an investment that must pay off. Gorathi-style attritional warfare would bankrupt Nashua in a generation—so they make sure Gorath pays the attrition instead.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all Ix'Vasyla train for war)

#### Doctrine of Patient Death

Nashuan military doctrine is simple: never fight fair, never fight directly, never fight when you can poison instead.

Every engagement begins with preparation—scouts mapping enemy positions, warriors pre-positioning along ambush routes, poison applied to water sources and food supplies. When the enemy moves, they move into kill zones. When they camp, they camp in poisoned ground. When they retreat, they're hunted.

The Ix'Vasyla's venomous bite is central to this doctrine. A warrior who delivers a single bite and escapes has effectively killed that enemy—the venom will do the rest over the following days. Wounded enemies become liabilities for their comrades, consuming resources and spreading demoralization as they die screaming.

#### Clan War-Bands

Nashua maintains no standing army. Instead, each clan provides warriors when the Council calls, organized into **war-bands** under Hunt-Master command. A typical war-band numbers fifty to two hundred warriors, assembled for a specific campaign and disbanded afterward.

This flexibility has advantages: war-bands can be tailored to specific missions, warriors retain clan bonds and local knowledge, and there's no expensive permanent military to maintain. The disadvantage is coordination—large-scale operations require negotiations between multiple clans, each jealous of their warriors' lives and honor.

#### The River Fleet

Nashua's small navy—really more a collection of armed boats—patrols the Jiji and its tributaries, protects coastal waters, and raids enemy shipping when opportunity presents. The vessels are shallow-draft, easily hidden, and crewed by warriors who can fight equally well on deck or underwater.

The fleet's primary role is defensive: preventing enemies from using the rivers as invasion routes. But it occasionally conducts offensive operations, striking Gorathi coastal positions or intercepting supply ships in the waters south of the Deserted Hills.

### Geography

**Location**: Eastern Inner Rim

**Biomes**: Toxic marshland (dominant), river valleys, coastal scrubland

**Named Regions**: The Toxic Marshes, The River Corridor, The Southern Scrublands

**Rivers**: Jiji River, Torin Creek

**Adjacent Waters**: Eastern coastal seas

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tirexonos

**Major Towns**: Vosx, Hyobinii, Sipokno, Dolno Jelovce, Nikolici, Poyux

**Lesser Settlements**: Kisava, Lukshax, Sviniste

### Relations

**Gorath**: Active war, decades-long stalemate. The Deserted Hills mark the contested border. Nashua views Gorath as an existential threat; Gorath views Nashua as an inconvenient obstacle to expansion. Neither can defeat the other; neither will make peace.

**Trømgar**: Active war, ritualized conflict. The dwarves raid highland approaches; the Ix'Vasyla raid mountain settlements. Neither side can invade the other's core territory. The conflict has become almost traditional—both sides seem to fight because they always have, not because victory is possible.

**Kyagos**: Complicated. The Sylthik homeland lies to the southeast, and Nashua's Sylthik minority maintains ties there. The relationship is neither alliance nor enmity—a wary coexistence between peoples who share scaled nature but little else.

**Everyone Else**: Nashua has few friends and many enemies. Their reputation as poisoners, ambushers, and merciless hunters makes them poor diplomatic partners. Trade happens through intermediaries; alliances don't happen at all.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Gorath War**: The primary existential threat. Gorath's resources dwarf Nashua's; only the terrain and Ix'Vasyla defensive doctrine have prevented conquest. If Gorath ever commits its full strength—unlikely given their other fronts—Nashua might fall.

- **The Trømgar Raids**: A constant drain on northern settlements, but manageable. The dwarves cannot take the marshes; the Ix'Vasyla cannot take the mountains. An eternal standoff.

- **Internal Clan Tensions**: The major clans compete for influence on the Council. These competitions are usually ritualized and non-lethal, but resentments simmer. A major military defeat could shatter the clan consensus that holds Nashua together.

### History

The Ix'Vasyla have inhabited the toxic marshlands since before recorded history. When human settlers arrived along the rivers—the ancestors of today's integrated population—the lizardfolk were already ancient.

Early conflicts between humans and Ix'Vasyla ended predictably: the marshes swallowed the invaders. Eventually, a pragmatic accommodation emerged. Humans who submitted to Ix'Vasyla authority were permitted to live, work, and trade. Those who resisted joined the nutrients feeding the marsh ecology.

The wars with Gorath and Trømgar are more recent—centuries old rather than millennia. As both neighboring powers expanded, they encountered Nashua's borders and decided to push through. They're still pushing. They're still failing.

### Culture

#### The Hunt

Ix'Vasyla culture centers on the hunt—the patient stalking, the perfect strike, the kill. This isn't metaphor; it's literal. Every Ix'Vasyla, male or female, is trained from hatching to hunt. The skills transfer directly to warfare: patience, stealth, reading terrain, delivering death efficiently.

Successful hunts are celebrated; failed hunts are analyzed for lessons. The greatest hunters earn prestige that translates to political influence. The worst hunters are relegated to support roles—still valuable, but not honored.

#### Patience as Virtue

The Ix'Vasyla concept of **szrilketh** (roughly "the waiting strike") pervades their culture. Szrilketh is the art of perfect timing—knowing when to act and when to wait, accepting discomfort now for advantage later. A warrior who strikes too soon wastes effort; one who strikes too late misses opportunity. Szrilketh is striking at the precise moment when effort yields maximum result.

This philosophy makes the Ix'Vasyla maddening opponents. They don't respond to provocation. They don't take bait. They wait, and watch, and when they finally move, it's because they've identified the exact moment of maximum advantage.

#### Death and Memory

The Ix'Vasyla don't fear death—they fear meaningless death. A warrior who dies achieving an objective is honored; one who dies uselessly is pitied. The worst fate is to die having accomplished nothing, to have wasted the clan's investment in training and equipping a warrior.

The honored dead are consumed by their clan-kin in ritual meals. The Ix'Vasyla believe this transfers the dead warrior's essence to the living, strengthening the clan. Foreign observers find this practice horrifying; the Ix'Vasyla find foreign burial practices wasteful.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Poison Scholars**: The Arcane Consortium maintains scholarly interests that extend beyond mere commerce. Their bounty on Yegnoth information suggests research into planar phenomena. What are they actually studying in those marsh laboratories?

**The Human Question**: Nashua's integrated humans occupy an ambiguous position—not enslaved, but not equal. Some advocate for expanding human rights; others see humans as useful tools that shouldn't forget their place. A charismatic human leader could destabilize this balance.

**The Sylthik Temples**: The serpent-folk's religious activities in Dolno Jelovce remain opaque to outsiders. They worship Sythikranos and await her return—but what does that mean for Nashua when/if the serpent goddess awakens?

**Clan Fractures**: The Council holds because external threats demand unity. But old grudges fester beneath the surface. A major defeat—or a major victory that ends one of the wars—could unleash generations of suppressed inter-clan conflict.

**The Southern Vulnerability**: The scrublands are Nashua's weak point. If Gorath ever committed to a sustained campaign there, accepting the casualties needed to push through, they might break into the river corridor. Some in Tirexonos argue for preemptive action; others counsel patience. The debate continues as Gorathi patrols probe ever closer.

## Nektuna

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal monarchy with merchant influence

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (dominant), Craven (massive population)

**Secondary Inhabitants**: Dwarblin, Trollkin, Ayblek

**Transient**: Weblin traders

**Population**: ~400,000 (Tarkhetan alone: ~120,000)

**Stability**: Stable but tense

**Core Values**: Wealth, power, prestige, naval supremacy, the eternal flame

- Nektuna is the imperial heartland of Tarkhon, ruled by **King Selron II** from the capital of **Tarkhetan**. His authority is theoretically absolute, but in practice he navigates a web of noble factions, merchant interests, and military commanders.
- The state is dominated by humans, but Craven make up perhaps a third of the population—laborers, sailors, soldiers, and increasingly merchants in their own right. Tensions between human and Craven communities simmer constantly but rarely boil over.
- Smaller populations of dwarblin (dwarven-goblin hybrids), trollkin, and even ayblek add to Nektuna's cosmopolitan character. Weblin traders pass through regularly, their caravans a common sight in Tarkhetan's markets.
- Nektuna is wealthy beyond measure but also paranoid. Everyone wants what they have. Every ally is a potential enemy. Every smile hides a knife.

### Economy

**Size**: Massive

**Tech**: Advanced (maritime, financial, magical)

**Primary Exports**: Services (shipping, banking, insurance), fire magic, luxury goods

**Primary Imports**: Everything (as intermediary)

- Nektuna doesn't produce much—it *taxes* production. Every ship through the strait pays tariffs. Every merchant using Tarkhon roads pays tolls. Every trader wanting access to Tarkhon markets pays fees.
- The great merchant houses of Tarkhetan have made fortunes not by making things but by financing those who do. They insure ships, lend money to kingdoms, and take a cut of every transaction they touch.
- **Besnoumeru**, Nektuna's second city, sits on a time leyline. Its merchants can anticipate market changes before they happen—a massive advantage that has made the city almost as wealthy as the capital.
- This economy is entirely dependent on controlling the strait. If an alternative route opened, Nektuna would collapse within a generation.

### Military

**Size**: Large (navy-focused)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Professional with conscription reserves

- Nektuna maintains the most powerful navy in the region. Ships that refuse to pay are sunk. Pirates are hunted relentlessly. The sea lanes are safe—for those who pay.
- The **Firemage Corps** is Nektuna's elite military asset. Born on the fire leyline that runs through Tarkhetan, these mages can burn ships from a mile away. A single firemage on the walls can destroy an entire fleet.
- The army is smaller but professional, used primarily to garrison fortresses and project power into troublesome territories.
- Conscription can raise large reserves in emergencies, drawing from the Craven population especially.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Tarkhon, controlling both shores of the Needle (the strait's narrowest point)

**Biomes**: Temperate coastland, Mediterranean hills, island territories

**Climate**: Warm Mediterranean—mild winters, hot summers

**Named Features**: The Needle (narrowest strait point), Tarkhetan (capital), Besnoumeru (time-leyline city), Pyris Island

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tarkhetan

**Major Cities**: Besnoumeru

**Controlled Territories**: Pyris Island, Astrelle (vassal state)

**Fortresses**: Torsnerhun (across the Needle), Fort Tenze (Pyris, ruined)

### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire and seat of King Selron II.

Tarkhetan is a city of extremes. Gleaming palaces rise beside rotting slums. Merchant princes who could buy kingdoms walk streets where beggars die unnoticed. The harbor never sleeps—ships arrive and depart at all hours, their cargoes taxed, inspected, and sent onward.

The city is built on a series of hills overlooking the Needle, the narrowest point of the strait. From the palace walls, you can see clear across to Torsnerhun fortress on the opposite shore. Between them, nothing passes without Tarkhetan's permission.

**The Old City** occupies the highest hills—noble estates, the royal palace, the great cathedral where the Evertorch burns. Here the wealthy live behind high walls, attended by servants and protected by private guards.

**The Middle City** spreads across the lower slopes—merchant houses, guild halls, respectable taverns, the homes of successful craftsmen. This is where business happens, where deals are made, where fortunes rise and fall.

**The Waterfront** sprawls along the harbor—warehouses, shipyards, sailor's taverns, brothels, and the cramped tenements where workers live. Craven make up the majority here. The smell of fish, tar, and humanity mingles with salt air.

**The Undercity** exists in the spaces between—tunnels, cellars, forgotten passages. Smugglers, thieves, and those who want to disappear find their way here. The city guard doesn't patrol the Undercity. Some say things live down there that have never seen the sun.

### The Evertorch

In the great cathedral at Tarkhetan's heart burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting over six centuries ago.

The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing eternal dominion and unbroken continuity. Emperors are crowned in its light. The most binding oaths are sworn before it. Ritual magic of time and fire occurs at its shrine.

What most humans have forgotten—or choose not to remember—is that the Evertorch is a **Neferati creation**. The same tradition of eternal flames that burns in the Kingdoms of Fire. Lit by Neferati hands, sustained by Neferati magic.

The Neferati remember.

### The Fire Leyline

A leyline of fire runs directly through Tarkhetan, its power concentrated beneath the Old City. Children born here sometimes manifest fire attunement—and those who do are claimed by the **Firemage Corps**.

The Corps is both military asset and political faction. Firemages are trained from childhood in the Citadel of Flames, emerging as weapons of terrifying power. A single trained firemage can burn a ship to the waterline from the city walls. A squad of them can destroy a fleet.

This makes the Corps essential to Nektuna's defense—and dangerously influential in its politics. The **Pyremaster**, who commands the Corps, holds a seat on the king's council. Wise rulers keep the firemages loyal. Foolish ones learn why the previous dynasty fell.

### Besnoumeru

Nektuna's second city, built where a **time leyline** surfaces. Besnoumeru is almost as wealthy as Tarkhetan—not from controlling trade, but from predicting it.

Merchants born on the time leyline sometimes develop a peculiar gift: they sense market changes before they happen. Not prophecy exactly—more like an instinct for when to buy and when to sell, when ships will arrive, when prices will shift. The **Oracle Merchants** of Besnoumeru have made fortunes from this gift.

The city is quieter than Tarkhetan, more orderly, with an almost eerie sense of calm. The merchants here don't rush—they already know what's coming.

### Pyris Island

A moderate-sized island southwest of the strait, technically part of Nektuna. Pyris is home to an old population—humans who've interbred with dwarves over centuries, producing a stocky, hardy folk who mostly want to be left alone.

The Pyrisi are farmers and fishers, content with their simple lives. They pay their taxes, send their young to serve in the navy, and try not to attract attention from the capital.

**Fort Tenze**, on the island's eastern coast, guards a secondary chokepoint—not as critical as the Needle, but significant. The fortress has been in ruins for nearly three centuries, ever since the Severance.

### Fort Tenze: The Cursed Fortress

Fort Tenze was a functioning fortress until the **Severance**—the event that ended direct Neferati rule of Tarkhon.

When the last Neferati-blooded emperor died without clear heir, the succession war that followed was brutal. Fort Tenze's garrison chose the wrong side. When the victors came to take the fortress, something went wrong.

The details are disputed. Some say the garrison's firemages lost control during the final assault. Others say Neferati loyalists performed some desperate ritual. What's certain is that the fortress burned—not normal fire, but something that left the stones themselves wrong. Twisted. The flames were extinguished, but the wrongness remained.

Three times since, the crown has ordered Fort Tenze rebuilt. Three times, the workers suffered: accidents, disappearances, madness. Equipment failed. Stones wouldn't set properly. Workers reported whispers, figures in their peripheral vision, dreams of burning.

Now the fortress sits empty. The Pyrisi avoid it. The crown has stopped trying. Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, though even they don't stay long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

### King Selron II

The current ruler of the Tarkhon Empire, forty-three years old and in the seventeenth year of his reign.

Selron is intelligent, cautious, and deeply aware of how precarious his position is. He inherited a stable empire and has worked to keep it that way—managing the noble factions, maintaining the trade relationships, avoiding the wars that would drain the treasury.

His critics call him weak, indecisive, a king who rules by compromise rather than command. His supporters call him wise, patient, a king who understands that Tarkhon's strength is wealth, not war.

**Appearance**: Average height, running to fat in middle age. Brown hair going gray. Shrewd eyes that miss nothing. Dresses simply by royal standards—he prefers to seem approachable.

**Family**: Married to Queen Vethira of Astrelle (a political match that secured the vassal state). Three children: Prince Hathan (19, the heir), Princess Lyselle (16), Prince Doran (12).

**Governing style**: Selron rules through his council, balancing factions against each other. He rarely makes dramatic pronouncements, preferring to let decisions emerge through negotiation. This makes him seem weak but keeps anyone from becoming strong enough to threaten him.

**Greatest fear**: That the Kingdoms of Fire will remember they have a better claim to the Evertorch than he does.

### The Royal Council

Selron governs through a council of powerful figures, each representing a major interest:

**Lord Gavren Holt** — Master of Coin. Controls the treasury and has the merchant houses' ear. Fat, jolly, and ruthless about money.

**Admiral Kessa Thorn** — Commander of the Fleet. The navy is her domain. Respected by sailors, feared by pirates, and dangerously popular with the common folk.

**Pyremaster Valdros Kaine** — Commander of the Firemage Corps. Gaunt, intense, speaks rarely. When he does speak, people listen. The Corps' loyalty to him is absolute.

**Lord Armund Castor** — Warden of the Marches. Responsible for land defenses, including the fortresses. Old military family, traditional values, suspicious of anything that smells like change.

**High Priestess Salenne** — Keeper of the Evertorch. Leads the cathedral clergy. Her authority is religious, but in Tarkhon, the Evertorch is politics. She knows more secrets than anyone.

**Duchess Ysmera of Astrelle** — Speaks for the vassal state. Also the queen's aunt. Navigates the awkward position of representing Astrelle while her niece is married to its overlord.

### The Neferati Legacy

Six centuries ago, Tarkhon was founded by **Neferati conquerors** who understood that controlling the Needle meant controlling trade. They brought fire magic, the tradition of eternal flames, and the military power to seize the strait.

For nearly three centuries, Tarkhon was ruled by Neferati emperors or their descendants. They lit the Evertorch. They established the Firemage Corps. They built the foundations of everything that makes Tarkhon powerful.

But the Neferati line diluted over generations. Marriages to local humans, the practicalities of ruling a diverse population, the slow drift of blood and culture. By the end, the "Neferati" emperors were mostly human—fire-touched, perhaps, but not truly of the flame.

The **Severance** came when Emperor Valdric III died without legitimate heir. His children by his Neferati mistress were passed over for his nephew—fully human, with no fire in his blood. The Neferati faction resisted. The war that followed was brief but vicious.

The human faction won. The remaining pure Neferati withdrew to the Kingdoms of Fire. The Evertorch stayed—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish. But its keepers changed.

This is why the Kingdoms of Fire stay in the empire despite having the power to leave. They don't see themselves as tributaries—they see themselves as founders in exile. The Evertorch is theirs. Tarkhon is theirs. The humans just haven't realized it yet.

And someday, perhaps, the fire will remember who lit it.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Succession Question**

Prince Hathan is heir, but he's untested and some say weak. Princess Lyselle is sharper, more ambitious—and some whisper she'd make a better ruler. Selron is healthy, but he's not young. The factions are already positioning for what comes next.

**The Firemage Problem**

Pyremaster Valdros is loyal—for now. But the Corps' power has grown over generations, and some fear what happens when a less scrupulous Pyremaster takes command. The firemages could make or break any succession crisis.

**The Neferati Shadow**

The Kingdoms of Fire have been patient for three centuries. But patience isn't infinite. If the right opportunity arose—a succession crisis, a military defeat, a weakened throne—they might remember their claim. High Priestess Salenne has noticed certain Neferati ambassadors spending a lot of time in the cathedral, studying the Evertorch's flames.

**The Naval Rivalry**

Admiral Kessa is popular. Too popular. Selron needs the navy, but he also fears what happens if Kessa decides she wants more than command of a fleet. For now, she seems content with her ships. But ambition has a way of growing.

**Fort Tenze**

The cursed fortress is embarrassing. A functional Fort Tenze would significantly strengthen the western approaches. But every attempt to rebuild has failed. Some on the council want to try again. Others say the cost isn't worth the risk. And some whisper that certain parties benefit from the fortress staying ruined...

### Vassal: Astrelle

Astrelle was absorbed into Nektuna's orbit two centuries ago—peacefully, through a combination of marriage alliances and economic pressure. The current arrangement makes Astrelle a vassal state: self-governing in internal matters but subordinate to Tarkhetan in foreign policy and defense.

Astrelle hosts two critical fortresses: **Torsnerhun** (directly across the Needle from Tarkhetan) and **Sharvatunis** (watching the eastern approach). This makes Astrelle strategically vital—and gives its duchess leverage she wouldn't otherwise have.

Duchess Ysmera walks a careful line: loyal enough to keep Tarkhetan happy, independent enough to maintain Astrelle's dignity. Her niece's marriage to the king complicates things. Is she family or subject? Both, and the tension never quite resolves.

### History

**The Founding (~600 years ago)**: Neferati warlords seize the Needle, establishing control over the strait. The Evertorch is lit in what will become Tarkhetan.

**The Neferati Era (~600-300 years ago)**: Neferati emperors rule from Tarkhetan, expanding the empire through trade dominance rather than conquest. The Firemage Corps is established. Besnoumeru rises on its time leyline.

**The Dilution (~400-300 years ago)**: Neferati bloodlines mix with human through generations of political marriages. The ruling family becomes increasingly human—fire-touched perhaps, but not truly of the flame.

**The Severance (~300 years ago)**: The last fire-blooded emperor dies. Succession war between human and Neferati factions. Humans win. Pure Neferati withdraw to the Kingdoms of Fire. Fort Tenze is destroyed in the conflict. The Evertorch stays—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish.

**The Human Era (~300 years ago - present)**: Human dynasties rule, maintaining the traditions and symbols of Neferati founders while slowly forgetting their origins. Emperors become kings. The Kingdoms of Fire remain within the empire, waiting.

**The Present**: King Selron II maintains stability through careful balance. But the old tensions remain—Neferati legacy, naval ambitions, firemage power, and the eternal question of succession.

Huge chunk of population is fire attuned. Steam mages, geysers, etc. 

Underwater volcanic activity dots the area.

## Phiora

Tags: state, major island

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Fraternal monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Verucan (fire dwarves)

**Population**: 40,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Humor, wit, passion, smithing, craftsmanship

- The Verucan are fire dwarves—obsidian-black skin with glowing red veins that pulse with inner heat. Born from volcanic forges, they built their civilization within active volcanoes, harnessing geothermal energy.
- Like volcanoes, the Verucan are complacent most of the time, but will occasionally begin to bubble beneath the surface, only to explode with fiery temper at some unexpected moment. Their loves burn as hot as their hatreds.
- Phiora is ruled by siblings under a fraternal monarchy. The elder sibling has more executive power, but when succession comes, it passes to the children of the younger sibling. This unusual arrangement prevents power from concentrating in one branch and forces the ruling siblings to cooperate—or at least to limit their conflicts.
- Despite being master weaponsmiths, the Verucan are surprisingly non-militaristic. They view anger as a sacred flame that drives innovation and excellence in craft, not conquest.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Weapons, metalwork, volcanic glass, geothermal crafts

**Primary Imports**: Food, timber, textiles

- The forges of Mount Kajiit produce weapons of exceptional quality. Phioran steel is sought across the Middle Sea, and wealthy warriors pay premium prices for blades tempered in volcanic fire.
- The island's volcanic soil is poor for farming, and the Verucan have little interest in agriculture. They import most of their food in exchange for metalwork.
- The economy runs hot and cold, matching Verucan temperament. Production surges during periods of inspiration; work slows when the collective mood turns contemplative.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Despite being expert weapon craftsmen, the Phioran populace is largely non-militaristic. Most have never fought in a war. They make the tools of war; others use them.
- Verucan generally dislike the sea—something about the cold water conflicts with their fiery nature. The Phioran navy is pitiful, barely sufficient to patrol local waters.
- Defense relies on geography. The caldera of Mount Kajiit is virtually impregnable, and any invader would have to fight uphill through volcanic terrain against defenders who know every tunnel and lava flow.

### Geography

**Location**: Pii Island, in the Forgotten Sea east of the Ofrenia Passage

**Biomes**: Volcanic island, geothermal vents, obsidian fields

**Named Entities**: Mount Kajiit, Kedari Emnath

**Rivers & Lakes**: Geothermal pools, lava flows

**Adjacent Waters**: The Forgotten Sea, the Middle Sea

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Mereiki (within Mount Kajiit's caldera)

**Cities**: Mereiki

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Doga (coastal)

### Primary Conflicts

**Sibling Rivalry**

The fraternal monarchy ensures that ruling siblings must work together, but it doesn't ensure they'll like each other. Court drama erupts regularly when the elder and younger clash over policy, pride, or petty grievances. The explosions are spectacular—sometimes literally, given Verucan tempers—but the system has survived for generations.

**Arms Dealing Ethics**

Phiora sells weapons to anyone who can pay, which means their blades often appear on both sides of the same war. This creates complicated diplomatic situations and occasional moral qualms. Some Verucan argue for restricting sales; others point out that a blade doesn't choose its wielder. The debate smolders but never quite ignites into policy change.

**Isolation vs. Engagement**

The Verucan dislike the sea and generally prefer to stay on their island, but trade requires engagement with the wider world. Younger Verucan increasingly question whether isolation serves their interests, while elders point out that every time Phiora has gotten involved in mainland politics, it's ended badly.

**The Kajiit Legacy**

Mount Kajiit was once forcibly erupted by a follower of Dyos to end the daemon wars, causing a volcanic winter and multi-millennia ice age that killed millions. The Verucan live with this history—literally, within the caldera of that catastrophic eruption. Some view it as ancient history; others believe the mountain remembers and might one day remind the world of its power.

### History

The Verucan emerged from the volcanic forges of southern peaks in ages past, and eventually found their way to Pii Island. They recognized Mount Kajiit as kin—a living volcano that matched their fiery nature—and made their home within its caldera.

The fraternal monarchy developed as a solution to succession crises that nearly destroyed early Phiora. When two siblings both claimed the throne, the compromise that prevented civil war became permanent tradition: share power, but ensure it passes to a different branch each generation. The system creates tension but prevents tyranny.

Phiora's reputation as a weapons source grew over centuries. The combination of volcanic heat, Verucan craftsmanship, and obsessive attention to quality produced blades that outlasted their wielders. Kings, generals, and assassins all sought Phioran steel. The Verucan sold to all of them and stayed out of the fights their weapons fueled.

The island's historical tragedy—the Kajiit eruption—predates Verucan settlement but shapes their worldview. They live in a place that once ended an age. They've built their civilization around a force that could destroy it at any moment. This awareness gives Verucan culture its characteristic intensity: life is short, the volcano is eternal, so work with passion while you can.

## Phirexes

Tags: state, emerald coast, swamp

A fog-shrouded swampland at the southeastern edge of the Emerald Coast, ruled by the gorgon queen Phendexelas the Beautiful. What appears to be an absolute monarchy is something stranger: a nation of willing captives who praise their jailer nightly, trapped not by walls but by magical addiction to the very mists that imprison them.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy (de facto theocratic cult)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Dengar (swamp halflings)

**Population**: ~30,000 (concentrated in Maurevelious; several hundred refugees in hiding)

**Stability**: Stable (superficially); deeply unstable (beneath the surface)

**Core Values**: Gratitude, unity, devotion to the queen, "the worse it gets, the better it was"

The gorgon Phendexelas the Beautiful has ruled Phirexes for sixty years, having manufactured the crisis that brought her to power and positioned herself as savior. She does not need to rule through fear—the Dengar culture of finding silver linings in suffering has been weaponized into mass Stockholm syndrome. Citizens genuinely believe they are fortunate to live under her protection, because the alternative (the fog-maddened swamp she created) is so much worse.

Every evening, Phendexelas walks the raised boardwalk through Maurevelious's central district. Every citizen who can attend does attend, kneeling with heads bowed as she passes, listening to her speak of her love for them. Those who miss the Queen's Walk are noted. Those who miss it repeatedly are visited by her agents. Those visits end in one of two ways: renewed devotion or disappearance.

The refugees—a few hundred Dengar who escaped Maurevelious and cannot return—hide in Old One's Wood, sustained by smugglers and the Sweet Water River. They are sick, all of them; the fog-binding that makes the queen's subjects unable to leave also afflicts those who've fled. But they endure, waiting for something to change, holding onto the memory of what the Dengar were before Phendexelas came.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Somewhat developed (exceptional alchemy)

**Primary Exports**: Medicines, alchemical compounds, "swamp spirits" (alcohol)

**Primary Imports**: Metals, metal goods, preserved foods, textiles

The Dengar are master alchemists, a tradition predating the queen by centuries. Their still-houses produce medicines that no other culture can match: salves for infections that resist magical healing, elixirs that dull pain without clouding the mind, compounds that can purge exotic poisons. They also produce "swamp spirits"—a violently alcoholic brew that doubles as solvent, antiseptic, and (the Dengar insist) a perfectly reasonable breakfast drink.

Phendexelas has captured this economy without destroying it. She controls access to rare ingredients by controlling access to Duskwood Forest where they grow. She monitors what formulas are produced, confiscating anything that might counteract fog-binding. She takes her cut of all exports. But she lets the Dengar work, lets them profit, lets them feel like they're thriving under her rule. Happy workers are productive workers, and productive workers don't ask questions.

The swamps prevent heavy industry—no mining, no large-scale metalwork, no foundries. Everything metal must be imported, which gives the queen another lever of control. She decides what comes in and from whom.

### Military

**Size**: None (officially)

**Quality**: N/A

**Enrollment**: Forbidden

Phendexelas forbids any military force in Phirexes. She and the swamp itself, she argues, are sufficient defense against any invasion. This is not empty boasting—the Croaking Briars have repelled every Trømgar assault, and the fogs would make conventional warfare impossible even if an army could reach Maurevelious.

The real reason for the prohibition is control. An armed populace might get ideas. The queen's personal power—her gorgon gaze, her sorcery, her control over the fogs—is more than sufficient to handle any internal dissent. External threats simply don't exist in meaningful form.

The watching ships that patrol the Gulf of Tears are not military vessels; they're classified as "customs enforcement." The agents who visit those who miss the Queen's Walk are not soldiers; they're "concerned citizens ensuring community wellness." The distinctions are technical but important—the queen maintains the fiction that Phirexes needs no military because Phirexes has nothing to fear.

### Geography

**Location**: Southeastern Emerald Coast, Rimihuica

**Biomes**: Swamp, marsh, fog-shrouded wetland, ancient forest

**Named Regions**:
- Misty Marshes (central wetlands)
- Cragwood Swamp (fog-touched nightmare zone)
- Old One's Wood (primordial forest, refugee hideout)
- Sweetwoods (northern timber forest)
- Duskwood Forest (southwestern twilight forest, rare alchemical ingredients)
- Croaking Briars (western thorn-barrier, border with Trømgar)
- Whispering Mangroves (eastern coast)
- Ogzwad Swamp (southeastern, dragon territory)
- Grove of Migwam (sacred site, now queen's shrine)
- Hag's Pasture (mysterious clearing)

**Rivers & Lakes**:
- Sweet Water River (clean freshwater, refugee lifeline)
- Mud Run (fog-infused, hallucinogenic)
- Groaning Creek (mysterious, constantly moaning)

**Adjacent Waters**:
- Gulf of Tears (northwest)
- Crocodile Coast (east)
- Sea of Seven Snakes (south)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Maurevelious

**Cities**: None besides Maurevelious

**Towns**: None (all population concentrated in capital)

**Villages**: Scattered work camps (logging, harvesting), refugee camps in Old One's Wood

Phirexes is unusual in having essentially one settlement. Before the queen came, the Dengar lived throughout the swamp in small communities. Phendexelas consolidated them into Maurevelious "for their protection"—creating a population center she could monitor and control. The old village sites are now ruins slowly sinking into the bog, occasionally visible when the fog thins.

### Borders & Neighbors

**West (Trømgar)**: The Croaking Briars form an impassable living wall. The Strømgodden battle dwarves have tried repeatedly to breach it; the briars grow back overnight, faster where blood is spilled. An uneasy non-relationship exists—neither side can reach the other, so neither side bothers with diplomacy.

**South (Kyagos)**: The Cloud Mountains separate Phirexes from the lawless Shacklands to the south. Little contact exists; Kyagos has its own problems.

**Northwest (Emerald Coast nations)**: Trade relationships exist with Eoga and Vystrilik, though heavily controlled. The queen permits enough commerce to maintain her economy but discourages any cultural exchange that might give her subjects ideas.

**Southeast (Ogzwad/Pfustias)**: The dragon Pfustias controls this territory in all but name. The queen and the dragon have some kind of arrangement—neither moves against the other, but neither acknowledges the other as ally.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Queen vs. The Refugees**: Several hundred Dengar have escaped Maurevelious and hidden in Old One's Wood. They cannot truly leave (fog-binding), cannot return (the queen would destroy them), and cannot live openly (the queen cannot tolerate visible defiance). The queen walks a careful line: she must maintain her image as savior while suppressing those who've rejected salvation. So far, she's content to let them suffer in hiding, trusting that their sickness and hardship will eventually break them.

**The Queen vs. Old One's Wood**: Something in the ancient forest hates Phendexelas with cold patience. Her fogs penetrate but don't control it. Her creatures enter and don't return. The forest shelters her enemies and resists her power. She hasn't moved against it directly—perhaps she can't, or perhaps she's waiting for the right moment.

**The Queen vs. Pfustias**: The dragon arrived a decade after Phendexelas. Their relationship is unclear to outsiders—cold war? Mutual observation? Some kind of game? Pfustias knows something about the queen that she'd prefer stayed secret. What leverage that gives the dragon, and how she might use it, remains to be seen.

**Internal Tension**: Not all Dengar have fully surrendered to the cult of gratitude. Some remember what life was like before, or have heard stories from grandparents. Quiet dissent exists, carefully hidden, waiting for something to change. The queen's agents work constantly to identify and neutralize these elements before they can organize.

### History

Sixty years ago, the Dengar lived throughout the swamp in scattered communities. They knew its dangers and respected them; they'd negotiated relationships with its creatures and spirits over generations. Life was hard but sustainable. They were free.

Then the gorgon came.

No one knows where Phendexelas came from or why she chose Phirexes. Some say she was fleeing something worse. Others say she was drawn by the swamp's latent magic. What matters is what she did: within months of her arrival, the fogs descended.

At first, the mists seemed merely weather. Then the swamp beasts began to go mad. Creatures the Dengar had lived alongside for generations turned savage. The spirits withdrew or went hostile. The carefully negotiated peace collapsed into chaos.

The Dengar fled their villages, gathering in the only safe place they could find: a patch of high ground where a strange gorgon was building a city with impossible speed. Phendexelas welcomed them with open arms. She'd prepared, she said. She'd seen this coming. She would protect them.

Within a year, Maurevelious stood complete, and thirty thousand Dengar lived within its walls. They were grateful—so grateful. The queen had saved them from a catastrophe she herself had created, and they had no way of knowing. The fog-binding was subtle at first, a dependency that grew so slowly it seemed natural. By the time anyone realized they couldn't leave, it was far too late.

Sixty years later, two generations have grown up knowing nothing but the queen's rule. The elders who remember freedom are dying off. The refugees who carry that memory are hunted and sick. And Phendexelas walks her boardwalk every evening, accepting the worship of a people who believe she is all that stands between them and oblivion.

### Notable Figures

**Phendexelas the Beautiful**: Gorgon queen, sorceress, architect of the catastrophe. See [dramatis_personae/Phendexelas](../dramatis_personae/Phendexelas.md) for full entry.

**Pfustias**: Swamp dragon dwelling in Ogzwad Swamp. Patient, philosophical, watching. See [bestiary/dragons/Pfustias](../../bestiary/dragons/Pfustias.md) for full entry.

### Player Hooks

**The Smuggler's Run**: A Vystrilik smuggling captain needs crew for a supply run to the refugees. The pay is excellent. The route goes through the Crocodile Coast. Survival is not guaranteed.

**The Silent Grove**: An elderly Dengar exile approaches the party with a request: investigate the Grove of Migwam and find out why the ancestors stopped speaking. What happened to the spirits when the fogs came? Are they trapped? Dead? Something worse?

**Dragon's Bargain**: Pfustias has information about Queen Phendexelas—something that could shift the balance of power in Phirexes. She'll share it. For a price. The price is never gold.

**The Cure**: A brilliant Dengar alchemist claims to have developed a treatment for fog-binding. She needs rare ingredients from Duskwood Forest, which means getting the queen's permission—or going without it. She also needs test subjects willing to risk everything on an unproven formula.

**The Queen's Secret**: Rumor among the refugees: Phendexelas cannot leave Phirexes either. The fogs bind her too, or something does. She's as trapped as her subjects, ruling a prison she can never escape. If true, this changes everything. If false, investigating it means drawing the queen's attention.

**Heart of the Wood**: Something lives in the center of Old One's Wood—something that hates the queen and has been waiting sixty years for the right allies. The refugees speak of it in whispers. Pfustias speaks of it not at all, which might be more telling. Finding it means navigating a forest that thinks.

## Postronamas Empire

Tags: ruins, state, fallen, westwilds

An ancient civilization that rose to greatness through mastery of twyl crystals, built an empire spanning the western Westwilds, and collapsed into madness and civil war when they pushed too deep into their own power.

### Overview

The Postronamas dominated the Piktiniti Desert and surrounding regions for centuries, perhaps millennia. Their civilization was built on twyl—a crystalline mineral that produces oxygen and, when concentrated, resonates at frequencies that can enhance mental abilities, enable long-distance communication, and amplify magical power.

At their height, the Postronamas constructed the Chakatann pillars: massive stone columns containing twyl crystal cores, spaced ten miles apart in a grid across the western desert. The pillar network allowed them to project power across continental distances.

Then they pushed too deep into the crystal caverns beneath their capital, Enimogos. The music of the deepest crystals broke their leaders' minds. The madness spread through the resonance network, cascading from pillar to pillar. Within a generation, the empire collapsed.

### Culture (What Survives)

**Aesthetic:** Egypt + Japan + Tlingit. Geometric line art, flowing garments, an emphasis on symmetry and pattern. Postronamas artifacts are immediately recognizable—clean lines, insect motifs, crystal inlays.

**Insect Partnership:** The Postronamas worked closely with the giant insects of the Piktiniti. They bred enormous dung beetles whose wing vibrations could harvest twyl at precise frequencies. They wore armor crafted from insect chitin—beautiful and effective. Their art featured insects prominently.

**Crystal Meditation:** Postronamas leaders used massive crystal caves as meditation chambers, achieving enhanced perception and magical sensitivity. This practice was their greatest achievement and their downfall.

### The Collapse

The crystal caverns extend far underground, and the deeper crystals sing differently. The Postronamas leaders who sought the deepest power found it—a resonance that permeates the mind, overwhelming thought, erasing identity.

The madness spread through the pillar network. Civil war erupted as factions blamed each other, as leaders descended into psychosis, as the empire tore itself apart. Survivors scattered. Most died. A few found refuge—on the pillars (becoming the Seyiki), in the musical forest (becoming the Melodians), or into the mysterious Woods of Systoril (fate unknown).

### Legacy

**The Chakatann Pillars:** Still standing, now colonized by Seyiki gnomes. Most are broken or depleted; some still hum.

**Enimogos:** The shattered capital, still resonating with maddening intensity. A death trap for treasure hunters.

**Melodia:** A forest where Postronamas-engineered trees still sing.

**The Seyiki:** Gnomes who merged with Postronamas survivors and inherited fragments of their knowledge.

**Artifacts:** Postronamas relics—crystal-powered devices, insect-chitin armor, resonance tools—command enormous prices. Most are dangerous.

### What They Knew

The Postronamas understood harmonics and resonance at levels modern mages don't match. Their twyl-harvesting technique (using dung beetle wing vibrations at specific frequencies) has never been replicated. Their pillar network demonstrated engineering capabilities that seem impossible.

Whether this knowledge is lost or simply waiting to be rediscovered in Enimogos is a question that draws scholars and fools to the Piktiniti.

## Poum-Titch

Tags: state

Located in Terrenia, south of the Green Mountains and east of Aal Salma. Inhabited by Scalawags. A huge civil war has recently broken out—total disaster, as the northern nation declares independence from the rest of the state. Total chaos, lots of death. Armies are assembling and marching on each other.

## Pyonokraus

Tags: city, state

Home to some Ayblek.

This city is cursed—none of the inhabitants can ever leave, including those who enter from the outside. Built into a titan skull on the mountainside, it has layers upon layers of city built on top of itself, since there's nowhere to go but down and on top of existing buildings. 

It has a similar feel to the mining town in guardians of the galaxy where they meet the bioengineer

It has existed for millenia, and contains secrets completely unknown to the outside world. Getting them, however, is quite difficult; no one who enters can ever leave. You can greet people at the border, but you have to be able to offer something fantastic to make them willing to share—after all, they're screwed, and they have no reason to help you if you can't offer something incredible in return.

## Qet Yemani

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Stongman tribes

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ulvsjael

**Population**: 3,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Loyalty, heritage, strength

- Numerous, nomadic tribes or "packs" dot the landscape.
- Pack leadership is determined by strength and leadership skill. Dynamics within a tribe mimic those within a wolfpack.
- Wisdom is highly valued to. Although the "strongman" is the voicepiece for the pack, and the nominal leader, they will have a partner who is their advisor. The leader is expected to defer to their advisor in all important decisioins


### Economy

**Size**: Very small

**Tech**: Very undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Animal products

**Primary Imports**: Beads, trinkets

- Outsiders rarely enter Qet Yemani, and the Ulvsjael rarely trade. However, colorful beads that can be braided into one's coat of fur are seen as symbols of wealth and power, and are popular.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Nearly everyone is capable of fighting, so their entire population doubles as their army.
- There is no discipline or unity across tribes, and they have never had to fight together for a common cause.


### Geography

**Location**: 

**Biomes**: 

**Named Entities**:

**Rivers & Lakes**: 

**Adjacent Waters**: 


### Political Geography

**Capital**: 

**Cities**: 

**Towns**: 

**Villages**: 


### Primary Conflicts

- Although infighting is infrequent, skirmishes against the Da Trang are somewhat common.
- An Ulvsjael man who had left the jungle has now come back. He has quickly taken over a pack, and his pack is growing. He seems to be magically powerful.


### History

## Qintas

Tags: state

A coastal state in Central Aboyinzu, home to a significant Amverela high elf population and famous across Alaria for Sondoros wine—a vintage so legendary that it has shaped the state's economy, politics, and international relations for millennia.

### Government

Qintas is governed by councils that embody Amverela philosophy: deliberate, patient, and frustratingly slow to outsiders. The High Council in Constancias meets quarterly to address major policy; lesser councils handle administrative matters; emergency procedures exist for crises but have been invoked perhaps twice in living memory.

Representation is weighted toward longevity. Amverela who have served for centuries hold more influence than human delegates who die after a few decades. This isn't formal policy—it simply reflects how council dynamics evolve over time. Humans participate but rarely dominate.

The government's approach to problems is to have anticipated them generations ago. When this works, Qintas appears preternaturally prepared. When it fails—when something genuinely new arises—the response can be catastrophically slow.

### Population

**Amverela High Elves**: The cultural and political elite, though not numerically dominant. They hold most council positions, own most significant property, and set the tone for Qintan society. They are patient, wise, and sometimes paralyzed by their own caution.

**Humans**: The majority population, concentrated in cities and agricultural regions. They do most of the manual labor, including the physical work of the wine harvest. Relations with the Amverela are cordial if condescending—the elves view humans as useful but short-lived; humans view elves as impressive but insufferable.

**Others**: Qintas welcomes traders and visitors from across Alaria, particularly in Mataojo. A cosmopolitan port population has developed there, distinct from the more homogeneous interior.

### Economy

**Sondoros Wine**: The foundation of everything. The legendary wine produced from the Sondoros forest's unique vines cannot be replicated elsewhere—many have tried, all have failed. This monopoly has made Qintas wealthy and given the Amverela leverage far exceeding their military power.

Wine exports fund imports of everything else. Qintas produces food, wool, and crafts for domestic consumption, but its international significance rests entirely on Sondoros.

**Trade**: Mataojo serves as the state's commercial gateway, welcoming ships from across Alaria eager to purchase wine and whatever else the high elves will sell. The Amverela prefer to let others handle the actual sailing.

### Military

Qintas maintains professional guards rather than a true army—enough to patrol roads, protect wine shipments, and maintain order, not enough to fight a war. The Amverela philosophy holds that wars are won through diplomacy, economics, and patience, not through soldiers.

This philosophy has worked so far. Whether it will survive contact with Chaal Nazzerox's undead hordes remains to be seen. The Amverela are preparing—they've been preparing for centuries—but their preparations are characteristically opaque.

### Culture

Amverela culture values patience, beauty, and long-term thinking. Buildings are designed to last millennia. Decisions are made slowly and implemented gradually. Art is created with the understanding that the artist may not live to see it completed, but the work will outlast everyone.

Humans in Qintas have adapted to this pace or learned to work around it. The port city of Mataojo operates on human time; the rest of the state operates on elven time. The contrast can be jarring.

### Relations

**Grustos**: Friendly neighbor to the west. The Amverela consider Grustani slightly uncouth but appreciate their role as buffer against the undead. Trade flows freely; borders exist mainly on maps.

**Chaal Nazzerox**: The existential threat. If Grustos falls, Qintas is next. The Amverela have plans—centuries of plans—but no one outside their councils knows what those plans entail.

**Broader Alaria**: Qintas maintains cordial relations with anyone willing to buy wine, which is everyone. The state's soft power far exceeds its size.

### What Will Go Wrong

- **The wine could fail**: If something happens to the Sondoros vines—blight, magical corruption, climate change—Qintas loses its only real asset.
- **Ojos Goros**: The watching forest in the south. The Amverela avoid it and won't explain why. Whatever's in there has been watching for a long time.
- **Too slow to respond**: Amverela patience is a strength until it's a fatal weakness. Some threats don't wait for quarterly council meetings.
- **The undead are coming**: Chaal Nazzerox will eventually break out. The Amverela's long-term plans had better be good.

## Rakite

Tags: state, elven, tribal

The great plains of the eastern Farlands, where the grass grows taller than a man and the Rakiten elves hunt buffalo beneath an endless sky. This is not a kingdom in any conventional sense—there's no capital, no standing army, no tax collectors. Just a loose confederation of tribes bound by shared blood, shared custom, and an absolute refusal to bow to anyone.

The Rakiten are the tallest elves in the known world, bred over generations to see over the six-foot grasses that dominate their homeland. They dress in auburn and rust, colors that blend with the autumn plains. They hunt the great herds that migrate between Tyror Miig and Tyror Weklis with a patience and skill that makes other hunters look like amateurs.

And now strangers are burning their grasslands to plant farms, and the Rakiten are deciding whether to disappear or fight back.

### Overview

Rakite sprawls across approximately 50,000 square miles of grassland, bounded by the Vokas Enrisikna mountains to the west, the Vokas Pendi range to the south, and the sea to the east. The land is mostly flat—gentle swells hiding the horizon, river valleys cutting through the plains, occasional copses of trees where the land dips enough to shelter them from the constant wind.

The grass is the defining feature. Tyror grass grows six feet tall in summer, higher in wet years, and moves in waves like a golden ocean. From ground level, visibility extends maybe twenty feet. From atop a horse—or from the height of a Rakiten elf—you can see for miles, tracking herds by the wake they leave in the grass.

There are no cities. The Rakiten live in movable camps, following the buffalo and the seasons. The only permanent structures are sacred sites, the Palace of Flickering Lights, and—increasingly—the Roule colonial villages sprouting on the eastern peninsula.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Tribal confederation

**Primary Inhabitants**: Rakiten elves

**Population**: ~10,000

**Stability**: Very Stable (internally), Threatened (externally)

**Core Values**:

- Generosity as dominance—the greatest gift-giver commands the most respect
- Confrontation is shameful; disputes are resolved through competitive giving
- The land belongs to no one; the herds belong to everyone
- Outsiders are tolerated but never trusted

The Rakiten have no unified government. Each tribe—there are perhaps thirty, ranging from a few dozen to several hundred members—governs itself according to its own customs. Some follow hereditary chiefs, others elect leaders, others defer to their elders or their shamans.

Once a year, at the autumn equinox, tribal leaders gather at the **Kro Shiik Convocation**—a meeting on the shores of the central lake where matters affecting all Rakite are discussed. Decisions are made by consensus or not at all. In practice, this means most decisions aren't made, and each tribe handles its own affairs.

The gift-giving tradition is central to Rakiten culture. Disputes between individuals, families, or tribes are settled not by violence or arbitration, but by gift competition. Each party gives the other gifts of increasing value until one side presents something so generous, so self-sacrificing, that the other is obligated to accept it—and with it, the giver's position in the dispute.

This sounds peaceful. It is, mostly. But it can also be brutal: the pressure to give more than you can afford, the shame of accepting a gift you can't reciprocate, the slow impoverishment of a family that keeps losing gift-battles. The Rakiten avoid open conflict, but they're capable of destroying each other with generosity.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**:
- Buffalo hides and horn (highly valued for quality)
- Tyror grass rope (unusually strong and water-resistant)
- Bone carvings (ceremonial and decorative)

**Primary Imports**:
- Metal tools and weapons (they have no smithing tradition)
- Salt (essential for preserving meat)
- Occasionally, luxuries for gift-giving competitions

The Rakiten economy is fundamentally different from settled peoples. There's no currency; wealth is measured in horses, buffalo, and the quality of your crafts. Trade with outsiders happens at the margins—literally at the edges of Rakiten territory—and is handled by specific families who've specialized in dealing with foreigners.

Most Rakiten go their entire lives without using money. Everything they need, they make, hunt, or receive as gifts.

### Military

**Size**: Small (but can mobilize quickly)

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all adults are trained hunters and warriors)

The Rakiten have no standing army because they don't need one. Every adult is a hunter, and every hunter is a warrior. They fight from horseback with bows, javelins, and long knives. They don't form ranks or follow orders—each warrior fights as an individual, using the grass for concealment and the plains for maneuver.

In open battle, they would lose to any organized army. They never fight open battles. Rakiten warfare is about ambush, harassment, and attrition. They appear from the grass, strike, and vanish. They poison water sources. They stampede herds through enemy camps. They burn the grass behind advancing forces and wait for starvation to do their work.

No army has ever conquered Rakite. Several have tried. The grass swallowed them all.

### Geography

### The Roule Problem

Twenty years ago, halflings from Roule began settling the eastern peninsula. They called the land empty because they couldn't see anyone using it. They burned the grass to plant crops. They built permanent villages. They named the land and claimed to own it.

The Rakiten watched. They are culturally averse to confrontation, and the strangers were far from the core grazing lands. When the buffalo avoided the burned areas, the tribes simply adjusted their migration patterns. When Roule settlers started finding old hearths and stone foundations beneath their fields, they dismissed them as ancient history.

But the burning continues. Each year, a little more grassland becomes farmland. Each year, the buffalo have less range. Each year, the Rakiten lose ground without ever fighting a battle.

The tribes are divided. Some argue for continued withdrawal—the plains are vast, and there's room to disappear. Others say the withdrawal will never end until they fight. A few have begun quiet acts of resistance: herds "accidentally" stampeding through Roule fields, fires "somehow" spreading to colonial buildings. So far, the Roule don't even know the Rakiten exist. They think the plains are haunted.

That ignorance won't last forever.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Roule Expansion**: The colonial villages are growing. The burning continues. Something will break.
- **Internal Division**: The tribes can't agree on whether to fight, flee, or ignore the problem. The annual convocation grows more tense each year.
- **The Palace Question**: The Sarakiel in the Palace of Flickering Lights have lived among the Rakiten for centuries without interaction. Recently, the angels have been seen at the palace windows, watching the plains. Watching the Roule. No one knows what they're thinking.
- **The Light Leyline**: A major leyline of light energy passes through eastern Rakite. The Roule villages sit directly on it. Some Rakiten shamans believe this isn't coincidence—that the halflings are drawn to the power without knowing why, and that waking the leyline could have consequences.

### History

The Rakiten have lived on these plains longer than anyone can remember. Their oral histories stretch back dozens of generations, describing a time before the Palace, before the elven kingdoms to the south, before the mountains had names. The plains were always here. The buffalo were always here. The Rakiten were always here.

They've weathered droughts, harsh winters, and occasional incursions from the Vokas Enrisikna. They've traded with Lenora to the south and occasionally raided the coastal settlements that existed before Roule. They've never been conquered because no one has ever wanted the plains badly enough to pay the cost of taking them.

The Sarakiel arrived perhaps a thousand years ago—a squadron of fallen angels who built their marble palace and retreated inside. The Rakiten left them alone. The angels left the Rakiten alone. It's been a comfortable arrangement.

Now, for the first time, something is changing. The Roule colonists don't understand the rules. They don't know about gift-giving or sacred territories or the old arrangements with the Palace. They just see empty land and opportunity.

The Rakiten are about to learn whether their culture can adapt—or whether their refusal to fight will be the end of them.

### Player Hooks

- **The Charcoal Discovery**: A Roule farmer in Kilik digs up charcoal and stone foundations in his field. He reports it to the mayor. Someone needs to investigate whether the land was occupied before—and what it means if it was.

- **The Gift-War**: Two Rakiten families are locked in a ruinous gift competition. They've beggared themselves and are now offering things that shouldn't be offered—sacred objects, family members, promises that will destroy them. A neutral party might be able to mediate, if they can understand the rules.

- **The Angel's Offer**: A Sarakiel from the Palace has broken the ancient prohibition and walked into the plains. She seeks outsiders—not Rakiten, not Roule—for a task the angels cannot do themselves. She won't say what. She'll pay in light.

- **The Leyline Waking**: Strange lights have been seen at night near Golyayla. The Roule colonists think it's ghost-fire. The Rakiten shamans know better: something is stirring in the leyline, and the villages are at the center of it.

- **The Buffalo War**: A Roule hunting party killed a sacred white buffalo, not knowing what it was. The Rakiten are divided between those who want blood payment and those who want to give the colonists gifts until they understand what they've done. Both approaches could end in disaster.

## Roule

Tags: state, halfling, colonial, greenwater isles

A colonial halfling nation built on emptied land and sustained by honey, slavery, and selective memory. Roule is wealthy, orderly, and ruthless—a civilization that has perfected the art of not seeing what it doesn't want to see.

Three centuries ago, halfling colonists arrived on these shores. Within two generations, a plague had swept through the indigenous human population. The halflings called it providence. The survivors fled into the interior forest and have never forgotten. Today, Roule is one of the most prosperous nations in the Greenwater Isles, its flower fields and honey trade funding an expanding colonial enterprise. The price of that prosperity is paid by slaves, subjugated peoples, and the ghosts of those who came before.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant Oligarchy (Parliamentary Facade)

The Parliament of Flowers meets in Fozyader and passes laws with great ceremony. Real power rests with the Honey Lords—the dozen or so merchant families who control flower cultivation, honey processing, and the slave trade. The Parliament elects a Prime Consul every five years; the Honey Lords ensure their preferred candidate wins.

The system is stable because it's profitable. Every Honey Lord has enough wealth to be content, and competition is channeled into social status rather than political conflict. When disputes arise, they're settled in private clubs over honeyed wine, not in the streets.

**Primary Inhabitants**: Halflings

Roule is overwhelmingly halfling—roughly 85% of the population. The remainder includes human merchants and sailors, a small gnomish artisan community in Kabilcuz, and slaves of various races. The Velani humans of Murderwood are not counted in any census.

**Population**: ~180,000

**Stability**: Stable

The colonial economy generates enough wealth to keep most halflings comfortable. Dissent is rare and quickly addressed. The major instabilities are external: the Velani in Murderwood, Nylos resistance, tensions with Xoth, and the ongoing Rakite expansion.

**Core Values**:

- **Commerce above all**: Profit is virtue. Successful merchants are respected; poverty is a moral failing.
- **Respectability**: What matters is appearance. Private sins are tolerated; public scandal is unforgivable.
- **Progress**: Roule is civilization advancing into wilderness. This belief justifies everything.
- **Selective memory**: The past is what we say it is. Uncomfortable truths are simply not discussed.

### Culture

Roulean halflings are polite, industrious, and quietly vicious. Social interaction follows elaborate rules of courtesy that everyone understands and no one violates publicly. Insults are delivered through praise; rejection comes wrapped in apology. Outsiders often mistake this for friendliness and learn otherwise too late.

Status is everything. Hat styles indicate profession and rank. Flower pins show family affiliation. Seating arrangements at public events communicate subtle hierarchies. A halfling can read another's entire social position at a glance and adjust their behavior accordingly.

The wind is central to Roulean identity. Greetings wish "fair winds." Curses wish "still air." Weather vanes top every building. Children learn wind-reading before letters. This obsession is practical—Roule's constant winds power mills, fill sails, and shape agriculture—but it's also cultural. Movement is virtue; stagnation is death.

**Food & Drink**: Honey features in everything. Honeyed meats, honey-glazed vegetables, honey wines, honey-sweetened teas. Visitors find it cloying; locals can't imagine food without it. The cuisine otherwise emphasizes preserved fish, root vegetables, and dense breads suitable for the windy plains.

**Religion**: Roule's official faith centers on Gythry, daemon of commerce and fair exchange—interpreted locally as blessing profit and punishing those who interfere with trade. Shrines to Gythry appear in every marketplace. The Honey Lords fund elaborate temples while ignoring the irony of a "fair exchange" deity blessing their slave markets.

**Taboos**: Never mention the previous inhabitants. Never suggest the plague wasn't natural. Never imply Murderwood contains anything but animals. These silences are enforced through social pressure rather than law—violators find themselves uninvited to gatherings, passed over for contracts, quietly excluded from polite society.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

Roule punches above its weight economically. The honey trade alone would make it prosperous; combined with fishing, shipbuilding, and the slave trade, it's genuinely wealthy.

**Primary Exports**:
- **Taberthine honey**: Sharpens mental acuity (+1 cunning). Prized by scholars, merchants, and anyone facing important negotiations.
- **Zindwatt honey**: Induces gentle euphoria. Technically regulated; practically available to anyone with coin.
- **Preserved fish**: Roule's fishing fleets supply much of the Greenwater Isles.
- **Ships**: Kabilcuz and Teldib yards produce quality vessels.
- **Slaves**: Officially "modest domestic trade." Practically, a significant export to nations with fewer scruples.

**Primary Imports**:
- Iron and steel (limited local mining)
- Luxury goods for the Honey Lords
- Timber (Murderwood makes local logging... complicated)
- Exotic spices and goods from Xoth, Urok, and beyond

**Currency**: The Roulean Bloom—gold coins stamped with a stylized flower. Silver "petals" and copper "seeds" serve smaller transactions.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (with strong social pressure)

Roule's military is primarily naval. The fleet based at Teldib is the largest in the southern Greenwater Isles—fast patrol vessels, heavy warships, and the specialized prison-tender ships that supply Sunbeam Prison. Land forces are smaller but well-trained, focused on garrison duty and colonial expansion rather than large-scale warfare.

The navy operates with significant autonomy under Admiral Tessara Brightwater, a politically ambitious officer who has expanded her mandate steadily over the past decade. Her loyalty to the Honey Lords is... conditional.

**Notable Forces**:
- **The Teldib Fleet**: Main naval force. Approximately 40 combat vessels plus support ships.
- **Fairn's Pride**: Elite squadron named for the admiral who broke Xoth's naval power. Handles the most sensitive missions.
- **The Colonial Rangers**: Land forces specializing in "frontier security." Currently deployed in Rakite.
- **The Bay Watch**: Patrol force that guards Sunbeam Prison and monitors the Bay of Roule.

**Named Entities**: Murderwood, Arins Plains

**Rivers & Lakes**: Hanli River, Ezcelmez Lake, Hakö Lake

**Adjacent Waters**: Bay of Roule, Inside Passage, Fairn Passage, Roule Channel

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Fozyader

**Cities**: Kabilcuz, Tezina, Teldib, Ovabasi, Samandoken, Recnaf

**Towns**: Esslekiv, Wunipek, Gavuragili, Dikilkaya, Nebil, Boke, Dimetoka, Gevenlik, Atamer, Bachesaray, Kyullyuk, Varhal, Karamehmetler, Mahmu

**Rakite Colonial Settlements**: Kilik, Ilyasca, Golyayla

*Note: Kyullyuk is listed in official records but is actually a Velani settlement in Murderwood that Roule does not control.*

### Primary Conflicts

**The Velani Problem**

The survivors of the plague live in Murderwood. They call themselves the Velani—"the remaining"—and they have not forgotten what the halflings did. For three centuries they've held the forest against every attempt at pacification. The Honey Lords publicly maintain that Murderwood contains only dangerous animals. Privately, military planners know the truth and have no solution.

The Velani kill halflings on sight. They trade occasionally with outsiders through hidden intermediaries, accepting iron and salt in exchange for forest goods. Whether they could ever threaten Roule directly is unknown—but the possibility haunts those who know the real history.

**Nylos Subjugation**

The islands of Nylos were once independent. Now they're a Roulean territory, their people taxed, their fishing rights controlled, their resistance fighters tried in Samandoken and executed in the public square. The Nylosi haven't forgotten independence, and the younger generation is increasingly willing to fight for it.

Roule maintains order through military presence, economic control, and exemplary punishment. So far, it's been enough. But the occupation is expensive, the Nylosi are patient, and every execution creates new martyrs.

**Xoth Tensions**

Two centuries ago, Admiral Fairn sank a Xothian fleet in the passage that now bears his name. Relations have never recovered. The nations maintain formal peace, but naval "incidents" occur regularly, trade negotiations are hostile, and both sides assume the other is planning something.

The conflict is partly territorial (disputed island claims), partly economic (competing trade routes), and partly pure historical grudge. Neither side wants open war, but neither side will back down.

**Rakite Expansion**

Roule is currently colonizing Rakite—burning grasslands for farms, establishing settlements, pushing ever westward. The colonists insist the land is empty. It isn't. The Rakiten elves have lived there for millennia, and they're beginning to realize that retreat won't save them.

Back in Fozyader, the Honey Lords know only what the Colonial Rangers tell them: progress is good, expansion is profitable, the land is available. The truth—that Roule is repeating its founding crime—hasn't reached them yet. When it does, they'll probably find a way not to see it.

**The Colonial Villages**

Three settlements now dot the eastern Rakite peninsula, all drawing water from the Ves Neles river system:

*Kilik* is the oldest and largest—twenty years established, grown from a frontier outpost into something approaching a proper town. Wooden buildings cluster around a central square, a small Gythry temple serves the faithful, and the original ford across the Ves Neles is now a proper bridge. Population around 400. The Colonial Rangers maintain their regional headquarters here.

*Ilyasca* lies downstream in low hills, chosen for its defensible position. The settlers here are the most nervous of the three villages—they insist something watches them from the tall grass. Livestock goes missing. Fires start without explanation. The Rangers dismiss it as frontier paranoia. Population around 200.

*Golyayla* occupies the river mouth where the Ves Neles meets the sea. Primarily a fishing village, it receives supply ships from Roule proper at its small dock. The colonists here spend more time looking seaward than inland, which may be why they sleep better than their neighbors. Population around 150.

A trail connects all three villages, maintained by the Rangers for supply runs and patrol routes. The colonists believe they're civilizing empty wilderness. They don't know the Rakiten exist. They don't know they're being watched.

### History

**The Arrival (c. 3076 SD)**: Halfling colonists from [eastern origins] make landfall at what becomes Kabilcuz. They find a populated land—humans living in coastal villages and the interior plains.

**The Plague (3080-3095 SD)**: A devastating disease sweeps through the human population. Nine in ten die. The halflings are largely immune. Whether the plague was natural, carried unknowingly by the colonists, or something worse has never been established. Survivors flee into the interior forest.

**The Claiming (3095-3150 SD)**: Halflings expand across the emptied land. The first Honey Lords establish flower cultivation. Attempts to clear Murderwood fail repeatedly. The colonial narrative crystallizes: providence gave them this land; what came before doesn't matter.

**The Nylos Conquest (c. 3180 SD)**: Roule subjugates the Nylos islands, adding their fishing grounds and pearl beds to the colonial economy. Resistance is crushed. The first generation of Nylosi born under occupation knows no other life.

**The Fairn Victory (c. 3200 SD)**: Admiral Fairn destroys a Xothian fleet attempting to challenge Roulean control of the northern passage. Roule becomes the dominant naval power in the southern Greenwater Isles. Xoth never forgives.

**The Modern Era (3200-present)**: Roule consolidates, grows wealthy, and begins expanding into Rakite. The Honey Lords rule through commerce. The Parliament provides legitimacy. The navy ensures security. Everything is prosperous and stable and built on bones.

### Notable Figures

**Prime Consul Aldric Thornberry**: The current head of government—a mild, agreeable halfling who does exactly what the Honey Lords tell him. He's genuinely popular because he's genuinely harmless.

**Admiral Tessara Brightwater**: Commander of the Teldib Fleet. Brilliant, ambitious, and increasingly independent. She's built a power base within the navy that rivals the Honey Lords' economic influence. What she wants is unclear; that she wants *something* is obvious.

**Lady Primrose Goldpetal**: Head of the largest Honey Lord family. Ancient, ruthless, and possessed of a memory for slights that spans decades. She's outlived three husbands, five rivals, and countless enemies. The other Lords fear her.

**The Keeper of Thorns**: The Velani's leader, if they have one. Roulean intelligence has never confirmed this figure exists, but prisoners taken at the forest's edge sometimes whisper the title before dying. The name suggests someone who remembers the original massacre.

### Adventure Hooks

- A Honey Lord hires the party to "survey" Murderwood—actually to find proof the Velani exist, so he can argue for renewed military action.
- Nylos resistance fighters approach the party for help smuggling weapons through the Inside Passage.
- Strange honey appears on the market—Taberthine that grants visions instead of clarity. The source is somewhere in the forest.
- A Rakiten elf reaches Fozyader seeking allies against colonial expansion. No one will listen—except perhaps outsiders with nothing to lose.
- Something has killed three patrol ships near Sunbeam Prison. The navy wants it handled quietly.

### History

## Sennos

Tags: citystate, state

Inhabited by Sennites—the lake dwarves. The city formed when the dwarves were driven out of Argysis thousands of years ago for betraying the dwarves the first time. Dwarves hate the water, but such was the vengeance of the Hephake and Argysis dwarves, they had no choice but to flee literally into the water. There, they made a new home.

Huge, dark, underwater palace.

Area surrounded by Rusalka. The Sennites in constant war with them.

## Sestros

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Shailin

**Population**: 100,000

**Stability**: Very stable

**Core Values**: Glory, the graces of their god Talressses, do as your told, blind faith

- The king of Sestros is believed to have a direct link with their god Talresses.
- Believe magic is horrible, and is thus forbidden (Talresses' influence).
- Very warm towards outsiders.
- The world is very authoritarian, though they do not feel it. It is rude to ask questions.


### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Silks, fine textiles

**Primary Imports**: Technology

- Sestros boasts the finest textile production of anywhere in the world, attracting wealthy merchants and nobility form all over to purshase form their fine selection.
- Most people work as ranchers, herding sheep and other domestic animals across the plains.


### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The whisperings of Talresses encourage the Shailin to always hold onto a standing army. Why they must do this, they are unclear, but they do not ask. 


### Geography

**Location**: Western Ve, south of Edari, west of Shyona and the Hills of Dolor

**Biomes**: Savannah plains (central), Red Desert (north), forest (south)

**Named Entities**: Red Desert, Shepherds' Stones (northern mountains), Tukiwood (southern forest), Glory River

**Rivers & Lakes**: Glory River (central, flows east toward Shyona)

### Primary Conflicts

- As the Sestros military grows, Sestros' neighbors grow wary. They wonder if war is coming.
- Innovation slows, and scholarship remains frozen in the past, as asking questions is fronwned upon, and new ideas are rare.
- The Shailin are being deluded by a prideful daemon.


### History

## Seyiki

Tags: state, gnome, westwilds

A distributed nation of dragonfly-riding gnomes living among the Chakatann pillars—the massive stone monuments left by the fallen Postronamas Empire in the western Piktiniti Desert.

### Overview

Seyiki isn't a single city but a network of pillar-communities, each hosting between 200 and 2,000 gnomes in carved chambers along the pillar sides. The pillars rise hundreds of feet from the desert floor, and the Seyiki have adapted to vertical life: children learn to fall (safely, using wingsuit-robes) before they learn to climb.

Below many pillars lie saltwater lakes—remnants of ancient seas now trapped in desert basins. The giant dragonflies the Seyiki ride have adapted to tolerate saltwater, using the lakes as breeding grounds.

### Government

Seyiki governance is loose and distributed. Each pillar-community is largely autonomous, governed by a council of elders, successful merchants, and veteran riders. The pillars cooperate through periodic gatherings—"Sky Moots"—where representatives from across the network meet to resolve disputes, coordinate defense, and arrange marriages between communities.

No central authority exists. Attempts to create one have historically failed; the Seyiki are too independent, too scattered, and too suspicious of concentrated power (they remember, mythologically, what happened to the Postronamas).

### Culture

**Vertical Life:** Status correlates with elevation. Pillar-tops are prestigious; base-dwellers are low-caste. Everything important happens high up.

**The Robes:** All Seyiki wear flowing garments that convert to wingsuits when falling. This isn't fashion—it's survival. A Seyiki without their robe is naked in a way that has nothing to do with modesty.

**Dragonfly Bonds:** The relationship between gnome and mount is intimate and lifelong. Losing a dragonfly is a genuine tragedy; bonding with a new one takes months of patient work.

**The Reaping:** The seven-year locust swarms are the most important cultural event. Seyiki don't hide—they hunt, riding into the swarms to harvest locusts by the ton. A gnome's worth is measured partly by how many Reapings they've survived.

### Economy

Seyiki export crystal fragments (twyl from depleted pillars), dragonfly chitin, and locust products. They import metal, textiles, and luxuries through Jüt. Trade caravans are rare; most commerce happens via dragonfly-back, with hauler-breeds carrying cargo between pillars and to the coast.

### Military

Seyiki warriors are fantastic fighters despite their small size. Their combat doctrine emphasizes three-dimensional movement: dropping from above, striking from unexpected angles, retreating upward or into the air. On their home pillars, they're nearly impossible to defeat; enemies can't pursue them vertically, and the gnomes know every passage and platform.

The dragonfly-mounted cavalry is feared across the region. War-dancer breeds are fast, maneuverable, and aggressive. A Seyiki warband can harry an army indefinitely, picking off stragglers, raiding supply lines, and never committing to a fight they might lose.

### Relations

**Jüt:** Primary trading partner. The coastal city is the Seyiki's window to the wider world. Relations are commercial and cordial.

**The Orc States:** Distant but wary. The orcs control the inland Westwilds; the Seyiki control the desert pillars. Neither has much the other wants, so conflict is rare.

**Treasure Hunters:** A constant irritation. Outsiders seeking crystal cores are tolerated if they ask permission; those who try to claim pillars by force discover why the Seyiki have held this territory for millennia.

### Notable Locations

See atlas entry for Chakatann. The pillars themselves are the notable locations—each one a vertical village with its own character, history, and specializations.

### Player Hooks

- Hire Seyiki guides to cross the Piktiniti safely
- Seek Postronamas artifacts in the ruins near Enimogos (the Seyiki won't help, but they might not stop you)
- Join a Reaping—outsiders who prove themselves worthy earn Seyiki respect
- Investigate a pillar whose crystal core has begun humming *wrong*
- Mediate a dispute between pillar-communities threatening to escalate into inter-pillar war

## Shazuihn

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

They come from the east on giant boars, screaming, axes raised, and when they leave there's nothing but blood and burning. The Shazuihni don't build. They don't negotiate. They don't farm. They raid, they take, and they vanish back into the forest before anyone can retaliate.

The other orc states call them savages. The Shazuihni call themselves free.

### Overview

The Shazuihni are everything the other orc states have evolved past—or so the other states like to believe. They're enormous, hairy, and violent. They ride massive boars that can gore a horse to death. They wield axes that need two ordinary orcs to lift. They attack without warning, take what they want, and disappear.

But dismissing them as simple brutes is a mistake. The Shazuihni have survived for centuries in the hostile borderlands between forest and steppe. They've resisted every attempt to conquer or civilize them. They maintain a complex relationship with their boar herds that borders on spiritual. And their "primitive" raids have bled the other orc states for generations.

They're not sophisticated. They don't need to be. They're doing fine.

### Government

**Type:** War-Chief Dominance

The Shazuihni don't have formal government. They have whoever is strongest. A War-Chief rules until someone kills them or proves themselves more worthy of leadership—usually by killing them.

**Current Leadership:**
- **War-Chief Grokthul the Boar-Father** — Massive even by Shazuihni standards, Grokthul has ruled for fifteen years by being too dangerous to challenge. His boar, Skull-Splitter, has killed more orcs than most warriors.
- **The Blood-Riders** — A loose council of the most successful raiders. They advise Grokthul (when he asks, which is rarely) and lead their own warbands independently.
- **The Boar-Speakers** — Shamans who maintain the bond between riders and mounts. They hold surprising influence because without healthy boars, there are no raids.

Leadership changes frequently. Three War-Chiefs in the last generation died in raids; two were killed by rivals; one was trampled by his own boar. The Shazuihni consider this natural. The strong rule until they're not strong anymore.

### Culture

**The Shazuihni** are the largest of the Wildwood orcs—easily seven feet tall, covered in coarse hair, with prominent tusks and small, cunning eyes. They look like someone crossed an orc with an ogre, which may not be entirely wrong. Their intelligence is... different. Not absent, but focused. They don't think abstractly. They don't plan far ahead. They react, adapt, and survive.

**Core Values:**
- **Strength Is Everything** — The strong take. The weak give. This is how the world works.
- **The Boar Is Brother** — A rider and boar are bonded for life. Harming someone's boar is worse than harming them directly.
- **Take What You Need** — Property belongs to whoever can hold it. Theft is just a test of strength.
- **Die Well** — Death in battle is glorious. Death from old age or sickness is shameful. The best deaths involve taking enemies with you.

**Society:** Shazuihni society is organized around boar-bonds and war-bands. A young orc bonds with a boar around age ten—a dangerous process that kills many aspirants. Those who survive become riders; those who fail become servants, cooks, or corpses.

War-bands form around successful raiders. A rider who brings back good plunder attracts followers. A rider who fails too often finds themselves alone, which in the Shazuihni world is a death sentence.

Women raid alongside men. Children learn to ride before they learn to walk. The elderly—the few who reach old age—are quietly abandoned when they can no longer keep up. The Shazuihni don't discuss this. It simply happens.

**The Boars:** Giant boars, bred for size and aggression over centuries. A full-grown Shazuihni war-boar stands five feet at the shoulder, weighs over a thousand pounds, and has tusks that can punch through wooden shields. They're not horses—they're partners. The bond between rider and boar is genuine and profound, the one area where the Shazuihni show something like tenderness.

### Economy

**Size:** Very Small (formal economy)
**Tech:** Undeveloped

**Primary Exports:**
- Nothing (they don't trade)

**Primary Imports:**
- Nothing (they take what they need)

The Shazuihni don't have an economy in any meaningful sense. They raid for what they need—food, weapons, captives, anything useful. What they can't raid for, they do without.

Between raids, they hunt in the forests and steppes. The boars root for tubers and mushrooms. Captured slaves do the work the Shazuihni find beneath them. It's not sustainable in any civilized sense, but it's sustained them for centuries.

**The Captive Question:** The Shazuihni take slaves in their raids. Some are worked to death. Some are ransomed back. Some eventually earn acceptance by proving useful. A few have even become riders, though this is rare. The other orc states condemn this practice while quietly engaging in their own forms of bondage.

### Military

**Size:** Medium
**Quality:** High (in specific contexts)
**Enrollment:** Universal (all riders raid)

The Shazuihni military is simple: riders on boars with big axes. There's no infantry, no archers, no siege equipment. Just speed, mass, and overwhelming violence.

**The Raid:** A typical Shazuihni raid involves twenty to fifty riders appearing without warning, hitting a target hard, grabbing everything portable, and vanishing before defenders can organize. They don't hold territory. They don't fight pitched battles. They strike and run.

**Boar Charge:** The signature Shazuihni tactic. Fifty war-boars charging in formation create a wall of tusks, hooves, and screaming riders that can break any conventional defensive line. The charge is nearly unstoppable—but it only works once per battle. If the first charge doesn't break the enemy, the Shazuihni retreat to try again another day.

**Weaknesses:**
- Terrible at defense. They don't build fortifications and don't know how to hold ground.
- Useless in confined spaces. The boars need room to move.
- No ranged capability worth mentioning.
- Dependent on boar health. Sick boars mean no raids.
- Can't sustain long campaigns. They hit and run; they don't siege.

### Geography

**Location:** Eastern Wildwood edge, where forest meets the Steppe of Aziirn

**Biomes:** Forest margins, scattered woodland, open steppe

**Key Locations:**
- **The Rooting Grounds** — Semi-permanent camps where the boar herds graze and breed. Sacred to the Shazuihni.
- **The Blood Road** — The main raiding path west into Hedroscobb territory. Generations of raids have worn it into the land.
- **The Scorches** — Geothermal region to the north. Too dangerous for regular habitation but used as a retreat when enemies pursue.
- **Dragon Spout** — Where void and fire meet. The Shazuihni avoid it but use it as a boundary marker.

**Borders:**
- West: Hedroscobb (primary raiding target)
- Northwest: Tarn (secondary raiding target)
- North: The Scorches, eventually the northern steppes
- East: Steppe of Aziirn (mostly empty; occasional contact with steppe peoples)
- South: Wurmspine Mountains region

### Relations

**Hedroscobb:** Primary target. The Black Orcs have things the Shazuihni want—metal, food, slaves. The algae-iron armor is a problem, but the Shazuihni have learned to avoid the armored infantry and hit softer targets. This war has continued for generations with no end in sight.

**Tarn:** Secondary target. The Tarni spirit warriors are individually dangerous—nearly impossible to kill quickly—but they're few in number. Hit-and-run tactics work well against them. The river territory offers good plunder.

**Glivornax:** No direct contact. Tarn lies between Shazuihn and the Glivornaxi.

**Uhionai:** The Shazuihni learned the hard way not to raid the Wooden Men. The Ryunimir Forest is too dense for boars, and the Uihonaii make anyone who enters pay dearly. One catastrophic defeat was enough.

**Grieb:** No raids. Two generations ago, War-Chief Grulnak led fifty riders against the lakemen. Three came back. The boars won't go near water now—they remember something the riders won't talk about. The territory might be valuable, but nobody's willing to pay that price again.

**Vogenfeld:** The Shazuihni would love to raid the dwarves, but Hedroscobb is in the way. By the time raiders fight through Black Orc territory, they're too depleted to challenge mountain fortresses.

**The Orc Moot:** The Shazuihni attend irregularly. When they come, they demand tribute from the other states for "protection" (from themselves). This rarely works, but they keep trying.

### Conflicts

**The Eternal Raid:** The Shazuihni are always raiding someone. It's not a conflict that can be won or lost—it's a permanent state of affairs. They raid to survive. They survive to raid.

**The Boar Plague:** A sickness swept through the herds two years ago, killing a third of the war-boars. The Shazuihni are still recovering. Raids have been smaller and less frequent, but this won't last. The herds are growing again.

**The Eastern Question:** The steppe peoples beyond Aziirn have their own horse-riders and their own ambitions. Occasional clashes have occurred. If the steppe tribes ever unified, the Shazuihni would face a serious threat—but the steppes are even more fragmented than the Wildwood.

### History

Where did the Shazuihni come from? No one's sure. They were raiding the Wildwood before the other orc states formed. They might be descendants of ogre-orc crossbreeding. They might be an ancient orc lineage that never "civilized." They might have wandered in from the eastern steppes generations ago.

They don't keep records. They don't tell origin stories. They raid, they survive, they die in battle if they're lucky. That's enough history for them.

The other orc states have tried everything to stop them. Alliances, punitive expeditions, assassination attempts, even bribery. Nothing has worked. The Shazuihni absorb losses, retreat into the steppes, breed more boars, and come back. They're a fact of life in the Wildwood, as constant as the seasons and twice as destructive.

### Player Hooks

- Survive being captured in a Shazuihni raid
- Negotiate with a War-Chief for passage through their territory (bring gifts)
- Bond with a Shazuihni war-boar (extremely dangerous; possibly lethal)
- Investigate the boar plague—was it natural or something else?
- Hire Shazuihni mercenaries (they'll work for enough plunder)
- Unite the other orc states against the eternal raids (probably impossible)
- Convince the Shazuihni to raid somewhere truly dangerous (like Vogenfeld)

## Sheîr

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Feudal monarchy (nominal), island autonomy (actual)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Bledreon Islanders (humans with dual-lid eyes), various mainland humans

**Population**: ~35,000 (capital ~8,000; scattered island populations ~27,000)

**Stability**: Stable in chaos (the system is dysfunction, but it functions)

**Core Values**: Naval freedom, island pride, ancestral territory, the hunt

Sheîr is two nations wearing one crown. The capital—called simply **The Seat**—is a proper kingdom: courts, nobles, laws, tax collectors. The islands are something else entirely. Bledreon sailors acknowledge the king exists. They ignore everything he says.

The Bledreon Islanders are immediately recognizable: their eyes have dual lids, an inner membrane that protects against salt spray and harsh sun. They can see underwater with surprising clarity. Some claim the trait comes from interbreeding with sea spirits; the Bledreon say their ancestors simply learned to live at sea until the sea lived in them.

The capital's nobles are a different breed—mainlanders who married into island families or received land grants from forgotten kings. They ride **raptors**—swift, vicious creatures somewhere between lizard and bird—and maintain the deadliest land army in the Western Isles. When Sheîr's raptors land on an island, everyone on that island dies.

### The Ghost Treaty

Sheîr's relationship with Tarkhon is... complicated.

Five hundred years ago—before the Tarkhon Empire existed as such—the Neferati fire-bloods made a pact with Sheîr's ancestors. The terms were specific: Sheîr would provide naval support to whoever held the Evertorch in Tarkhetan. In exchange, the Neferati would never claim Sheîr as territory, would guarantee its independence, and would support it against external threats.

The pact was sworn on the Evertorch itself. It cannot be broken by either party—only renegotiated by mutual agreement.

When the Severance happened and humans inherited Tarkhon, they inherited the pact too. The current emperor claims this makes Sheîr a vassal—bound to support whoever holds the Evertorch. Sheîr's king argues the pact makes them *equals*—allies, not subjects, with no obligation beyond what they choose to give.

Both interpretations are legally defensible. Neither side wants to test the pact's limits.

In practice: Sheîr sends ships when Tarkhon calls—sometimes. Sheîr's nobles occasionally lend their raptor cavalry to Tarkhon's campaigns—when they feel like it. Tarkhon doesn't try to tax Sheîr or station troops there. Everyone pretends this is a functioning relationship.

The Kingdoms of Fire find the whole arrangement darkly amusing. The pact was with the Neferati. Perhaps the *original* holders of the Evertorch could interpret it differently...

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Standard, advanced shipbuilding

**Primary Exports**: Ships, sailors, fish, sea products, raptor mounts (rarely)

**Primary Imports**: Grain, metals, luxury goods, mainlander goods

Sheîr builds the best ships in the Western Isles. The Bledreon have been sailing these waters for centuries; they know what works. Shipyards on the larger islands produce vessels for clients across the Shattered Sea.

The islands themselves produce fish, salt, and various sea products. Some islands have valuable timber; others have little but rock and stubbornness. The capital controls most overland trade with Tarkhon.

Raptor breeding is controlled exclusively by noble families. The creatures are too dangerous and too valuable to sell casually. Occasionally a foreign noble will pay an obscene price for a trained mount—but they rarely survive long without Sheîr handlers.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Naval excellence, elite cavalry

**Enrollment**: Island volunteers (navy), noble retinues (cavalry)

Sheîr's military has two branches that barely interact:

**The Island Fleets**

Every significant island maintains its own ships and crews. There's no unified navy—each captain answers to their island elder. When Sheîr needs a fleet, the king sends word and captains who feel like responding show up. This sounds chaotic. It is. But it also means enemy raiders never know how many ships they'll face.

The Bledreon fight from ships with devastating effectiveness. Their dual-lid eyes let them see in spray and sun. They can dive overboard, swim to enemy vessels, and attack from below. Most naval powers fear engaging them.

**The Raptor Nobility**

The capital's nobles breed and ride raptors—pack-hunting predators standing taller than a man. The creatures are stupid, vicious, and terrifyingly fast. They hunt by running prey to exhaustion, then tearing it apart.

On open ground, raptor cavalry is nearly unstoppable. The problem is reaching open ground—Sheîr is mostly islands and water. But when the nobles land their raptors on an enemy island, the result is massacre. This happens rarely, but the threat keeps rival islands from pushing too hard.

### Geography

**Location**: Eastern Western Isles, jutting into the Shattered Sea from the Tarkhon coast

**Biomes**: Island archipelago, coastal mainland territory

**Climate**: Warm maritime, frequent storms

**Named Features**: The Seat (capital), Phyndarr Sound (northern waters), numerous unnamed islands

Sheîr straddles the boundary between the Western Isles and Tarkhon proper. The mainland portion is small—a coastal strip with the capital city. The real territory is the islands: dozens of them spreading west into the Shattered Sea.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Seat (~8,000)

**Major Islands**: Named by their elders, too numerous to list. Larger islands have populations of 500-2,000; smaller ones might have a few families.

### The Seat

The capital is everything the islands aren't: orderly, hierarchical, concerned with appearances. Stone buildings line planned streets. Nobles maintain townhouses and compete for proximity to the palace. The royal court observes elaborate protocols that islanders consider laughable.

**King Varos III** rules from the Driftwood Throne—carved from timbers of the ship that supposedly carried the first Bledreon to these shores. He's thirty-seven, competent, and increasingly frustrated by his inability to actually control the islands that are nominally his.

The Seat's power comes from three sources: control of Tarkhon trade, the raptor cavalry, and the legal fiction that the king speaks for all Sheîr. The first two are real. The third is useful mainly for negotiating with foreigners who expect someone to be in charge.

### The Islands

The islands govern themselves through tradition. Each has an elder or council; decisions are made by consensus or force. The king has no authority there. He can request assistance, but islanders respond only to direct threats or opportunities for profit.

Island culture values freedom above all. A Bledreon sailor answers to their captain, their captain answers to their elder, and their elder answers to no one. This makes coordinating anything nearly impossible—but it also means no foreign power can conquer Sheîr by taking the capital.

**Key Island Groups:**
- **The Inner Ring**: Islands closest to the mainland, most influenced by capital politics
- **The Drift**: Central island clusters where the true Bledreon traditions survive
- **The Far Reach**: Western islands barely connected to Sheîr at all—practically independent states

### Primary Conflicts

**King vs. Islands**

King Varos wants to actually rule his kingdom. The islands want to be left alone. This tension has existed since Sheîr's founding and will probably never resolve. Varos's recent attempts to collect island taxes have been met with selective deafness.

**The Ghost Treaty Question**

What exactly does Sheîr owe Tarkhon? The empire keeps pushing for more active support. Sheîr keeps finding reasons to provide less. Eventually someone will force the issue—and then the ancient pact will be tested in ways no one can predict.

**The Fire Kingdom Interest**

The Kingdoms of Fire have started asking questions about the Ghost Treaty. The pact was with the Neferati who held the Evertorch. What if the original holders reclaimed their flame? Would the treaty transfer? Some in Sheîr are curious. Others are terrified of being caught between Tarkhon and the Fire Kingdoms.

**Raptor Succession**

The noble families who breed raptors are dying out. Three of the seven breeding bloodlines have ended in the past century. The remaining families guard their secrets jealously—but secrets don't help if there's no one to inherit them.

### Notable Figures

**King Varos III** — Ruler of Sheîr in name, frustrated administrator in practice. Competent, ambitious, and increasingly willing to take risks to expand his actual authority.

**Elder Kresh of the Drift** — Unofficial leader of the island faction. Eighty years old, sailor since childhood, respected across the archipelago. When Kresh speaks, islanders listen—which is more than the king can say.

**Duchess Seravyn** — Leader of the raptor cavalry and head of the oldest breeding family. Cold, competent, and deeply concerned about her family's fading bloodline. Has three daughters; none have the talent for raptor bonding.

**Captain Drell Stormwake** — Most famous Bledreon sailor alive. Commands a fleet of twelve ships that he's built up through piracy, trade, and strategic marriages. Theoretically loyal to Elder Kresh; practically loyal to profit.

### History

**The First Bledreon**: The islands were settled long ago by humans who developed—or acquired—their distinctive eye trait. Origin stories vary; the Bledreon don't much care which is true.

**The Neferati Pact** (~500 years ago): When the Neferati were building what would become Tarkhon, they needed naval support. They couldn't conquer the Bledreon, so they made a deal. The Ghost Treaty has bound Sheîr to whoever holds the Evertorch ever since.

**The Severance**: When humans inherited Tarkhon, they inherited the pact. The relationship has been contentious ever since—Sheîr honoring the letter while ignoring the spirit.

**The Present**: A kingdom divided against itself, bound by an ancient treaty to an empire it doesn't respect, and increasingly caught between Tarkhon and the Fire Kingdoms. Something will break eventually.

## Shykasas

Tags: state, shacklands, alekroin

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Alekroin

**Population**: 10,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Patience, territorial dominance, ancestral tradition, predatory hierarchy

The King of Shykasas rules over the six noble houses from the Palace of the Six Jaws in Vila Bonsa. Royal succession follows ancient ritual: an egg is selected from the King's brood and incubated in isolation at precise temperatures, watched by keepers who will never see it hatch. The chosen heir grows larger, stronger, and more cunning than any other Alekroin. The process is not explained to outsiders.

Each noble house controls territory within the archipelago and maintains its own hunting traditions, but all defer to the crown in matters of foreign policy and territorial defense. Internal disputes are settled through ritualized challenges—rarely lethal, but always decisive.

Shykasas has no allies because it wants none. The Alekroin view diplomatic relationships as a form of weakness, an admission that one cannot survive alone. They trade when convenient but make no treaties, sign no pacts, and join no coalitions.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Medicinal plants, bioluminescent algae, cured hides, rare shells, aquaculture products

**Primary Imports**: Metals, worked steel, luxury goods

The swamps provide abundantly for those who know how to harvest them. The Alekroin have developed sophisticated aquaculture, cultivating shellfish and medicinal plants in managed pools throughout the archipelago. Their bioluminescent algae—harvested from the deeper channels—fetches high prices in foreign markets for both decorative and alchemical purposes.

Trade happens on Alekroin terms. Foreign merchants are restricted to Bixesarri on the outer islands. The Alekroin do not haggle, do not negotiate, and do not explain their prices. Traders who complain are free to leave and never return.

Metal remains the critical import. The swamps offer no ore deposits, and the Alekroin require steel for tools, weapons, and construction. This dependency is their only significant vulnerability, and they maintain carefully hidden stockpiles against the possibility of trade disruption.

### Military

**Size**: Very small

**Quality**: Exceptional

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (effectively universal)

Every adult Alekroin is a capable combatant—their predatory physiology and lifelong hunting experience make formal military training almost redundant. The "military" consists primarily of the coastwatch stationed at Erez and similar posts, who track vessel movements and coordinate responses to intrusion.

When Shykasas goes to war, it does so with the patient, methodical lethality of its people. They do not march in formations or hold battle lines. They wait in water that looks empty until it isn't. Three Gorathi survey vessels learned this lesson. Gorath has not sent a fourth.

An individual Alekroin can engage four or more typical soldiers with reasonable odds of victory. They are ambush predators by nature and training, striking from unexpected angles and using terrain that advantages them and disadvantages everyone else.

### Geography

**Location**: Southwestern Shacklands, between the Sea of Sighs and open ocean

**Biomes**: Saltwater swamp, tidal marshland, mangrove forest, coastal archipelago

**Climate**: Hot, humid, monsoon seasons

**Named Entities**:
- Turiik Forest (northern mangrove boundary)
- Soso Mari (southern tidal bay)
- Thizun (taboo ruins, northwest island)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Numerous tidal channels; no major freshwater rivers

**Adjacent Waters**: Sea of Sighs (north), open ocean (south and west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Vila Bonsa

**Cities**: None (Vila Bonsa is the only major settlement)

**Towns**: Bixesarri (trade), Ansalonga (hunting), Molleres (eastern border), Arinsal (aquaculture), Erez (coastwatch)

**Villages**: Sornas (fishing/pearl diving)

### Relations

**Gorath**: Cold indifference. Gorath wants shipping access through Soso Mari; Shykasas has not responded to diplomatic overtures. Three survey vessels have entered the bay; none returned. The matter remains unresolved.

**Lyoki Ingi Ingi**: Neutral non-interference. The Mudzwiti goblins and Alekroin share a border at Molleres. Both peoples are territorial and respect boundaries. Trade is minimal but not hostile.

**Kyagos**: No meaningful contact. The mountain island's recent revolution has not affected Shykasas in any way.

**Slave Trade**: No participation. The Alekroin have no interest in slavery—they consider the practice inefficient and demeaning to the enslaved (who become prey) and the enslaver (who relies on prey for labor).

### Primary Conflicts

**The Soso Mari Question**: Gorath's interest in the bay shipping lanes remains unresolved. The Alekroin's continued silence forces Gorath to choose between accepting the status quo and risking another expensive lesson.

**Thizun**: The taboo ruins occasionally attract treasure hunters. The Alekroin do not interfere with these expeditions, but neither do they assist. Something in those ruins prevents most explorers from returning, and the Alekroin seem content to let this natural defense continue.

**Succession Tensions**: The ritual selection of royal heirs occasionally generates resentment among noble houses whose eggs were passed over. These tensions rarely escalate beyond pointed comments and careful watching.

### History

The Alekroin have occupied these swamps for millennia. Their oral histories speak of arriving from elsewhere—"when the waters were different"—but the details have been worn smooth by generations of retelling. What remains is the certainty that they belong here and always have.

Thizun predates them. The ruins were already ancient and already taboo when the first Alekroin settled the archipelago. The prohibition against visiting the site has been maintained without explanation for as long as anyone can remember.

Shykasas has never been conquered. Several powers have considered the attempt over the centuries. Those who proceeded learned why the others did not.

## Silwyn

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council of Herd-Chiefs

**Primary Inhabitants**: Silzar (plains ogres)

**Population**: ~4,000

**Stability**: Somewhat Stable

**Core Values**: Kindness, strength, toughness, grit, connection to the plains

The Silzar have no permanent leadership. When the mammoth herds converge at seasonal watering grounds, the herd-chiefs meet in council to decide matters affecting all Silwyn. Decisions require broad consensus—but any chief who disagrees strongly enough can simply leave with their herd. This makes Silzar politics slow and frustrating to outsiders, but it has kept them unified through decades of war.

The entire culture rests on the Mammoth Covenant: a spiritual pact formed generations ago between the Silzar and the great mammoth herds. The mammoths are not beasts of burden or war animals—they are partners. A Silzar who mistreats a mammoth is exiled. One who kills a mammoth without dire need is killed in turn. In exchange, the mammoths carry the Silzar to war, share their strength, and grant them dominion over the open plains.

This covenant defines what the Silzar are. It also limits what they can become.


### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Mammoth ivory, cured leather, bone-craft

**Primary Imports**: Metal, timber, rope and fiber

The Silzar economy runs on three things: what the mammoths provide, what the plains provide, and what they take from Iylovia.

Mammoth ivory, leather, and bone form the basis of Silzar craftsmanship. They're skilled workers—their bone carvings and leather goods are prized by traders willing to make the journey. But they have no metal deposits, no forests, no fiber crops. Everything that isn't meat, milk, leather, or bone must come from outside.

Timber and rope come from Iylovia, taken in raids. Metal is harder. The Silzar trade with merchants who travel up from the southern desert routes—exchanging ivory and leather for iron and bronze. It's never enough. Every ballistae bolt represents precious metal that can't be replaced easily.

This scarcity shapes everything. The Silzar don't waste. They don't build permanent structures. They repair and reuse until nothing remains. And they raid Iylovia not from cruelty but from genuine need—the forests have what the plains lack.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

The Silzar field perhaps 800 warriors at full muster—a tiny force by any standard. But those 800 ride war mammoths carrying ballistae platforms, and on open ground, nothing in the region can stand against them.

A mammoth charge breaks formations. The ballistae—massive torsion crossbows firing bolts the length of a man's arm—shatter shield walls and fortifications from range. And the trumpeting... the coordinated trumpeting of a mammoth war-line drowns out commands, drowns out thought, drowns out the whispers of the Gyv forest-magic.

The Silzar don't fight in organized ranks. Each mammoth is a mobile fortress crewed by three to five warriors—a driver, a ballistae operator, and flankers with bows or javelins. They coordinate through horn signals and generations of shared instinct. On the plains, they're unstoppable.

In the forests, they're helpless. Mammoths can't maneuver between dense trees. Ballistae can't aim through canopy. The whispers creep in despite the trumpeting. Every attempt to push into Iylovia's forests has ended in disaster—warriors stumbling out days later, half-mad, having killed their own companions in the confusion.

This is the heart of the Silzar dilemma. Their greatest strength is useless against the enemy they most need to defeat.


### Geography

**Location**: Landlocked plains in northwestern Rimihuica

**Biomes**: Temperate grassland, savanna

**Named Entities**: The Thundering Way, Grandmother's Rest, The Scar, Avil Lakes, seasonal gathering grounds

**Rivers & Lakes**: The Silwyn River (flows north through the plains into Iylovia), Avil Lakes (southern plains, trade meeting point)

**Adjacent Waters**: None (landlocked)

Silwyn occupies a pocket of grassland surrounded by impassable barriers. To the north lies Eros—the haunted forest of the Nemo, which no Silzar will enter under any circumstances. To the east stretches Iylovia, enemy territory, dense forest where mammoths cannot go. To the south and west, desert—death for any creature the size of a mammoth.

The Silzar are trapped in their own homeland. They dominate everything they can reach and can reach nothing worth dominating.

The Silwyn River flows from springs in the southern highlands, running north through the heart of the plains before crossing into Iylovia. This river is the lifeblood of the region—and a source of bitter internal debate. The Silzar could dam it, poison it, use it as a weapon against the Gyv. Some younger warriors argue they should. The elders refuse. Water is sacred under the Mammoth Covenant; it belongs to all living things. To weaponize it would be to become something less than Silzar.

The argument continues. The river flows on.


### Political Geography

**Capital**: None

**Cities**: None

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: None (seasonal gathering grounds only)

The Silzar build nothing permanent. They follow the mammoth herds along the Thundering Way—the ancient migration route that loops through the plains with the seasons. Where the herds stop, the Silzar stop. Where the herds move, the Silzar move.

Seasonal gathering grounds serve as temporary centers of Silzar life. The largest is where the river bends sharply east—here, in summer, as many as half the Silzar converge when multiple herds come to drink. Chiefs meet, disputes are settled, young people from different herds meet and marry, and traders from outside know they can find customers.

Grandmother's Rest is different—a lone rocky hill rising from the plains where, according to tradition, the first mammoth to accept the Covenant died of old age. The Silzar leave offerings here: carved bone, braided grass, small treasures. No one camps at Grandmother's Rest. It is for the dead.


### Primary Conflicts

**The War with Iylovia**

For forty-odd years, the Silzar have been driving the Gyv back. What was once Gyv territory from the forest to the desert is now Silwyn—plains that the Silzar took field by field, settlement by settlement, until the Gyv retreated into forests too dense to follow.

Now the war has stalled. The Silzar control everything they can reach. The Gyv hold everything the Silzar can't take. Raiding continues along the forest edge—the Silzar take timber, rope, food, whatever they can carry. The Gyv ambush anyone who pushes too deep. Neither side can end it.

**The Internal Schism**

The real threat to Silwyn isn't the Gyv. It's the question of what the Silzar are willing to become to win.

Traditionalists—mostly older chiefs who remember the days before the Covenant made them strong—insist that victory means nothing if it costs them their souls. The Covenant has rules. Water is sacred. The mammoths must be honored. There are lines that cannot be crossed.

Progressives—mostly younger warriors who have never known anything but war—argue that rules are luxuries. Dam the river. Send warriors in on foot. Burn the forest if necessary. End this, whatever it takes, and worry about the Covenant afterward.

This schism cuts through every herd, every family. Chiefs who were allies for decades now eye each other with suspicion. The next council gathering may not end in consensus. It may end in blood.

**The Water Question**

The river flows from Silwyn into Iylovia. The Gyv need it. The Silzar could take it.

Every few years, someone proposes damming the river. Every few years, the elders refuse. But the pressure grows. The war grinds on. Young warriors ask why their friends are dying in forest ambushes when they could end the Gyv in a single season by turning off the water.

The elders say: because we are not monsters. Because the mammoths would know. Because some victories cost more than defeat.

The young warriors say: the mammoths don't care about Gyv children. The Covenant is about us and them, not us and the enemy. Stop hiding behind tradition and win this war.

No one has acted. Yet.


### History

**The Old Days**

Before the Covenant, the Silzar were nothing. Scattered bands of plains ogres, hunted by predators, raided by the Gyv, barely surviving in the grasslands no one else wanted. The Gyv controlled the entire region—plains and forest both—and considered the ogres vermin to be culled when their numbers grew troublesome.

Silzar elders still tell stories of those days. Hiding in gullies while Gyv hunting parties rode past. Watching children starve because the Gyv had burned the grasslands for sport. Being captured and made to work until they died. The Silzar remember. They will never forget.

**The Mammoth Covenant**

How the Covenant began is sacred knowledge, shared only in certain ceremonies. What outsiders know is this: somehow, the Silzar formed an alliance with the great mammoth herds. Not domestication—partnership. The mammoths accepted Silzar riders in exchange for protection, guidance, and respect.

Within two generations, everything changed. Mammoth-mounted Silzar could cross the plains in days instead of weeks. They could carry supplies, shelter behind mammoth bodies, strike and retreat before enemies could respond. And when they learned to mount ballistae on mammoth platforms...

The Gyv didn't understand the threat until it was far too late.

**The Turning**

The first Silzar victories were small. A Gyv outpost overrun. A hunting party slaughtered. The Gyv sent punitive expeditions; the Silzar ambushed them on open ground and left no survivors.

Then the Silzar stopped hiding. They rode in force against Gyv settlements on the plains—and the settlements fell. One after another. Year after year. The Gyv retreated toward the forests, burning what they couldn't carry, but the Silzar just kept coming.

In a single generation, the Silzar took the plains. Gyv who had owned this land for centuries fled east or died where they stood.

**The Stall**

And then the Silzar reached the treeline, and everything stopped.

The first assault into the forest was a disaster. Two hundred warriors went in. Thirty came out, raving about trees that moved and voices that came from everywhere and friends who turned on friends. The mammoths had refused to enter at all.

The second assault went worse. The Silzar tried to cut paths, to burn clearings, to force the forest open. The forest fought back. Warriors vanished. Supply lines collapsed. Chiefs died to their own warriors' hands, driven mad by whispers they couldn't escape.

Now the Silzar raid the forest's edge and go no deeper. They've won everything the mammoths can reach. They've lost every battle the mammoths can't fight.

The war continues. Neither side can end it.


### Relations

**Iylovia**: Active war. The Silzar raid constantly; the Gyv defend desperately. Neither side negotiates. Both sides hate.

**Eros**: Terror. The Silzar will not enter the haunted forest under any circumstances. They don't speak of the Nemo. They pretend the northern border doesn't exist.

**Southern Traders**: Wary commerce. Merchants from the desert routes trade metal for ivory and leather. They don't stay long.

**Everyone Else**: Silwyn is too isolated for most nations to care about. Those who know of the Silzar know only that they're dangerous mammoth-riders in a distant grassland, fighting some forest people for reasons no one bothers to understand.


### Player Hooks

**The Schism**: The next council gathering could tear Silwyn apart. Both sides might seek outside help—mercenaries, advisors, assassins. Players could tip the balance either way.

**The Water Decision**: Someone might actually try to dam the river. What happens then? Do the players help, stop them, or deal with the consequences?

**Breaking the Stalemate**: Either side might hire outsiders to do what they cannot. The Silzar might want specialists who can fight in forests. The Gyv might want someone to sabotage the mammoth herds. Players could end this war—for better or worse.

**The Mammoth Plague**: A sickness spreading through the herds. The Silzar are desperate for a cure. Without the mammoths, they're nothing—prey again, like in the old days.

**What Lies North**: Someone needs to go into Eros. The Silzar won't do it. They'll pay anything—anything—for someone else to face what they cannot.

## Stipen

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Gerontocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Ezuri (Tree Gnomes)

**Population**: 9,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Truth, honor, creativity, beauty

- Settlements are built into massive trees—interconnected homes supported by living wood.
- The Ezuri here live up to 500 years, their longevity sustained by the trees themselves. To leave the forest is to give that up.
- Upon reaching elder years, you join the Stipen Council, which makes all decisions for the state.
- Fully integrated with the trees—they can speak with them and are expert gardeners.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Specialty flora

**Primary Imports**: None

- Largely self-sufficient. People grow their own gardens in the trees, kept alive and producing through accelerated growth magic.
- People rarely leave—their longevity is tied to the forest.
- Trade is minimal; outsiders are tolerated but not encouraged.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Very High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- Although not formally trained, the Stipen people are incredibly adept at working with nature to fight back against enemies.
- All their might is defensive. Outside the forest, they lose their connection and their power.
- The forest itself fights for them—trees shift, roots trip, branches strike.

### Geography

**Location**: Middle Sea coast along the Chedwin Strait, east of Thespia, north of Zintacas

**Biomes**: Ancient forest (entirely forested)

**Climate**: Temperate coastal—mild, humid, perfect for trees

**Named Features**: Teleriwood (western forest), Schousterwood (eastern forest)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Atra

**Cities**: None (Atra is the closest thing)

**Towns**: Shamwet, Kestrel, and scattered tree-settlements throughout the forest

### Primary Conflicts

**The Generational Divide**

There is growing tension between the young and old. The council of elders makes all decisions, but young Ezuri—who may be a century old and still considered "youth"—feel they lack any representation. Elders dismiss their concerns as impatience; youth see elders as out of touch with a changing world.

**The Drug Question**

Psychedelic substances have been discovered—flora that grows in the deeper parts of the forest. Some Ezuri use them for spiritual experiences or creative inspiration. The council has not approved, viewing them as dangerous or corrupting. The debate is quiet but persistent.

**Isolation vs. Engagement**

The outside world is increasingly chaotic—mad queens in Thespia, silvertongue plagues in Ubrik, dragon standoffs. Some younger Ezuri think Stipen should engage more, help their neighbors, participate in the wider world. Elders argue that leaving the forest means death, and involvement brings only trouble.

### History

The Ezuri came to these forests long ago, fleeing the Mad Gorehorn disease that ravaged the Jungles of Titania. They climbed into the trees to escape and never came down. Over centuries, they bonded with the forest until their lives became intertwined with it.

Now Stipen is an ancient, peaceful realm where gnomes live for centuries among the branches. They want nothing from the outside world, and hope the outside world wants nothing from them.

## Sylke

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Oznak, Tikhaya

**Population**: 300,000

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Duty, privacy, minding one's own business, nihilism

- Ruled by Queen Alisandra the Merciful—a title dripping with irony. She's calculating, cruel, and has no qualms about massive human sacrifice to power Deoric magic for the throne.
- The population has learned not to ask questions. Eyes and ears are everywhere. Neighbors inform on neighbors. The queen knows everything, and then some.
- Sylke functions with brutal efficiency. Taxes are collected, roads are maintained, criminals are punished. The cost is freedom, privacy, and anyone who draws the queen's attention.
- Recently conquered Tornia in a swift, "fairly bloodless" war. Now Alisandra rules two of Ofrenia's three kingdoms—with Joswik clearly next on her list.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Very Developed

**Primary Exports**: Lumber, manufactured goods, ships

**Primary Imports**: Grain, minerals, slaves (through intermediaries)

- Sylke's forests are legendary—dense, well-managed, and producing timber that builds ships across the Middle Sea.
- The economy runs on Deoric magic, which runs on human sacrifice. The Ivory Hand ensures a steady supply of victims, disguised as criminals, prisoners, and the inconvenient.
- With Tornia now under her control, Alisandra has access to Gem Crest Bay's trade routes and Besnoumeru's financial networks. She's moving quickly to integrate these assets.
- Myastor serves as Sylke's shipping hub and dumping ground for those who displease the crown but don't quite merit execution.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Every citizen serves. No exceptions, no bribes, no escape. The military reflects Sylke's values: dutiful, efficient, and unquestioning.
- The army that conquered Tornia was well-drilled and well-supplied. It faced minimal resistance and secured the kingdom in weeks.
- Now that same army occupies hostile territory, stretched thin across two kingdoms while watching Joswik's border.
- The navy is growing rapidly, incorporating captured Tornian vessels. Alisandra understands that controlling Ofrenia means controlling the surrounding waters.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Ofrenia, the island at the heart of the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Dense forests, river valleys, coastal lowlands, hilly interior

**Named Entities**: Gilded Pass (ley line corridor)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Multiple rivers flowing from the interior to the western coast

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea, Tykon Channel (west)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Helmsbridge

**Cities**: Helmsbridge, Scarnett

**Towns**: Shimmercreek Falls, Seavault, Cat Fell, Fool's Keep, Exralhorn, Mapleburg, Bridgeton

**Villages**: Numerous logging and fishing villages throughout

### Primary Conflicts

**Occupying Tornia**

Conquest was the easy part. Alisandra's armies hold Tornia's cities and patrol its roads, but the countryside burns with resistance. The rebels she once cultivated have turned against her. Every week brings ambushes, assassinations, and supply disruptions. The occupation is bleeding resources faster than expected.

**The Joswik Question**

One kingdom remains. Prince Edric of Joswik watches his sister's expansion with growing terror. He lacks the military strength to resist and the political cunning to negotiate. Alisandra could crush Joswik tomorrow—but she's learning from Tornia that rapid conquest creates lasting problems. Some advisors urge patience; others want to finish reunification while momentum holds.

**The Ivory Hand**

Alisandra is a member of the Ivory Hand, a secretive organization that maintains global slave trafficking networks to fuel Deoric magic. Her throne runs on human sacrifice. If this became public knowledge, even Sylke's cowed population might rebel. The Hand protects its own, but Alisandra's rapid expansion has drawn attention she'd prefer to avoid.

**Internal Surveillance**

The network of informants that keeps Sylke stable is expensive, paranoid, and occasionally wrong. Innocent people disappear. Useful people are denounced by rivals. The system works, but it breeds a sullen, fearful population that follows orders without initiative or loyalty. In a crisis, would they fight for their queen—or simply stop pretending to?

### History

Sylke was always the poorest of Ofrenia's three kingdoms. When the old king divided his realm, Alisandra received the western forests—valuable for lumber, but lacking Tornia's rich farmland or Joswik's mineral wealth. She was the middle child, overlooked and underestimated.

She made that everyone else's problem.

Within a year of her father's death, Alisandra had consolidated absolute power in Sylke. The nobility who opposed her vanished. The merchants who questioned her policies found their businesses destroyed. The common folk learned to keep their heads down and their mouths shut.

She discovered Deoric magic through the Ivory Hand—power fueled by suffering. The organization welcomed a queen willing to provide both victims and protection. In exchange, Alisandra gained access to magic that no legitimate ruler would touch.

For years she watched her brothers squander their inheritances. Aldric drowned Tornia in decadence. Edric let Joswik stagnate. Alisandra built her military, cultivated agents in both kingdoms, and waited.

When she finally moved against Tornia, the war lasted weeks. Now she rules two-thirds of Ofrenia, with the third clearly in her sights. The girl her father overlooked is becoming the queen who reunites the island—not through diplomacy or marriage, but through conquest, surveillance, and blood magic.

**Core Values**: Pride, personal life and secrets, horses, speed, courage, exploration

- Small, dispersed settlements each controlled by a local priest, who report to the Kazigh—the chief horse shaman ruling from the great temple in Büüli Umén.
- The Kazigh is attended by a select group of servants who spend their lives in servitude and are killed when they turn 30.
- **Selection ritual:** Each year, eligible teenagers stand in a ring with outstretched hands full of grass. A blindfolded horse walks among them and eats from one child's hand, selecting the next servant to be sent to the temple.
- When the Kazigh is deemed unable to survive another week, they declare their successor, who is immediately appointed. The old shaman is then killed.
- Many Ta Minn develop an attunement with the winds that whip across the plains.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Weaving, horse hides, horse products

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, lumber

- The plains are slightly magical—wind attunement seeps into everything, including the horse hides used in nearly all Ta Minn craftsmanship.
- Products from Ta Minn carry a faint enchantment of speed and air.

### Military

**Size**: Large

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- It is an honor to serve in the military. Ta Minn cavalry are legendary—fast, skilled, and utterly fearless.
- The horse warriors of Ta Minn once aggressively expanded across the plains before running into established civilizations.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Middle Sea coast, west of the Crags of Geth (Griselia), south of the Browthiel Hills

**Biomes**: Grassy steppe, prairie, occasional hills, river valleys

**Climate**: Continental steppe—harsh winds, hot summers, cold winters

**Named Features**: Kanüli Daha Plains (north), Cercesa Plains (southeast)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Büüli Umén (central plains, site of the great temple)

**Cities**: Büüli Umén, Ta Akikis (west), Toh Hural (north), Avar Sonnon (east), Limoste (southwest coast)

### The Coastline

Ta Minn's southern border is a jagged coastline along the Middle Sea, with several inlets and natural harbors. The Chedwin Strait lies along the southwestern coast. Limoste is the main coastal settlement.

### The Northern Plains

The Kanüli Daha Plains in the north are flat, fertile ground—and contested territory. A river flows from Anarak through a gap in the mountains between the Kharvorn and Griselia, providing a route for Anarak forces to reach Ta Minn. The northern plains are where the two nations clash.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Anarak War**

Ta Minn and Anarak are locked in increasingly violent skirmishes over the northern plains. Anarak's forces come through the mountain gap via the river route; Ta Minn cavalry meet them on the open steppe. Neither side has achieved decisive victory, but the fighting grows bloodier each season.

Tepheranos wants Ta Minn's territory. The Ta Minn refuse to yield their ancestral plains. The war will likely escalate.

**Expansion Halted**

The Ta Minn once aggressively expanded across the plains, their cavalry unstoppable in open terrain. They've since run into other civilizations—Griselia to the east, Thespia to the southwest, Anarak to the north—and been forced to pause. The proud horse warriors chafe at the constraint.

### History

The Ta Minn arrived from the West, speaking Ashakri like many western peoples. They found the windswept plains and made them home, bonding with the horses and the winds. For generations, they expanded freely, their cavalry sweeping across the steppe.

Then they hit the mountains, the sea, and other nations. The expansion stopped. Now they hold their territory against Anarak's encroachment and dream of the days when the plains had no borders.

## Tamadrez

Tags: state, shacklands

Tamadrez is not a nation. It is what's left.

The island of Pesalolo stretches a thousand miles from northeast to southwest, bisected by the Freedom Mountains and divided by Gorathi violence. The south belongs to the slavers—occupied territory where Gorathi ships collect their human cargo. The north belongs to no one in particular—a scattering of villages and towns that call themselves "Tamadrez" because they need a name when foreigners ask. There is no king, no council, no capital. There is only the shared understanding that Gorath could crush them whenever it chose, and the desperate hope that it won't.

Three centuries ago, Gorathi explorers discovered Pesalolo and the Drasnian dwarves who had lived there for millennia. Within a generation, the slave trade had transformed both societies. Gorath occupied the southern coast by force; the northern settlements survived because they weren't worth conquering. The mountains are too rugged, the villages too poor, and Gorath's military too stretched thin on other fronts. So the empire takes what it wants from the south and leaves the north alone—as long as the north stays out of the way.

Gorath's terms are simple: the empire operates freely in the south. The north does not interfere. Any village that harbors escaped slaves burns. One northern town learned this lesson permanently when Gorathi warships firebombed it to ash for sheltering hundreds of escapees. The Drasnians never agreed to these terms—there was no negotiation, no treaty, no signing. Gorath simply announced how things would be, and the alternative was extermination.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: None (loose confederation of autonomous villages)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Drasnian dwarves

**Population**: ~200,000 (north); unknown thousands in the south under Gorathi control

**Stability**: Unstable

**Core Values**: Duty, custom, pragmatic survival, wealth as security

#### The Non-Government

Tamadrez has no central authority because it never did. The Freedom Mountains made unification impractical long before Gorath arrived—villages on opposite coasts might as well be in different countries. Each settlement governs itself through elder councils, hereditary headmen, or simple consensus depending on local tradition.

This fragmentation happens to frustrate Gorath. When the empire demands that "Tamadrez" crack down on escape networks, there is no one to receive the demand. When a village defies Gorath's terms, other villages can honestly claim they had no knowledge and no control. Gorath would prefer a central authority to threaten and negotiate with. The Drasnians have no intention of providing one—not as resistance, but because creating a unified government would be difficult, expensive, and would only make them easier to coerce.

When coordination is necessary—which is rarely—representatives meet in Yava. These meetings produce no binding agreements, no formal resolutions, no accountable decisions. Just talk, and whatever informal understanding the participants carry home.

#### The Drasnian Dwarves

The Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and most widespread of dwarven heritages, found in vast numbers at nearly every cultural hub across Alaria. The Pesalolo Drasnians are one branch of this diaspora—darker-skinned from generations in the tropical climate, but otherwise recognizable to their continental kin.

Drasnian culture values education, money, and the preservation of their elaborate customs. Their religious and social traditions govern worship, relationships, and daily life in intricate detail—which prayers for which occasions, which foods at which meals, which obligations between which relatives. These customs persist in Tamadrez despite three centuries of Gorathi predation, maintained with characteristic Drasnian stubbornness.

The Drasnians are pragmatic about survival. They value wealth not for luxury but for security—coin hidden away means options when disaster comes. They count, they plan, they prepare. The arrangement with Gorath is distasteful, but Drasnians have survived worse through careful calculation. They will endure this too.

In the south, Drasnian customs survive in fragments—abbreviated prayers, simplified rituals, the small observances that remind the enslaved who they are. In the north, the full weight of tradition continues, adapted where necessary but never abandoned. A Drasnian wedding in Yava still follows the same seventeen steps as one in distant Drasnia, even if the specific prayers now include petitions for absent family members who will never return.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Fish, tropical hardwoods, dyes, Yava's port services

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, weapons (quietly), information

#### The Two Economies

The south has no economy—it has extraction. Drasnian dwarves are the product, collected and shipped like timber or ore. Whatever the captives produced before their capture becomes Gorathi property.

The north survives on fishing, subsistence farming, and the mountain forests that Gorath has never managed to exploit. Villages trade among themselves using barter and informal credit. Coin is rare outside Yava.

Yava itself operates differently. The port city trades with the wider world—Ethadia, Shir, Windori, whoever sails through Screamstrait. This trade provides the foreign goods that filter into the rest of Tamadrez, and the foreign contacts that make certain... arrangements... possible.

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: n/a

**Enrollment**: n/a

Tamadrez has no army. It cannot have one. Any organized military force would give Gorath the excuse it needs to invade.

What Tamadrez has instead:
- Village militias for local protection (bandits, wildlife, occasional Gorathi "inspection teams" that get too aggressive)
- Hunters who know the mountain passes better than any Gorathi patrol
- A population that has spent three centuries learning to disappear when soldiers come looking

The Freedom Mountains themselves are Tamadrez's best defense. Gorathi expeditions have repeatedly failed to establish permanent control of the highland routes. The terrain favors those who know it.

### Geography

**Location**: Island of Pesalolo, Shacklands region

**Biomes**: Tropical jungle (lowlands), highland forest (mountain slopes), scrubland (Ryujilin Hills)

**Named Entities**: Freedom Mountains (Apuindi, Gesichi, Tishkung sections), Ryujilin Hills, Slaver's Coast, Yava

**Rivers & Lakes**: Numerous rivers draining from the Freedom Mountains to both coasts

**Adjacent Waters**: Divinity Passage (east), Torgan Passage (southeast), Gindrik Sea (south), Screamstrait (southwest)

See [Pesalolo](../../atlas_of_alaria/shacklands/Pesalolo.md) for detailed geographic information.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (Yava serves as informal meeting point)

**Cities**: Yava (~30,000)

**Towns**: Scattered along both coasts and in mountain valleys

**Villages**: Dozens, mostly unnamed on foreign maps

#### Yava

The only real city, at the island's southwestern tip. Yava survives because destroying it would destabilize trade across the Gindrik Sea. Every major trading power has made clear that burning Yava would have consequences. So Gorath pretends it's a minor fishing town, and Yava pretends it doesn't shelter escapees.

See [Pesalolo - Yava](../../atlas_of_alaria/shacklands/Pesalolo.md#yava) for details.

#### Slavewatch

The Gorathi fortress in the central Gesichi Mountains, officially monitoring the passes for escaped slaves. In practice, Commander Kassander Volso runs a profitable corruption operation that takes bribes from all sides.

See [Slavewatch](../../atlas_of_alaria/shacklands/Slavewatch.md) for details.

### Primary Conflicts

**Compliance**: Every day, Tamadrez must choose between obeying Gorathi demands and risking annihilation for defiance. Most villages comply just enough to avoid attention. Some take greater risks.

**The Underground Railroad**: Escaped slaves flee north through the mountain passes. Someone is organizing the routes, providing safe houses, bribing Slavewatch patrols. Gorath wants the network found. Many Tamadrezans quietly support it. A few actively participate.

**Agtakkeri**: The dragon hunting Gorathi ships in the northern waters has accidentally become Tamadrez's greatest protector. But the dragon kills slaves along with slavers, and its methods are monstrous. Supporting it means enabling a torturer. Opposing it means helping Gorath.

**The South**: The Drasnians in occupied territory are still kin. The north survives by staying out of the way while the south is harvested. Some northerners rationalize this as necessary pragmatism. Others fund the underground railroad. A few argue for open war, regardless of the cost. The division runs through families.

**Internal Fractures**: Some villages want open resistance. Others counsel patience. A few have been thoroughly compromised by Gorathi informants. Trust is scarce.

### History

**Before Contact**: The Drasnian dwarves settled Pesalolo millennia ago, building a civilization in the mountains and along both coasts. They were never unified under a single government—the Freedom Mountains made that impractical—but they shared language, culture, and trade networks.

**The Tamadrez Contact (~300 years ago)**: Gorathi explorers discovered the island and its inhabitants. Initial contact was peaceful. Trade began. Then Gorath realized how valuable Drasnian labor could be.

**The First Raids**: Gorathi slave ships began taking captives from coastal villages. The Drasnians resisted, but their village militias couldn't match Gorathi legions. Coastal settlements fell or fled into the mountains.

**The Occupation**: Gorath seized the southern coast and established the Slaver's Coast—a chain of ports for collecting and shipping human cargo. The northern settlements were too poor and too difficult to conquer, and Gorath's military was already stretched thin. So the empire announced its terms: the south belongs to Gorath; the north stays out of the way; any interference results in destruction. The Drasnians never agreed to this. They simply survived it.

**Three Centuries of Extraction**: The arrangement has persisted because it remains profitable for Gorath and survivable for the north. Periodic Gorathi violence reinforces the terms—the firebombing that destroyed Kalashev being the most dramatic example. Smaller punishments occur regularly. The Drasnians adjust their calculations accordingly.

**The Present**: Emperor Veramus maintains the current arrangement because full invasion would overstretch Gorath's already-thin military. The underground railroad operates despite Slavewatch—some say because of Slavewatch's corruption. Agtakkeri hunts the northern waters. And the Drasnian dwarves continue what they have always done: count the costs, preserve what they can, and plan for better circumstances.

### Hooks

- **The Network**: The party is asked to move escaped slaves through the mountain passes. Success means saving lives. Failure means Gorathi retribution on the villages that helped.

- **Kalashev's Ghosts**: The firebombed town left survivors—scattered, angry, with nothing left to lose. They're planning something. It might be resistance. It might be revenge. It might get everyone killed.

- **The Southern Question**: A Drasnian leader in the north wants to establish contact with resistance cells in Gorathi-controlled territory. The mission would require traveling into the Slaver's Coast itself.

- **Yava's Secret**: Someone in Yava is selling information to Gorath—escape routes, safe house locations, network contacts. Finding the informant means navigating the port city's tangled politics.

- **The Dragon Dilemma**: Gorath has finally assembled a serious dragonslaying expedition against Agtakkeri. If it succeeds, the northern escape routes close forever. If it fails, the dragon continues killing innocents along with slavers. The party might be hired by either side—or might have to choose for themselves.

## Tangiern

Tags: state, human, crimson-coast

A human kingdom on the Crimson Coast, Tangiern has survived for centuries in the shadow of the Winter Elves—paying tribute, keeping quiet, and building strength in the vast Fragenstor Mielthøn forest. The elven civil war has given them unexpected freedom. What they do with it will determine whether their kingdom thrives or burns.

### Overview

Tangiern occupies the western two-thirds of the Crimson Coast, bounded by the Dragon's Spine mountains to the north and the Void to the south. The land is dominated by the enormous Fragenstor Mielthøn—a dark conifer forest that has shaped Tangier culture as much as any king or god. The people are foresters, hunters, and trappers who have learned to find wealth in the endless woods while avoiding the attention of their powerful neighbors.

Capital: **Nøsen** (~4,000 population)

### Government

**King Halvard III** rules Tangiern, the sixth in a dynasty established when his ancestors unified the scattered forest clans. The kingdom functions as a loose confederation—jarls control the major towns and owe military service to the crown, but local governance remains local. The king's authority extends mainly to foreign relations, military coordination, and the settlement of disputes between jarls.

The current situation demands more centralization than tradition allows. Halvard has been quietly expanding royal authority, positioning loyalists in key positions and building a standing force separate from the jarls' levies. This hasn't gone unnoticed; some jarls grumble that the king is using the elven crisis as an excuse to seize power.

**Succession** follows male primogeniture with provision for regency. Halvard has three sons; the succession is secure unless the elves decide to remove him.

### Culture

The Tangier people are practical, taciturn, and deeply connected to their forest. They worship nature spirits and ancestors without formal priesthoods—each family maintains its own shrines, and sacred groves scattered through the forest serve as communal holy sites. The elves' daemon-worship seems alien and slightly repulsive to them; they cooperate with elven religion as little as possible.

**Festivals** mark the seasons: the Return of Light (spring equinox, celebrating survival of another winter), the Great Hunt (autumn, a kingdom-wide hunting competition), and the Long Dark (winter solstice, a somber acknowledgment of the hardest season). These celebrations are the rare occasions when the scattered forest communities gather.

**Social structure** is based on skill and contribution. A master woodsman outranks a wealthy merchant; a successful hunter outranks both. Titles exist but carry less weight than demonstrated competence. This meritocratic tendency frustrates outside traders who can't figure out who to bribe.

### Economy

Timber and furs drive Tangiern's economy. The Fragenstor Mielthøn provides seemingly endless lumber, and Tangier woodsmen have developed techniques for selective harvesting that maintain forest health while meeting demand. Furs—bear, wolf, fox, and the prized winter ermine—command premium prices in markets around the Void.

Agriculture is limited. The growing season is short, the soil acidic, and cleared land tends to revert to forest. Most grain is imported, creating vulnerability that Halvard is working to address through forest-edge farming initiatives.

The kingdom has no significant mining—the Dragon's Spine contains ore, but the mountains are too dangerous to work. Metal goods are imported, making Tangiern dependent on trade relationships that the elven civil war has disrupted.

### Military

Tangiern fields approximately 2,000 fighters when fully mobilized—jarls' levies plus a small royal guard. They're skilled in forest warfare: ambush, tracking, and survival in difficult terrain. In open battle against disciplined elven forces, they'd likely lose. In their own forest, they'd make any invader pay dearly for every mile.

**The Forest Guard** is Halvard's attempt to build a professional core. Currently perhaps 300 strong, these full-time soldiers train year-round and answer directly to the crown. Their existence annoys the jarls, who see it as a threat to their traditional military role.

### Relations

**With Klevnaf**: Cautiously neutral. Taoinor has made overtures—alliance against Istora in exchange for reduced tribute—but Halvard hasn't committed. He doesn't trust elven promises and suspects any alliance would leave Tangiern worse off than neutrality.

**With Istora**: Carefully neutral. Lamenrae has also made overtures, emphasizing her reformist agenda and hinting that a progressive elven kingdom might be easier to live beside than the traditional alternative. Halvard is skeptical; a nastier Istora under a vengeful queen might be worse than old-style elven rule.

**With the Dragon's Spine Coast**: Minimal contact. The mountains block easy travel, and whatever lurks beyond them isn't Tangiern's problem yet.

### History

Tangiern's history is one of survival through accommodation. When the Winter Elves arrived millennia ago, the scattered human clans faced extinction or submission. They chose submission—paying tribute, providing labor, and staying out of elven affairs. In exchange, they were left to govern themselves within their forest.

The unification came three hundred years ago when Halvard's ancestor, Bjorn the Builder, convinced the clans that a unified human voice would negotiate better terms than individual supplication. He was right; the unified kingdom negotiated reduced tribute and formal recognition of Tangier sovereignty within the forest.

The current crisis is unprecedented. For the first time in living memory, no elven power demands tribute. Halvard's challenge is converting this temporary freedom into permanent independence—without triggering elven retaliation that his kingdom can't survive.

### What Outsiders Notice

- The smell of pine resin everywhere
- Suspicious stares from locals who don't see many strangers
- Wooden construction even in the capital—stone is rare and expensive
- The casual competence with which even children handle axes and bows
- References to "the elves" delivered with careful neutrality

### Adventure Hooks

- Halvard needs deniable agents to gather intelligence on both elven factions
- Something in the deep Fragenstor Mielthøn has woken up, and the foresters can't handle it alone
- A jarl is secretly negotiating with one elven faction; find out which and what they're promising
- The ruins of Hildaneir have become active; Tangiern needs outsiders to investigate without elven notice

## Tarkhon Empire

Tags: state, empire

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Imperial monarchy with tributary states

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, Craven, Neferati, Dwarves, Halflings (varies by region)

**Population**: ~2,000,000 (across all territories)

**Stability**: Stable but fragile

**Core Values**: Trade, prosperity, imperial continuity, the eternal flame

- The Tarkhon Empire is ruled by **King Selron II** from the capital of **Tarkhetan** in Nektuna. His authority is absolute in the core territories but dilutes rapidly as distance from the strait increases.
- The empire holds together through economic incentive rather than military force. Subsidiary states receive preferential trade terms in exchange for fealty, tribute, and open roads. This arrangement is stable as long as Tarkhon remains wealthy—but it means loyalty is always conditional.
- Tarkhon's diversity is a strength and weakness. The empire contains humans, Craven, Neferati fire-kingdoms, dwarven city-states, and an immortal halfling kingdom. They have little in common except profit.

### Economy

**Size**: Massive

**Tech**: Advanced (maritime, financial)

**Primary Exports**: Everything (as intermediary)

**Primary Imports**: Everything (as intermediary)

- Tarkhon controls the **Tarkhon Strait**—the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. All maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world passes through Tarkhon-controlled waters.
- The empire doesn't produce much itself. It *taxes* production. Every ship that passes through pays tariffs. Every merchant who uses Tarkhon roads pays tolls. Every trader who wants access to Tarkhon markets pays fees.
- This makes Tarkhon fabulously wealthy—and deeply dependent on maintaining its chokehold on trade. If an alternative route opened, the empire would collapse within a generation.

### Military

**Size**: Large (navy-focused)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Professional

- Tarkhon maintains a powerful navy to control the strait. Ships that refuse to pay are sunk. Pirates are hunted relentlessly. The sea lanes are safe—for those who pay.
- The army is smaller but professional, primarily deployed to protect key assets and project power into tributary states that forget their obligations.
- Nektuna's fire leyline produces powerful **firemages** who serve as the empire's elite military asset. A single firemage can burn a ship from a mile away.

### Geography

**Location**: Straddles the strait between Clueanda (north) and Rimihuica (south)

**Biomes**: Temperate coastlands (north), arid highlands (south), volcanic mountains, fertile river valleys

**Climate**: Mediterranean to semi-arid

**Named Features**: Tarkhon Strait, Eronia Range, Fleimrut Mountains, Stone Forest, Sea of Merchants

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tarkhetan (in Nektuna)

**Core Territories**: Nektuna, Enymu, Kerwin

**Tributary States**: Astrelle, Yaif, Kabir, Gissemari, Wadiyah

**Allied City-States**: Üod, Blvnird, Melaia (First Brotherhood dwarves)

**Other Holdings**: Murth, Vogenfeld (northern shield), various smaller territories

### The Evertorch

In Tarkhetan's great cathedral burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting six centuries ago. The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing the empire's eternal dominion and unbroken continuity.

The Neferati founders kindled it from sacred fire brought north from Yaif when they established Tarkhetan. It has burned in the same cathedral ever since—through the Neferati dynasty, through the Severance, through three centuries of human rule. The torch doesn't care who sits on the throne. It just burns.

Ritual magic of time and fire occurs at the Evertorch shrine. The empire's most important oaths are sworn before it. Emperors—now called kings—are crowned in its light. The Kingdoms of Fire have never forgotten that it burns with their fire.

### Subsidiary States

**Northern Holdings (Clueanda)**
- **Nektuna**: The imperial heartland. Controls the strait, produces firemages, generates most of the empire's wealth.
- **Enymu**: Farming state east of Nektuna. Loyal but poor. Ruled by a long line of honorable kings.
- **Kerwin**: Halfling kingdom ruled by Ulyas the Immortal. Nominally tributary; practically independent.
- **Astrelle**: Vassal state of Nektuna. Fully integrated into the empire.

**The Kingdoms of Fire**
- **Yaif**, **Kabir**, **Gissemari**, **Wadiyah**: Four Neferati monarchies that act as a bloc. They maintain internal independence but coordinate on external matters.

**Dwarven City-States**
- **Üod**, **Blvnird**, **Melaia**: Leadership cities of the First Brotherhood. Their relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they're tributary but also exercise influence over dwarves across the world.

**Other Territories**
- **Murth**: Dual-capital state (Eynmore and Vastilin)
- **Vogenfeld**: Uline dwarf settlements holding the northern passes against Hedroscobb's orc hordes. The Vogenfeld Pact is ancient but increasingly strained.
- **Chykum** and various smaller holdings

### Klor the Blood Lord

Two hundred years ago, the **Eronia Range**—the mountains forming Tarkhon's southern boundary—was infested with a massive confederation of mountain clans. Orcs, goblins, and worse had raided Tarkhon's southern territories for generations. Caravans were ambushed. Villages burned. The problem seemed intractable.

**Klor** was a Tarkhon general, brutal and effective. He proposed a solution: systematic extermination. The empire gave him an army and a mandate.

The campaign lasted a decade. Klor earned his title—the Blood Lord—through the sheer scale of slaughter. He didn't negotiate, didn't accept surrenders, didn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. He cleared the mountains the way a farmer clears brush: thoroughly, methodically, without mercy.

When it was done, the Eronia Range was empty. Safe for Tarkhon travelers, at least. Klor died in the final campaign—some say heroically in battle, some say assassinated by his own officers who could no longer stomach the killing.

Tarkhon honors Klor as a necessary monster. The southern territories are safe because of what he did. Whether the cost was justified depends on who you ask—and whether they lived south of the mountains or in them.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Tenuous Grasp**

Tarkhon holds its empire through trade benefits, not loyalty. Every subsidiary state is calculating whether the advantages of membership outweigh the costs. If Tarkhon's wealth falters, if an alternative trade route opens, if the navy weakens—the empire will fragment within a generation.

**The Immortal Problem**

King Ulyas of Kerwin has outlived every Tarkhon ruler for five centuries. He remembers the Neferati founders, the old bargains, the Severance. He was ancient when Tarkhon was young—his kingdom predates the empire by centuries. His continued existence is an embarrassment to imperial narratives of progress and a reminder that some things in the empire are older than the empire itself. Worse, he knows secrets the current dynasty would prefer stayed buried.

**The Kingdoms of Fire**

The four Neferati monarchies act as a bloc, which makes them powerful enough to negotiate collectively with Tarkhetan. If they ever decided to leave the empire together, Tarkhon would have difficulty stopping them. So far, the trade benefits have kept them loyal. So far.

### History

**The Founding (~600 years ago)**

Neferati warlords from Yaif recognized that the Tarkhon Strait could be controlled—and that whoever controlled it would control trade across half the world. They brought sacred fire north, founded Tarkhetan on the Needle, and lit the Evertorch. From the beginning, Tarkhon was built on commerce.

**The Neferati Dynasty (~600-300 years ago)**

For nearly three centuries, Neferati emperors ruled from Tarkhetan. They expanded through trade agreements and tributary arrangements rather than conquest. Kerwin was already ruled by the immortal Ulyas; rather than fight him, the empire negotiated. Ulyas accepted nominal fealty in exchange for autonomy—an arrangement that has held for five centuries.

**The Dilution (~400-300 years ago)**

Neferati bloodlines mixed with human through generations of political marriages. The ruling family became increasingly human—fire-touched perhaps, but not truly of the flame.

**The Severance (~300 years ago)**

The last fire-blooded emperor died without legitimate heir. His children by his Neferati mistress were passed over for his fully human nephew. The Neferati faction resisted. The war that followed was brief but vicious. The human faction won. The pure Neferati withdrew to the Kingdoms of Fire. The Evertorch stayed—too sacred to move, too dangerous to extinguish. But its keepers changed.

**The Klor Campaign (~200 years ago)**

Klor's brutal clearing of the Eronia Range secured the empire's southern frontier but left a moral stain that some believe has never washed clean. The mountains are safe now. The price was measured in tens of thousands of lives.

**The Present Day**

King Selron II rules an empire held together by profit rather than loyalty. The system works—for now. Trade flows, taxes are paid, the navy maintains order. But the foundations are fragile, the subsidiaries are calculating, and the immortal halfling in Kerwin remembers everything the current dynasty has forgotten.

## Tarn

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

A nation of orcs who are very difficult to kill—not because of armor or numbers, but because their souls refuse to leave their bodies. The Tarni control the most valuable stretch of the Grand Tolkarsus river and fight their wars with weapons that cut spirit as easily as flesh.

### Overview

The Tarni are called the Darkeyes for their solid black eyes that seem to look through flesh to the soul beneath. They've developed a unique understanding of the boundary between spirit and body, learning to anchor their own souls so firmly that death struggles to claim them. Their warriors fight on after wounds that would kill other orcs, and their spirit weapons bypass armor entirely to attack the essence within.

Tarn's territory is strategic—they control the middle reaches of the Grand Tolkarsus where the river passes through the Plenjorn Swamp, meaning they share claim to the healing waters with Glivornax. This makes them wealthy, dangerous, and perpetually at odds with their neighbors.

### Government

**Type:** Spirit Council

The Tarni are ruled by a council of elder spirit-seers—those who have learned to see beyond flesh and commune with the ancestors who linger. Political power comes from spiritual authority; military command follows spiritual rank.

**The Spirit Council:**
- **First-Seer Vurkoth** — Eldest of the council, over eighty years old. She speaks with ancestors three generations dead and has "died" twice herself, only to return.
- **War-Seer Gothnak** — Commands the warriors. His spirit-sight allows him to target enemy souls directly; he teaches the war-priests their craft.
- **River-Seer Thulmis** — Oversees the Tolkarsus trade and the healing waters. The most diplomatic of the council; handles negotiations with outsiders.
- **Shadow-Seer Yulthrek** — Youngest member. Responsible for intelligence and the spirit-scouts who observe enemy movements in ways conventional scouts cannot.

Decisions are made through ritual consensus. The council enters a trance state together, communing with ancestral spirits, and emerges with unified purpose. Outsiders find this process unnerving—the council members' eyes roll back, they speak in voices not their own, and sometimes the ancestors disagree.

### Culture

**The Tarni** have dark eyes with no visible whites—solid black orbs that seem to absorb light. Their skin ranges from deep gray to charcoal, and many bear pale ritual scars that mark their spiritual accomplishments. They're not physically larger than other orcs, but they carry themselves with unsettling certainty.

**Core Values:**
- **The Soul Is the Self** — The body is temporary; the soul is eternal. Physical scars mean nothing; spiritual wounds are everything.
- **Death Is a Door, Not a Wall** — The ancestors watch, guide, and sometimes return. Death is transition, not ending.
- **The River Carries All** — The Tolkarsus connects the living world to the spirit realm. Those who control the river control the boundary.
- **Strike the Essence** — Physical victory without spiritual victory is incomplete. True warriors kill souls, not just bodies.

**Society:** Tarni society revolves around spiritual rank. At the bottom are those who have never touched the spirit world—children and outsiders. Above them are those who have glimpsed beyond the veil. Higher still are the spirit-touched who can see and speak with the dead. At the top are the spirit-seers who walk between worlds.

Every Tarni undergoes a spirit-trial at age fifteen—a ritual ordeal that pushes them to the edge of death. Those who return with spirit-sight advance; those who return without it remain common warriors; those who don't return... sometimes come back later, changed.

### Economy

**Size:** Medium
**Tech:** Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports:**
- River passage (tolls for trade along the Tolkarsus)
- Healing water (controlled access to Plenjorn Swamp, in competition with Glivornax)
- Spirit-blessed items (weapons and talismans touched by ancestral power)
- Information (the spirit-scouts see things others cannot)

**Primary Imports:**
- Metal (the Tarni are not smiths)
- Food (the swamps don't farm well)
- Luxury goods (the spirit-seers have expensive tastes)

Tarn's position on the river makes them natural middlemen. Trade flows through their territory, and they extract tolls from everyone. The healing waters provide additional leverage—Tarn and Glivornax both control access, creating an awkward shared monopoly.

### Military

**Size:** Small
**Quality:** Extremely High
**Enrollment:** Volunteer (only the spirit-touched serve)

The Tarni don't field large armies. They don't need to. Their warriors are individually devastating—nearly impossible to kill and wielding weapons that ignore physical defenses.

**Spirit Warriors:** The core of Tarni military power. These orcs have trained their souls to cling to their bodies beyond normal limits. Where other warriors die, they keep fighting. Where other warriors heal slowly, they recover quickly because their spirit refuses to release the body. Each spirit warrior carries weapons blessed to cut essence as well as flesh.

**Spirit-Scouts:** The Tarni intelligence apparatus. These orcs can project their awareness beyond their bodies, observing distant locations, passing through walls, seeing in darkness. They're invaluable for reconnaissance and nearly impossible to detect.

**War-Priests:** Battlefield commanders who can see the spiritual state of everyone present. They direct spirit warriors to focus on enemies whose souls are wavering, target leaders whose death would shatter morale, and shore up their own warriors' flagging spirits.

**Weaknesses:**
- Small numbers. A Tarni warrior is worth ten ordinary soldiers, but they can still be overwhelmed.
- The spirit weapons don't work on the soulless—constructs, certain undead, creatures that have traded their spirits away.
- The Glivornaxi have learned that targeting spirit warriors with multiple attackers forces them to choose which soul to defend.
- Physical exhaustion still matters. The soul may be willing, but the flesh has limits.

### Geography

**Location:** North-central Wildwood, along the middle Grand Tolkarsus

**Biomes:** River valley, flood plains, edges of Plenjorn Swamp

**Key Locations:**
- **Tarns-Hollow** — The capital, built where the Tolkarsus widens into a series of lakes. The water is sacred here; the boundary between worlds is thin.
- **The Spirit Gates** — Stone pillars along the river where the ancestors are said to enter the mortal world. Major ritual sites.
- **The Contested Shore** — The stretch of Plenjorn Swamp that Tarn and Glivornax both claim. Fighting happens here regularly.

**Borders:**
- North: Grieb (the lakemen; minimal contact)
- Northwest: Uhionai (the tree-orcs; occasional border friction)
- West: Glivornax (hostile; the Water War)
- South: Hedroscobb (neutral; little interest in each other)
- East: Shazuihn (hostile; they raid everyone)

### Relations

**Glivornax:** The Water War. Both states claim Plenjorn Swamp and its healing waters. The Tarni spirit weapons can damage Glivornaxi souls directly—but the Glivornaxi can heal from physical wounds in the swamp. It's a brutal stalemate. Neither side can afford to lose.

**Shazuihn:** The boar riders raid Tarni territory too, though less successfully. Spirit warriors are hard to kill quickly, and the Shazuihni prefer quick raids. Still, they come.

**Uhionai:** Occasional friction over the border where Ryunimir Forest meets Tarni river territory. The tree-orcs are defensive; the Tarni don't particularly want their land. Skirmishes happen when young warriors need to prove themselves.

**Hedroscobb:** Minimal contact. The Tarni have nothing the Hedroscobbi want, and vice versa.

**Grieb:** Respectful distance. The Tarni spirit-seers can sense something old and powerful in the northern lakes. They don't fear the Griebi exactly—but they understand that some neighbors are better left alone.

**Vogenfeld:** No direct contact. The dwarves are too far south.

**The Orc Moot:** The Tarni attend and participate more than most. Their spirit-seers provide neutral ground for negotiations—they can tell when someone is lying.

### Conflicts

**The Water War:** The central conflict. Plenjorn Swamp's healing waters are priceless, and both Tarn and Glivornax claim them. The Tarni have the advantage in direct combat—spirit weapons are devastating—but the Glivornaxi have home-field advantage in the swamps. Neither side can win decisively.

**The Inheritance Question:** First-Seer Vurkoth is old, and the question of succession looms. Shadow-Seer Yulthrek is ambitious; War-Seer Gothnak is conservative. If the council fragments, Tarn's enemies will notice.

**The Fading:** Some spirit-seers whisper that the boundary between worlds is weakening. More spirits linger than before. More Tarni return from death. This sounds like good news until you ask: where are all these spirits coming from? What is pushing them into the mortal world?

### History

The Tarni discovered their spiritual gifts generations ago when a great shaman named Tarn (for whom the state is named) nearly died in battle and found his soul caught between worlds. Instead of passing on, he learned to cling to his body—and to see others' souls as they truly were.

Tarn taught his techniques to his children, and they taught theirs. Within generations, the Tarni had developed spirit-sight as a cultural inheritance. They claimed the river because Tarn had died beside it; they believe the Tolkarsus carries souls downstream to whatever comes after.

The Water War with Glivornax began when both states realized the healing waters existed. It has continued, on and off, for over sixty years.

### Player Hooks

- Seek a spirit-seer's help to contact a dead loved one
- Negotiate the Water War between Tarn and Glivornax
- Undergo the spirit-trial and gain Tarni abilities (or die trying)
- Investigate the Fading—why are so many spirits lingering?
- Steal a spirit-weapon (incredibly difficult; they're spiritually bound to their wielders)
- Use Tarn's position as neutral ground to negotiate between other orc states

## Teku

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council oligarchy (founding families)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Mixed humans (descended from multi-cultural shipwreck survivors)

**Population**: ~8,000 (fluctuates with trade seasons)

**Stability**: Stable (external threats unite the population)

**Core Values**: Survival, adaptation, shark-mastery, community resilience

Teku exists because its founders couldn't leave and their descendants learned not to want to. The city-state occupies Survivor's Island in the heart of the Sea of Sharks—waters so dangerous that normal ships can't cross them. The inhabitants have spent generations developing techniques to survive where nothing should.

The population is remarkably diverse. The founding refugees came from a dozen different cultures; their descendants have blended into something uniquely Tekuan—a people defined not by ancestry but by their relationship with the sharks.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (but essential to regional trade)

**Tech**: Standard, advanced in shark-resistance technology

**Primary Exports**: Safe passage, shark products, salvage goods, navigation services

**Primary Imports**: Metal (for hull reinforcement), food variety, manufactured goods

Teku's economy is built on being the only safe harbor in the Sea of Sharks. Ships that must cross the shark waters—carrying goods between the Shattered Sea and southern regions—stop at Teku and pay whatever the city charges.

The shark-hunting industry provides secondary income: shark hide, teeth, oil, and meat all have value. Salvage from wrecked ships supplements the economy; Teku salvagers are experts at recovering cargo from shark-infested waters.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Exceptional in shark waters

**Enrollment**: Shark-hunters serve as de facto military

Teku has no formal military because it doesn't need one. The Sea of Sharks is the city's defense. Any attacking fleet would have to cross shark-infested waters, losing ships and crews before reaching the island.

The shark-hunters serve as the city's warriors when needed. They're experts at operating in conditions that would kill normal fighters—small boats in dangerous waters, close combat with marine predators, the psychology of survival.

### Geography

**Location**: Survivor's Island, central Sea of Sharks

**Biomes**: Rocky tropical island surrounded by shark-infested waters

**Climate**: Warm, humid, tropical

**Named Features**: Survivor's Island, the Barrier Harbor

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Teku (the only significant settlement on Survivor's Island)

### The Shark Council

Teku is governed by the **Shark Council**—representatives from the twelve founding families who've held power since the city's desperate early days. Council positions pass within families, though demonstrated incompetence can trigger replacement.

The Council manages:
- Harbor fees and trade regulations
- Shark defense maintenance
- Hunter coordination
- Dispute resolution

**Council Head**: **Admiral Kess Ironhull**, elected from among the Council members based on demonstrated shark-killing prowess and administrative competence.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Isolation Question**

Some younger Tekuans wonder if the city should expand—claim more territory, build more ships, become a regional power. Elders argue that Teku's strength is its isolation; trying to be more would risk everything.

**The Metal Shortage**

Teku depends on imported metal for hull reinforcement. The supply chains are vulnerable to disruption from Shattered Sea politics. Finding reliable suppliers is a constant concern.

**The Breeding Grounds**

Why are the sharks in the Sea of Sharks so numerous and aggressive? Some Tekuans want to find the breeding grounds and control the population permanently. Others argue this would destroy the natural defense that keeps Teku safe.

### Notable Figures

**Admiral Kess Ironhull** — Council Head and legendary shark-hunter. She's personally killed more sharks than anyone else alive and maintains her position through continued demonstration of competence.

**Salvage Master Dorek Finch** — Runs the salvage operations that recover cargo from wrecked ships. He knows every wreck site in the Sea of Sharks and has strong opinions about territorial claims.

**Old Coral** — A shark-hunter who survived being swallowed by a massive shark and cut his way out from inside. He's mostly retired now but still trains young hunters.

### History

**The Founding** (~400 years ago): Refugee ships fleeing an unknown war were blown into the Sea of Sharks. Most were destroyed. Survivors established a settlement on the only significant island.

**The Desperate Years**: Early Teku barely survived. Each generation learned from the sharks, developed new techniques, and passed knowledge to the next.

**The Harbor**: Construction of the Barrier Harbor—a protected lagoon with underwater barriers—transformed Teku from survivor camp to functioning city.

**The Present**: Teku at equilibrium—not growing, not declining, simply persisting in a place that should be uninhabitable.

## Tenches

Tags: state

Inhabited by Ezuri. Live in towering tree in center of island, many miles across. Entire island is trapped to shit.

## Thespia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Absolute monarchy (in chaos)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans

**Population**: 50,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: (currently: survival)

- The Thespian king was recently overthrown by **Queen Akta**, a mercenary from the south. She is a powerful magic user and absolutely fucking bonkers.
- The kingdom is in chaos. Akta's rule is violent and unpredictable. No one knows what she wants or how long she'll last.
- Before the coup, Thespia was a quiet, underdeveloped agricultural kingdom that kept its head down to avoid angering the dragon to the northwest.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: Grains

**Primary Imports**: Textiles, metals

- Thespia is primarily agricultural—rolling farmland between the Salty Hills and the mountains.
- Trade is difficult. The mountains to the west are dragon territory. The main routes run east toward Stipen and north toward Ta Minn.
- The current chaos is disrupting what little trade existed.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Thespian army was historically kept small to avoid provoking Morgnor, King of the Mountains, the dragon overlord to the northwest.
- Queen Akta is reportedly building up forces, though whether for defense, conquest, or sheer chaos is unclear.

### Geography

**Location**: Western Middle Sea region, east of Morgnor's mountains, north of Glorin, west of Stipen, southwest of Ta Minn

**Biomes**: Rolling farmland, hills, river valleys

**Climate**: Temperate—mild seasons, good for agriculture

**Named Features**: Salty Hills (running north-south through the center)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Geordon (center)

**Cities**: Geordon

**Towns**: Waterrun, Amerstad, Telford, Yunbery, Cricklade (west/northwest); Dadleigh, Syozlus (north); Tutton, Embrulton (east); Ronnymede, Wediton, Everdein (south-center); Camerdon, Lewes, Fellsay (south)

### Primary Conflicts

**Queen Akta's Reign**

The kingdom is in chaos. Akta seized power through violence and magic, and rules through the same. She's unpredictable, powerful, and possibly insane. The old nobility are dead, fled, or in hiding. Common people are terrified.

No one knows what Akta wants. She came from the south as a mercenary—her origins and motivations are unclear. Some think she's after something specific in Thespia. Others think she just wanted a kingdom to burn.

**The Dragon Shadow**

Morgnor, King of the Mountains, rules the peaks to the northwest. Thespia has always lived in his shadow, keeping their army small and their ambitions smaller. The previous king paid tribute and caused no trouble.

Akta has not continued the tribute. Whether this is madness, confidence, or simply not caring is unknown. Morgnor has not yet responded. When he does, it may be the end of Thespia—or the end of Akta. Or both.

**Neighbor Relations**

Glorin to the southwest and Stipen to the southeast are watching nervously. A mad queen on their border is bad enough. A mad queen who might provoke a dragon is worse.

### History

Thespia was always a quiet, unremarkable kingdom—farmers tending fields in the shadow of dragon mountains. They paid their tribute to Morgnor, traded grain for goods, and caused no trouble.

Then Akta came. No one knows exactly how she did it—the coup was fast and brutal. The king and his family are dead. The army capitulated or died. Now Thespia belongs to a madwoman, and everyone waits to see what happens next.

## Thorum

Tags: state

Links: States

The smallest of Ve's mountain states, Thorum clings to the Steadfast Mountains with the obstinacy of lichen on granite. Six settlements, one lake, endless pride. The Thorumni are a people apart—their language shares no roots with Shyona's elegant syllables, their gods answer to different names, and their customs strike lowlanders as either charmingly archaic or barbarously stubborn, depending on who's asked.

Shyona could conquer Thorum. Everyone knows this. The Thorumni know it best of all. But the Steadfast Mountains earned their name—every pass is a killing ground, every valley a trap, and the Thorumni have spent generations ensuring that any invasion would cost more than it could ever gain. Shyona's generals have done the math. The numbers don't work. So Thorum endures: too poor to covet, too fortified to break, too proud to bend.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Elective Voivodeship

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (Thorumni)

**Population**: 8,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Honor, hospitality, independence, ancestral tradition

- The Voivode is elected for life by the heads of the six major clans, one from each settlement. Upon a Voivode's death, the clans convene at Churup Lake to select a successor—a process that has occasionally taken years.
- Clan allegiance matters more than settlement residence. Marriages between clans require elaborate negotiations, and blood feuds can simmer for generations.
- Hospitality law is sacred. A guest under your roof is inviolate; harming them brings shame upon your entire clan. This extends even to enemies—if a Shyonan soldier stumbles wounded to a Thorumni door, custom demands he be fed, healed, and released unharmed. Then you may hunt him again.
- The Thorumni calendar diverges from Shyona's. They mark time by the Auris moon alone, considering Nyxara ill-omened. Hollownight is spent indoors with doors barred; they believe the dark moon draws hungry spirits from the peaks.

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

**Primary Exports**: Iron ore, copper, furs, mercenaries

**Primary Imports**: Grain, salt, manufactured goods, weapons

- Thorum survives on three pillars: mining, tolls, and blood.
- The southern slopes of the Sunrise Mountains hold iron and copper deposits that Thorum works with grim determination. The ore quality is decent, the conditions brutal. Mines operate only in summer; winter buries them entirely.
- The mountain passes between Shyona and the southern states funnel through Thorum's territory. Officially, the passes are "neutral." In practice, Thorum extracts tolls from any merchant foolish enough to travel without Shyonan military escort—and sometimes from those with one.
- Thorumni mercenaries command premium rates across Ve. They're not the most skilled fighters on the continent, but they're among the most reliable: a Thorumni sellsword who breaks contract brings shame on their entire clan. Employers trust that.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all adults)

- There is no standing army. There is no need for one. Every adult Thorumni trains from childhood in mountain warfare—ambush, rockfall, the patient art of making an invader bleed for every step.
- The Steadfast Guard, a rotating militia of roughly 200 warriors, patrols the passes and maintains the border watchtowers. Service is mandatory: one year in five for every able-bodied adult.
- Thorum's defensive doctrine is simple: make conquest prohibitively expensive. The passes are studded with prepared positions, hidden caches, and terrain features that turn deadly with minimal effort. Thorumni children learn which boulders are load-bearing before they learn to read.
- In living memory, no one has tested this doctrine seriously. The Thorumni consider this proof of its effectiveness.

### Geography

**Location**: Northeastern Widebarrow Mountains, bordered by Shyona (north), Dern (south), and Meadow Sound coastline (southeast)

**Biomes**: Alpine mountains, highland valleys, mixed forest

**Named Entities**: Steadfast Mountains, Dappled Forest (shared border zone)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Churup Lake, Torokovo River, Kremisch River

**Adjacent Waters**: Whisper Bay (Meadow Sound)

- The Steadfast Mountains dominate everything. Jagged peaks, treacherous passes, valleys that see sun for only hours each day in winter.
- Churup Lake sits in a highland bowl west of Dorlev, fed by snowmelt and drained by the Torokovo River. The Thorumni consider it sacred—clan councils meet on its shores, and the old Voivodes are buried in cairns along its western edge.
- The Dappled Forest marks the southwestern border with Shyona. Neither state claims it; both use it. Secret meetings happen here, duels are fought, and a hermit community tends a shrine to Melera that predates either nation.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Dorlev
**Cities**: Pichor
**Towns**: Winiza, Kiten
**Villages**: Stefanovo, Gorskiy

**Dorlev** — The capital perches in a mountain valley at the heart of the Steadfast range. More fortress than city, its stone buildings cluster around the Voivode's hall. Population perhaps 2,000. The architecture is practical: thick walls, steep roofs to shed snow, small windows to conserve heat. Visitors note the absence of inns—hospitality law means travelers stay in private homes, which locals consider more civilized anyway.

**Pichor** — The largest settlement and Thorum's window to the world. Pichor sits in the western lowlands where the mountains begin to flatten toward Shyona. Most trade passes through here; most Thorumni mercenaries depart from here. The city has grown almost cosmopolitan by local standards, which means foreigners can now find a tavern that serves something other than fermented mare's milk.

**Winiza** — A mining town on Churup Lake's southern shore. Iron and copper come down from the slopes; processed ore goes out to Pichor. The work is hard, the winters long, and the Winizani have a reputation for dour fatalism even by Thorumni standards.

**Kiten** — Guards the eastern passes toward Meadow Sound. A strategic chokepoint that has changed hands between Thorum and Shyona three times in recorded history. The current arrangement leaves it Thorumni, but Shyonan patrols watch the roads closely.

**Stefanovo** — A shepherding village in the southwestern valleys. Known for wool, cheese, and a fierce local variety of dog bred to fight wolves.

**Gorskiy** — A village below Dorlev, existing primarily to support the capital. Farms the limited arable land in the central valley.

### Primary Conflicts

- **Shyona**: The eternal tension. Contested passes, competing patrols, generations of border incidents that never quite escalate to war. Shyona's size makes them the existential threat; Thorum's terrain makes them the perpetual irritant. Both sides maintain the fiction of neutrality while preparing for the day it fails.
- **Dern**: Relations are cool but functional. Dern has its own problems (the Mez, the Lyzine raids) and no interest in adding Thorumni mountain warfare to the list. Trade flows; diplomacy is minimal.
- **Internal**: Clan rivalries simmer constantly. The current Voivode, Aleksar Gorovich, has held power for eighteen years by carefully balancing clan interests—but he's aging, and no clear successor has emerged. The next election could fracture the nation.

### History

The Thorumni origin is disputed. They claim descent from refugees who fled a great catastrophe in the distant past, finding shelter in the Steadfast Mountains when no one else would have them. Shyonan historians dismiss this as myth, suggesting the Thorumni are simply a splinter population from an older, now-vanished lowland culture.

What's certain: Thorum has been independent for at least eight centuries. Multiple Shyonan expansion attempts failed in the passes. The most serious, the War of Three Winters (approximately 400 years ago), saw a Shyonan army of 12,000 enter the mountains. Fewer than 3,000 left. Since then, Shyona has pursued diplomatic containment rather than military conquest.

The current détente dates to the Treaty of Dappled Stones, signed 200 years ago. The treaty established the neutral passes, formalized the border, and created the Dappled Forest buffer zone. Both sides have violated its spirit countless times while maintaining its letter.

### Hooks

- **The Succession Crisis**: Voivode Aleksar is dying. The clans are positioning. An outsider who wins favor with the right clan head could shape Thorum's future—or become a pawn in someone else's game.
- **The Melera Shrine**: The hermits in Dappled Forest know things. They've watched both nations for generations from their neutral ground. What secrets have they accumulated? What would they trade them for?
- **The Lost Mine**: Rumor speaks of a sealed mine in the high peaks, closed after something was found that the old Voivodes decided was better left buried. The Winizani know where it is. They won't say.
- **Shyonan Overtures**: A faction in Shyona's court is pushing for renewed expansion. They need an incident to justify military action. Someone in Thorum might be willing to provide one—for the right price.

## Tornia

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Occupied monarchy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, mixed

**Population**: 400,000

**Stability**: Very Unstable

**Core Values**: Tradition, wealth, spectacle (pre-occupation); resistance, resentment (current)

- Tornia was ruled by King Aldric, eldest son of the late King of Ofrenia who once held all three kingdoms united. Aldric was more interested in the Gem Crest Races than governance, leaving the state to rot from neglect.
- Queen Alisandra of Sylke recently invaded in a "fairly bloodless war"—Tornia's hollowed-out military offered little resistance. The king fled or was captured; the situation remains unclear.
- Sylke's occupation has transformed simmering popular discontent into active rebellion. Alisandra's agents had been stoking revolution for years, but now that she's the occupier, the rebels have turned against her too.
- The nobility are split—some collaborate with Sylke for survival, others fund resistance cells, and many simply fled to Joswik or the mainland.

### Economy

**Size**: Large (collapsing)

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Timber, ships, luxury goods, preserved fish, temporal services (illicit)

**Primary Imports**: Grain, wine, mercenaries, luxury goods

- The economy was already bleeding from King Aldric's obsession with the Gem Crest Races. Occupation has accelerated the collapse.
- The races continue—Alisandra hasn't stopped them, recognizing their value as distraction—but gambling houses now operate under Sylke supervision, and profits flow west.
- Besnoumeru's time-gangs have adapted to occupation with characteristic pragmatism. They're playing both sides, selling information to Sylke authorities while quietly supporting rebels who can pay.
- Trade routes are disrupted. Merchants avoid Ofrenia entirely when they can, routing through Myastor or the mainland.

### Military

**Size**: Small (remnant)

**Quality**: Low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (under Sylke command)

- What remains of the Tornian military has been absorbed into Sylke's occupation force or disbanded. Loyalist units fled south to Joswik or scattered into the countryside.
- The navy was captured largely intact—ships are valuable, and Sylke needed them.
- Resistance cells operate throughout the countryside. They're poorly coordinated but growing, drawing from disaffected soldiers, dispossessed nobles, and common folk who've had enough.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern Ofrenia, the island at the heart of the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Temperate forests, coastal lowlands, river deltas, agricultural plains

**Named Entities**: Glowbud Forest, Shadewood Forest, Gem Crest Bay, Blue Lake

**Rivers & Lakes**: Blue Lake, the Catalina River delta

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea, Gem Crest Bay, the Passage (south)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Catalina (under occupation)

**Cities**: Catalina (including Besnoumeru), Mithras, Highwater

**Towns**: Port Edott, Northpoint, Ryerton, Bexley, Ylidor, Oakheart, Meadowlea, Gerstown Rapids, Lowwater, Goodlawn, Tall Woods, Blank Point, Thenbury, Minos, Watertown

**Villages**: Numerous fishing villages along the coast

### Primary Conflicts

**The Occupation**

Sylke's armies hold Tornia, but holding isn't the same as controlling. Alisandra's troops garrison the major towns and patrol the roads, but the countryside seethes with resistance. Every week brings reports of ambushed supply wagons, assassinated collaborators, and occupation soldiers found dead in ditches.

**The Failed Revolution**

Alisandra spent years stoking revolution in Tornia, planning to sweep in as liberator once the old regime fell. Instead, she invaded before the revolution matured—and now the rebels she cultivated have turned against her. They wanted freedom, not a different queen.

**The Time-Gang Opportunism**

Besnoumeru's time-gangs see opportunity in chaos. They're selling intelligence to everyone, manipulating markets more brazenly than ever, and quietly acquiring the properties of fled nobles. Some suspect they're positioning themselves to emerge from the occupation as the real power in Tornia.

**Glowbud Forest**

The royal menagerie's escaped jaguars have transformed Glowbud Forest into a death trap. The great cats hunt humans now. Occupation forces avoid the forest; rebels use its edges as refuge, accepting the risk.

### History

Tornia was once the seat of power for all Ofrenia. The previous king—father to Aldric, Alisandra, and their brother in Joswik—united the island through diplomacy, marriage, and occasional war. Under his rule, Ofrenia prospered. The Gem Crest Races were prestigious events, not gambling dens. The time and darkness ley lines that cross Tornia were studied by respected scholars, not exploited by criminals.

When the old king died, he divided Ofrenia among his three children, expecting them to rule in harmony. Instead, they turned on each other within a year.

Tornia received Aldric, the eldest—handsome, charming, and utterly uninterested in governance. He inherited the richest kingdom and the strongest claim to reunification, then squandered both on pleasure and spectacle. The races consumed his attention. The treasury drained. The borders weakened.

Alisandra watched from Sylke, patient as a spider. She sent agents to fan revolutionary sentiment, bribed border commanders, and waited for the perfect moment. When she finally moved, Tornia's military collapsed in weeks. The "bloodless war" was bloodless because there was barely anyone willing to fight for Aldric.

Now Tornia is occupied territory, and Alisandra is learning that conquest is easier than rule. The land remembers better days—ancient roads built by forgotten empires, temples to half-forgotten gods, pre-human ruins beneath Catalina where the time-gangs learned their craft. That history doesn't belong to Sylke, and Tornia's people haven't forgotten it.

## Trømgar

Tags: state, dwarves, innerrim

The mountain fortress. Trømgar is a dwarven nation where warfare has become religion, where armor is sacred art, and where how one dies matters more than how one lived. The Strømgodden have carved their civilization into the Thunderdark Peaks, creating fortress-cities that have never fallen and forging a culture that measures worth in battle-scars and glorious endings.

This is not mere militarism—the Strømgodden genuinely believe that combat is holy, that sacrifice in battle honors the gods, and that a spectacular death redeems any life. Their spiked armor transforms each warrior's body into a weapon; their charge attacks trade damage given for damage taken, accepting wounds to deliver devastation. They are simultaneously the most honorable and the most terrifying warriors on Alaria.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Military meritocracy (Warcouncil)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Strømgodden (battle dwarves)

**Population**: ~50,000

**Stability**: Very stable

**Core Values**: Sacrifice, fury, glory, battle, bravery, "full heart"

#### The Warcouncil

Trømgar is ruled by the **Warcouncil**, a body of twelve war-leaders who have proven themselves through exceptional deeds in battle. Seats are earned, not inherited—a warrior who achieves sufficient glory may challenge for a position, and the Council regularly loses members to combat deaths (as expected and honored).

The Warcouncil makes decisions by consensus when possible, by combat when necessary. Disputes that cannot be resolved through debate are settled in the **Ring of Judgment**, where the disagreeing parties fight until one yields or dies. This sounds chaotic to outsiders, but it produces remarkably efficient governance—the Strømgodden don't waste time on debates that could be settled by blade.

The current Council includes warriors from each major fortress-city, ensuring regional representation, plus several "wandering seats" held by heroes whose deeds transcend local affiliation.

#### The High Forge-Master

A unique position outside the Warcouncil: the **High Forge-Master** oversees all armor-smithing in Trømgar. This role is spiritual as much as practical—the Forge-Master ensures that sacred techniques are preserved, that the gods of war receive their due honor in every piece of armor created, and that no inferior work leaves the forges.

The current High Forge-Master, **Valdrik Ironvein**, has held the position for forty years. His armor is worn by half the Warcouncil, and his word on matters of smithing tradition carries more weight than any warrior's blade.

#### Strømgodden Society

Strømgodden society is organized around the concept of **drengskald**—roughly translated as "warrior-worth" or "battle-reputation." Every adult Strømgodden accumulates drengskald through combat, craftsmanship (especially armor-smithing), and sacrifice. Those with high drengskald command respect; those with low drengskald are pitied rather than scorned.

Children begin combat training at age ten. By fifteen, they've forged their first piece of spiked armor—a coming-of-age ritual that marks the transition to adulthood. By twenty, most have seen their first real combat against Ix'Vasyla raiders or in the ritual challenges that settle personal disputes.

Women fight alongside men in Strømgodden culture; the gods care only for courage, not gender. Some of the most legendary warriors in Trømgar's history have been women, and their names are carved in the Hall of Glorious Ends alongside any man's.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (specialized)

**Primary Exports**: Weapons, armor, metalwork, mercenary services

**Primary Imports**: Food, textiles, luxury goods

#### The Forge Economy

Trømgar's economy runs on metal and war. The Thunderdark Peaks provide abundant iron, copper, and the rare alloys needed for superior armor-smithing. Strømgodden metalwork commands premium prices across Alaria—their weapons never break, their armor never fails, and their spiked designs are both functional and terrifying.

Beyond equipment, the Strømgodden export their services. Strømgodden mercenaries are expensive but worth it—disciplined, fearless, and bound by personal honor to fulfill their contracts. They're especially valued for desperate situations where other soldiers would break and run.

#### Economic Limitations

Food is Trømgar's weakness. The mountains don't support significant agriculture, and the population depends on trade for grain, vegetables, and anything that doesn't grow in stone. This vulnerability is mitigated by extensive stockpiles—every fortress-city maintains years' worth of preserved food—but a prolonged siege or trade embargo would eventually bite.

The Strømgodden are aware of this weakness and deeply resentful of it. Their dependence on lowland food is considered slightly shameful, a necessary compromise with a world that doesn't cooperate with dwarven ideals.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Extremely High

**Enrollment**: Universal

#### The Spiked Doctrine

Strømgodden combat doctrine is unique: their armor is their primary weapon. Every warrior wears custom-fitted armor embedded with spikes, blades, and protrusions designed to turn the body into a weapon. The signature **spiked charge** involves building momentum and slamming into enemies body-first, the armor's spikes doing the killing.

This fighting style is inherently sacrificial. The impact damages the charger as well as the target. Warriors accept wounds to deliver wounds, trading their own blood for enemy blood. Against most opponents, this exchange favors the armored dwarf—but the Strømgodden would use the tactic even if it didn't, because sacrifice itself is holy.

#### Organization

The Strømgodden military is organized by fortress-city. Each settlement maintains its own garrison and can field warriors for offensive operations when the Warcouncil calls. A full muster of all fortress-cities would produce perhaps 15,000 warriors—small compared to nations like Gorath, but each Strømgodden fighter is worth several ordinary soldiers.

Elite units include:
- **The Venom-Scarred**: Warriors who have survived Ix'Vasyla bites, specialists in anti-lizardfolk combat
- **The Tunnel-Breakers**: Experts in underground warfare, maintaining the tunnel network and fighting in its depths
- **The Storm-Riders**: Warriors who fight during thunderstorms, using the lightning and chaos to their advantage

#### Every Citizen a Soldier

Military service in Trømgar isn't mandatory because it doesn't need to be—the entire culture is military. Every adult Strømgodden trains for combat, maintains their armor, and stands ready to fight when called. There is no distinction between "soldier" and "civilian" because the concept of civilian doesn't exist.

### Geography

**Location**: Eastern Inner Rim (Thunderdark Peaks)

**Biomes**: Mountain (dominant), highland forest, coastal mangroves (claimed but unoccupied)

**Named Regions**: Thunderdark Peaks, Duskwood Forest, Whispering Mangroves, Croaking Briars (border)

**Rivers**: Several unnamed rivers flowing from the peaks

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Levke

**Fortress-Cities**: Andvik, Kavnendal

**Outposts**: Traut

### Relations

**Nashua**: Eternal war. The Ix'Vasyla and Strømgodden have fought for generations in a conflict that has become almost ritualized. Neither side can conquer the other—the dwarves can't survive in the toxic marshes, the lizardfolk can't take the mountain fortresses. Both sides seem to find this arrangement... acceptable. The enemy you know, and all that.

**Gorath**: Cold war heating up. The Strømgodden are furious about Gorath's enslavement of Drasnian dwarves—distant kin, but kin nonetheless. Diplomatic protests have been ignored. Trade sanctions have been ineffective. More direct action is being discussed in the Warcouncil, though Gorath's sheer size makes open war inadvisable.

**Phirexes**: Barrier relationship. The Croaking Briars prevent meaningful contact. The Strømgodden know something lies beyond the briars, ruled by some queen the traders whisper about, but they can't reach it and it can't reach them. A frustrating stalemate for a people who prefer problems they can hit.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: Complicated kinship. The Strømgodden consider themselves the truest dwarves—the ones who remember what it means to be warriors. They view other dwarven cultures with a mixture of kinship and contempt, respecting their craftsmanship while deploring their softness.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Nashua War**: Endless but contained. Seasonal campaigns, ritual raids, acceptable casualties. Neither side wants to escalate because neither can win.

- **The Gorath Question**: How to respond to the enslavement of Drasnian kin? Open war is suicide against Gorath's numbers. Doing nothing is dishonorable. The Warcouncil debates while young hotheads agitate for action.

- **The Briars**: A frustration rather than a conflict. The Strømgodden hate that they can't breach the Croaking Briars through force. It offends their worldview.

### History

The Strømgodden arrived in the Thunderdark Peaks in an era now lost to exact record—at least eight centuries ago, possibly more. They came from somewhere else, fleeing or conquering or simply wandering, and found mountains that suited them.

The first fortress-cities rose within decades. The wars with the Ix'Vasyla began almost immediately and have never truly stopped. The culture of sacred warfare developed over generations, crystallizing into its current form roughly three centuries ago when the **Prophet Bjornir** codified the theology of glorious death.

Recent centuries have been stable—if "stable" can describe a nation in perpetual war. The Strømgodden population remains steady, deaths roughly balanced by births, the eternal conflict with Nashua providing both threat and meaning. The rising tension with Gorath over the Drasnian question is the first significant change in generations.

### Culture

#### Glorious Death

The Strømgodden believe that how one dies determines one's fate in the afterlife. A glorious death—in battle, through sacrifice, achieving something worthy—earns a place in the eternal feast-halls of the war-gods. An inglorious death—from old age, disease, or cowardice—condemns one to... something worse. The theology is vague on exactly what, but no Strømgodden wants to find out.

This belief shapes everything. The elderly seek death in combat rather than fade away. The sick volunteer for suicide missions. No Strømgodden retires, ever. They fight until they can't, then they find a way to die well.

#### The Armor-Soul

Strømgodden believe that a warrior's soul partially inhabits their armor. The forging process isn't just metalworking—it's spiritual binding, weaving the wearer's essence into the steel. This is why Strømgodden armor is never passed down or inherited; when a warrior dies, their armor is either buried with them or melted and reforged with the next generation's spirit.

Damaging a Strømgodden's armor is not just practical injury—it's spiritual violation. Warriors have killed over scratches to their plate.

#### The Full Heart

To act with a "full heart" (**hjartenful**) is the highest Strømgodden virtue: to commit completely, to hold nothing back, to throw oneself entirely into battle, craft, love, or anything worth doing. Half-measures are contemptible. If something is worth doing, it's worth dying for.

This philosophy produces warriors of terrifying commitment—and a society that struggles with nuance, compromise, and the kind of patient diplomacy that other nations practice.

### Hooks & Tensions

**The Drasnian Underground**: Some Strømgodden are not content to wait for the Warcouncil to act on the Gorath situation. An underground network is forming, planning to strike at Gorathi slave operations directly. The Warcouncil officially disapproves. Unofficially, some members are sympathetic.

**The Briar-Breakers**: A young warrior named Astrid Thornsdaughter has sworn to breach the Croaking Briars or die trying. She's gathering followers, studying the patterns of the briars, and planning an assault that veterans consider suicidal. She might be mad—or she might succeed where generations have failed.

**The Old Tunnels**: The tunnel network beneath the Thunderdark Peaks connects to passages older than the Strømgodden presence. Something lives in the deepest levels. The dwarves have sealed those passages, but seals don't last forever.

**The Peace Faction**: A small but growing group questions the eternal war with Nashua. What if peace were possible? What if both sides simply... stopped? This heresy is dangerous to voice, but the whispers spread nonetheless.

**The Foreign Forges**: Strømgodden armor-smithing techniques are closely guarded. But someone has been selling secrets to outsiders—inferior copies of Strømgodden designs have appeared in distant markets. The High Forge-Master has sworn to find and execute the traitor.

## Tykos

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Slaver aristocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Minotaurs, humans (enslaved)

**Population**: 35,000 (including slaves)

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Strength, dominance, tradition, hierarchy

- Tykos is ruled by minotaur clans who've practiced slavery for as long as anyone can remember. The strong rule; the weak serve. This isn't philosophy to them—it's simply how the world works.
- The minotaur aristocracy controls all land, all trade, and all decision-making. Humans and other races exist as property, workers, or (rarely) freed servants with limited rights.
- The clan system determines everything. Each major settlement is controlled by a clan, and inter-clan politics drive most conflicts. Marriages, alliances, and betrayals follow patterns as old as the islands themselves.
- Outsiders view Tykos with disgust, but the minotaurs don't care. They trade with anyone willing to buy or sell, and many are willing—Tykos slaves are well-trained and relatively cheap.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Slaves, labor, mercenaries, livestock, stone

**Primary Imports**: Luxury goods, weapons, grain

- The slave trade is Tykos's primary industry. Captives from raids, purchased prisoners, and the children of existing slaves flow through Tykos's markets to buyers across the Middle Sea.
- The minotaurs themselves are sought after as mercenaries—massive, disciplined, and terrifying in battle. Clans hire out warriors for premium prices.
- Quarries in the rocky islands produce quality building stone, extracted by slave labor and shipped throughout the region.
- Agriculture is limited by the terrain; Tykos imports much of its grain and pays with the products of forced labor.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Mandatory (for minotaurs)

- Every minotaur male trains for war. Military service is a coming-of-age requirement and a lifelong obligation. The clans compete through martial prowess as much as political maneuvering.
- The Tykos navy is formidable—fast raiding ships designed to strike coastal settlements, take captives, and escape before organized resistance can form.
- Slave soldiers exist but are used carefully. Armed slaves are a risk, and the minotaurs prefer to do their own fighting when possible.

### Geography

**Location**: Island chain south of Erpeus, in the Middle Sea

**Biomes**: Rocky islands, scrubland, limited arable land

**Named Entities**: Tiber's Passage (north), Tykon Channel (east)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Limited freshwater; cisterns and wells are critical

**Adjacent Waters**: The Middle Sea (all directions), Tiber's Passage, Tykon Channel

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Slavos (the largest settlement and primary slave market)

**Cities**: Slavos

**Towns**: Toros, Skoldar, Fynol, Alyzon, Pyndar, Stonebreach

**Villages**: Scarr, Seaview, numerous smaller settlements

### Primary Conflicts

**Inter-Clan Rivalry**

The clans compete constantly for status, territory, and slaves. Open warfare is rare—it damages valuable property and weakens everyone—but raids, assassinations, and political maneuvering are constant. The current balance of power is always temporary.

**The Abolition Movement**

Some outsiders, particularly in Lier and the United Free Nations, argue that Tykos's slave trade should be ended by force. So far, no one has been willing to pay the cost of such a war. But as the moral arguments grow louder and Tykos's neighbors grow stronger, the calculation may change.

**Escaped Slaves**

Slaves who escape Tykos have nowhere safe to go on the islands—but some manage to reach the sea, steal boats, or swim to passing ships. The minotaurs hunt escapees relentlessly; a successful escape encourages others. The underground network that helps slaves flee is small, secretive, and constantly hunted.

**The Ofrenia Disruption**

Alisandra's conquest of Tornia has disrupted regional trade, including Tykos's slave markets. Some buyers can't reach the islands; others are distracted by war. The clans are adapting, but the uncertainty makes them nervous.

### History

The minotaurs came to these islands in an age before human memory, fleeing something they don't discuss. They found rocky terrain, limited resources, and a strategic position at the crossroads of Middle Sea trade. They adapted.

Slavery emerged naturally—or so the minotaurs claim. Raiding coastal settlements for workers solved the labor shortage. Selling surplus captives created trade relationships. The system grew, formalized, became tradition. By the time other civilizations developed moral objections, Tykos was too entrenched and too profitable to change easily.

The clan structure evolved to manage competition without constant warfare. Rules about raiding, about treatment of slaves, about territorial boundaries—these developed over generations, creating a society that's brutal but stable. The minotaurs see themselves as honest about what every civilization practices covertly: the strong exploit the weak. At least Tykos doesn't pretend otherwise.

Modern Tykos is much as it's always been. The slave markets operate. The clans compete. The minotaurs prosper while their property suffers. Outsiders condemn them and continue trading. The system continues because no one has yet found a way to stop it that doesn't cost more than they're willing to pay.

## Ubrik

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Democracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Uline (Chain Dwarves)

**Population**: 30,000 (and falling)

**Stability**: Catastrophic

**Core Values**: Wealth, honor, determination, grit

- Class ranking determined by land ownership. Wealthy mine-owners at top, landless workers at bottom—trapped in debt, working the mines to survive.
- Uline are stubborn, pragmatic, and respect authority. The democracy functions through councils of landowners; the landless have no vote.
- Even before the outbreak, Ubrik was a powder keg—brutal class disparity, cruel working conditions, and simmering resentment.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium (collapsing)

**Tech**: Somewhat developed

**Primary Exports**: Metals (formerly)

**Primary Imports**: Food, luxury items for the rich

- Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though the alliance is straining under Ubrik's crisis.
- The wealthy lived in luxury while miners lived in destitution. Now the wealthy are fleeing with their gold while the poor are left to deal with the infected.
- Most mines have been abandoned or overrun by silvertongues.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Very low

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- The Ubrik military consists of conscripted peasants with little training and no desire to fight.
- Completely inadequate to contain the silvertongue outbreak. Military units sent into infected mines rarely return.

### Geography

**Location**: Middle Sea coast, between Camaran (east) and Bestacia (west)

**Biomes**: Mountainous highlands, mining valleys, sparse forests

**Climate**: Temperate continental, cold in the mountain heights

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Grothak (partially evacuated)

**Cities**: Grothak, various mining settlements (many abandoned or overrun)

**Towns**: Refugee camps forming along southern borders

### The Silvertongue Outbreak

**Slick Silver** is a corrupted mineral discovered in Ubrik's deepest mines—a shimmering, mercury-like substance that calls to those who see it. Miners who touched it felt compelled to taste it. Those who consumed it transformed.

The infection spreads through ingestion. Victims' mouths fill with liquid silver that coats their teeth and tongue, eventually spreading through the bloodstream. The silver drives them into cannibalistic madness—they lose all reason, attacking and consuming the living. Their eyes turn metallic, their veins visible as silver threads beneath the skin.

**The silvertongues** retain enough cunning to hunt. They don't just wander—they pursue, ambush, and overwhelm. Worse, they seem driven to spread the infection, forcing Slick Silver down victims' throats.

The outbreak started in the northern mines. Poor miners were exposed first—the wealthy owners didn't go underground. By the time anyone understood what was happening, entire mining communities had turned. Now the silvertongues are spreading beyond the mines, raiding nearby settlements and even crossing into neighboring states.

There is no known cure. Quarantine and extermination are the only containment measures, and they're failing.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Spreading Plague**

Silvertongues have escaped the mines and now terrorize the countryside. Their numbers grow with every settlement they overrun. Ubrik's military cannot contain them. The infected are spreading into Bestacia and threatening Camaran's eastern border.

**The Refugee Crisis**

Thousands of Ubrik dwarves have fled south and west, pouring into Bestacia, Camaran, and other neighboring states. They bring nothing but fear and desperation. Host countries are overwhelmed; some are closing borders. Rumors that any Ubrik dwarf might be infected are causing persecution and violence against refugees.

**Political Fallout**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Erasnus is desperately trying to hold it together, but member states blame each other for the crisis. Camaran is using the outbreak to justify further isolationism. Bestacia is dealing with both refugees and silvertongue incursions.

**Internal Collapse**

What remains of Ubrik's government has retreated to the southern regions. The landowners who caused the brutal conditions that made the outbreak worse are now safe behind private guards while the common people suffer. Some refugees are more angry at their own nobility than at the silvertongues.

### History

Ubrik was founded by Uline dwarves who discovered rich mineral veins in the mountains. For centuries, the mines produced iron, copper, and precious metals that made the landowners wealthy. The workers who actually dug the ore saw little of this wealth—trapped in cycles of debt, they had no path to land ownership and no political voice.

The class system was always brutal, but it was stable. Then prospectors struck something new in the deep northern mines—Slick Silver. It glittered beautifully. It seemed valuable. The first miners who touched it couldn't resist tasting it.

Within months, the northern mines went silent. Rescue parties didn't return. By the time the surface understood what had happened, it was too late. The silvertongues emerged hungry, and Ubrik began to die.

## Uhionai

Tags: state, orc, westwilds

A nation of orcs who become trees when they die—and sometimes wake again. The Uihonaii control the ancient Ryunimir Forest in the far northwest of the Wildwood, where the groves of their ancestors stand silent and watchful, and weapons carved from sacred wood carry the spirits of those who came before.

### Overview

The Uihonaii are the oldest of the Wildwood orcs in a literal sense: their elders have lived for centuries, dying and being reborn from their tree-forms in cycles that span generations. They call themselves the Wooden Men, and their connection to the Ryunimir Forest is not metaphorical. Their bloodline is bound to the trees. When a Uihonaii dies, they become a tree. When the time is right, they may wake again.

This makes Uhionai society profoundly different from other orc states. They take the long view because they have no choice—the same leaders, the same ancestors, the same conflicts echo across centuries. They're defensive because their sacred groves cannot be moved. They're patient because time means something different when you've already lived three lives.

### Government

**Type:** Grove Council

The Uihonaii are governed by a council of the Reborn—those who have died, become trees, and awakened again. Political authority flows from accumulated wisdom; those who have lived longest and remembered most guide the nation.

**The Grove Council:**
- **First Root Yorunax** — Has been reborn four times across seven centuries. Speaks rarely; when he does, others listen. His memories stretch back to before the other orc states existed.
- **Second Root Vethani** — Three lives, four centuries. The most active voice on the council; handles day-to-day governance while Yorunax contemplates deeper matters.
- **Third Root Sulthek** — Two lives, two centuries. The youngest Reborn. Still adjusting to his accumulated memories; sometimes forgets which life he's in.
- **The Waking Grove** — A collective voice representing trees that are stirring but not yet fully awakened. Their semi-conscious input is channeled through ritual.

Below the Grove Council are the Living Elders—Uihonaii who have not yet died and been reborn. They manage practical affairs and will eventually take their place among the trees.

### Culture

**The Uihonaii** have bark-like patches on their skin that grow more prominent with age. Their eyes are amber or deep brown, and their hair often takes on the color of autumn leaves. In tree form, they're indistinguishable from ancient oaks or ironwoods until you notice the faint outline of a sleeping face in the bark.

**Core Values:**
- **The Grove Is Eternal** — Individual lives are temporary; the grove endures forever. All decisions must consider centuries, not years.
- **Memory Is Sacred** — The Reborn carry memories across lifetimes. Forgetting is worse than death.
- **The Soil Remembers** — Only specific soil can support the transformation. Protecting these sacred sites is the highest duty.
- **Blood and Sap Are One** — The trees are not metaphors for ancestors; they are ancestors. Harming a tree is harming family.

**Society:** Uihonaii society is divided into the Reborn (who have died and returned), the Elders (who are nearing their first death), the Living (ordinary adults), and the Seedlings (children). Social mobility is inevitable—everyone eventually becomes a tree. Status comes from accumulated wisdom, not wealth or martial prowess.

Death is not mourned but celebrated. When an Elder feels their time approaching, they journey to a sacred grove and take root. Their family tends the new tree until they wake—which might take years or centuries.

**The Weapons:** Blades carved from Uihonaii sacred wood carry the spirits of those trees. A sword made from Third Root Sulthek's first-life tree would carry echoes of his memories and personality. These weapons are sentient, powerful, and deeply personal. They're never sold—only gifted to those who have earned the right.

### Economy

**Size:** Small
**Tech:** Somewhat Developed (in woodcraft), Undeveloped (in everything else)

**Primary Exports:**
- Sacred wood artifacts (extremely rare, only traded in exceptional circumstances)
- Herbal medicines from the deep forest
- Wisdom (the Reborn sometimes consent to advise outsiders, for a price)

**Primary Imports:**
- Metal (the Uihonaii don't mine)
- Food during lean seasons
- Nothing else—they're remarkably self-sufficient

The Uihonaii don't trade much. They don't need to. The Ryunimir Forest provides everything they require, and they've learned over centuries to live within their means. When they do trade, they prefer services and knowledge to goods.

### Military

**Size:** Very Small
**Quality:** High
**Enrollment:** Universal (but only when the groves are threatened)

The Uihonaii military doctrine is simple: don't start fights, but finish them. Their warriors carry weapons of sacred wood—swords that whisper advice, spears that remember where enemies are vulnerable, shields that warn of incoming attacks. A Uihonaii warrior with an ancestral blade is worth five ordinary soldiers.

**The Grove Guard:** Standing defenders of the sacred groves. Small in number, but they know every tree in the forest and can disappear into the woods like ghosts. They don't fight conventional battles; they ambush, harass, and wait for invaders to make mistakes.

**The Awakening:** In times of true crisis, the grove can wake. Trees that were once warriors can temporarily animate, fighting alongside the living. This hasn't happened in two centuries, but the threat alone deters most attackers.

**Weaknesses:**
- Tiny numbers. The Uihonaii cannot sustain prolonged conflict.
- Immobile assets. The sacred groves cannot be moved; if enemies destroy them, the Reborn are lost forever.
- Fire. The forest burns. The ancestors burn.
- They're terrible at offense. Defending the forest is one thing; projecting power beyond it is nearly impossible.

### Geography

**Location:** Far northwest Wildwood, the Ryunimir Forest

**Biomes:** Ancient temperate forest, unusually dense, with clearings where the sacred groves stand

**Key Locations:**
- **The First Grove** — The oldest sacred site, where Yorunax and the earliest Reborn took root. Forbidden to outsiders.
- **Waking Hollow** — Where trees on the verge of reawakening are tended. A place of strange whispers and half-heard voices.
- **The Boundary Oaks** — Ancient trees along the southern border that mark where Uhionai territory begins. Crossing them without permission is considered an act of war.
- **The Speaking Glade** — Where the Grove Council meets and where outsiders may petition for audience.

**Borders:**
- South/Southeast: Tarn (occasional friction)
- East: Grieb (distant, minimal contact)
- North: Unclaimed wilderness, eventually the Northlands
- West: More forest, eventually the Walking Forest

### Relations

**Tarn:** Occasional border conflicts. The Tarni want access to certain forest resources; the Uihonaii refuse to let them cut trees. Neither side seeks war, but young warriors from both nations sometimes clash. The Spirit Council and the Grove Council have maintained an uneasy peace through mutual respect—both cultures revere the dead, just differently.

**Hedroscobb:** Almost no contact. The Black Orcs are too far south, and they have nothing the Uihonaii want.

**Glivornax:** Distant respect. The Glivornaxi understand guardianship of sacred places. Occasional diplomatic contact.

**Shazuihn:** The boar riders don't attack Uhionai. The forest is too dense for boars, and the Uihonaii have made it clear that entering Ryunimir means war. After one disastrous raid three generations ago, the Shazuihni learned to leave the Wooden Men alone.

**Grieb:** Distant neighbors. The Uihonaii and Griebi have little reason to interact—and the Grove Council's ancient memories suggest the lakemen are best left alone.

**The Orc Moot:** The Uihonaii send representatives but rarely advocate for anything. Their concerns are local; what happens in the southern Wildwood matters little to them as long as the Ryunimir remains safe.

### Conflicts

**The Long Memory:** The Reborn remember old grudges across centuries. Conflicts that other orcs have forgotten still simmer in Uhionai memory. First Root Yorunax remembers when the Tarni were raiding tribes, before they developed spirit-sight. Some grievances never truly heal.

**The Fading Groves:** Some sacred groves are producing fewer viable transformations. Trees die but don't awaken. Is the magic fading? Is the soil exhausted? Or is something darker happening?

**The Outsiders' Interest:** Word is spreading that Uihonaii weapons are extraordinarily powerful. Adventurers, mercenaries, and foreign powers are becoming more interested in Ryunimir. The Grove Council debates whether isolation can be maintained.

### History

The Uihonaii were the first orcs to settle the Wildwood, long before the other tribes arrived. They discovered the tree-bond by accident—an elder who should have died instead woke years later from an oak that hadn't been there before.

Over centuries, they refined the bond, identified the sacred soils, and built a society around the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. When the other orc nations formed, the Uihonaii withdrew into their forest and made it clear that their borders were not to be crossed.

They've watched empires rise and fall. They've seen the Wildwood change hands a dozen times. They endure because they take the long view—and because their ancestors are always watching.

### Player Hooks

- Seek an audience with the Reborn to learn forgotten history
- Commission a sacred wood weapon (requires proving yourself worthy across years)
- Investigate the Fading Groves—why are some trees refusing to awaken?
- Mediate the ancient grudge between Uhionai and Tarn
- Protect a sacred grove from mercenaries seeking to harvest weapons
- Accompany an Elder on their final journey to take root

## United Free Nations

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Confederate city states

**Primary Inhabitants**: Halfling, gnomes, goblins, dwarves, Swuigrach

**Population**: 25,000

**Stability**: Somewhat stable

**Core Values**: Freedom

- The United Free Nations, or UFN are a confederacy of allied city states. Each city state is a metropolis consisting of a multitude of races, treated as equals.
- Many consist of banished, once enslaved, or oppressed races. The cities welcome anyone who needs a home.
- Although the cities are allied and have promises to defend each other, they are technically totally independent.


### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Each city is different

**Primary Imports**: Refugees

- The economies of the city states thrive. Most cities are managed by competent capitalists.
- Those with money are most powerful in society.


### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Each city is required to meet a quota of military members at all times throughout the year. They are expected to be kept at a certain level of skill, and each city state's militaries train together once a year.


### Geography

### Political Geography

**Capital**: 

**Cities**: 

**Towns**: 

**Villages**: 


### Primary Conflicts

- Some cities believe that there should be a more unified government for all the cities, one that could manage the military more efficiently, and also orchestrate better trade deals so that states weren't competing with each other. 
- Others believe that there should be even less government, as they don't want to see control over their cities given away to people they view as outsiders. 


### History

## Urzula

Tags: state, city_state, elder_wilds

A city-state built beneath massive waterfalls in the Seyiy region of the Elder Wilds—the only significant settlement in the region outside L'Coth D'hari.

### Overview

Urzula clings to cliff faces and occupies caves behind curtains of falling water. The city exists in perpetual mist, the roar of waterfalls a constant backdrop to daily life. Climbers hang from ropes along the cliffside, harvesting the rare plants that grow only in this unique microclimate—medicinal mosses, exotic herbs, bioluminescent fungi.

Access is difficult by design. The only approaches are dangerous climbing routes or navigation of the treacherous rivers that drain from Seyiy's heights. This isolation has kept Urzula independent and relatively safe from the dangers of the Elder Wilds.

### The Titan Ruins

Beneath modern Urzula lie the remains of an ancient titan city—one of the few titan settlements documented in Aboyinzu. The current inhabitants occasionally find artifacts, strange inscriptions, and chambers of unknown purpose in the depths below their homes.

The ruins have never been fully explored. The depths are dangerous—unstable, partially flooded, and occasionally disgorging creatures or energies that the Urzulans have learned to contain rather than investigate. They are more interested in surviving the present than excavating the past.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council (elected representatives from major guilds)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans, with small populations of other races

**Population**: Approximately 3,000 permanent residents

**Stability**: Stable

The city is governed by a council drawn from its major guilds—the Climbers' Guild, the Herbalists' Collective, the Traders' Circle, and the Guardians (who maintain the city's defenses and contain threats from the depths).

### Economy

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Developed (sophisticated rope-work, climbing gear, and preservation techniques)

**Primary Exports**: Rare medicinal plants, bioluminescent compounds, waterfall-grown herbs

**Primary Imports**: Metal goods, grain, textiles, weapons

Urzula's economy depends entirely on what grows in the mist. Their medicinal exports command high prices from distant markets, but the difficulty of reaching the city limits trade volume.

### Relations

- **L'Coth D'hari**: Cautious respect. The Gamori occasionally trade at Urzula's edges but view the Seyiy region as their hunting grounds. Territorial disputes occur.
- **Dalizi Confederation**: Primary trading partners. Dalizi merchants are the most common outsiders in Urzula.
- **The Wider World**: Urzula is known but rarely visited. Its exports travel far, but its location deters casual contact.

### Dangers

The Archfalls lie to the south—a maze of waterfalls, ancient stonework, and death. Water hags, pterodactyls, brain-eating amoebae, and treacherous terrain make the southern approaches nearly impassable.

The depths below the city harbor unknown threats from the titan ruins. Occasionally something emerges that requires the Guardians' attention.

The jungle surrounding Urzula contains the standard dangers of the Elder Wilds—though the apes rarely venture this far south into Seyiy.

## Vetral

Tags: state, alrock ocean, theocracy, triton, underwater

An ancient triton theocracy claiming sovereignty over the entire Alrock Ocean. The Vetralians fled Adron in an age so distant that even the naga have forgotten why. Now they are reclusive, arrogant lords of the deep—and they are losing a war they cannot afford to lose.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocracy

**Primary Inhabitants**: Triton

**Population**: Unknown (estimates range from 50,000 to 200,000)

**Stability**: Strained

**Core Values**: Divine mandate, oceanic sovereignty, ancestral tradition, secrecy

**The Depths Conclave**: Vetral is ruled by a council of high priests who interpret the will of their sea-gods. The eldest serves as Voice of the Deep, speaking for the Conclave in matters requiring a single authority. Succession is determined through elaborate divination rituals that reportedly take months.

**The Sovereignty Claim**: Vetral claims the entire Alrock Ocean as sacred territory—from the seabed to the surface, from Adron's eastern coast to Ve's western shores. This claim is ancient, largely symbolic, and until recently, enforced only near Vetralian waters. Surface nations have never recognized it. The tritons have never needed recognition; they've needed only enforcement.

**The Old Lanes**: For millennia, Vetral maintained order through a simple arrangement. Ships that follow the "Old Lanes"—ancient, twisting routes that avoid triton holy sites and breeding grounds—sail safely. Ships that stray experience accidents: uncharted reefs, freak storms, vessels that simply never arrive. Nobody calls it piracy. The tritons take nothing. Ships just... have bad luck.

### The Bfaspeik War

The conflict with the Bfaspeen has ground on for longer than surface nations have kept records. Two underwater civilizations with incompatible interests, fighting over territory that neither can afford to cede.

**What Vetral Wants**: Ordered seas. The Old Lanes system depends on predictable surface activity. Ships following approved routes means the tritons can manage what happens above their domain. Control is everything.

**What the Bfaspeen Want**: Chaos. The Bfaspeen thrive on shipwrecks—every merchant vessel that sinks adds to their glittering hoards. Orderly trade lanes protected by triton "accidents" are bad for the brood mothers' treasure piles.

**The Current State**: Vetral is losing. Slowly, but losing. The Bfaspeen breed faster, fight dirtier, and don't care about casualties. Every triton offensive follows the same pattern: initial victories, then grinding attrition, then withdrawal. The brood mothers retreat into volcanic vents the tritons cannot follow, then resurge.

Worse, the broods have started coordinating—something Bfaspeen historically don't do. Multiple matriarchs working together, sharing intelligence, targeting triton supply lines. Someone or something is organizing them.

**The Desperation**: The war has pushed Vetral to expand enforcement of their sovereignty claims. They've begun sending formal notices to distant surface nations—demands for vessel registration, adherence to approved routes, traditional respects. It's a bid to build alliances, to pressure the Bfaspeen from above while fighting them below. So far, the responses have been... disappointing.

### Economy

**Size**: Unknown

**Tech**: Advanced (underwater)

**Primary Exports**: Forgecrab metal, deep-sea salvage, navigation agreements

**Primary Imports**: Surface metals, certain foods, intelligence

**Forgecrab Dependence**: Vetral's military power rests on forgecrab metal—living alloy harvested from massive crustaceans that migrate up from volcanic vents to die on Vetralian shelves. The shells grow and heal, making forgecrab armor and weapons extraordinarily durable. But the forgecrabs spawn near Bfaspeik, and the war has disrupted the harvest.

**The Salvage Trade**: Tritons know where every ship has sunk in the Alrock for the past thousand years. Occasionally they'll trade salvage rights to surface nations—for a price, and only for wrecks in "approved" waters. It's one of the few ways surface folk interact with Vetral directly.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Religious obligation

The triton military is a temple force—warriors blessed by sea-priests, wielding forgecrab weapons, trained from youth in underwater combat. On their home ground, they're nearly unbeatable. The problem is, war with the Bfaspeen isn't fought on their home ground. It's fought in volcanic trenches, thermal vents, and the lightless deep where the brood mothers lair.

**The Depth Riders**: Elite warriors mounted on trained sea creatures—sharks, rays, and stranger things. They serve as scouts, messengers, and shock troops. Depth Riders are the tritons' answer to Bfaspeen mobility, but there aren't enough of them.

### Geography

**Location**: Central Alrock Ocean (underwater)

**Biomes**: Coral cities, kelp forests, abyssal trenches

**Named Entities**: The Coral Throne (capital complex), the Breeding Shallows, the Old Roads (underwater highways)

**Adjacent Waters**: Alrock Ocean (claimed entirely)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Coral Throne—a vast underwater complex grown from living coral over millennia. The Depths Conclave meets here. Surface ambassadors have never been permitted entry.

**Cities**: Numerous underwater settlements, names unknown to surface cartographers

### Primary Conflicts

**The Bfaspeik War**: The defining struggle of modern Vetral. The tritons are losing slowly, and they know it. The Conclave debates whether to seek surface allies (humiliating), abandon outlying territories (unthinkable), or continue the grinding attrition (unsustainable).

**The Alliance Question**: Keletus has the finest navy in the world. Vetral has approached them repeatedly. King Varrosh has refused repeatedly. The insult stings, but the tritons need allies too badly to escalate. For now.

**Internal Fractures**: Younger tritons question the Conclave's strategy. Some advocate abandoning the sovereignty claims entirely—focus on core territory, let the surface do what it wants. Others want total war against the Bfaspeen, regardless of cost. The Conclave tries to navigate between these factions while presenting unified purpose.

**The Breeding Shallows**: Vetral's greatest secret and greatest vulnerability. Every seventeen years, tritons from across the Alrock return to specific thermal vents to spawn. If surface nations—or the Bfaspeen—learned when and where this happens, they could exterminate the species in a single coordinated attack. The Conclave's refusal to explain *why* certain waters are sacred has cost them diplomatic credibility. But explaining would cost them everything.

### History

The tritons fled Adron in prehistory. Why they left, what they were fleeing, what they abandoned—all lost to time. Even the naga, who have long memories, recall only that the tritons were there, and then were not.

The Alrock became their new home. They built coral cities, established the Old Lanes, claimed sovereignty over all the waters they could reach. For ages, this worked. Surface nations learned to respect the routes. The sea was orderly.

Then the Bfaspeen population exploded—no one knows why, perhaps a shift in volcanic activity providing more thermal habitat. What had been occasional skirmishes became constant warfare. The tritons have been fighting for three generations now, and they're running out of forgecrab metal, running out of Depth Riders, running out of options.

### Player Hooks

- **The Desperate Embassy**: Vetral has sent an envoy to a surface nation. They need allies. They're offering things they've never offered before—salvage rights, safe passage guarantees, perhaps even forgecrab metal. But they won't explain why their situation is so dire. Players could serve as intermediaries, translators, or spies.

- **The Breeding Shallows**: Someone has learned the tritons' secret. Now they're selling it—to Keletus, to Bfaspeik, to the highest bidder. The Conclave wants this person silenced before the knowledge spreads. Players might be hired to find the leak, or to buy the information themselves.

- **Behind Bfaspeen Lines**: The Conclave suspects someone is organizing the brood mothers. They need surface agents—people who can breathe air, survive the volcanic waters with the right magic, and investigate without being identified as triton allies. Suicidal? Yes. Necessary? Also yes.

- **The Old Wreck**: A Vetralian salvage priest has offered coordinates to a ship that sank carrying something valuable—truly valuable, nation-changing valuable. The catch: it's in waters the Bfaspeen now control. The tritons can't retrieve it themselves. They need surface divers willing to risk brood mother territory.

## Vogenfeld

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Council of Thanes (dwarven elders)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Uline Dwarves (Chain Dwarves)

**Population**: ~12,000

**Stability**: Stable internally, increasingly resentful of Tarkhon

**Core Values**: Duty, tradition, defense, memory, the old oaths

- Vogenfeld is governed by the **Council of Thanes**—the eldest and most respected dwarves from each of the three settlements. Major decisions require consensus. Minor decisions fall to local authority.
- The Uline of Vogenfeld are "chain dwarves"—underground dwellers who use elaborate systems of chain-operated air vents to survive in the deep. They're rough, tough, pragmatic, and stubborn beyond measure. They've done things the same way for thousands of years. Change is not welcome.
- Every Uline child learns to fight. The monsters of the deep—shadereavers and worse—are a constant threat in the tunnels. Iron blades and hammers are part of daily life.
- The Vogenfeld dwarves consider themselves Tarkhon's shield. For centuries, they've watched the northern passes, sending patrols into the Wildwood, keeping vigil against the orcish hordes of Hedroscobb. This duty defines them.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Developed (mining, metallurgy, fortification)

**Primary Exports**: Iron, weapons, armor, gems

**Primary Imports**: Food, cloth, luxuries

- Vogenfeld's economy is based on mining and metalwork. The mountains are rich in iron and gems; the dwarves extract both and trade the surplus.
- Most trade goes south to Tarkhon—iron for Nektuna's shipyards, weapons for its armies, gems for its nobles. In return, Vogenfeld receives food (the mountains don't support agriculture) and manufactured goods.
- The trade is necessary but insufficient. Vogenfeld survives; it doesn't prosper. The dwarves remember when Tarkhon paid properly for their service.

### Military

**Size**: Medium (for population)

**Quality**: High

**Enrollment**: Universal (all adults trained)

- Every Uline is a warrior. Children train from young ages to wield the heavy iron blades and hammers that are the dwarven signature. By adulthood, every dwarf can fight.
- The **Vogenfeld Guard** is the professional force—~2,000 warriors who do nothing but patrol, train, and watch. They rotate through the surface patrols that scan the northern forests.
- In emergencies, the entire adult population can mobilize—perhaps 8,000 warriors, armed with dwarf-forged iron and fighting from prepared positions in mountain tunnels.

### Geography

**Location**: The mountains between Tarkhon and Hedroscobb, north of the Wurn Mountains

**Biomes**: Mountain peaks, underground caverns, fortified passes

**Climate**: Alpine on the surface; controlled underground

**Named Features**: The three settlements, the Pass of Oaths, countless unnamed tunnels

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (council rotates between settlements)

**Settlements**: Atlangsow, Kaisa, Glashof

### The Three Settlements

**Atlangsow**
The westernmost and largest settlement, home to perhaps 5,000 dwarves. Built into a mountain that overlooks the main pass between Tarkhon and the Wildwood. This is where the Council of Thanes most often meets.

**Kaisa**
The central settlement, smaller but strategically vital. Kaisa's tunnels extend furthest north—scouts from here can emerge in the Wildwood itself, watching orc movements without being seen.

**Glashof**
The easternmost settlement, controlling the approaches from the Wurn Mountains. Glashof maintains the closest ties to the Stone Men who live in the Wurns—not friendship exactly, but mutual respect between mountain peoples.

### The Vogenfeld Pact

Centuries ago, when Tarkhon was young and the orcish threat was real, the empire made a pact with the Uline of Vogenfeld.

The terms were simple:
- The dwarves would hold the northern passes
- They would patrol the Wildwood's edge
- They would warn Tarkhon of any orcish movement
- They would fight and die if the orcs came south

In exchange:
- Tarkhon would pay tribute—gold, food, supplies
- Tarkhon would honor the dwarves as defenders of civilization
- Tarkhon would remember the sacrifices made

For centuries, the dwarves kept their oath. Generations lived and died on the northern watch. The stone tablets in Atlangsow list every dwarf who fell fighting orcs—thousands of names, carved in iron-hard tradition.

The orcs stopped coming. The great invasions ended. The tribal states of Hedroscobb turned inward, fighting each other instead of pushing south.

And Tarkhon forgot.

### The Broken Promise

The tribute payments have dwindled over generations. What was once substantial is now insulting. What was once paid with respect is now paid with resentment.

Young humans in Tarkhetan ask: "Why are we paying dwarves to sit in mountains and drink?"

The dwarves have a different question: "Why have we held this watch for centuries while Tarkhon grows rich and forgets?"

The current Council of Thanes is divided:
- **Thane Gorveth of Atlangsow** (eldest) counsels patience. The pact is the pact. The dwarves swore to hold the passes, and they will hold them.
- **Thane Brunhild of Kaisa** argues for renegotiation. Tarkhon should be reminded what the dwarves do and why it matters.
- **Thane Keldris of Glashof** (youngest) speaks what others only think: Why should Vogenfeld keep an oath that Tarkhon has already broken?

### The Northern Threat

The orcs of Hedroscobb are not gone. They've merely turned their violence inward.

Six great tribal states dominate the Wildwood:
- **Glivornax** — directly north of Vogenfeld
- **Tarn** — northeast, around the central lakes
- **Grieb** — east, near the swamps
- **Uhionai/Ryunimir** — northwest, in the deep forest
- And others whose names the dwarves track carefully

These states war constantly among themselves. Territory, resources, honor—the reasons shift but the fighting never stops. This is why they haven't pushed south in centuries. They're too busy killing each other.

But the dwarves remember. They remember when the orcs stopped fighting each other and turned south. They remember the battles in the passes, the tunnels filled with dead, the desperate stands that held the line.

If the orcs ever united—if one warlord rose powerful enough to forge them into a single force—they could sweep south with hundreds of thousands of warriors. Tarkhon, grown soft and complacent, would fall in months.

Only Vogenfeld stands in the way. And Vogenfeld is asking why it should bother.

### The Secret Tunnels

The Uline have dug tunnels for thousands of years. The official maps show the main passages—the routes used for trade and travel. The unofficial maps show much more.

Secret tunnels extend deep into the Wildwood. Emergency passages connect the three settlements. Hidden exits emerge in unexpected places throughout the mountains.

Some of these tunnels could serve a darker purpose. If Vogenfeld decided to stop defending Tarkhon—decided instead to help the orcs—the secret passages could guide orcish armies through the mountains, bypassing the defended passes entirely.

No dwarf speaks of this possibility openly. But Thane Keldris has been spending time in the deep tunnels lately. And some of the younger dwarves have been asking questions about the northern exits.

### Primary Conflicts

**The Tribute Question**

The Council of Thanes has sent three delegations to Tarkhetan in the past decade, requesting restoration of proper tribute. Each delegation has been treated politely, promised consideration, and ultimately ignored.

Patience is running out. If Tarkhon doesn't respond meaningfully soon, the Council will have to decide: Do they continue serving an empire that has forgotten them? Or do they withdraw to their caverns and let the north take care of itself?

**The Succession Crisis**

Thane Gorveth is old—even by dwarven standards—and will not live forever. When he dies, the balance of the Council shifts. Brunhild's caution and Keldris's radicalism will no longer be moderated by Gorveth's patience. What happens then depends on whether Tarkhon has remembered its obligations.

**The Orcish Stirring**

Reports from the northern patrols are concerning. The usual tribal warfare has paused in some areas. Unusual gatherings have been observed. Someone or something is moving among the orcish states, meeting with chiefs, speaking of unity.

It might be nothing. The orcs have had would-be unifiers before, and they've always failed.

But the dwarves are watching. Because if they're wrong, and the orcs are finally uniting, the passes of Vogenfeld will be the only thing between Hedroscobb and Tarkhon.

And right now, the dwarves are asking themselves: Why should that be our problem anymore?

### History

**The Deep Past**: Uline dwarves settle in the mountains, building the first tunnels, fighting the monsters of the deep.

**The Pact** (~500 years ago): Tarkhon, facing orcish raids, negotiates with Vogenfeld. The dwarves agree to defend the passes in exchange for tribute and honor.

**The Great Invasions** (~500-200 years ago): Multiple orcish incursions test the passes. Thousands of dwarves die holding the line. Tarkhon survives because of Vogenfeld's sacrifice.

**The Quiet Centuries** (~200 years ago - present): The orcs turn inward. The invasions stop. Tarkhon slowly forgets. The tribute dwindles.

**The Present**: Vogenfeld keeps the watch, but resentment builds. The Council debates whether the Pact still binds them. In the north, something stirs among the orcs.

## Watalina

Tags: state, city

pronounced "wah-tah-LEE-nah"

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant oligarchy (Council of Pearls)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Kendor (primarily Pelaendor wanderers)

**Population**: 3,000 permanent residents, plus transient traders

**Stability**: Very Stable

**Core Values**: Commerce, neutrality, discretion, beauty

- Watalina is governed by the Council of Pearls, seven Kendor merchant-houses who rotate leadership annually
- The settlement maintains strict neutrality in Atriik's internal politics—they trade with all four city-states equally
- Violence is not just illegal but socially unthinkable; disputes are resolved through elaborate arbitration rituals
- Non-Kendor visitors are welcome but expected to conduct themselves with decorum

### Economy

**Size**: Small but influential

**Tech**: Sophisticated (underwater engineering, shipbuilding)

**Primary Exports**: Pearl cultivation, pilotage services, shipbuilding, preserved seafood

**Primary Imports**: Timber (from Sprenwood), freshwater, surface-world luxuries

- Watalina controls all maritime traffic in Shark Bay through their monopoly on pilotage
- Their shipbuilding combines Kendor design principles with Sprenwood hardwoods
- Pearl cultivation is a closely guarded secret; Watalina pearls command premium prices across Westrim
- The settlement serves as the primary interface between Kendor society and the Atriik city-states

### Military

**Size**: None

**Quality**: n/a

**Enrollment**: n/a

- The Kendor consider organized violence vulgar and maintain no military force
- Defense relies on the settlement's underwater location (inaccessible to land forces), maritime leverage (no one attacks the only pilots who know the channels), and diplomatic relationships with all parties
- In emergencies, Kendor can summon aquatic creatures or simply withdraw to deeper waters

### Geography

**Location**: Southern Shark Bay, at the interface between coastal shallows and open water

**Biomes**: Submerged coral structures, floating platforms, tidal zones

**Named Entities**: The Pearl Halls (council chambers), the Pilot's Ledge (training center), the Market Platforms

**Rivers & Lakes**: n/a

**Adjacent Waters**: Shark Bay, Agreben Sea approaches

### Physical Structure

Watalina is not a conventional city. The settlement consists of:

- **Submerged Architecture**: Coral-grown buildings in the shallows, accessible only by swimming or diving. This is where most Kendor live and conduct private business.
- **Floating Platforms**: Moored structures where surface-dwellers can meet with Kendor traders. Markets, hostels, and negotiation chambers for those who cannot breathe water.
- **Tidal Gardens**: Cultivated oyster beds and pearl-producing mollusk colonies in the bay's shallows, maintained by Kendor aquaculture.

### Political Geography

**Capital**: The Pearl Halls (submerged council chambers)

**Districts**:
- The Shallows (residential, submerged)
- The Market Platforms (commercial, floating)
- The Outer Anchorage (visiting ships)

### Primary Conflicts

- The Kendor's strict neutrality occasionally frustrates Atriik's city-states, who would prefer Watalina to favor their interests
- Some younger Kendor chafe at the isolation from the wider Kendor fortress-cities to the south
- Surface traders sometimes resent Kendor price-setting on essential maritime services

### Relations

**Positive**: All Atriik city-states (trading partners), Mueras merchant-kings (distant trade contacts)

**Neutral**: Northern states (limited contact)

**Negative**: None—the Kendor cultivate relationships, not enemies

### History

Watalina was established generations ago when Pelaendor wanderers recognized Shark Bay's strategic value. The settlement grew as Atriik developed, providing maritime services that the land-bound city-states could not supply themselves. The relationship is symbiotic: Atriik needs the sea access; Watalina needs the trade goods.

The Council of Pearls has governed since the settlement's founding, with remarkable consistency in policy despite annual leadership rotations. The Kendor view the surface-dwellers with the patient amusement of beings who measure time in centuries.

## Watar

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Oligarchy (trading families)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Dwarblin

**Population**: 40,000

**Stability**: Stable

**Core Values**: Commerce, innovation, self-reliance, ambition

- Watar is ruled by an oligarchy of powerful trading families. Three families dominate: the Soleri (capital), the Gravo, and the Madero. Each controls significant territory and competes fiercely for market share.
- Dwarblin culture is defined by rejection. Hated by both dwarves and goblins, they built their own nation from nothing. This shared experience of being outcasts has forged a scrappy, entrepreneurial people.
- Very forward-thinking, almost tech-bro energy. They're always looking for the next opportunity, the next innovation, the next market to corner. Some smugness has crept in as they've succeeded, but the scrappy underdog mentality remains.

### Economy

**Size**: Large

**Tech**: Developed

**Primary Exports**: Trade goods (everything—they're middlemen), practical craftsmanship, ships

**Primary Imports**: Raw materials, luxury goods, anything they can flip for profit

- Members of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though they're increasingly aggressive about controlling trade routes.
- Dwarblin are master traders, bridging markets that would never otherwise interact. A Dwarblin merchant can sell sand to desert dwellers.
- Their craftsmanship is practical rather than beautiful. Dwarblin-made tools aren't pretty, but they never break.

### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary (mercenary-supplemented)

- Watar has a real navy—merchant vessels that double as warships, plus dedicated military ships protecting trade routes.
- Ground forces are adequate. They hire mercenaries when needed; why waste Dwarblin on fighting when you can pay someone else?
- The military exists to protect trade. Period.

### Geography

**Location**: Peninsula in the western Middle Sea, northwest of the Telphineas Strait, south of Erasnus, with Echea at the peninsula's tip

**Biomes**: Grassland, temperate forest, coastal regions, mountains to the west

**Climate**: Mediterranean—mild winters, warm summers, good sailing weather

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Solera

**Cities**: Solera, Gravo, Madero

**Towns**: Various port towns and trading posts along the coast

### Primary Conflicts

**The Telphineas Strait**

Watar wants control of the strait. It's the key to dominating Middle Sea trade—whoever controls passage can set tariffs and squeeze competitors. Bestacia also wants it, but they're on the wrong side of the mountains with no navy.

Watar has the ships and the willingness to use them. Tensions are escalating. The Trade Alliance technically prohibits members from blocking each other's shipping, but Watar is looking for loopholes or reasons to renegotiate.

**Family Politics**

The three great families—Soleri, Gravo, and Madero—cooperate when facing external threats but compete ruthlessly otherwise. Corporate espionage, market manipulation, and occasional "accidents" are all part of doing business. The oligarchy is stable because no single family can dominate the others, but the balance could shift.

**Alliance Strain**

The Aldriktch Trade Alliance is fracturing. Watar joined for the trade benefits but increasingly sees the alliance as a constraint on their ambitions. If they could control the strait independently, why share?

### History

The Dwarblin came to this peninsula as refugees—rejected by dwarf and goblin societies alike, with nowhere else to go. They found an empty stretch of coast and started trading.

Within a few generations, they'd built a merchant empire. What they lacked in magical aptitude or social acceptance, they made up for in relentless work ethic and shrewd dealing. The trading families emerged from the most successful early merchants, consolidating power through wealth rather than warfare.

Now Watar is an up-and-coming power. They've got ships, money, and ambition. The older powers of the Middle Sea are starting to notice—some with interest, others with concern.


Also just to clarify, the atlas files should focus more on high level stuff, interactions between regions, and geography, whereas the state files should be more about the actual inner workings of that state. There's lots of overlap, but the juicy specifics belong in the state file

## Windor

Tags: state, nation

Windor is a halfling nation occupying the northern slopes of Terrenia, wedged between the Green Mountains and the cold northern coast. It's a quiet country by most standards—pastoral, prosperous, well-organized—but the quietness is earned. The Windorf have built something comfortable in the shadow of troll-infested peaks, and they maintain it through luck, vigilance, and a practical understanding of acceptable losses.

### People

The Windorf are the dominant population: halflings who've lived here long enough that no one remembers arriving. They're small, clever, and blessed with an unusual relationship to probability. Fortune-magic runs in Windorf blood—not dramatic sorcery, but a subtle attunement to chance. Dice fall their way more often than statistics suggest. Dangers miss by inches. Opportunities appear at convenient moments.

This isn't universal or reliable. Most Windorf experience it as good instincts, lucky breaks, a sense of when to push and when to fold. A minority—those with genuine talent—can cultivate it into something more deliberate. These luck-blessers are valued throughout Terrenia and beyond.

Other peoples live in Windor—human traders, dwarf craftsmen, the occasional wanderer who settled down—but they're a small minority. Windorf culture dominates, and outsiders either adapt or move on.

### Government

Windor is governed by the Council of Chairs, a representative body that meets in Nylen. Each settlement sends delegates based on population and contribution, with seats weighted accordingly. The capital and Roye hold the most influence; villages share seats or rotate representation.

There's no king, no hereditary aristocracy. Local nobility exists—old families with wealth and reputation—but their authority comes from economic and social standing, not legal privilege. They serve on the Council like anyone else, and they can be voted out.

The Council handles defense coordination, trade agreements, taxation, and disputes between settlements. Local matters stay local. The system works because Windor is small enough for it to work, and because the Windorf temperament favors negotiation over confrontation.

**The Bureau of Fortune** operates under Council oversight, regulating luck-blessing services, training practitioners, and preventing the worst abuses. Fortune-magic for hire is legal and common—merchants pay for favorable winds, gamblers for loaded odds, parents for safe childbirths. The Bureau takes a cut and maintains standards. Unlicensed practice isn't illegal exactly, but the Bureau makes life difficult for competitors.

### Economy

Windor is modestly prosperous without being rich. The economy rests on four pillars:

**Agriculture**: The lowlands produce grain, dairy, and fruit—especially apples. Windorf cider is exported throughout Terrenia. Sheep and goats graze the hill country, providing wool and meat.

**Fishing**: The coastal villages work the cold northern waters. Cod, herring, and crab move inland; grain and goods move out. It's not glamorous work, but it's steady.

**Fortune Services**: Luck-blessing brings outside money into Windor. Merchants, nobles, and adventurers travel to Nylen seeking favorable odds. The Bureau of Fortune charges well for its services, and independent practitioners find plenty of clients despite official discouragement.

**Troll Materials**: An uncomfortable but profitable trade. Troll blood, bone, and hide have alchemical and magical applications. The Wardens sell what they harvest. Buyers don't ask too many questions about sourcing.

### Military

Windor doesn't maintain a standing army—there's no one to fight except the trolls, and trolls don't respond to conventional warfare. Instead, the nation relies on the Warden system.

**The Wardens** are professional troll-hunters, maintained by Council funding and stationed at posts along the mountain fringe. Each post covers a section of the border, running patrols, maintaining signal towers, and responding to raids. Wardens aren't soldiers; they're specialists. They know troll behavior, troll vulnerabilities, and troll territory better than anyone.

Warden service is voluntary but well-compensated. Recruits train for two years before field deployment. Casualties are expected—not catastrophic, but steady. The work attracts a certain type: people who want purpose, danger, and the respect that comes from doing something most can't.

**Village Militias** supplement the Wardens. Every mountain-fringe settlement maintains a watch, trains its adults in basic defense, and keeps weapons accessible. They're not expected to fight trolls directly—their job is to sound the alarm, evacuate civilians, and delay until Wardens arrive.

**Signal Towers** dot the mountain rim, each within sight of at least two others. Fire by night, smoke by day, specific patterns for different threats. When a tower lights, the message can reach Nylen within hours.

### Relations

**Aal Salma** (south): The human nation on Windor's southern border. Relations are civil but distant. Trade flows through Gorstraat. Aal Salma views Windorf fortune-magic with a mix of suspicion and envy—useful but untrustworthy, the way humans often view halfling advantages.

**Poum Titch** (across the mountains): The Scalawag territory beyond the Green Mountains is currently in civil war. Cross-mountain trade has collapsed. Refugees occasionally make the dangerous passage, bringing news that rarely improves.

**Broader Terrenia**: Windor is a small player in regional politics. It trades, it maintains neutrality, it avoids entanglements. The Council's priority is always internal—keep the trolls contained, keep the harvests coming, keep the luck flowing.

### Tensions and Hooks

**Something's Stirring**: Troll activity has increased over the past two years. Not dramatically, but noticeably. Raids are more frequent. New warrens are appearing in areas previously clear. The Wardens don't know why, and the Council doesn't want to admit they're concerned.

**The Deep Caves**: The mountains are riddled with unexplored cave systems. The trolls emerge from somewhere. What else lives down there? Occasional reports mention things that aren't trolls—larger, stranger, glimpsed in thermal fog or sulfur-steam. The Wardens don't investigate deep. Maybe they should.

**Bureau Politics**: The Bureau of Fortune holds significant power over a significant industry. Not everyone is happy about that. Independent luck-blessers chafe at regulation. Council members question the Bureau's growing treasury. Rumors of corruption circulate—favoritism, price-fixing, occasionally darker things. The Bureau denies everything.

**Clawsnatch**: The lake hides something. The Wardens know more than they say. Someone will eventually want answers.

**The Old Workings**: Pre-Windorf ruins dot the mountains. Who built them? What happened to them? The mines went deep before they were abandoned. Some shafts connect to places the Windorf have never mapped.

### Visiting Windor

Windor welcomes travelers and traders. The roads are good, the inns are comfortable, and the Windorf are hospitable in a reserved sort of way. They'll sell you cider, rent you a room, answer your questions politely. They won't invite you home for dinner unless they've known you for years.

The coast is cold. The lowlands are pleasant in summer. The mountains are off-limits unless you have business there and the sense to register with the Wardens.

Fortune-blessing services are available in Nylen through the Bureau or through less official channels. Prices vary. Results vary more. The Bureau guarantees satisfaction within defined parameters. Independent practitioners guarantee nothing but offer discounts.

Don't insult a Windorf's luck. It's the closest thing they have to a cultural taboo. Suggesting that their fortune is unearned or manipulated is deeply offensive—even when it's obviously true.

## Wykakas

Tags: city-state

Home to many Sharabha families. Strict, casted society. Nobility have arranged marriages. Large standing army to defend against Naruaghin in the south. Army has lots of talk about "honor" and "bravery" but they've not had to fight in 100 years, so the army has gone soft and is full of bs.

## Xi Chin

Tags: citystate

The Timekeeper city rises from a high plateau in the Tethryn Mountains of SW Urok, its white marble architecture stark against the dark volcanic stone. Xi Chin is home to the greatest astronomers in Alaria—scholars who track not just the movements of sun and moons, but the cycles of stars, the drift of planets, and patterns in the sky that most people never notice. When Xi Chin issues a prediction, wise rulers listen.

### Overview

Xi Chin exists because of a question: *What time is it?*

The question sounds simple. It isn't. Alaria's dual moons create a calendar of staggering complexity—Auris and Nyxara cycling at different rates, their alignments creating holidays that drift through the seasons, their light affecting magic in ways scholars still don't fully understand. Someone had to track it all. Someone had to maintain the authoritative calendar that merchants, priests, and kings could rely on.

That someone became Xi Chin.

The city was founded over two thousand years ago by an alliance of Uline Dwarven clockmakers and human astronomers who recognized that precision timekeeping required both mechanical expertise and observational patience. The dwarves built instruments; the humans watched the sky. Together, they created something neither could have managed alone: an institution dedicated to measuring time itself.

Today, Xi Chin remains cosmopolitan in a way the other dwarven city-states of SW Urok are not. Humans and dwarves share the city equally, with smaller populations of gnomes, elves, and others who've come for the knowledge and stayed for the culture. The marble architecture reflects this blend—dwarven precision in the stonework, human grandeur in the scale.

### The Great Clocktower

At the city's heart stands the Clocktower, visible from anywhere in Xi Chin and from ships in the Gulf of Xoth on clear days. The tower rises three hundred feet, its upper reaches housing the great orrery—a mechanical model of Alaria's sky that tracks the positions of sun, moons, and major celestial bodies with terrifying accuracy.

The Clocktower chimes the hours. Not just for Xi Chin—the sound carries across the mountains, and smaller towers throughout Alaria are synchronized to its rhythm. When the Clocktower strikes midnight at year's end, the new year officially begins. No other authority is recognized.

The tower's lower levels house the Chroniclers' archives: records of every astronomical observation made in Xi Chin's history, predictions issued and verified, calendars maintained for every nation that subscribes to the service. The archives are open to scholars, for a fee. The observation decks are not—those are reserved for the Chroniclers themselves.

### The Chroniclers' Compact

Xi Chin's neutrality is not an accident. It's a treaty.

The Chroniclers' Compact, signed over fifteen centuries ago and renewed every generation since, guarantees Xi Chin's independence. No nation may attack the Timekeepers. No army may march on the city. No trade embargo may starve it. In exchange, Xi Chin shares its calendrical services with all signatories equally, plays no favorites in political disputes, and issues predictions without bias.

The Compact has held because everyone needs it to hold. A war that destroyed Xi Chin's archives would plunge Alaria into calendrical chaos—festivals celebrated on wrong days, contracts with date-dependent clauses thrown into dispute, magical rituals timed to celestial events suddenly unreliable. The cost of destroying Xi Chin would exceed the benefit of conquering it.

This makes the city neutral ground. Diplomats meet here when they can't meet anywhere else. Treaties are signed in the shadow of the Clocktower. Enemies dine together in Xi Chin's restaurants, knowing that violence within the city walls would turn every signatory against the aggressor.

### Prediction as Power

The Chroniclers don't prophesy. They calculate.

Their predictions emerge from mathematical models of extraordinary sophistication—patterns identified in centuries of observations, correlations between celestial events and earthly consequences that most people would dismiss as coincidence. When Xi Chin predicted the Red Tide plague seven years before it arrived, they weren't reading omens. They were tracking a cyclical pattern in stellar positions that had preceded similar plagues twice before in recorded history.

Not every prediction proves accurate. The Chroniclers maintain careful records of their successes and failures, adjusting their models accordingly. But their track record is impressive enough that a formal warning from Xi Chin sends nations into preparation. They've predicted famines, volcanic eruptions, wars, and what they call "convergences"—moments when multiple celestial cycles align in ways that historically correlate with dramatic change.

The next major convergence, according to current models, is less than a decade away. The Chroniclers have not yet announced what they expect to happen. The silence makes people nervous.

### Government

Xi Chin is governed by the **Council of Hours**—twelve Chroniclers, each responsible for one aspect of the city's timekeeping mission. The Council selects its own members through a process involving peer review, demonstrated accuracy, and what they call "temporal intuition"—an ability to see patterns that others miss.

The Council has no hereditary component. Chroniclers come from any race, any background, any nation—what matters is the work. This meritocracy is genuine but brutal; failed predictions end careers, and the pressure to maintain accuracy drives some Chroniclers to obsession or madness.

Below the Council, the city operates through guilds: the Clockmakers who maintain the instruments, the Observers who watch the sky, the Calculators who crunch the numbers, the Archivists who preserve the records. Each guild has its own hierarchy, its own traditions, its own fierce pride in its contribution to the mission.

### The Orrery-City

Xi Chin's layout is not accidental. The city was designed as a functional astronomical instrument.

Streets align with solstice sunrises. Plazas mark the positions where specific stars rise over the eastern peaks. The Clocktower stands at the exact center of a geometric pattern that, viewed from above, maps the orbital paths of Auris and Nyxara. Walking through Xi Chin is walking through a model of the heavens.

This means the city cannot grow organically. Every new building must be approved by the Council to ensure it doesn't block sight-lines or disrupt the pattern. The result is a city of unusual order—beautiful, precise, and slightly unsettling to visitors used to the chaos of normal urban growth.

### Culture

Life in Xi Chin revolves around time. Appointments are kept to the minute. Lateness is a moral failing. The city's music features complex polyrhythms that mirror celestial cycles; its poetry counts syllables with mathematical precision; its cuisine emphasizes dishes that must be prepared at exact moments or they fail.

Outsiders find it exhausting. Residents find everywhere else sloppy.

The city celebrates time-based holidays that most of Alaria has forgotten—ancient observances tied to stellar positions rather than the common lunar calendar. Some of these celebrations are open to visitors; others are private, conducted in observatories at moments when specific stars align.

### Relations with Neighbors

Xi Chin maintains formal neutrality, but geography creates practical relationships.

**Wister Valley** feeds the city, and the valley folk resent their dependent status even as they profit from it. Tensions simmer but never boil—Xi Chin needs the food, and Wister needs the protection the Compact provides.

**Maun and Wisgarrd** are trading partners. Xi Chin's precision instruments often incorporate Wisgarrd gems; Maun's musicians perform at Chronicler ceremonies. The relationship is commercial rather than warm—the dwarven city-states find Xi Chin's mixed population vaguely distasteful, and Xi Chin finds their artistic obsessions frivolous.

**Xoth** is the complication. The Compact requires Xi Chin to serve all signatories equally, and Xoth is a signatory. This means providing calendrical services to a nation whose daemon-aided military makes everyone else nervous. Some Chroniclers argue the Compact should be revised to exclude Xoth; others argue that would destroy the principle of neutrality entirely. The debate has lasted generations without resolution.

### Player Hooks

- **The Silent Prediction**: The Chroniclers have identified something in their models—something they're not announcing publicly. Rumors suggest it involves Xoth, or the Shattered Court beneath Maun and Wisgarrd, or something older. Someone needs to find out what they know and why they're keeping quiet.

- **Temporal Anomaly**: A Chronicler has gone missing, along with records of specific observations. The Council wants the records recovered discreetly—whatever the Chronicler discovered, they don't want it becoming public knowledge.

- **The Convergence**: With a major celestial convergence approaching, various factions are positioning themselves. Some want to prevent whatever's predicted; others want to exploit it. Xi Chin is the only place with enough information to understand what's actually coming.

- **Compact Crisis**: A signatory nation has violated the Compact's terms—attacking a Xi Chin citizen, or pressuring Chroniclers for favorable predictions. The Council must respond, but harsh action might trigger the very conflict the Compact was designed to prevent.

## Xoth

Tags: state

Xoth is not a nation in the traditional sense. It is a covenant—a religious contract between mortals and the daemons of Celestia that became a state. What makes someone Xothic isn't blood or ancestry; it's faith. Dwarves, humans, gnomes, and others live side by side in Xoth, bound not by ethnicity but by shared worship of the Seven Patrons.

The result is one of the most formidable powers on Urok: wealthy, disciplined, and backed by divine forces that other nations can only envy or fear.

### Overview

Centuries ago, the peoples of southeastern Urok lived in scattered communities—dwarven mining camps, human farming villages, gnomish trading posts—competing and warring in the usual fashion. Then came the Covenant.

The details are sacred history now, embellished by generations of priests. What's certain is that a prophet (whose name is spoken only in temple) claimed the daemons of Celestia would protect any who worshipped them properly. Skeptics laughed. Then the faithful started winning battles they shouldn't have won. Crops flourished where they should have failed. Plagues turned aside at village boundaries.

Word spread. More joined. Those who refused were conquered or fled. Over generations, the covenant became a nation.

Today, Xoth spans the southeastern third of Urok—plains, forests, desert, and coast. Its population is diverse: you'll find dwarven smiths working alongside human farmers, gnomish merchants in the same temple as orcish soldiers, children of mixed heritage everywhere. Race matters less than observance. The question isn't "what are you?" but "do you keep the covenant?"

### The Seven Patrons

Xoth practices henotheistic daemon worship—acknowledging many daemons exist but organizing around seven who answered the original covenant. Each patron governs an aspect of life, and each demands constant worship.

**Theros, the Blazing Eye**
Daemon of the sun, truth, and revelation. The first to answer the prophet's call and chief among the Seven. Theros sees all deception and burns away falsehood. His temples face east; his rituals occur at dawn. The Hierophant of Theros is the closest thing Xoth has to a head of state.

**Kethros, the Shaper**
Daemon of craft, creation, and the work of hands. Kethros blesses forges, workshops, and artisans. Items made with proper ritual carry his minor enchantments—Xothic metalwork and stonework commands premium prices across Alaria. His temples smell of smoke and ring with hammers at all hours.

**Makhros, the Iron Voice**
Daemon of war, discipline, and righteous violence. Makhros does not love slaughter for its own sake; he loves *victory*—the precise application of force to achieve divine purpose. His priests lead soldiers in battle, and his blessings make Xothic armies terrifyingly effective.

**Nestros, the Rememberer**
Daemon of ancestors, oaths, and the honored dead. Nestros ensures that the fallen are not forgotten and that promises are kept across generations. His temples house genealogies stretching back centuries; his priests conduct funerals and witness contracts. Breaking an oath sworn before Nestros is spiritual suicide.

**Dikros, the Scale**
Daemon of law, hierarchy, and proper conduct. Dikros defines what is permitted and what is forbidden. His priests serve as judges, and his temples double as courthouses. Xothic law is harsh but consistent—everyone knows the rules and the consequences.

**Petranos, the Foundation**
Daemon of endurance, patience, and the earth itself. Petranos is the slow god, the one who waits. He blesses farmers, miners, and builders. His temples are the sturdiest structures in any Xothic settlement, often doubling as storehouses and shelters.

**Lykanos, the Guide**
Daemon of journeys, trade, and safe passage. Lykanos protects travelers, blesses merchants, and ensures that goods flow. His shrines stand at crossroads and harbor entrances. Xothic caravans carry his symbol, and bandits who rob them tend to meet unfortunate ends.

### The Covenant's Price

Daemons are not gods in the traditional sense. They are spirits sustained by belief—literally fed by worship. The Seven are powerful because Xoth feeds them constantly. Dawn prayers, dusk rituals, weekly observances, seasonal festivals, life-event ceremonies. The entire nation is a belief-engine, generating the faith that keeps the daemons strong.

This creates mutual dependency. If Xoth fell, the Seven would fade—not die, perhaps, but diminish into shadows of their current power. If the Seven faded, Xoth would lose the divine protections that make it formidable. Neither side can afford to let the other weaken.

The Xothic understand this arrangement clearly. They are not naive worshippers hoping for divine favor; they are partners in a contract. They give belief; they receive power. The relationship is transactional, even mercenary—but it works.

### The Hierophancy

Xoth is governed by the **Hierophancy**—a council of seven High Priests, one for each patron. Religious and civic authority are identical; there is no secular government.

**The Hierophant of Theros** serves as spiritual leader and final arbiter in disputes between the other six. In practice, this makes them the head of state, though the title is never used.

**The Hierophant of Makhros** commands the military. All soldiers answer ultimately to this office, and military strategy is as much religious doctrine as tactical planning.

**The Hierophant of Dikros** administers justice. The courts are temples; judges are priests; trials are rituals.

**The Hierophant of Kethros** oversees craft guilds, workshops, and production. Quality standards are religious standards—shoddy work offends the Shaper.

**The Hierophant of Lykanos** manages trade, diplomacy, and foreign relations. Ambassadors are priests; trade agreements are sacred contracts.

**The Hierophant of Petranos** controls agriculture, mining, and infrastructure. The roads, the granaries, the mines—all fall under this office.

**The Hierophant of Nestros** maintains genealogies, cemeteries, and the temples themselves. This hierophant also oversees the Rite of Binding for new converts.

The Hierophancy meets in **Umlas**, the holy capital, in the **Hall of Convergence** at the center of the seven great temples. Decisions typically require consensus among at least five of the seven, though the Hierophant of Theros can break ties.

### Conversion and Citizenship

Anyone can become Xothic.

The **Rite of Binding** is open to any adult who seeks it. The process takes seven days—one for each patron. The convert fasts, receives instruction in doctrine and ritual, and undergoes purification ceremonies. On the seventh night, they hold vigil in a temple until dawn, when a priest brands or tattoos the **Seven Marks** on their forearms: one symbol for each patron.

Once bound, you're Xothic. Full rights, full obligations. Your previous identity doesn't vanish—Xothic dwarves still have dwarven customs, Xothic humans still celebrate human holidays—but your primary identity is now the covenant. You will worship. You will serve. You will belong.

Children of Xothic citizens undergo a simpler version of the Rite at adolescence, confirming the covenant their parents made on their behalf at birth.

**Apostasy** is the worst crime in Xoth. Those who abandon the faith aren't merely exiled—they are **unmade**. Their names are stricken from genealogies, their families forbidden to speak of them, their existence erased from official records. Property reverts to the temples. Former friends and family must treat them as strangers—or risk being investigated for sympathies.

The punishment isn't death. It's worse: nonexistence. To the Xothic, an apostate literally stops being a person.

### The Daemon-Aided Military

Xoth's military advantage is real and terrifying. The army is large, well-equipped, and professionally trained—but so are other nations' armies. What makes Xoth different is divine support.

**The Theophoroi** ("god-bearers") are priest-soldiers who channel daemon power in battle. Every Xothic military unit includes at least one Theophoros, often more. Their role is to maintain constant communion with the patrons while their comrades fight.

The blessings are tangible:
- **Makhros** grants enhanced strength, reflexes, and coordination to faithful soldiers nearby
- **Theros** provides clarity—resistance to illusions, fear, and confusion
- **Petranos** offers endurance, reducing fatigue and helping soldiers hold positions longer
- **Lykanos** aids movement, helping units navigate terrain and maintain supply lines

In extremis, a Theophoros can invoke **manifestation**—channeling so much divine power that the daemon briefly takes physical form through them. This is devastating but dangerous; many Theophoroi die from the strain.

**The cost**: These blessings only work for the faithful. Mercenaries, allies, and conscripts from outside the covenant receive nothing. And if the Theophoroi are killed or their rituals disrupted, the blessings end immediately. Savvy enemies target the priests—but the Theophoroi are trained soldiers themselves, and Xothic units protect them ferociously.

**Mandatory service**: Every Xothic citizen serves two years in the military between ages 18 and 25. This isn't just defense—it's religious formation. Soldiers learn to fight *and* to pray. They witness the blessings firsthand. Veterans return to civilian life as true believers, having seen the covenant's power with their own eyes.

### Economy

Xoth is wealthy, and the wealth comes from multiple sources:

**Agriculture**: The central plains are fertile and well-managed. Petranos's blessings help, but so does simple competence—Xothic farmers are organized, their irrigation maintained, their harvests stored properly.

**Timber**: Kumi Wood produces exceptional lumber. Every tree felled requires ritual permission, which sounds like an obstacle but actually ensures sustainable harvesting. Xothic hardwood is prized across Alaria.

**Craft goods**: Items made in Kethros's name carry minor enchantments—tools that don't dull as quickly, armor that fits more comfortably, jewelry that catches light strangely. The premium isn't huge, but it's consistent.

**Religious services**: Xothic priests can petition the Seven on behalf of outsiders. Healing, divination, blessings for journeys or business ventures—all available for a price. Desperate people across Alaria pay for Xothic intercession, and the coin flows back to the temples.

**Trade position**: Xoth controls the Gulf of Xoth and significant portions of Urok's eastern coast. Lykanos blesses commerce, and Xothic merchants have a reputation for honoring contracts—Nestros ensures it.

### Culture and Daily Life

Life in Xoth is structured around observance. Dawn prayers. Dusk prayers. Weekly temple attendance. Seasonal festivals. Blessing meals before eating. Invoking the appropriate patron before beginning work. The rituals aren't optional; they're the fabric of society.

This sounds oppressive to outsiders, and it can be. But most Xothic don't experience it as burden—it's simply how life works. The rituals are familiar, even comforting. They provide structure. They connect you to your neighbors (who are performing the same rituals) and to the divine (who notice when you skip).

**Race relations** in Xoth are complicated. In theory, all faithful are equal. In practice, old prejudices linger—a dwarven family might look down on their human neighbors, or vice versa. But these prejudices must remain private. Public discrimination based on race is both illegal (Dikros forbids it) and impious (the covenant transcends blood). Intermarriage is common and unremarkable; mixed-heritage children are ordinary.

**Social status** derives from piety and service. The most respected Xothic aren't the wealthiest—they're the most devout. Veterans are honored. Priests are revered. Those who've made major temple donations or performed exceptional service gain status that wealth alone cannot buy.

**Art and architecture** in Xoth tends toward the monumental. Temples dominate every settlement. Public buildings are built to last centuries. Art depicts the Seven, scenes from sacred history, and abstract representations of divine concepts. Private art exists but rarely challenges religious themes—the patrons are watching.

### Relations with Neighbors

**Xi Chin** maintains correct diplomatic relations. The Chroniclers' Compact requires Xi Chin to serve all nations equally, and Xoth is a signatory. This means Xoth receives calendrical services despite making Xi Chin's other clients nervous. Some Xi Chin scholars privately question whether serving a daemon-worshipping theocracy violates the Compact's spirit; the official position is that neutrality means neutrality.

**Maun and Wisgarrd** are wary. The dwarven city-states don't share Xoth's faith and have no interest in joining. The three maintain trade relations—Xothic grain and timber for Maun's instruments and Wisgarrd's jewelry—but there's always tension. Xothic missionaries occasionally appear in both cities; they're tolerated but watched. The Shattered Court beneath the mountains concerns Xoth's Hierophancy less than it concerns the city-states; whatever's down there doesn't threaten the covenant.

**The Order of the Falling Leaf** is a wound that hasn't healed. When Xoth demanded the Order's submission centuries ago, they weren't asking for political allegiance—they were demanding the monks worship the Seven. The Order refused. They saw what happens when daemons are fed too much belief: they grow demanding, jealous, potentially dangerous. The Order's philosophy was self-mastery; the covenant requires perpetual submission.

The monks chose death-in-armor over spiritual slavery. Xoth still wants the Order's texts destroyed—they contain arguments against daemon-worship and techniques for resisting daemonic influence. Those ideas are dangerous to a society built on daemon-dependence.

### Geography

Xoth occupies southeastern Urok, bounded by the Pearly Mountains to the northwest, the Siddaneas River to the west, the Gulf of Xoth to the south, and the Bay of Lords to the northeast.

**Capital**: Umlas
**Sacred Cities**: Ku'or, Speusippos, Hippotas, Qo'koven, Sicule'os, Gryllus, Iphikrates
**Major Regions**: Kumi Wood (north), Dunes of Tithonius (northeast), Pyrgion Forest (west), Central Plains, Stepsidae Peninsula (southeast)
**Rivers**: Meilaenias, Tipholes, upper Siddaneas
**Adjacent Waters**: Gulf of Xoth, Bay of Lords

See the atlas entry for detailed geographic information.

### History

**The Scattering** (ancient): Before the covenant, southeastern Urok was a patchwork of competing communities—dwarven mining camps, human farming villages, gnomish traders, and others. No unity. Constant small wars.

**The First Covenant** (centuries ago): A prophet whose name is now sacred claimed the daemons of Celestia offered protection to those who would worship them properly. The first followers were few, desperate, and mocked. Then they started winning. Battles turned. Harvests flourished. The faithful grew.

**The Unification** (generations): As the covenant spread, it absorbed communities through conversion and conquest. Those who wouldn't join were defeated; their children often converted anyway. What began as a religious movement became a territorial power.

**The Order's Rejection**: When Xoth encountered the Order of the Falling Leaf—Uline Dwarven warrior-monks who had rejected their own people's growing interest in daemon-pacts—they demanded submission. The Order refused. Rather than fight a losing war or accept spiritual slavery, the masters bound their souls to their armor and sent their students away. Xoth has never forgotten this defiance.

**The Modern Era**: Xoth is secure, wealthy, and patient. The Hierophancy doesn't need to conquer—the faith spreads on its own. Converts trickle in from neighboring regions, drawn by Xoth's prosperity and protection. The covenant grows. The Seven grow stronger. The cycle continues.

### Player Hooks

- **The Binding**: A player character considers conversion—or is pressured into it. The Rite of Binding is genuine; the Seven are real; the blessings work. But the covenant is forever. Is divine power worth eternal obligation?

- **The Apostate**: Someone has fled Xoth after abandoning the faith. The Hierophancy wants them returned—not for punishment, but for *unmakng*. The apostate knows something dangerous, and the temples want them silenced before they can spread it.

- **The Missionary**: Xothic priests have arrived in [neighboring location], offering healing and blessings. They're gaining converts. Local authorities are concerned but unsure how to respond—the missionaries aren't breaking any laws. Yet.

- **The Seventh Text**: Rumors persist of an eighth daemon who was part of the original covenant but was somehow excised. Finding proof would shake Xothic theology to its foundations—or reveal something the Hierophancy desperately wants hidden.

- **Beneath Tithonius**: The Dunes of Tithonius hide ruins older than the covenant. Something's been uncovered—something that predates the Seven. The Hierophancy is mobilizing scholars and soldiers, and they're not explaining why.

- **The Order's Legacy**: Evidence suggests that students of the Falling Leaf escaped to Maun, carrying their masters' philosophy. Some of that philosophy—techniques for resisting daemon influence—may have survived in the School of Music's martial traditions. Xoth would pay well to recover or destroy it. Maun would pay well to protect it.

## Zelidia

Tags: state

The jungle has teeth, and they are crimson-winged.

Zelidia is a theocratic matriarchy of Zelle pixies, nestled within the Kameesi Jungle on Urok's northwestern peninsula. To outsiders, it is a death sentence. The Zelle view all non-pixies as either threats to be eliminated or offerings to be sacrificed—and they have perfected both arts over centuries of isolation.

The kingdom's power flows from its High Priestesses, who commune with the jungle itself through blood-magic and ritual sacrifice. Every Zelle is raised from emergence as both predator and protector, trained in the arts of ambush, poison, and the sacred rites that keep their realm hidden from those who would conquer it. They have survived countless invasion attempts through ruthless cunning and the divine wards that shroud their territory.

Zelidia does not trade. It does not negotiate. It does not explain itself. It simply endures, feeding its hungry gods and waiting for the next fool to wander into its domain.

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Theocratic Matriarchy

The High Priestesses rule absolutely, their authority derived from direct communion with the jungle-spirits. There is no formal council, no system of laws—only the priestesses' interpretation of divine will. What the jungle wants, Zelidia does.

The current hierarchy includes seven High Priestesses, each responsible for a different aspect of Zelidian life: war, sacrifice, agriculture, prophecy, warding, judgment, and memory. They convene in the Temple of the Hungry Canopy to settle disputes, interpret omens, and determine which outsiders live and which die.

Succession is by demonstration. When a High Priestess dies (or is killed), any Zelle may attempt to commune with the jungle in her place. Those who succeed inherit the title. Those who fail rarely survive the attempt.

**Primary Inhabitants**: Zelle pixies

**Population**: Perhaps eight thousand Zelle across all settlements. Exact numbers are impossible to determine—the Zelle do not conduct censuses, and outsiders cannot count what they cannot see.

**Stability**: Stable

The theocracy has maintained its essential form for centuries. Internal power struggles exist—the High Priestesses compete for influence, and the temple factions have their own agendas—but the system itself is unquestioned. The jungle demands blood, and the Zelle provide it.

**Core Values**:

- The jungle is god; it must be fed
- Outsiders are either threats or offerings
- Survival justifies any cruelty
- The blood-debt must be paid

### Religion

The Zelle do not worship personified gods. They worship the jungle itself—an entity they experience as raw, impersonal hunger. Predation, rot, venom, growth: these are not metaphors but literal divine forces that the High Priestesses channel through blood-magic.

Every sacrifice feeds the jungle. Every death strengthens the wards. The Zelle believe they exist in a covenant: they provide blood, and the jungle provides protection. This covenant has held for centuries. The one time they tried to transcend it—the Great Working at Iirmos—the results were catastrophic.

The jungle-spirits themselves rarely manifest directly. Instead, they speak through omens: the pattern of falling leaves, the behavior of venomous creatures, the dreams that visit High Priestesses during ritual communion. Interpreting these signs is the priestesses' sacred duty.

### Economy

**Size**: Small

**Tech**: Somewhat Developed

Zelidia's economy is largely internal. The Zelle cultivate the jungle's bounty—sacred fungi, prophetic fruits, ritual materials—and craft what they need from local resources. They have no currency; goods flow according to need and religious duty.

**Primary Exports**: Technically none. However, through the shadow-market at Nox, certain goods reach the outside world: jungle venoms, alchemical ingredients, preserved specimens, and occasionally... services. The Zelle are exceptional assassins, and there are whispers that certain deaths in distant lands were arranged through intermediaries.

**Primary Imports**: Metal (the jungle provides little), glass, certain textiles, and captives. The last is the most important. Zelidian blood-magic requires blood, and the Zelle prefer not to spill their own.

### Military

**Size**: Small (by external standards); the entire population (by internal ones)

**Quality**: Extremely High

**Enrollment**: Universal

Every Zelle is trained from emergence to be a warrior. There is no distinction between civilian and soldier—only between those currently fighting and those preparing to fight. The jungle teaches: every Zelle knows which frogs are poison, which vines conceal ambush points, which calls summon allies and which warn of danger.

Formal military units do not exist. Instead, the Zelle fight as the jungle fights: through ambush, poison, psychological warfare, and overwhelming local force. Invading armies find themselves picked apart by enemies they never see, their supplies spoiled, their water poisoned, their sleep denied. The few who reach Zelidian settlements find them empty—the population simply vanishes into the canopy until the threat passes.

The wards are the greatest defense. Blood-magic has woven protection throughout Zelidian territory: concealment that makes paths loop back on themselves, confusion that scrambles compasses and memories, and worse things that trigger when invaders persist.

### Geography

**Location**: Northwestern Urok, within the Kameesi Jungle

**Biomes**: Tropical rainforest

**Named Entities**: Kameesi Jungle, Iirmos (ruined former capital)

**Rivers & Lakes**: Sovia River (central waterway connecting all settlements)

**Adjacent Waters**: Shamerei Bay (west, technically outside Zelidian control but within their reach)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Glezamos

**Cities**: None (Glezamos is more a large town than a true city by external standards)

**Towns**: None

**Villages**: Nox (shadow-market), Katat (agricultural), Sookap (fishing), Yift (artisan)

### Relations

**Pyonokraus**: The cursed city-state in the Phalkrene Mountains is the closest thing Zelidia has to a neighbor. The relationship is one of mutual wariness and complete non-interference. The Zelle have no interest in entering a city from which none can leave, and whatever dwells in Pyonokraus has no interest in the jungle. Occasionally, Zelle hunters spot Ayblek at the forest's edge, watching with too many arms and inscrutable purpose. They do not approach each other.

**Outsiders**: All outsiders are presumed hostile until proven otherwise—and proving otherwise is nearly impossible. The few exceptions are traders who have spent decades building trust through the Nox shadow-market, and even they are never permitted beyond the eastern fringe. Any outsider found in Zelidian territory without authorization is captured for sacrifice.

### Primary Conflicts

- **The Sealed City**: Iirmos remains a wound in Zelidian consciousness. The wards contain what emerged from the botched ritual, but they require constant maintenance, and some priestesses argue they are weakening. Others whisper that what dwells in Iirmos could be bargained with, used as a weapon against Zelidia's enemies. The faction that controls Iirmos—or survives its opening—would control Zelidia.

- **The Blood Debt**: The jungle's hunger grows. Each generation, the sacrifices must increase to maintain the wards at their current strength. Some High Priestesses advocate expansion—claiming new territory to find new sources of blood. Others argue for deeper communion with the jungle-spirits, seeking more efficient sacrifices. The tension is theological, but the stakes are existential.

- **The Outside World**: Zelidia's isolation cannot last forever. Ships pass closer each decade. Explorers probe deeper. Somewhere, someone is mapping the peninsula, counting the Zelle's defenses, looking for weaknesses. The High Priestesses know invasion will come eventually. They disagree on how to prepare.

### History

The Zelle have inhabited the Kameesi Jungle since before human memory. They claim to have always been here—that they emerged from the jungle itself, born from moonlight and flower-nectar when the world was young. Other races dispute this; the Zelle do not care.

**The Founding of Iirmos**: The first capital was established in the jungle's heart, where the Sovia River's sources converge. For generations, Iirmos served as the center of Zelle civilization—such as it was. The Temple of the First Hunger stood at its center, and the High Priestesses conducted their rites in what they believed was perfect safety.

**The Great Working**: Centuries ago, faced with yet another invasion attempt, the High Priestesses decided to end the threat permanently. They would work a ritual so powerful that no outsider could ever enter Zelidia again—a ward powered by more blood than had ever been offered. They gathered captives by the thousands. They sacrificed entire villages in a single night.

Something answered. It was not the jungle.

What came through the tear in reality consumed Iirmos in hours. The survivors—barely a third of the population—fled eastward, eventually founding Glezamos. The High Priestesses sealed Iirmos behind wards of a different kind, and forbade any Zelle from ever returning.

**The Present Era**: Glezamos has been the capital for centuries now. The trauma of Iirmos has hardened Zelidian isolationism into religious doctrine. The jungle's hunger has grown; the sacrifices have increased; the wards have strengthened. Zelidia is more dangerous now than at any point in its history—and more paranoid, more xenophobic, more certain that every outsider represents an existential threat.

The High Priestesses watch the outside world through omens and the reports of the few traders permitted at Nox. They see the great powers rising and falling beyond the jungle. They prepare for the day when someone comes for them again.

When that day arrives, the jungle will be hungry.

**Size**: Very Small

**Tech**: Very Undeveloped

**Primary Exports**: None

**Primary Imports**: None

- Very little trade with the outside world. The Gozi are deeply isolated and prefer it that way.
- The raptors are sacred—not for sale. To hunt them is strictly forbidden and would bring the wrath of all tribes.
- Internal trade happens at **Rompur Liko**, the winter bazaar.

### Military

**Size**: Very Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Enrollment**: Voluntary

- No formal military, but the raptors make for devastating aerial cavalry when the gorges need defending.
- The terrain itself is the best defense—outsiders who enter the canyons without guides rarely survive.

### Geography

**Location**: South of Stipen, north of Kazül, in a region of deep gorges and stone spires

**Biomes**: Canyon country—red rock gorges, stone spires, mesas, sparse desert scrubland

**Climate**: Arid high desert—hot days, cold nights, little rainfall

**Named Features**: Sighing Canyons (central), Clay Hills (east), The Lizard's Back (northern border), Tootby Hills (northwest), Dzobi Lands (southwest)

### Political Geography

**Capital**: None (tribal—no central authority)

**Cities**: None

**Villages**: Nod, Tilik, Pil, Kilam, Shraz, Fimli, Hechaw, Shyat, and others scattered through the canyons

### Rompur Liko

A temporary winter bazaar where all the tribes of Zintacas gather to trade with one another. The entire fair takes place on a small island cliff connected to its surroundings via long rope bridges. For one week each winter, the isolated tribes become a single community—then scatter back to their gorges until next year.

### Primary Conflicts

**Isolationism**

Zintacas has massive prejudice against outside cultures and technology. They don't understand the outside world, don't want to understand it, and violently reject attempts to change their ways. Outsiders who enter uninvited are driven out—or worse.

**The Raptors**

Occasionally, outsiders try to capture or kill the great raptors. This unites all tribes in furious retaliation. Several would-be poachers have been dropped from great heights.

### History

The Gozi have lived in these canyons for as long as anyone remembers. They bonded with the raptors, learned to fly the gorges, and built their society around the birds and the stone. The outside world passed them by, and they were content.

They remain content. The canyons provide everything they need. The raptors are their partners, not their property. The tribes are family. Why would anyone want anything else?
