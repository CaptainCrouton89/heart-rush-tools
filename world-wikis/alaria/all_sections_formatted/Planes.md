## Astral Plane

Tags: cosmology

### Geography

The Astral Plane consists of a massive sea with floating islands, consisting of a special stone-like material that floats in Astral solution. Like icebergs, larger islands are cliff-edged, and tower into the sky, while smaller islands ride much lower. Huge disasters occur when an island rolls over due to the massiver earthquakes they deal with (due to structural instability). These quakes can cause astral stone to break free, showering down on the earth. 

The Astral Sea is filled with beautiful shining lights, which are the stars on the material plane. These lights were created by the titans. The Astral Sea is nearly opaque, which is why the giant islands high in the sky are not visible. The Astral Plane is lit up from above by Aurus, the White Sun, which illuminates all souls on the Astral Plane, but cannot penetrate down to the material plane through the Astral Sea.

No maps chart these lands, as the islands, as their locations are constantly changing.

Massive cities are built in these islands. 

#### The Astral Sea

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo mountain shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea. 

### The Soul

The soul is slightly influenced by astral currents in the astral sea, and good ship captains can sense them to navigate astral currents well.

The Astral Plane is illuminated by the Aurus, the White Sun (counterpart to Nydus, the Black Sun). Souls are illuminated in its light.

All souls of the living go to the Astral Plane upon death. The Astral Plane is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. *** is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the Astral Plane vie for his position.

### Fauna

##### Astral Sentinels
In the Astral Plane, massive ethereal creatures known as Astral Sentinels roam the islands. These creatures, remnants of forgotten celestial battles, are attracted to disturbances in psychic energy. They serve as both protectors and dangers to astral travelers.

##### Symbiots
Some inhabitants of the Astral Plane have developed a symbiotic relationship with astral creatures. These beings, known as Astral Weavers, use the threads of psychic energy to weave protective barriers or manipulate the weakened free will of other astral entities.

## Bank of Infindior

Tags: poi

Bank where time doesn't pass, but anything is immediately accessible. Can freeze possessions and make them completely inaccessible to others. All sorts of opportunities for bullshit. Very niche, and extremely important bank in the world.

## Belagria

Tags: region

Belagria is lit by the Sun, a giant orb of Astral stone, made up of sunstone (heavily light attuned). It floats across the astral sea each night, then rolls over, becoming the moon, and lighting up the Astral Plane from below as it makes its jounrey across the sky in the opposite direction. It's enchanted, to continue indefinitely.

## Celesté

Tags: planes

The core of Celesté was created long before the entire plane was made. A pocket dimension was solidified as a safe haven from Nydus and Aurus, the titan gods. It is a plane that the titan Celesté created by sacrificing herself (titans normally can't die). This created a new dimension of her own. She swore that as long as the titans remembered her sacrifice, they would survive. And thus they did, because she granted them power from her plane. None of the titans could ever enter the plane unless they died, which no one else was willing to do. However she still protected them.

After the Ezz Rift, Ezz accumulated around Celesté, as it was the only location that resonated with Melera's song.

Celesté is the home of daemons. It is a reflection of the world but lacking any of the typical life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know Deoric, are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called daemons. 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the daemons who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a spirit—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your spirit. Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your true name and pray to you. Upon death, your spirit sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your shadow and soul behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your spirit, making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

Deoric does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane. 

Celesté is made of the the thoughts and beliefs of those who are alive. The world is shaped by the livings' understanding of it. You can faintly alter your own existence depending on your followers, though you are largely stuck at the whims of the living followers of the Material Plane.

## Celestial Forges

Tags: poi

Abandoned forges within the underbelly of the astral islands. This is where the Vyko crafted the stars and released them into the Astral Sea.

## Elemental Planes

Tags: planes

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material planes (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial planes (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material planes. The layers closer to the material planes are more accessible to those on the material planes, whereas the elemental layers closer to Celesté and the other immaterial planes are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

Leylines are cracks in the planes where individual elemental planes spill through much closer to the material plane. Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental magic performed on leylines is always more fantastic.

Those layers are:

- Yolus (Fire)
- Sulus (Air)
- Golus (Earth)
- Pelus (Water)
- Vulus (Darkness)
- Kunus (Light)
- Nilus (Void)
- Izzus (Time)

Along certain lines across the land, these elemental planes bend much closer to the Material Plane. Those lines on which they bend closer are known as Leylines, and are locations where elemental magic relying on the corresponding element will be much more potent.

## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Tags: plane

The Ethereal and Nethereal planes are two thin planes that overlay all other planes within Alaria. They are counterparts to one another.

### Ethereal Plane

Within the Ethereal Plane, echoes of events from the Material Plane linger as ethereal imprints. Skilled individuals can access these echoes to witness glimpses of the past or gain insights into the future, creating a unique form of divination.

### Nethereal Plane

The Nethereal Plane is the counterpart to the Ethereal Plane. Just like the Ethereal Plane, it contains echoes of events from the Material Plane, but often of a darker or more obscure nature. Skilled individuals can access these echoes to witness glimpses of the past or gain insights into the future.

## Ezz

Tags: material

The universal substrate. Contains equal parts of Azus and Melera—thought and emotion at balance.

## Hell's Palace

Tags: poi

Hotel. Each door in an endless hallway leads to a different subdivision of hell, each controlled by a local devil lord.

## Malstaris

Tags: plane

Malstaric Rivers go through the land, which can sweep your shadow away.

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate Malstaris. There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in Malstaris, and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

Malstaris is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in Malstaris can cause strange interactions, as your soul is so far away, and your shadow so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made Malstaris their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids. 

High above Malstaris is Nydus, the Black Sun, spilling heavy darkness across the land.

### Breakneck Canyons

A region of treacherous cliffs within Malstaris.

#### Black Citadel

A tower built atop cliffs in the Breakneck Canyons. Home to a vampire lord. The dead line up outside the citadel for miles, waiting for their turn.

### Parliament of Shadows

The governing body of the largest region of Malstaris. Composed of the lords of all of the comprising regions.

## Material Plane

Tags: planes

The Material Plane is enormous, and consists of several different layers. On the top half is Belagria, consisting of the Surfacelands and the Underrealms. The surface lands are where most of "life" occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. The Underrealms, on the other hand, are a 200 mile thick crust of stone crisscrossed with tunnels and caves, and filled with mysteries and monsters.

As you travel deeper into the Underrealms, the downward pressure keeping your boots pressed to the ground grows weaker and weaker until you eventually reach Emphathum—a 100 mile stretch of weightlessness, filled with floating stones and absolute darkness.

If you down even further, your weight returns, but in the opposite direction from before. Now, you would be heading up, and would be in the second, lower half of the Material Plane—Phlethageros. Phlethageros is dominated by a Zylogmus Eternus, a massive maze, which eventually ends at the lower surface known as the Wastes—the Phlethagoran counterpart to the Surfacelands.


#### Emphathum

A region with zero gravity, massive floating rocks similar to asteroids, and almost no life. Few have ever crossed this. It is the space between the Underrealms and Zylogmus Eternus.

#### Phlethageros

The world on the underside of Belagria. Cruel, corrupted, and horrible, it is a brutal world.

##### Zylogmus Eternus

Millions of miles of labrythine passages stretching across the entire plane, for the entire 200 miles beneath the Wastes and Emphathum.

##### The Wastes

The barren, lava covered, poison-gas filled, tornado ridden surface of Phethageros. Nothing gets past this—a barrier between the demons above, and the prisoners of Zylogmus Eternus below. 

##### Stalactites of Geth

Massive, low hanging stalactites constantly pour forth lava from above the Wastes. Hundreds of thousands of demons live in these stalactites.

#### The Edges of the World

**North/South/East/West**: if you walk far enough in any of the cardinal direction, eventually you will wrap around the side of the world and into Celesté.

**Up**: Although it is difficult, by traveling directly up far enough, you eventually reach the Astral Sea, and then the Astral Plane itself. 

**Down**: Reaching Malstaris by foot is by all practical means—impossible. Instead, those who wish to journey there travel via Deoric magic.

## Phlethageros

Tags: planes, location

Home to the Zylogmus Eternus and the Stalactites of Geth. Really, really sucky place.

## Planar Stacks

Tags: cosmology

A planar stack is a collection of tightly grouped planes, usually holding strong connections to each other. 

A planar stack consists of a series of planes, clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, magic, and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a planar stack, to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.

### Major Planar Stacks

#### Alaria
The primary focus of this almanac.

#### Epyphiozath
Little is known about Epyphiozath, other than it is a major planar stack existing elsewhere in the cosmos.

#### Instruxofinum
Instruxofinum consists of billions of planes jammed tightly together, nearly perfectly frozen in time. Almost anything can be found there with enough searching.

### Other Known Stacks

#### Glyssen
Glyssen is a spherical ocean of whispers and insanity. Aberrant creatures roam across both the currents and time itself. No one has returned with their sanity intact.

#### Klokas
Klokas is a vast void of empty space filled with huge demonic creatures floating through the skies. 

#### Narglon
Completely dark, nothing can be seen in Narglon. Those who have returned have come back infected with the darkness itself. Like a horrible, infective liquid of nothingness.

## Psywinds

Tags: poi

The flow of all thoughts, ideas, and emotions across Alaria. These thoughts pass through all. It is how telepathic creatures communicate. It allows syncopaths to function. It is also how prayers can be heard from Celesté. You can hear your true name no matter where it is spoken from on Alaria.

The psy winds are made of flowing ezz.

Somewhat related to Faesong.

## The Alarian Planar Stack

Tags: cosmology, planar stack

!Horizontal View

### About Alaria

The Alarian Planar Stack, also commonly known as Alaria, is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several planes, stacked on top of each other. 

### Geography of the Planes

### Material Plane

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies Celesté: the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

#### Celesté

Celesté was created when the Alarian Planar Stack fragmented and Ezz poured in from beyond. The material plane peeled apart and a new plane of conceptual existence was born. Emotion, free will, and thought poured into Alaria. Celesté is made of the coalescense of thought/emotion/etc on the material plane. Where there is thought, there is a counterpart to the material planes.

### Astral Plane

"Above" the Material Plane is the Astral Plane. Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Aurus, living pawns of his will.

#### Astraeva

On the flip side of the Astral Plane is Astraeva. Astraeva mirrors the Astral Plane but is devoid of souls. Aurus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

### Malstaris

"Below" the Material Plane is Malstaris—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Nydus, living pawns of his will.

#### Eindumor

On its flip side of Malstaris is Eindumor. Eindumor mirrors Malstaris but is devoid of shadows. Nydus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

### Elemental Planes

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the elemental planes, each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

### Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the Ethereal and Nethereal Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

### Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry. 

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in Celesté. 

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of Malstaris would take you to Eindumor. 

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or Malstaris requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other planes is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the elemental planes, and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal Planes, none can sustain spirit, soul, or shadow.

### Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the planar stack. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform magic on Alaria.
