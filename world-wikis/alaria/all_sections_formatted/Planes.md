## Astraeva

Tags: plane, cosmology, soul, Aurus

Astraeva is the flip side of the Astral Plane—but unlike other planar flip-sides, it is not truly a "place" in the conventional sense. Astraeva is **Aurus himself**, unfiltered and unmediated.

### Nature

The Astral Plane is Aurus's light filtered through structure: the floating islands, the Astral Sea, the accumulated souls that buffer his brilliant radiance. Astraeva is what remains when those buffers are stripped away—the raw, direct presence of the White Sun.

To enter Astraeva is to stand within the source of all souls. There are no islands here, no sea, no landmarks. Only light—warm, vast, and terrifyingly welcoming.

### The Cosmic Reservoir

Astraeva serves a fundamental role in the cycle of life and death:

**Origin of Souls**: When a new creature is conceived anywhere in Alaria, a soul is drawn from Astraeva. This raw Aurus-essence passes through the Astral Plane, threads down through the Ethereal Plane, and binds with the newly formed spirit. Every living creature's soul was once part of this undifferentiated light.

**Return of Souls**: When creatures die, their souls rise to the Astral Plane, where they persist for a time—sometimes centuries, sometimes millennia, depending on how they are remembered. But souls do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn souls—those that have cycled through many lives, or those that are utterly forgotten—drift back through to Astraeva. They dissolve into Aurus's light, losing their individual definition, becoming raw essence once more. In time, they may be drawn forth again as new souls, with no memory of what they were before.

### The Danger

Traveling to Astraeva is not merely dangerous—it is existentially threatening. Your soul is not a separate thing here; it is *part* of Aurus, and the boundary between self and source grows terrifyingly thin.

Visitors report:
- Their sense of self beginning to blur
- Memories feeling shared with countless other beings
- Identity becoming negotiable, optional, easily shed
- A profound sense of peace that makes returning seem pointless

Stay too long, and your soul may simply rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. Your body might continue breathing somewhere else, soulless and empty. But the *you* that made you distinct would become part of everything, and therefore nothing in particular. You would be *completed*—and completion, in this context, means the end of individual existence.

### What Exists There

Astraeva is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain definition under Aurus's unfiltered light. What few beings exist are:

- **Echoes of Aurus's will**: Not separate creatures, but expressions of the titan-god's vast, slow thoughts given momentary shape
- **Pre-birth souls**: The formless potential of souls waiting to be drawn into new lives—not conscious, but *present*, hungry to become
- **The Completed**: Rare cases where a being's soul returned to source but left behind some fragment, some echo, that persists as a memory of a memory

Some scholars theorize that if you could communicate with the pre-birth souls of Astraeva, you might learn what you were in previous lives—or what you will become in future ones. But no method of communication has ever succeeded without the questioner losing themselves in the attempt.

### Reaching Astraeva

Like all planar flip-sides, Astraeva is reached by traveling to the edge of the Astral Plane and continuing past the boundary. But the Astral Plane's "edges" are not clearly defined—the islands simply become sparser, the light brighter, until at some point you realize you have crossed over.

The transition is gradual, which makes it dangerous. Many who enter Astraeva do not realize they have done so until it is too late to return unchanged.

## Astral Plane

### Geography

The Astral Plane consists of a massive sea with floating islands, consisting of a special stone-like material that floats in Astral solution. Like icebergs, larger islands are cliff-edged, and tower into the sky, while smaller islands ride much lower. Huge disasters occur when an island rolls over due to the massiver earthquakes they deal with (due to structural instability). These quakes can cause astral stone to break free, showering down on the earth. 

The Astral Sea is filled with beautiful shining lights, which are the stars on the material plane. These lights were created by the titans. The Astral Sea is nearly opaque, which is why the giant islands high in the sky are not visible. The Astral Plane is lit up from above by Aurus, the White Sun, which illuminates all souls on the Astral Plane, but cannot penetrate down to the material plane through the Astral Sea.

No maps chart these lands, as the islands, as their locations are constantly changing.

Massive cities are built in these islands. 

#### The Astral Sea

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo mountain shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea. 

### The Soul

The soul is slightly influenced by astral currents in the astral sea, and good ship captains can sense them to navigate astral currents well.

The Astral Plane is illuminated by Aurus, the White Sun (counterpart to Nydus, the Black Sun). Souls are illuminated in its light.

All souls of the living go to the Astral Plane upon death. The Astral Plane is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the souls of the dead.

#### The Dreaming of Lyzaria

The very fabric of the Astral Sea is woven from the essence of Lyzaria, the first titan to die. When she chose death 235 million years ago, her soul spread across the Astral Plane, becoming the foundational substrate that all later souls settle into. Every soul that enters the Astral Sea flows through traces of her essence.

The Dreaming of Lyzaria is not a region—it is the Astral Sea itself. Her memories are diffused throughout the waters. Those who sail far enough from the known islands sometimes report strange visions: glimpses of the titan age, echoes of thoughts that are not their own, the faint sense that something vast and ancient is watching. In the deepest waters, it is said that the boundary between your memories and Lyzaria's becomes thin. Travelers who linger too long may forget who they are and remember someone else instead.

Lyzaria's presence also makes the Astral Plane a repository for souls—she carved the grooves that allow the dead to persist here rather than simply dissipating. Without her sacrifice, there would be no afterlife as mortals understand it.

### Fauna

##### Astral Sentinels
In the Astral Plane, massive ethereal creatures known as Astral Sentinels roam the islands. These creatures, remnants of forgotten celestial battles, are attracted to disturbances in psychic energy. They serve as both protectors and dangers to astral travelers.

##### Symbiots
Some inhabitants of the Astral Plane have developed a symbiotic relationship with astral creatures. These beings, known as Astral Weavers, use the threads of psychic energy to weave protective barriers or manipulate the weakened free will of other astral entities.

## Bank of Infindior

Tags: poi

Bank where time doesn't pass, but anything is immediately accessible. Can freeze possessions and make them completely inaccessible to others. All sorts of opportunities for bullshit. Very niche, and extremely important bank in the world.

## Belagria

Tags: region, material plane

Belagria is the upper half of the Material Plane—the inhabited world where most of "life" occurs. It consists of two major layers: the **Surfacelands**, where kingdoms and civilizations rise and fall, and the **Underrealms**, a 200-mile thick crust of stone crisscrossed with tunnels, caves, and mysteries.

### The Sun

Belagria is lit by **Bryn**, the awakened sun—the greatest of the titan-crafted stars. Unlike Aurus (who illuminates the Astral Plane) or Nydus (who casts dark light over Malstaris), Bryn is not a dissolved titan-god but a construct that gained consciousness when the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria with spirit-essence.

The sun is a giant orb of celestial glass, made primarily of sunstone (heavily light-attuned astral stone). It travels across the sky because Bryn *chooses* to travel—its path influenced by the prayers of the faithful. When it passes below the horizon of the Surfacelands, it continues its journey across the underbelly of the Astral Sea before returning, creating the cycle of day and night.

### Below Belagria

Beneath the Underrealms lies **Emphathum**—a 100-mile stretch of weightlessness filled with floating stones and absolute darkness. Below that, gravity reverses, leading to **Phlethageros**: the cruel underside of the Material Plane, dominated by the Zylogmus Eternus and the hellish Wastes.

## Celestia

Tags: planes

### Origin

Celestia's creation required two events separated by 115 million years.

During the Lyzaria Era (235–180 million years ago), the titan-god **Celest** sacrificed herself to create a pocket dimension—a protected space outside the conflict between her brothers Aurus and Nydus. This seed of Celestia served as a refuge where those who died could persist, a source of power the titans of the Material Plane could draw upon. As a titan-god, Celest could not truly die, only transform—and her essence became the core of this dimension.

For 115 million years, this seed remained small and hidden, accessible only through death. Then came the **Ezz Rift** (120 million years ago). When Melera's music fractured the Alarian Planar Stack and Ezz flooded in, it accumulated around Celestia because it was the only structure in Alaria that resonated with her song. The pocket dimension bloomed into a full plane, peeling away from the Material Plane to become its mirror-image flip side.

This dual origin explains Celestia's strange nature: its *core* is Celest's essence (which is why it serves as a refuge for spirits), but its *substance* is made of Ezz (which is why it reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the living). The titan-god created the vessel; Melera's music filled it.

### Nature

Celestia is the home of daemons. It is a reflection of the world but lacking any of the typical life that exists in the material realm. The plane is shaped by the thoughts and beliefs of the living—the world as mortals *understand* it, not as it physically is. Where there is thought on the Material Plane, there is a counterpart in Celestia.

Since the plane is shaped by belief rather than physical law, it cannot be directly altered by those within it. Daemons who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celestia.

### Spirits in Celestia

Spirits arrive here upon death, after their soul rises to the Astral Plane and their shadow sinks to Malstaris. Unlike souls and shadows, which cycle through cosmic reservoirs to be renewed, spirits in Celestia face a different fate.

While in Celestia, you have no body—only a spirit—and cannot die by any means except Ezz-forged weapons, which sever your will from your spirit. Survival depends entirely on the prayers of those who knew your true name. Upon death, your spirit fades to Celestia, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

**When a spirit is forgotten, it does not return to some cosmic source. It simply ends.** The spirit—the part of you that was *you*, your free will and personality—ceases to exist entirely. Souls cycle through Aurus. Shadows cycle through Nydus. But spirits made of Ezz have no such reservoir. The self that made you distinct is *gone*, irrevocably, forever. This is the true finality of death in Alaria: not the separation of soul and shadow, but the eventual forgetting that ends the spirit.

Some spirits, however, remain remembered. Those who know Deoric and gather enough worshippers become capable of affecting the material realm. These beings are called **daemons**, and they may be worshipped as gods.

### Travel to Celestia

Willingly going to Celestia requires leaving your shadow and soul behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your spirit, making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

### Magic in Celestia

Deoric does not function on Celestia due to Ezzic interference—the Ezz that fills the plane disrupts the absolute commands of Deoric speech. However, many Deoric masters reside in Celestia. They cannot cast directly within the plane, but they can project their knowledge and power across the boundary, channeling Deoric through their followers on the Material Plane. This is how daemons grant miracles: the worshipper provides the ritual and sacrifice on the Material side, and the daemon provides the Deoric knowledge and guidance from Celestia.

## Celestial Forges

Abandoned forges within the underbelly of the astral islands. This is where the Vyko crafted the stars and released them into the Astral Sea.

## Eindumor

Tags: plane, cosmology, shadow, Nydus

Eindumor is the flip side of Malstaris—but unlike other planar flip-sides, it is not truly a "place" in the conventional sense. Eindumor is **Nydus himself**, unfiltered and unmediated.

### Nature

Malstaris is Nydus's darkness filtered through structure: the caverns, the black lakes, the accumulated shadows that give shape and definition to his murk. Eindumor is what remains when those structures are stripped away—the raw, direct presence of the Black Sun.

To enter Eindumor is to stand within the source of all shadows. There are no caves here, no landmarks, no places to hide. Only darkness—not the absence of light, but darkness as a *presence*, a weight, a thing that *sees*.

### The Cosmic Reservoir

Eindumor serves a fundamental role in the cycle of life and death:

**Origin of Shadows**: When a new creature is conceived anywhere in Alaria, a shadow is drawn from Eindumor. This raw Nydus-essence passes through Malstaris, threads up through the Nethereal Plane, and binds with the newly formed spirit. Every living creature's shadow was once part of this undifferentiated dark.

**Return of Shadows**: When creatures die, their shadows sink to Malstaris, where they persist for a time—sometimes centuries, sometimes millennia, depending on how many secrets they still hold. But shadows do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn shadows—those that have cycled through many lives, or those whose secrets have all been revealed—drift back through to Eindumor. They dissolve into Nydus's darkness, losing their individual definition, becoming raw essence once more. In time, they may be drawn forth again as new shadows, with no memory of what they concealed before.

### The Danger

Traveling to Eindumor is not merely dangerous—it is existentially threatening. Your shadow is not a separate thing here; it is *part* of Nydus, and the boundary between self and source grows terrifyingly thin.

Visitors report:
- Their secrets beginning to leak outward, visible to any who look
- Hidden depths rising to the surface unbidden
- Every lie they've ever told, every shameful thought, becoming exposed
- A horrifying sense of *nakedness*, of being seen completely

Stay too long, and your shadow may simply rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. Your body might continue walking somewhere else, shadowless and flat. But the hidden depths that gave you complexity, interiority, *self*—those would become part of the primordial dark. You would be *completed*—and completion, in this context, means the end of secrets, of growth, of becoming anything other than exactly what you appear to be.

### What Exists There

Eindumor is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain hidden depths under Nydus's unfiltered darkness. What few beings exist are:

- **Echoes of Nydus's will**: Not separate creatures, but expressions of the titan-god's vast, cold purposes given momentary shape
- **Pre-birth shadows**: The formless potential of shadows waiting to be drawn into new lives—not conscious, but *watching*, ready to carry new secrets
- **The Completed**: Rare cases where a being's shadow returned to source but left behind some fragment, some echo, that persists as a secret of a secret

Some scholars theorize that Eindumor contains the truth of everything—every secret ever kept, every lie ever told, all laid bare in the primordial dark. If one could navigate it without losing themselves, they might learn anything. But the cost of such knowledge would be complete exposure of one's own depths.

### Reaching Eindumor

Like all planar flip-sides, Eindumor is reached by traveling to the edge of Malstaris and continuing past the boundary. But Malstaris's "edges" are not clearly defined—the caverns simply grow emptier, the darkness heavier, until at some point you realize you have crossed over.

The transition is gradual, which makes it dangerous. Many who enter Eindumor do not realize they have done so until it is too late to return unchanged.

### The Relationship with The First Dark

The First Dark—Lyzaria's ancient shadow—rules a region of Malstaris that borders Eindumor more closely than anywhere else. Some believe she guards the boundary, preventing things from crossing in either direction. Others believe she is *studying* Eindumor, seeking a way to reunite with her soul-half in Astraeva by understanding the cosmic sources themselves. What The First Dark knows about Nydus and Eindumor is knowledge she has never shared.

## Elemental Planes

Tags: planes

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material planes (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial planes (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material planes. The layers closer to the material planes are more accessible to those on the material planes, whereas the elemental layers closer to Celestia and the other immaterial planes are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

Leylines are cracks in the planes where individual elemental planes spill through much closer to the material plane. Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental magic performed on leylines is always more fantastic.

Those layers are:

- Yolus (Fire)
- Sulus (Air)
- Golus (Earth)
- Pelus (Water)
- Vulus (Darkness)
- Kunus (Light)
- Nilus (Void)
- Izzus (Time)

Along certain lines across the land, these elemental planes bend much closer to the Material Plane. Those lines on which they bend closer are known as Leylines, and are locations where elemental magic relying on the corresponding element will be much more potent.

## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Tags: plane, cosmology, divination, threads

The Ethereal and Nethereal planes are two thin planes that overlay all other planes within Alaria. They are counterparts to one another—and together, they form the substrate through which all living beings are bound to their souls and shadows.

### The Thread Substrate

Every living creature in Alaria possesses an astral thread and a malstaric thread, connecting their spirit to their soul and shadow respectively. These threads are not metaphors—they are literal strands of binding energy that run through the Ethereal and Nethereal planes.

- **Astral threads** pass through the Ethereal Plane, connecting spirits (in the Material Plane) to souls (in the Astral Plane above).
- **Malstaric threads** pass through the Nethereal Plane, connecting spirits to shadows (in Malstaris below).

The overlay planes are densely woven with countless threads—a vast web connecting every living being across Alaria to their astral and malstaric counterparts. This web is not static; it vibrates with the actions and experiences of the living.

### Ethereal Plane

The Ethereal Plane is the lighter of the two overlay planes, suffused with faint astral energy. It is here that astral threads run from the Material Plane up toward the Astral Sea.

**Echoes and Divination**: When significant events occur, they send vibrations through the astral threads of everyone involved. These vibrations ripple outward through the web, creating "echoes"—imprints that skilled diviners can perceive. The more people involved in an event, the louder and more persistent the echo. A great battle leaves reverberations that last centuries; a private murder leaves only faint traces.

- **Past echoes** are settled vibrations—events that have fully resolved, their energy dissipating but still readable.
- **Future glimpses** are nascent tensions forming in the web—threads pulling taut before they snap, probabilities condensing into inevitabilities.

**Healers and the Ethereal**: Those who mend astral threads—repairing damage to the soul-binding—work through the Ethereal Plane. This is why soul-healing magic often feels luminous and clarifying.

### Nethereal Plane

The Nethereal Plane is the darker counterpart, suffused with faint malstaric energy. It is here that malstaric threads run from the Material Plane down toward Malstaris.

**Dark Echoes**: The Nethereal also contains echoes of events, but these tend toward the obscured, the hidden, and the violent. Secrets leave stronger imprints here than public events. Deaths resonate powerfully. The echo of a betrayal may be nearly invisible in the Ethereal but scream through the Nethereal.

**Necromancy and the Nethereal**: Those who sever or manipulate malstaric threads—necromancers, shadow-binders, and practitioners of death magic—work through the Nethereal Plane. This is why necromancy feels cold and invasive; it is literally reaching into the substrate that holds a person together and pulling at the dark threads.

### Why You Cannot Survive There

No creature can sustain themselves within the Ethereal or Nethereal planes. To enter fully would be to stand inside the connective tissue that makes you *you*—like trying to exist within your own veins. Your threads would tangle, your bindings would unravel, and your spirit would come apart from its anchors.

Skilled individuals can *perceive* these planes—through dreams, meditation, or magical sight—but true travel there is impossible for any being that relies on the thread-binding to live.

### The Web as a Whole

Philosophers and mystics sometimes speak of the "Great Web"—the totality of all threads running through the Ethereal and Nethereal planes, connecting every living being in Alaria to one another through their shared bindings to Aurus and Nydus. Some claim that sufficiently powerful diviners can perceive not just local echoes but the shape of the entire web—though such claims are impossible to verify.

What is certain is that the Ethereal and Nethereal are not empty voids. They are dense with the filaments of life itself, humming with the vibrations of every joy, every death, every secret, and every war that has ever touched a living soul.

## Ezz

Tags: material

The universal substrate. Contains equal parts of Azus and Melera—thought and emotion at balance.

## Hell's Palace

Tags: poi

Hotel. Each door in an endless hallway leads to a different subdivision of hell, each controlled by a local devil lord.

## Malstaris

Tags: plane

Malstaric Rivers go through the land, which can sweep your shadow away.

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate Malstaris. There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in Malstaris, and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

Malstaris is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in Malstaris can cause strange interactions, as your soul is so far away, and your shadow so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made Malstaris their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids.

High above Malstaris is Nydus, the Black Sun, spilling heavy darkness across the land.

### The First Dark

When Lyzaria, the first titan to die, was split apart 235 million years ago, her soul rose to the Astral Plane—but her shadow sank here, to Malstaris. As the first shadow to ever enter this plane, she carried with her the first secret Malstaris had ever known: the secret of what death *is*.

That shadow became the entity known as **The First Dark**—the oldest and most powerful of the Shadow Lords. Unlike other shadows in Malstaris, which are echoes or remnants of the living, The First Dark is something closer to a titan in nature: ancient, vast, and terribly aware.

The First Dark rules a region of Malstaris that no other power dares challenge. Even Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, does not extend his authority into her domain. What occurs there is unknown—shadows that enter do not return, or return changed in ways they cannot explain.

Some scholars believe The First Dark still longs for reunion with her other half—the Dreaming of Lyzaria in the Astral Sea. They claim the strange currents between the planes, the ways shadows sometimes seem to reach for light, are echoes of her attempt to become whole. Others believe the separation has driven her to something darker: if she cannot reunite with herself, perhaps she will find other ways to bridge the gap between soul and shadow.

### Breakneck Canyons

A region of treacherous cliffs within Malstaris.

#### Black Citadel

A tower built atop cliffs in the Breakneck Canyons. Home to a vampire lord. The dead line up outside the citadel for miles, waiting for their turn.

### Parliament of Shadows

The governing body of the largest region of Malstaris. Composed of the lords of all of the comprising regions.

## Material Plane

Tags: planes

The Material Plane is enormous, and consists of several different layers. On the top half is Belagria, consisting of the Surfacelands and the Underrealms. The surface lands are where most of "life" occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. The Underrealms, on the other hand, are a 200 mile thick crust of stone crisscrossed with tunnels and caves, and filled with mysteries and monsters.

As you travel deeper into the Underrealms, the downward pressure keeping your boots pressed to the ground grows weaker and weaker until you eventually reach Emphathum—a 100 mile stretch of weightlessness, filled with floating stones and absolute darkness.

If you down even further, your weight returns, but in the opposite direction from before. Now, you would be heading up, and would be in the second, lower half of the Material Plane—Phlethageros. Phlethageros is dominated by a Zylogmus Eternus, a massive maze, which eventually ends at the lower surface known as the Wastes—the Phlethagoran counterpart to the Surfacelands.


#### Emphathum

A region with zero gravity, massive floating rocks similar to asteroids, and almost no life. Few have ever crossed this. It is the space between the Underrealms and Zylogmus Eternus.

#### Phlethageros

The world on the underside of Belagria. Cruel, corrupted, and horrible, it is a brutal world.

##### Zylogmus Eternus

Millions of miles of labrythine passages stretching across the entire plane, for the entire 200 miles beneath the Wastes and Emphathum.

##### The Wastes

The barren, lava covered, poison-gas filled, tornado ridden surface of Phethageros. Nothing gets past this—a barrier between the demons above, and the prisoners of Zylogmus Eternus below. 

##### Stalactites of Geth

Massive, low hanging stalactites constantly pour forth lava from above the Wastes. Hundreds of thousands of demons live in these stalactites.

#### The Edges of the World

**North/South/East/West**: if you walk far enough in any of the cardinal direction, eventually you will wrap around the side of the world and into Celestia.

**Up**: Although it is difficult, by traveling directly up far enough, you eventually reach the Astral Sea, and then the Astral Plane itself. 

**Down**: Reaching Malstaris by foot is by all practical means—impossible. Instead, those who wish to journey there travel via Deoric magic.

## Phlethageros

Tags: planes, location

Home to the Zylogmus Eternus and the Stalactites of Geth. Really, really sucky place.
