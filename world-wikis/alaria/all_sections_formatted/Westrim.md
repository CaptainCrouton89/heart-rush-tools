### Benshu's Promise

This oasis is located in the Dunes of Kunagi, and is the only source of freshwater for hundreds of miles. It is guarded by Benshu, a large, incredibly deadly sphinx. To drink from the water, you must answer at least one of the sphinx's three questions correctly. If you drink from the oasis before asking the sphinx for permission, the sphinx captures you (all your muscles go limp) and gives you choice for doing maze or being eaten.

### Shyalaviin (Malasi Karkus)

Hills just south of the Eronia range that poke into the northern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi. This region, also known as Malasi Karkus, is home to the Blitzling—creatures that inhabit these transitional hills between the mountains and the desert sands.

## House of the Scorpion

Tags: poi

The origin of all scorpions in the world, it is believed. Scorpion guardians all over. Visited during bicentennial pilgrimages by the Husakas. Keeps all the scorpions in the desert alive. At its center is the Prince of Scorpions—a half scorpion humanoid who owns the house.

The house is partially submerged in the sands.

Quest to kill the prince, misguided. Scorpions aren't "evil"

## Ishnit Jungles

Tags: forest, geography

Superduper fucking deadly unless your quite powerful. Lots of nasty monsters.

Home to Naruaghin.

### Ekomorn

Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The Naruaghin who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.

### Demonwatch

Large, darkstone palace on the southern cape of the Ishnit Jungles, vines growing up over all of it. Overrun when a demon-summoning wizard lost control over his subjects. The demons are confined to the tower, but they're quite powerful, and immortal. Decorated with large, leathery-winged gargoyles with curling horns perched on guard.

Sailors are incredibly superstitious of the place, won't go near it. Others make fun of them for it—"the stone gargoyles just look scary, they aren't real." They aren't, but the demons within are.

### Tul Azreitnok

In the southern hills and dunes region of Kura stands Tul Azreitnok—a fortress and specialized academy dedicated to the study of midnight fire, a rare and dangerous form of dark flame magic. The academy trains mages in the manipulation of fire that burns with darkness rather than light, flames that consume without illuminating.

A giant, scorching hot labrynth of mirrors, full of your clones who attack you. Guarded by Julrus the Fierce. At the center of the palace is the entrance to an even larger dungeon, which was built around... heart of gaea? Piece of heart of gaea? Titan slaying weapon? Largest soul vessel ever built? Fountain of youth?

Your double is created when you enter. Your double is single-mindedly focused on killing you. Your double knows your true name.

## Wyrm Teeth

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills in Westrim, east of Kura and north of the Milras Forest. The Wyrm Teeth earned their name from their jagged, tooth-like peaks and their historical connection to the wyrms that once roamed these lands.

### Urk Noulgas

On the southwest point of the Wyrm Teeth stands Urk Noulgas—a ruined fortress that was once home to the Keeper of the Wyrms. In ancient times, wyrms were controlled by powerful mages in the Dunes of Kunagi, and Urk Noulgas served as a command post for these wyrm-keepers. The fortress now lies in ruins, abandoned after the fall of the wyrm-keeping tradition, though some say the echoes of old power still linger in the stones.
