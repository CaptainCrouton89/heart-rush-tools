## House of the Scorpion

Tags: poi

The origin of all scorpions in the world, it is believed. Scorpion guardians all over. Visited during bicentennial pilgrimages by the Husakas. Keeps all the scorpions in the desert alive. At its center is the Prince of Scorpions—a half scorpion humanoid who owns the house.

The house is partially submerged in the sands.

Quest to kill the prince, misguided. Scorpions aren't "evil"
