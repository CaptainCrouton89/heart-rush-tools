Many warfaring giants live here. Massive skeletons litter the ground from their destroyed bodies. One of the more powerful giant lords recently died, resulting in a large power vacuum.

Ruins of a halfling civilization present. Nothing of the city, known as Tem Shyanna remains, but the fortress walls do. Trapped within are a small enclave of halfling explorers, taking care of an old, senile, fire attuned halfling, who keeps them warm during the winter and provides the warmth for their food. The man is too senile to move, and trying to force him out makes him go berserk.

The walls protect the halflings from the giants, but not the wyverns. Either way, they are trapped here. Have been living here for 5 years now.

## Gülheim

Tags: poi

Massive fortress built for Filgerran II, king of the Güli giants. The fortress is only really big enough for him, and is magically enabled to provide for his needs. It is his throne from which he looks out upon his mountains. One day, he may decide to look to the West and take Camaran, though that day has not yet arrived.

## Nirvanis Mountains

Tags: mountains

The Nirvanis Mountains were once home to an ancient civilization of people who died out hundreds of years ago to overhunting. All the remains are the massive stone statues dotted throughout the land, under which the dead were buried. These statues were believed to protect the mountains from evil spirits.

The mountains, do, in fact have evil spirits haunting them, which the statues protect against. These spirits are known as Kyth, and appear as white, spectral ghosts. They come out at night and will kill those who are not spiritually warded (such as by the statues).
