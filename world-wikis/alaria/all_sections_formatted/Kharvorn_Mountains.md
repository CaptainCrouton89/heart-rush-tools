### Pact of Barrik

The Pact of Barrik is a statue of two dwarven kings, standing back to back, one holding a battleax, the other holding a book. These corresponded to the Hephakean and Argysisean kings respectively.

The statues are said to imbue wisdom in those who spend time aroudn them. Children from both kingdoms would visit the statue, and princes would spend days in meditation around them. When Argysis was conquered by Rothogomos, this was no longer safe, and the tradition died out.

### Blueshale Peaks

A mountain range northwest of Argysis proper, positioned on an earth leyline.

#### Stormfather

In the Blueshale Peaks dwells Stormfather, an earth-attuned cyclops of tremendous power. Before Argysis fell to the dragon Rothogomos, Stormfather served as a counselor to the Argysisean dwarves, offering wisdom and aid in times of need.

Stormfather remains in the peaks, a powerful ally to those who can earn his favor. He will trade his help for gems and stories of the world—the more compelling the tale, the more willing he is to assist. Alternatively, those brave (or foolish) enough can challenge him to an arm-wrestling match. Victory earns his respect and aid, though few possess the strength to best a cyclops of his might.

### Wisdom Creek

Wisdom Creek flows from the spring at Othyndria (the ruined capital, now home to Rothogomos the cruel dragon) down into the valley between Argysis and Hephake. The river earned its name from the great wisdom that once flowed from the Kings of Argysis when the dwarven kingdom was at its height.

The water flows northeast, eventually reaching Enros Lake, a large lake just south of the Jotun Hills—a mountain range stretching east-west from Winterwood in the west to the southwest edge of Konai Mora.

## Blue Shale Peaks

Tags: mountains

Many warfaring giants live here. Massive skeletons litter the ground from their destroyed bodies. One of the more powerful giant lords recently died, resulting in a large power vacuum.

Ruins of a halfling civilization present. Nothing of the city, known as Tem Shyanna remains, but the fortress walls do. Trapped within are a small enclave of halfling explorers, taking care of an old, senile, fire attuned halfling, who keeps them warm during the winter and provides the warmth for their food. The man is too senile to move, and trying to force him out makes him go berserk.

The walls protect the halflings from the giants, but not the wyverns. Either way, they are trapped here. Have been living here for 5 years now.

## Gülheim

Tags: poi

Massive fortress built for Filgerran II, king of the Güli giants. The fortress is only really big enough for him, and is magically enabled to provide for his needs. It is his throne from which he looks out upon his mountains. One day, he may decide to look to the West and take Camaran, though that day has not yet arrived.

## Hephake

A dwarven state in the southern Kharvorn Mountains, sharing a southeastern border with the state of Myorna. Hephake is known for its extensive silver mines and the pollution they produce.

### Phorysia

The capital city of Hephake, a major dwarven mining settlement with massive silver extraction operations.

### Derivlia Lake

Located in the southern part of Hephake, Derivlia Lake has become severely poisoned by runoff from the silver mines of Phorysia. The water is toxic, killing most life and leaving the shores barren. The lake serves as a stark reminder of the environmental cost of Hephake's mining wealth, and the dwarves have made no efforts to clean it—silver production continues unabated, and the poison flows into the lake year after year.

## Nirvanis Mountains

Tags: mountains

The Nirvanis Mountains were once home to an ancient civilization of people who died out hundreds of years ago to overhunting. All the remains are the massive stone statues dotted throughout the land, under which the dead were buried. These statues were believed to protect the mountains from evil spirits.

The mountains, do, in fact have evil spirits haunting them, which the statues protect against. These spirits are known as Kyth, and appear as white, spectral ghosts. They come out at night and will kill those who are not spiritually warded (such as by the statues).

## The Knives

A mountain range in the Kharvorn Mountains region.


The Knives, as they are commonly called, are in a constant state of very high winds, which have blown the peaks into sharp points, giving the mountains their name.
