## Aurus, the White Sun

Tags: sun

Aurus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, up above the Astral Plane.

Nydus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. It  He became the Black Sun, up above Malstaris.

The black sun that illuminates all of malstaris. Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely illuminates one's shadow. Many things lie hidden in the dark. 

What one's shadow is made of.

Slowly bobs around the sky, causing cold temperatures to spike around the Material Plane.

## Stars

Tags: cosmology

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Lives and maintains the star that is the sun, propelled by Bryn across the sky each day. Immune to the extreme heat from the sun. 

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

## Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

Sun passes around center strip every day, all year. No Tilt. 

Three moons pass over at various times throughout month.

Seasons come and go when followers convince Bryn to traverse a different trail across Alaria.

Stars are viewports for the gods. They can look down upon their subjects. Usually located above some place of importance to them.

Moon cycles: Two main moons, one has 11 day cycles, is used to tell what day of the week it is. Full moon once a week, on the start of the week. The other goes through a 23 day cycle, meaning about once every year there is one double full moon, and one moonless night, each important holidays. The year is 200 days long, split into eight, 25 day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice (no summer v winter with two hemispheres). 2 quarters spring, 2 quarters summer, 2 quarters fall, 2 quarters winter. When solstice (new year) coincides with a double full moon, or a double empty, it signals the beginning of a new age, occurring once every 25,300 years (~18,000 Earth Years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years. 

Moon phase is determined by location of Aurus and Nydus, the light and dark suns respectively. Moons tied to magic of Malstaric and Astral planes.  

Third, rogue moon, known as the Killing Moon. Looking upon it kills you. Comes up once every 8,000 years or so, but isn't consistent. Remains up for same duration, so can mean ~8,000 years of death. 

Years counted forward from 0 to 25,300, and then back down again. The suffix F or B stands for if time is going forward or backward. At 0 there is a double new moon during the northern-summer solstice/southern-winter solstice. At 25,300, there is a double full moon on new-year. Each marks the beginning of a new age. 

Moons aligning represents cycle of magic, whereas new year is cycle of nature. Moon elf, and other cultures who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on dual full moon, etc. 

Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to magic and more so to nature. Celebrations on first day of spring, new-year/solstice, last week of fall, and other solstice. Both are celebrated, though winter ones are more about trying to be cheerful in the face of winter.

Moon and Magic divinely intertwined.
