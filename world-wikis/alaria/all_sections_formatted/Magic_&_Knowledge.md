## Aether

Tags: material

Aether is the primary meta-fluid source of energy on Lanthornia—a nearby planar stack. An eruption on lanthornia caused a sizable quantity of aether and lanthornium to be expelled from the planar stack and land in Alaria.

Some creatures of Alaria have some sensitivity to the material and can manipulate it and pull it out of the air. Aether is used to power sky ships and a number of other machines and contraptions.

Raw Aether spends most of it's time in the air—inert, invisible, and immaterial. However, it can be extracted and processed with a little water, turning it into a powerful fuel. On contact with a purified lanthornium vibrating at a specific frequency, the aether will begin to expand, losing it's bond with the water and becoming non-substantive once more. There are many similarities to a steam engine. Aether engines frequently involve lanthornium plates being struck to start, causing an self-striking process to continue feeding more aether and lanthornium strikes. 

### Lanthornium

An uncommon, gray-blue type of stone that requires some expensive processing to purify.

## Deoric

Tags: magic

Deoric is the language of absolute power. Statements spoken in deoric have the power to rip the world apart, if anybody had the knowledge and capacity to wield the power required to do so. According to legends, this is the language the gods spoke when they created the world. Nowadays, the spoken language is nearly dead, though the written form remains alive in the runes used in handmagic, as well as forbidden rituals performed by the few left who know them. 

### Handmagic

The amount of power required to channel Deoric is immense, let alone wield it in a purposeful way. It is only through the strengthening of the astral thread binding one’s soul and shadow that one can hope to bind the power necessary to use Deoric. With stronger astral thread, one’s hand can be tattooed with more runes in titan blood (or the ground up dust from titan bones, mixed into a paste) which act both as a means of holding the magic as well as channeling it in way described by the Deoric runes. However, inscribing too many runes on one’s hand runs the risk of snapping one’s astral thread, killing the owner instantly. 

Handmagic comes in two main flavors—unique abilities, and skill buffs. Both strain your astral thread, though the skill buffs are generally simpler and cheaper, as the addition in skill is usually a less complicated rune. 

For players of Heart Rush, strengthening one’s astral thread takes the form of gaining XP and spending it on handmagic. 

### Ritual Magic

Ritual magic is magic performed using Deoric speech, powered by blood sacrifice. Anything is possible with ritual magic so long as you know the words and have a suitable amount of life sacrificed. Rules for ritual magic are described in below the Spells section.

### Recording Deoric Text

Deoric cannot be recorded except with titan blood or special ink made from their ground up bones. It is magically draining to write, due to the powerful nature of the text. Writing a rune or simple command takes about an hour to complete, and causes you to lose 10 hitpoints. You regain hitpoints lost in this way at a rate of 1 hitpoint each week. 

Once Deoric text is read by someone other than the author, the text disintegrates into ash. For this reason, along with the reasons above, any book of Deoric text is incredibly valuable. 

### Deoric, Daemons, & Celesté

Deoric is primarily used by the daemons of Celesté. Having been around for centuries, millennia, or in some rare cases, eons, these beings are frequently at much higher levels of mastery with the Deoric language that mortals can only dream of. By using this magic, they serve their followers.

## Diamonds

Tags: material

Diamonds are quite rare on Alaria. Small ones can be found at the surface, but the biggest ones lie deep undergound—miles, and miles underground—in caves and underground reservoirs. Extremely dangerous to retrieve—there are a lot of creatures (and natural hazards) deep underground.

## Ezzal Artifacts

Tags: item

Some materials and items of Alaria were imbued with ezz during the Ezz Rift. The materials were hoarded by the first dragons, then captured by dwarven king who had them forged into a collection of weapons named "thought swords". Fast as thought, and as deadly as one's imagination. The weapons melded with your mind. Extremely potent. They were necessary to become a true swordmind.

## Faesong

Tags: magic

The music of Melera that runs through Alaria and the rest of the universe. Some creatures can use it to perform magic. It the music and magic of emotion. 

Rusalka, faeries, nelkie, rusalka, and nymphs can hear it and use it for their magic. It is also what bards reproduce when the perform gaeic melodies.

Somewhat related to the psywinds.

## Kethic Elementalism

Tags: magic

Kethic elementalism, or simply Kethic, is one of the most prevalent systems of magic. Its basis is in one of attunements. By understanding a fundamental element completely, and having a primal bond with that thing, one can develop power to control that element. As that bond and understanding grows, one’s power over that element grows. 

There are nine fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With these elements, nearly everything is created. Many things are compounds of these elements, while others, such as living things, have additional, non-elemental components. 

By attuning to different elements, you have some basic power over those elements. There are three different levels of attunement for each basic element, and one level for each secondary element—each of which grant you various abilities.

However, attuning to an element is difficult. Most people never attune to any elements in their life times, and your spirit must be able to handle the additional pressure of resonating with the your attuned element. Those who do will frequently do so by accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to one of these such elements. More advanced attunements require even more exposure, and paragon level attunements generally require special activity dedicated to developing an attunement to that element.

Kethic also comes with limitations. Every living thing has some very low level attunement with all the elements, and for this reason, it is nearly impossible for another creature to interfere with elements especially close to another living being, such as its blood or flesh.

### Orcish

Orcish is spoken by the orcs of northwestern Clueanda. 

### Gorathi

Gorathi is spoken primarily by natives of Gorath, but as Gorath grows, so does the influence of its langauge.

### Ylindian

Ylindian is spoken by much of Upoceax, the Free Isles, and western Aboyuinzu. 

### Minor Languages

### Elven

Many of the elves still speak their own dialects of Elven, which stemmed from Druidic. Most elves can roughly understand each other when speaking in their native elven tongue, if they have one.

### Dwarven

Unlike elven, dwarven tongues have mostly died out, as the dwarves pick up the languages of their neighboring trade partners. However, some locations still exist where various dialects of dwarven are still spoken.

### Countries of Aboyuinzu

Many of the countries here speak different langauges, that are only spoken within their country.

### Tribal States

Most tribal states speak languages that are only native to that region. 

### Deoric: The Language of Absolutes

Deoric was once spoken by the titans who long ago inhabited Alaria. It is the language of absolutes—things spoken in Deoric *must* occur, if there is power behind the words. Now, however, it is used by dark mages to perform powerful magic. The language is extremely complex, and takes centuries to learn, but unlocks great power.

This power comes from spiritual sacrifice, usually by killing a sentient creature and performing a ritual.

## Red Gold

Tags: mineral

Red gold is one of the most valuable materials known on Alaria. The metal is a beautiful reddish gold color that never tarnishes, is extremely reflective, and is heavier than normal gold.

## Red, the Screaming Blade

Tags: npc

A being in armor of blood, possessing a blade that sings with the screams of those it's killed. Wins every fight in the colliseums of the Free Isles.

## Sky-stone

Tags: material

Sky-stones are stones that have broken off from the lower crust of the Astral Plane, usually during its incredibly powerful earthquakes. 

The stones generally plummet quite a ways before the buoyency they experience in the Material Plane cuases them to float back up—usually not before smashing into the ground first though. Low density (density means the opposite here—it's the density of the "floaty" substance per weight of stone) stones float lower to the ground, while higher density ones can reach as high as the stars themselves (and are often populated by Xaphriel).

## Sleep Sauce

A combination of whale blood and baleen, this silk has amplifying or dampenging effects on emotion. It attunes the wearer with the whale's melody, which can be one of sadness, triumph, joy, or anything else.

## The Four Dragon Blades

Tags: magic

Each of the four dragon blades is an ancient item that was forged by a dark elf master smith. The blades are a rare example of elven smithing competing with the best of the drwaven and cyclopse craftsmen. Although none of the blades are enchanted, they were made with such skill and such rare material that they posses mythic properties, allowing them to aid the weilder in supernatural ways without the use of conventional magic or mana. The blades where forged for dragon riders of the ancient dark elf empire. The hilt of the blade is modelled after the dragon's maw while the blade itself is modelled after the dragon's tongue. This design resulted in the swords looking thick, wavey, and slightly sluggish. Their shape combined with their dark materials have led to them being described as crude or unsightly but on the battle field they serve their purpose flawlessly. They swing with speed and ease despite their size and shape and they seperate flesh, bone, and armor alike, without becoming dull. The blades have been scattered and traded over the years but remain legendary items coveted by dark elf establishments.

## The Golden Enchanting Table

Tags: magic

The Golden Enchanting Table was built by one of the greatest golden beard dwarf forges of all time. Although he is also famous for erecting the legendary 9-ringed city, the enchanting table is the crown jewel of his achievements. The table is made of the purest gold and resides at the center of a room made of ever turning gears. The gears are enchanted with lesser souls, allowing them to continue turning without fuel. On each side of each tooth of each gear, there is a fundamental rune that inevitably connects with the runes of each other gear during its rotation. When the fundamental runes of different gears touch they form a classical rune that draws power from the tables core (a legendary soul) and presents itself to whomever stands within the room of the enchanting table. Once the rune is presented to the tables user, they may use it however they wish without the need of soul energy or a sacrifice. The gears in the room are set up in a way that each gear migrates around the room over the course of a decade so that it can make contact with every other room and form as many different classical runes as possible. Reknowned enchanters search for the table and fight for a place at it so that they may learn from its complicated design and use is renewable magic. The golden beard dwarf who designed the table was a genious and an outlier within history. He was able to construct the fundamental runes from an advanced understanding of magic, souls, and enchanting that few beings have been able to replicate since.

## The River Elf Blade Master

Tags: magic

The river elves, although small in population, are a people dedicated to honing the practice of blade dancing. This practice is more of an art form than an actual fighting technique but its has the potential to be elevated for such use. A few river elves persue the title of blade master which signifies their ability to use blade dancing for practical purposes. The art focuses on maintaining a special type of composure and form which allows the blade master to cut through material regardless of the sharpness of the blade making is comprable to water the way that if flows and the weight behind its sharpness. The art also allows particularly skilled blade masters to move quicker than normal reaching an almost mythical level where they were believed to be able to "flow" through their enemies attacks when, in reality, they were evading them. The pinacle of the art was the skill to move so symetrically and quickly that enemies believed the blade master was fighting alongside a doble ganger of themselves who was also weilding an identical blade. The river elf blade master became a legendary pupil of the art and reached the point where they could momic themselves eight times over. Their skill became so honed that the technical application of what they learned became entirely depended on mythical techniques that far exceeded normal physical limits. These mythical techniques became realized by the river elf blade master through a lifetime of unbroken study and training. The master is often compared to other great sages and monks as their superior or role model.
