## Everwood

Tags: forest

Nothing can rot in this forest, the trees cannot die, and the entire forest is just one, large organism. The forest is so dense with undergrowth that no light reaches the bottom. 

The entire understory is fungal. Myushli live in small villages.

Because nothing rots, horrible forest fires come through and burn everything down, replenishing the forest with nutrients.

Sleeping on the forest floor in any season but winter will cause the roots to envelope you in your sleep.

The leaves all fall in autumn, revealing the sky above. 

Forest is north of the Piktiniti Desert

## Grieb Lakes

Tags: lake, geography

A series of interconnected freshwater lakes in the Westwilds, home to the reclusive Griebi people.

### The Griebi: The Lakemen

The Griebi are a unique subspecies of aquatic orcs with blueish-gray skin adapted for underwater life. They are accomplished hunters and fishers who rarely interact with surface-dwellers and communicate sparingly even among themselves.

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Blueish-gray skin
- Ability to breathe underwater
- Long, needle-like teeth adapted for swimming and catching fish

**Culture & Society:**
- Subsist primarily through hunting and fishing
- Rarely speak, preferring non-verbal communication
- Ruled by a hag queen

The Griebi's terrifying appearance - particularly their needle-like dentition - makes encounters with them unsettling for most surface dwellers, though they are primarily focused on survival rather than aggression.

## Krenglelan Range

Tags: mountains, geography

A mountain range in the Westwilds, featuring both dense forests and strategic passes.

### The Everwood

A vast forest stretching across the breadth of the Krenglelan Range, covering much of the mountain valleys and lower slopes.

### Ipt

On the western side of the Krenglelan Range, north of the Everwood and along a major trade route, stands Ipt—a formidable fortress built for Feriptus, an extremely powerful lich. The fortress serves as his primary research facility, where he conducts necromantic experiments in complete isolation.

Ipt is built into the mountainside with tall, iron-reinforced stone walls and heavy defensive wards that notify Feriptus of any approaching visitors. The fortress is supplied through a grim arrangement: a personal Enti trader makes bi-yearly trips south to acquire slaves, delivering fresh bodies for Feriptus's dark work. Despite its location along a trade route, travelers give Ipt a wide berth, knowing that those who approach uninvited rarely leave.

## Piktiniti Desert

Tags: desert

A vast, arid desert (less sand, more shrubland). All the water beneath the desert is leeched out by the Everwood in the north. The sandy soil contians trace amounts of twyl, a crystal that magically produces oxygen.

Beneath the desert are the ruins of the Postronamas Empire, an incredibly powerful civilization that used the powers of twyl to become incredibly powerful themselves. Large, crystal caves were used for meditation by their leaders, granting them fabulous powers. huge crystal caverns beneath the ground. Tons of crystals available, but can drive you mad from their music. Permeates mind unless you are literally deaf? Literally too dumb to think? 

The desert is dominated by giant insects, which flourish in the oxygen rich environment. Every 7 years, the locusts hatch and ravage the surface of anything edible. Large scorpions hunt the insects.

Desert also contains Sand Dragons, not true dragons, but still quite dangerous.

Most of the plants are filled with parasites and will fuck you up.

Tumbleweeds of massive wasp nests roll across the desert.

Sidewinders will fuck you up

Plants that give off the smell of "clean water". Fools water attunement too. Very large, sub-sand venus-fly trap.
