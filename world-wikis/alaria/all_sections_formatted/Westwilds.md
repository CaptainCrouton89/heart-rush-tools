## Everwood

Tags: forest

Nothing can rot in this forest, the trees cannot die, and the entire forest is just one, large organism. The forest is so dense with undergrowth that no light reaches the bottom. 

The entire understory is fungal. Myushli live in small villages.

Because nothing rots, horrible forest fires come through and burn everything down, replenishing the forest with nutrients.

Sleeping on the forest floor in any season but winter will cause the roots to envelope you in your sleep.

The leaves all fall in autumn, revealing the sky above. 

Forest is north of the Piktiniti Desert

## Piktiniti Desert

Tags: desert

A vast, arid desert (less sand, more shrubland). All the water beneath the desert is leeched out by the Everwood in the north. The sandy soil contians trace amounts of twyl, a crystal that magically produces oxygen.

Beneath the desert are the ruins of the Postronamas Empire, an incredibly powerful civilization that used the powers of twyl to become incredibly powerful themselves. Large, crystal caves were used for meditation by their leaders, granting them fabulous powers. huge crystal caverns beneath the ground. Tons of crystals available, but can drive you mad from their music. Permeates mind unless you are literally deaf? Literally too dumb to think? 

The desert is dominated by giant insects, which flourish in the oxygen rich environment. Every 7 years, the locusts hatch and ravage the surface of anything edible. Large scorpions hunt the insects.

Desert also contains Sand Dragons, not true dragons, but still quite dangerous.

Most of the plants are filled with parasites and will fuck you up.

Tumbleweeds of massive wasp nests roll across the desert.

Sidewinders will fuck you up

Plants that give off the smell of "clean water". Fools water attunement too. Very large, sub-sand venus-fly trap.
