## Desert of One Million Shards

Tags: desert, geography

This desert was created when a massive meteor struck a desert oasis kingdom. In a last ditch effort to avert the collision, powerful fire mages transfered the heat from the explosion to the rest of the desert. Although the oasis city was still destroyed, the meteor was not as cataclysmic. However, the distributed heat melted the desert, turning it to glass.

Over the millenia, this glass has been sandblasted and fractured—resulting in some places being blanketed in huge swaths of glass fragments.

Rocs in the nearby mountains now hunt large prey by lifting them up into the sky, and dropping them on the desert to break their bones before bringing them back to their enormous nests in the mountains.

Statues of redgold built by the dwarves who once lived here. Entire valley is horribly cursed (all the dwarves were killed by the Adron dragonriders.

If you have dragon blood in you, a horrible curse is placed upon you. Skin begins to turn to stone. Skin hardens, doesn't flex at all, movement becomes stilted. Won't kill you, but your agility die falls by 2 levels over course of next week. Permanent, unless forgiven by a stone dwarf descendent (only the dwarf bandit).

Home to numerous Kimril, copious quantities of red gold, and the an infamous dwarf bandit. 

Used to be homeland of stone dwarves, but it was destroyed by dragonriders from Adron. All of the underground cities and ruins of the stone dwarves are now infested with goblins and other nasties that the Adron government has given up trying to eradicate.

They removed the dwarves by just flaming the tunnels with their dragons, but now they don't really have the same dragon population they used to, and they can't ever quite get the last of the goblins, which is all it takes for them all to immediately repopulate the mountains.
