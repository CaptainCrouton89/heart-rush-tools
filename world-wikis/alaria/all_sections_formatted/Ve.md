# Ve

## Geography

Ve is a large, isolated continent to the far east of Alaria, separated from the main landmasses by vast ocean expanses. It stands apart—a world unto itself. The continent divides broadly into a drier northern half of savannah, plains, and desert, and a heavily jungled southern half dominated by wild beasts and ancient mysteries.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Alrock Ocean**: The vast ocean to the west, separating Ve from the rest of Alaria
- **Norswell Sea**: The northern waters
- **Sea of Fools**: The eastern ocean, what Meadow Sound opens to, lying due east of the Krell Lands. Despite its lovely appearance—filled with beautiful coral reefs and inviting waters—the Sea of Fools is treacherous. Every creature here, from the eels to the snails to the smallest reef dwellers, carries slow-acting poison. Not necessarily lethal, but awful nonetheless. The sea's beauty is a deadly lure, earning it the name "Sea of Fools" for those who trust what they see
- **Shadowreap**: Far to the east of Ve, north of the Sea of Fools, lies Shadowreap—a region where force and dark leylines intersect beneath the ocean. Massive clouds of pure darkness drift across the water, and sailing into them invites disaster. The combined power of force and darkness can tear ships apart, ripping hulls to splinters and scattering wreckage across the waves. Few vessels that enter Shadowreap return intact

### Continental Layout (Clockwise from Northwest)

**Northwest - Edari**: Savannah plains occupy the northwestern corner of Ve, a land of golden grasses and scattered trees.

**Shepherd's Stones**: Steep golden plains that form a natural barrier between Edari and Sestros, marking the transition between the two regions.

**North - Turquish Bay**: This bay separates Edari from Shyona, cutting into the northern coastline.

**Northeast - Shyona**: The largest state on Ve, occupying much of the northeastern region. Shyona is a Japan-inspired land of large plains (including the Gilded Plains), with dramatic **Yokani Cliffs** running along most of the eastern edge. The state extends south to **Meadow Sound**, a large inlet that penetrates deep into the continent where jungle meets the sea.

**East Coast - Wild Jungle**: South of Meadow Sound, the coast becomes untamed jungle.

**Southeast - Krell Lands**: The first major wild jungle region, occupying the eastern coastal jungle.

**South - Dygon Beast Lands**: A vast jungle stretching across the entire southern end of the continent from west to east. This is primordial wilderness, home to creatures found nowhere else.

**Southeast - Phyr Island**: A jungle island separated from the mainland by **Disaster Passage**, a treacherous strait.

**Southwest - Phriorys**: A region of hills between the Dygon Beast Lands and the Suki Jungle, home to the dragon **Pyaganos**.

**Southwest - Gulf of Chimea & Chimea**: The Gulf of Chimea indents the southwestern coast. The state of **Chimea** controls the **Suki Jungle** and extends through the Blood Mountains into the plains just south of Avalon. The Suki is divided into regions: South Suki and West Suki along the coasts, North Suki inland.

### The Widebarrow Mountains

A moderate-sized mountain range runs diagonally from the southwest to the northeast, roughly bisecting the continent. From south to north, it comprises:

- **Blood Mountains** (south): Home to an underground realm of vampiric gnomes
- **Mez**: Mountain state
- **Dern**: Mountain state
- **Thorum** (north): Northernmost mountain state

### Western Regions (North of the Mountains)

**Avalon**: Immediately north and west of the Widebarrow Mountains. A land of grasslands and forests, more temperate than the surrounding regions.

**Sestros**: North of Avalon. Transitions from plains in the south through savannah to desert in the north, including the **Red Desert**.

### North-Central Desert Region

Between Sestros and Shyona lie independent territories in a yellowy, arid landscape:

- **Hills of Dolor**: Hilly desert terrain with city-states
- **Dunes of Evioli**: Sandy desert with city-states

## Alrock Ocean

Tags: region, ocean, ve

A vast ocean between Ve and the central continents, the Alrock is claimed entirely by the triton theocracy of Vetral—a claim no surface nation recognizes but few openly defy. The waters are contested, valuable, and dangerous: ancient shipping lanes weave between triton holy sites, Bfaspeen hunting grounds, and the rare surface islands that dot the expanse.

The Alrock's defining feature is the war beneath its surface. For generations, Vetral's tritons have fought the Bfaspeen broods for control of the deep. This conflict shapes everything above: shipping routes shift to avoid battle zones, insurance rates climb, and surface nations receive increasingly desperate diplomatic overtures from tritons who once considered them beneath notice.

### Vetral

The triton theocracy claims sovereignty over every drop of the Alrock. In practice, they control the central waters and enforce their "Old Lanes" system—ancient shipping routes that avoid sacred sites. Ships that follow the Lanes sail safely. Ships that stray have accidents.

Vetral is losing its war against the Bfaspeen. The Depths Conclave has begun reaching out to surface nations for alliance—something unthinkable a generation ago. So far, they've met mostly rejection.

See [Vetral](../../nations_and_powers/states/Vetral.md) for full details.

### Bfaspeik

The southern waters where the Bfaspeen broods lair. Warm volcanic vents heat the sea here, creating the thermal environment the eel-bodied horrors prefer. The water steams in places. The seabed glitters with centuries of sunken treasure.

Bfaspeik is not one territory but many—each major vent system claimed by a brood mother and her subservient males. Historically, the broods competed as much with each other as with outsiders. That's changing. Someone or something is organizing the matriarchs, coordinating their attacks against Vetral.

**The Hoards**: Every ship sunk in these waters for the past thousand years has been dragged down and picked clean. The brood mothers sit atop mountains of gold, gems, and artifacts they cannot use but pathologically covet. Some surface treasure hunters have made fortunes trading with Bfaspeen—but far more have become additions to the hoard.

**The Volcanic Labyrinth**: Beneath Bfaspeik, the seabed fractures into a maze of thermal vents, lava tubes, and superheated caverns. The Bfaspeen retreat here when pressed, into environments the tritons cannot survive. It's why Vetral has never managed to exterminate them.

### Keletus

The Lorean minotaur democracy occupying Apketrii island. Keletus produces the finest naval officers in the world—a fact that makes them valuable to everyone and allied to no one. King Varrosh maintains stubborn neutrality in the Vetral-Bfaspeik conflict, refusing both triton overtures and brood mother offers.

See [Keletus](../../nations_and_powers/states/Keletus.md) for full details.

### Apketrii

The mountainous island home to Keletus. The Diamondback Mountains run through its center, the Hallenfell range guards the northwest, and Blossom Valley provides the agricultural south. The southeastern peninsula—called the Long Reach—stretches toward Ve, its lighthouse towns watching the sea lanes.

The island's most mysterious feature is Hallenfell, where drowned ruins of a pre-minotaur civilization—the Kelemyr—emerge from cliff faces. Expeditions into the flooded halls rarely return.

### Shimmerpools

An area where pools of liquid light form and swirl among the waves. The luminescent water retains its glow for weeks after sun exposure. Alchemists and illusionists pay fortunes for Shimmerpool water—properly prepared, it produces the most potent illusions in the world.

The Shimmerpools drift. They're not a fixed location but a phenomenon that moves with currents no one fully understands. Ships that stumble into them report disorientation, lost time, and occasionally crew who step overboard convinced the glowing water is solid ground.

### Albersea Islands

A scattered archipelago in the northern Alrock. The islands are technically unclaimed—too far from Ve for easy governance, too remote for Vetral to care about. Various communities have settled here: refugees, pirates, hermits, and the occasional trading post.

#### Silver Grove

The largest Albersea island, named for the metallic-leafed trees that grow nowhere else. The leaves aren't actually silver, but they ring like bells when the wind blows. A small monastery maintains the grove, accepting pilgrims who wish to hear the "singing forest."

### Stonedrift

A navigational hazard and curiosity: a field of massive floating stones that drift through the central Alrock on unpredictable paths. The stones are porous volcanic rock, somehow light enough to float. Some are large enough to support vegetation. One supports a hermit's shack.

Ships navigate around Stonedrift carefully. The stones move slowly but unpredictably, and collisions are common. Some captains swear the stones deliberately block certain routes—as if they're herding ships toward something.

### Brightstone Mines

Underwater mines producing brightstone—crystal formations that emit brilliant, permanent light. The mines are deep, dangerous, and entirely triton-controlled. Vetral sells brightstone sparingly, keeping prices astronomical.

The stones are fragile as glass and must be harvested delicately. Broken brightstone goes dark permanently. This has led to elaborate underwater mining techniques and a lucrative smuggling trade in "cracked bright"—damaged stones that still glow faintly.

### Sunshatter Palace

A structure of impossible geometry hovering above the waves, home to a being called the Seahorse King—supposedly a god from another plane of existence. The Palace is the only place this entity can survive in Alaria; something about the intersection of sea, sky, and otherworldly geometry keeps it anchored to reality.

The Seahorse King grants audiences to those who reach the Palace, offering cryptic prophecies and occasionally material aid. What it wants in return is unclear. Visitors report that the interior of the Palace exists in more dimensions than the exterior suggests.

## Avalon

Tags: region, state, ve, theocracy, time-magic

The heartland of Ve's time-magic theocracy, where the Grand Imperial Ecclesiarch has sat unblinking upon the throne for generations, seeing futures that guide every aspect of Temptari life. Avalon is a land of rolling grasslands and ancient forests, temperate and fertile, ruled by priests who declare children's destinies before they can walk.

### Geography

Avalon occupies central-western Ve, bounded by natural features that make its borders feel ordained:

**Boundaries:**
- **North**: Tukiwood and the plains of Sestros
- **East**: The Widebarrow Mountains and Dern
- **South**: Promisewood descending toward Chimea
- **West**: Munari Inlet and the open sea

The terrain is gentler than surrounding regions—rolling hills, broad river valleys, and mixed forests that provide timber without overwhelming the grasslands. The Honor River winds through the center, its banks supporting the densest population.

### Tarolin (Capital)

The seat of the Grand Imperial Ecclesiarch sits where the Honor River bends through the heart of Avalon. Tarolin is both capital and pilgrimage site, its central temple-palace housing the throne where the Ecclesiarch has sat, unblinking, for longer than anyone can remember.

The city is organized in concentric rings around the temple. The innermost ring houses the Solum Impervium—the Ecclesiarch's administrative hand—and the highest priests. Each successive ring holds lesser religious officials, then merchants and craftsmen, then the common faithful. Movement between rings requires permission from the appropriate authorities, who consult the Ecclesiarch's pronouncements to determine who may pass.

Tarolin's population approaches 40,000, making it Ve's largest city outside Shyona. Pilgrims swell this number during holy seasons, when the faithful come to hear the Ecclesiarch's pronouncements about the coming year.

### The Forests

Four major forests define Avalon's landscape:

**Goldwood** lies in the west, between the settled heartland and Munari Inlet. The trees here have distinctive golden-yellow bark that seems to glow in afternoon light. The forest is considered sacred to the aspect of time governing autumn and endings. Pilgrims visit to contemplate mortality.

**Pathanul** spreads across the northern reaches, a transitional forest between Avalon's heartland and the Sestran border. The trees are older here, and the priests say this is where time moves slowest in Avalon—minutes pass while hours elapse elsewhere. Whether this is literally true or theological metaphor, travelers report feeling disoriented in Pathanul's depths.

**Promisewood** dominates the south, a vast forest stretching toward the Widebarrow Mountains. The name refers to the promises made to children during their Declarations—the forest is where those declared for forestry, hunting, or druidic paths spend their training decades. Deep Promisewood is off-limits to casual visitors.

**Shorolyn Forest** covers the eastern highlands where Avalon meets Dern. Logging operations work its edges; the interior remains wild.

### The Honor River System

The **Honor River** rises in the eastern highlands and flows westward through Avalon's heart, eventually emptying into Munari Inlet. Its valley contains the kingdom's best farmland and most of its population.

**Honor Creek** branches northeast from the main river, draining the Pathanul region. The creek's waters are said to reveal glimpses of the future to those who drink from certain pools—though the priests warn that unguided visions bring madness more often than wisdom.

**Honor Moss** is the marshy region where the river slows near Tarolin, spreading into wetlands thick with reeds and waterfowl. The Moss produces medicinal herbs used in time-magic rituals.

**Pale Run** flows through the southern forests, eventually joining the river systems that drain toward Chimea.

### Ismail (Port City)

Where the Honor River empties into Munari Inlet stands Ismail, Avalon's window to the world. The city of perhaps 12,000 serves as the kingdom's primary port—nearly everything that enters or leaves Avalon by sea passes through Ismail's harbor.

The city sits at a natural chokepoint. The Honor River narrows as it approaches the coast, and Ismail controls both banks. Warehouses line the waterfront, storing goods moving between river barges and oceangoing vessels. The textile trade dominates—bolts of Goldwood-dyed cloth, time-touched ritual implements, and agricultural products flow outward, while metal goods, exotic materials, and foreign luxuries flow in.

Ismail's character differs from inland Avalon. The constant flow of foreigners—sailors, merchants, travelers—dilutes the theocracy's grip. The priests maintain temples and enforce the major observances, but Ismail's residents are more worldly than their rural cousins. Declarations still govern local children's lives, but visitors operate under looser rules, and the commerce-minded locals have learned to accommodate difference.

The harbor master, always a priest of high standing, balances religious duty against commercial necessity. Ships carrying forbidden goods (certain magical items, materials the Ecclesiarch has proscribed) are turned away. Ships carrying merely unusual cargo are taxed and monitored. The Ecclesiarch presumably foresees what passes through his port; the harbor master acts accordingly.

### Munari Inlet

The western coast curves around Munari Inlet, a protected natural harbor that makes Ismail possible. The inlet is named for a saint of the Ecclesiarch's faith—a priest who allegedly foresaw a great storm and evacuated the coast before it struck. The waters are calm, the sailing relatively safe, and the Temptari consider the inlet blessed.

Fishing villages dot the inlet's shores beyond Ismail, their catches supplementing the grain-and-meat diet of inland Avalon. The fishermen worship as faithfully as anyone, though their prayers focus on weather and tides rather than the abstractions that occupy Tarolin's theologians.

### Karahoroz

Avalon's eastern city, Karahoroz sits where the Honor River approaches Dern. It serves as administrative center for the eastern fiefdoms and as a trading hub with the mountain states. The city's priests maintain close ties with Dern—the mountain kingdom has its own traditions, but respects Avalon's theocracy enough to cooperate on border matters.

### Society

Life in Avalon follows patterns laid down generations ago by the Ecclesiarch's visions. At age eight, every child is brought before the local priest for their **Declaration**—a pronouncement of what their life will hold. Farmers' children are declared farmers. Soldiers' children might be declared soldiers, or might be declared for entirely different paths if the priest sees different futures.

The Declaration is final. Fighting one's Declaration is possible but brings social ostracism and religious condemnation. Most Temptari accept their fates—the Ecclesiarch sees truly, the priests interpret correctly, and individual desires are less important than cosmic order.

Partners are similarly assigned. The priests determine which unions will produce the children Avalon needs, and marriages are arranged accordingly. The system usually works. When it doesn't—when couples are miserable, when children are born outside assigned partnerships—the failures are attributed to corruption among minor priests rather than flaws in the system itself.

### Why It Matters

Avalon's time-magic tradition produces the most skilled temporal practitioners on Ve. Their military is tiny but devastating—soldiers trained from childhood in time manipulation, capable of knowing where attacks will land before they're launched. No neighbor has successfully invaded Avalon in recorded history.

The theocracy also provides stability. The Ecclesiarch's visions prevent famines (fields are planted where harvests will succeed), disasters (buildings are constructed where earthquakes won't strike), and most conflicts (problems are addressed before they grow). Life in Avalon is predictable, safe, and thoroughly controlled.

Whether this is paradise or prison depends on whether you trust the Ecclesiarch's sight—and whether your Declaration matched what you wanted from life.

## Belanora

Tags: region, hills, geography, ve

A rugged hill country along the western edge of Meadow Sound, separating the coastal waters from the interior jungles. The Belanora hills rise abruptly from the lowlands, their eastern faces forming dramatic cliffs that overlook Belanorn Bay and the sound beyond.

### Geography

The Belanora hills run roughly north-south for perhaps sixty miles, reaching elevations of several hundred feet above the surrounding terrain. The western slopes descend gradually into dense jungle, their ridges forested with hardwoods distinct from the lowland vegetation. The eastern slopes are steeper, in places nearly vertical where the hills meet the water.

The hills create a natural barrier between the Misery River watershed and Meadow Sound. Only a few passes allow easy transit between the interior and the coast, making Belanora strategically important despite its sparse population.

### Character

Unlike the grief-soaked jungle to the west, Belanora feels merely melancholic. The Misery River's influence doesn't penetrate the hills with the same intensity—the elevation and the rocky substrate seem to filter it somewhat. Residents describe the mood as "thoughtful rather than despairing."

The hills themselves are beautiful in a subdued way. Morning mists cling to the valleys. Wildflowers bloom in brief, colorful bursts during the wet season. The views from the eastern ridges—looking out over Belanorn Bay and Meadow Sound—are genuinely stunning, even if observers find themselves contemplating loss and regret while admiring them.

### Inhabitants

Belanora has long served as a refuge for those unwilling to live fully under any established authority. Outlaws, exiles, deserters, and hermits find homes in the hill country's scattered settlements. No formal government exists. Communities police themselves through reputation and the understanding that everyone here has reasons for being hard to find.

The population is small and dispersed. A few hundred people at most occupy the entire region, living in isolated homesteads or tiny villages of a dozen families. They trade with Tearfall and the other coastal settlements, offering hill products—timber, medicinal plants, small game—in exchange for salt, metal goods, and news.

Relations with Locquine are complicated. The pixies occasionally send emissaries into Belanora, seeking things the hill-dwellers can provide—metals they don't work, foods they don't grow. These exchanges happen according to rules the pixies set and the hill-folk have learned to follow, mostly. Belanora has lost people to Locquine's unpredictable violence, but has also profited from the trade when it goes well.

### The Hill Roads

A network of trails winds through Belanora, connecting the scattered settlements and linking the coast to the interior. These paths are unmarked and unmapped—knowing them requires local guidance or years of personal experience. Outsiders who attempt to navigate Belanora without help typically get lost, sometimes fatally.

The most important route is the **Mourner's Path**, which connects Tearfall on Belanorn Bay to the edge of Locquine territory. Traders and explorers use this trail to approach the pixie city-state while minimizing their time on the Misery River itself. It takes three days on foot, winding through the hill passes before descending into the jungle.

### Why It Matters

Belanora is the gateway to Locquine. Anyone seeking to trade with the pixies, explore the Misery River watershed, or investigate the source of the river's grief must pass through these hills. The hill-folk have leveraged this position into a modest economy of guiding, provisioning, and information-selling.

The region also serves as a buffer. Whatever has afflicted the Misery River watershed, the Belanora hills seem to contain it. The melancholy doesn't spread beyond the hills to the same degree. Shyonan authorities have occasionally proposed establishing outposts in Belanora to better monitor the interior, but the hill-folk's resistance and the region's difficult terrain have prevented any serious efforts.

## Belanorn Bay

Tags: bay, geography, ve, meadow sound

A sheltered bay at the western end of Meadow Sound, where the Misery River deposits its waters into the sea. The bay serves as the primary maritime access point for the southern jungles of Ve, though the river's influence makes it an uneasy place.

### Geography

Belanorn Bay cuts into the coast where the Belanora hills meet the jungle lowlands. The eastern and southern shores are steep—the Belanora hills descend sharply to the waterline, creating dramatic cliffs in places. The western and northern shores are gentler, where river sediment has built up over millennia.

The bay is relatively deep, capable of accommodating large vessels. Several natural harbors indent the coastline, though none have developed into significant ports. The Misery River enters at the bay's northwestern corner, spreading into a marshy delta before the waters mix.

### The Diluted Grief

The Misery River's psychological effects weaken significantly in Belanorn Bay. The salt water of Meadow Sound seems to dilute whatever the river carries. Sailors in the bay report only mild melancholy—nothing compared to the crushing despair of the river itself.

This has made the bay's mouth the only safe anchorage for ships approaching Locquine territory. Traders who wish to deal with the pixies typically anchor in the bay and travel upriver by small boat, limiting their exposure to the concentrated effects.

Even so, the bay's waters aren't entirely normal. Fish caught here taste faintly bitter, and long-term residents of the coastal settlements report vivid dreams of events they never witnessed—fragments of other people's memories, ancient and sorrowful.

### Settlements

A handful of small fishing villages cling to the bay's shores, populated by hardy souls willing to trade psychological comfort for the bay's abundant catches. These communities tend toward the stoic and laconic—people here don't smile much, but they don't complain either. Depression runs high, but so does a peculiar resilience.

The largest settlement, **Tearfall**, occupies a sheltered harbor on the eastern shore. Perhaps two hundred people live there, supporting themselves through fishing, limited trade with upriver communities, and serving as guides for the occasional expedition into Locquine territory. Tearfall's residents have developed rituals to manage the bay's influence: communal singing each evening, mandatory rest days, and a tradition of sharing meals that seems to ward off the worst of the isolation.

### Trade

Belanorn Bay sees little commercial traffic. The Misery River makes the interior inaccessible to conventional trade, and the bay itself offers nothing that can't be found more easily elsewhere. What trade does occur usually involves:

- **Pixie artifacts** from Locquine, sold through intermediaries who've survived dealing with the insane fae
- **Rare jungle specimens** gathered from the river delta's unique ecology
- **Misery water** itself, bottled and sold to alchemists and researchers studying its properties

The artifacts command the highest prices. Weavings from Locquine that show fragments of possible futures are worth fortunes to the right buyers. Most traders consider the risks—both physical and psychological—too great, which keeps supply low and prices astronomical.

### Navigation

Entering Belanorn Bay from Meadow Sound requires careful navigation. Sandbars shift seasonally as the Misery River deposits and redistributes sediment. The Belanora cliffs on the eastern approach can create treacherous currents. Local pilots from Tearfall offer their services, though finding them requires knowing where to look.

The bay's waters are calmer than Meadow Sound, protected from the worst weather by the surrounding hills. This makes it a popular refuge during storms—ships will anchor in Belanorn Bay rather than risk the sound's choppier waters, accepting the melancholic dreams as a fair trade for safety.

## Blackpits

Tags: swamp, geography, ve

A sprawling swamp in the north-central Dygon Beastlands, where dark water pools beneath a broken canopy and the dead do not always stay dead. The Blackpits occupy the lowest ground in the region—a basin where runoff from the surrounding jungle collects in stagnant pools of water so dark it reflects nothing.

The swamp stretches roughly sixty miles east to west and forty miles north to south, fed by seasonal flooding from a dozen streams that drain into the basin but never seem to drain out. Where the water goes is unclear; Ix'Meglyakuk legends speak of underground rivers, of water that descends to feed something far below.

### The Waters

The Blackpits take their name from the water itself. The pools are opaque—not merely dark but *lightless*, absorbing rather than reflecting. A torch held over the water illuminates nothing below the surface. Divers report that visibility drops to zero within inches of submersion.

**Composition:** The water is heavily saturated with tannins from decaying vegetation, iron compounds from the soil, and something else—a substance alchemists have failed to identify. It's not poisonous to drink, merely foul-tasting. Prolonged skin contact causes temporary numbness. Wounds exposed to it heal slowly and scar badly.

**Depth:** Most pools are shallow—waist-deep or less—but the "pits" proper are different. Scattered throughout the swamp are sinkholes of unknown depth, their edges indistinguishable from the surrounding shallows until you step into one. The Ix'Meglyakuk mark the known pits with specific warnings, but new ones open periodically, and the old markers sometimes move.

**What Lives There:** The waters host things adapted to lightless hunting. Giant eels that sense vibration. Crustaceans with crushing claws and no eyes. Fish with bioluminescent lures that draw prey close before striking. And the remains of things that drowned—preserved by the water's unusual chemistry, sometimes rising again.

### The Preserved Dead

Bodies that enter the Blackpits do not decay normally. The water's composition arrests decomposition, leaving corpses preserved for years or decades. This would be merely macabre if it stopped there.

It doesn't.

**The Risen:** Periodically—most commonly during the wet season, when water levels peak—preserved corpses animate. They rise from the pools and walk, driven by something that isn't quite undeath and isn't quite life. The Ix'Meglyakuk call them *Thekk-Morru*, which translates roughly to "the ones who forgot they died."

The Risen are not intelligent. They don't hunt or fight with purpose. They simply... move, wandering the swamp until they encounter the living, at which point they attack with whatever reflexes remain. Most are easily avoided or destroyed. But the sheer number of bodies the Blackpits have accumulated over millennia means a wet-season rising can involve hundreds of Thekk-Morru emerging simultaneously.

**Origins Unknown:** What causes the animation is debated. Some scholars propose a unique necromantic phenomenon tied to the water's composition. Others believe the Blackpits sit on a weak point between the Material Plane and Malstaris, allowing shadow-energy to seep through. The Ix'Meglyakuk have a simpler explanation: the swamp is hungry, and the Risen are its way of feeding.

### The Bone Beds

Beneath the water, the Blackpits hold a graveyard spanning epochs.

The swamp has been a natural trap for millions of years. Creatures wandered in and never left. Their bones accumulated, layer upon layer, creating beds of fossil remains preserved by the same chemistry that keeps corpses from rotting. These bone beds are visible in places where seasonal water recession exposes the underlying sediment—masses of skeletal remains, species layered atop species, a record of everything that ever died here.

**Paleontological Value:** Scholars would kill for access to the bone beds. The Blackpits contain specimens found nowhere else—transitional forms, extinct megafauna, creatures that predate the current geological era. A single expedition could rewrite understanding of Ve's ancient history.

**Practical Barriers:** The Ix'Meglyakuk prohibit excavation. The waters are dangerous. The Risen attack intruders. And something about disturbing the bone beds seems to trigger increased Thekk-Morru activity, as if the swamp notices when its dead are molested.

### The Ix'Meglyakuk of the Blackpits

A few tribes make their home in the swamp, occupying the scattered patches of higher ground that remain above water year-round. These *Thekk-uli* (swamp-dwellers) are distinct from their jungle-dwelling kin.

**Adaptation:** Thekk-uli have developed webbed feet and hands, allowing them to swim through the dark waters with uncanny ease. Their scales have darkened to near-black, providing camouflage. They hunt by sound and vibration, their eyes almost vestigial in the lightless pools.

**The Risen-Hunters:** Thekk-uli specialize in controlling the Thekk-Morru. They've developed techniques for putting the Risen down quickly, for predicting when risings will occur, and—controversially—for directing the Risen against enemies. Other Ix'Meglyakuk view this last practice as abomination. The Thekk-uli view it as survival.

**Isolation:** Like the Blyss tribes, the Thekk-uli have minimal contact with the outside world. They attend no gatherings, trade with no outsiders, and respond to intrusion with violence. Their numbers are unknown; estimates suggest perhaps two thousand individuals scattered across the swamp.

### Locations

#### The Central Pit

The largest sinkhole in the Blackpits—a near-perfect circle roughly a quarter-mile across, filled with water that testing ropes have never found the bottom of. The Ix'Meglyakuk consider it sacred and forbidden. They do not approach it, do not fish near it, and kill outsiders who try to investigate.

Local legend holds that the Central Pit connects directly to the underworld—that the water descends through miles of stone to somewhere else entirely. Some stories name this destination as Malstaris. Others speak of a buried city older than life on Ve. The Thekk-uli say only that the Central Pit is *Thekk-Gor*, "the throat," and refuse to elaborate.

**The Sounds:** Those who've camped near the Central Pit—against all advice—report sounds from below. Not the gurgling of water or the calls of swamp creatures, but rhythmic pulses, like breathing or heartbeats, slow and vast. The sounds are clearest just before dawn.

#### The Strangler's Reach

A peninsula of relatively dry ground extending into the swamp's northern section, where a grove of massive trees has developed a unique hunting strategy. The trees—species unknown, found nowhere else—have root systems that extend into the water for hundreds of feet, sensitive to vibration. When prey wades near, the roots rise, wrap, and drag.

The Strangler's Reach provides the only navigable path through the northern Blackpits, assuming travelers stay exactly on the central ridge where the roots cannot reach. Straying left or right by more than a few feet means being dragged under by gripping tendrils.

The Thekk-uli use the Reach as a defensive barrier. Enemies attempting to approach from the north must traverse a quarter-mile of trees that actively hunt them, while the Thekk-uli wait on the far side to deal with survivors.

#### Thekk-Valori

The largest Thekk-uli settlement, built on an island of raised ground in the swamp's center. Perhaps five hundred lizardfolk live here, in structures of woven reeds and preserved wood, raising their young and training the Risen-hunters who keep the surrounding waters clear.

Thekk-Valori is the closest thing the Blackpits have to a capital. The island hosts the tribal councils that make collective decisions, the breeding grounds for the community's utahraptors (adapted to swimming rather than land-running), and the bone-shrines where the Thekk-uli honor their ancestors.

Outsiders are not welcome. The few who've been allowed to visit describe a community living in uncomfortable intimacy with death—Risen corpses stored in underwater cages for later use, children playing games that involve navigating past restrained Thekk-Morru, elders whose own bodies have begun the partial preservation that comes from lifelong immersion in the black waters.

### Threats and Opportunities

**The Bone Bed Expedition:** A wealthy collector in Shyona will pay a fortune for specimens from the Blackpits bone beds. Specifically, they want a complete skeleton of a *Thyrak-ossi*—a creature mentioned in ancient texts but never documented, supposedly preserved somewhere in the central swamp. The collector provides equipment, guides to the swamp's edge, and promises of wealth. What they don't provide is Thekk-uli permission, knowledge of the Risen, or any realistic plan for surviving the attempt.

**The Central Pit:** Something has changed at the Central Pit. The sounds are louder. The water level is dropping. The Thekk-uli are scared—scared enough to have sent a messenger to the outer tribes for the first time in generations. They're asking for help. They won't say with what.

**Risen Overflow:** The last wet season saw the largest Thekk-Morru rising in living memory—thousands of corpses animating simultaneously, spilling out of the swamp into the surrounding jungle. Most were destroyed or wandered off to collapse, but the event has the Ix'Meglyakuk worried. Something is changing in the Blackpits. The risings are getting worse, and no one knows why.

**The Thekk-uli War:** A faction within the Thekk-uli has begun using Risen against rival tribes outside the swamp. The practice is spreading—and other Ix'Meglyakuk are organizing to stop it. The swamp-dwellers are outnumbered, but they control the Blackpits, and anyone trying to assault Thekk-Valori will have to cross miles of territory where the dead rise to defend their masters.

## Blisterswamp

Tags: swamp, geography, ve, krell

A caustic wetland near the western edge of the Krell Lands, where geothermal activity creates bubbling pools of acidic water that nothing—not even the Krell—can tolerate. The swamp marks the border between Krell territory and Chimea's eastern claims.

### Geography

Blisterswamp occupies a shallow depression roughly fifteen miles across, where underground heat sources interact with surface water to create an environment hostile to most life. The "blisters" that give the swamp its name are bubbling pools of superheated, acidic water that can strip flesh from bone in minutes.

Steam drifts constantly across the swamp, limiting visibility and creating an eerie, shifting landscape. The water ranges from merely scalding near the edges to immediately lethal near the thermal vents. Solid ground is rare, and what exists is often caked with mineral deposits that crumble underfoot.

The swamp's western edge bleeds into the North Suki jungle, creating a natural boundary that neither Chimea nor the Krell have interest in crossing.

### Why Nothing Lives Here

The combination of heat, acid, and mineral toxicity makes Blisterswamp essentially lifeless. No fish swim in its waters. No plants grow along its shores. Even insects avoid the steam plumes. The few creatures adapted to such environments—extremophile microorganisms, certain heat-resistant arthropods—aren't prey anything else would want.

This makes Blisterswamp unique in the Krell Lands: a genuinely empty zone. The insects don't enter because there's nothing to eat and the environment would kill them. Humans don't enter because the environment would kill them faster.

### The Jaipon Ruins

The most significant feature near Blisterswamp is the ruined fortress-city of Jaipon, visible on the swamp's eastern edge where the caustic waters give way to regular jungle. The city's founders apparently chose this location deliberately—the swamp served as a natural moat against threats from the east.

The strategy worked until the Krell came from the north instead.

Today, Jaipon's towers rise above the jungle canopy, visible from miles away. Its walls still stand. Its gates remain closed. No one has entered and returned in over a century, and the combination of Krell patrols and caustic swamp makes the approach extremely dangerous.

### Border Zone

Blisterswamp effectively marks the Chimea-Krell border in this region. Neither side patrols it—there's nothing to patrol. Occasionally, Chimean scouts skirt the western edge to observe Krell movements; occasionally, Krell workers investigate the eastern edge for reasons unclear to observers.

The swamp's impassability creates a natural peace. Chimea doesn't worry about Krell incursions from this direction, and the Krell apparently don't consider the acidic wasteland worth expanding into.

### Crossing Blisterswamp

It's possible, barely, to cross the swamp rather than going around it. The route requires:

- Detailed knowledge of which areas are merely dangerous versus immediately fatal
- Heat-resistant equipment (boots, gloves, face protection)
- Alchemical treatments to neutralize acid exposure
- Perfect timing—crossing during thermal surges is suicide
- Speed—the longer you're in the swamp, the worse the cumulative damage

A few expeditions have used this route to reach Jaipon from Chimean territory, avoiding the Krell-patrolled approaches from the north. Most failed. The successful ones report that the crossing took hours, cost them equipment, and left survivors with chemical burns that took months to heal.

Why bother? Because whatever Jaipon contains is supposedly worth it. The fortress-city was the seat of a confederacy that once rivaled Theoron in wealth. If its vaults remain intact, the treasures inside could make a small army rich.

### The Steam Prophets

Local legend speaks of figures who walk through Blisterswamp unharmed—robed shapes that appear in the steam, deliver cryptic messages to those nearby, then vanish. Chimean border guards have reported these sightings; so have Krell-watchers from Yuki.

Most dismiss the stories as heat-induced hallucination. A few scholars theorize the geothermal activity has created some kind of planar weakness—the steam serving as a medium for communication from elsewhere. No one has investigated seriously, because investigating would require entering the swamp.

## Blood Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, ve, chimea

The southernmost reach of the Widebarrow Mountains, the Blood Mountains take their name from the deep crimson iron ore veins that streak through the rock—and from the blood spilled extracting them. What should be Chimea's greatest treasure has become its most persistent drain.

### Geography

The Blood Mountains rise sharply from the jungle floor, their peaks permanently dusted with red-tinged snow where iron particles have accumulated over millennia. The range runs roughly northeast to southwest, separating the Suki Jungle from the plains approaching Avalon. Below the surface, the mountains are honeycombed with natural caverns, ancient mines, and tunnels dug by inhabitants who arrived long before Chimea's legions.

The western slopes descend gradually into Chimean-controlled territory. The eastern slopes drop sharply into the Deep Warren—the domain of the Lyzine spider-folk of Mez, whose tunnels extend beneath the entire Widebarrow range.

### The Aureum

Before Chimea, the Blood Mountains belonged to the Aureum—a dwarven culture that broke away from their underground kin after a devastating shadereaver incursion nearly wiped out their population. The Aureum developed an obsessive relationship with sunlight, engineering elaborate systems of mirrors and crystal lenses to illuminate their underground settlements. They discovered how to extract and store liquid sunlight itself, which became central to their culture and magic.

The Aureum kingdom lasted over a thousand years, their mirror-cities legendary even among other dwarven peoples. They were wealthy, well-defended, and utterly unprepared for what Chimea became.

### The Conquest (3,070-3,150 SD)

After the War of Bone ended in mutual exhaustion around 3,070 SD—creating the undead-haunted Boneswamps that still separate Chimea from Dern—the Empire could no longer expand northward. So it turned its attention to the Aureum.

The conquest took eighty years. Not a single campaign but a century of economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and periodic military action. Chimea controlled the trade routes. Chimea poisoned the alliances. When the Aureum kingdom finally fell around 3,150 SD, it collapsed from exhaustion as much as force.

Three generations have passed since then. The Aureum remember every year.

### Life Under Occupation

The conquered dwarves are subjects, not citizens. They pay higher taxes. They cannot own weapons larger than utility knives. They are forbidden from military service—a restriction that simultaneously insults their honor and prevents them from gaining combat training. Their mirror-cities were dismantled "for safety," the crystal lenses confiscated for imperial use.

Resistance simmers constantly. Sabotaged equipment. Collapsed tunnels. Imperial officials who simply vanish. The rebellion has no single leader—cells operate independently, communicating through methods the Quiet Office hasn't cracked. The Empire's brutal suppression creates martyrs faster than it eliminates threats.

### The Bloodlings

The Aureum were not the first inhabitants. Deep in the mountain's heart, where even dwarven miners feared to dig, the Bloodlings have dwelt since before recorded history.

These pale, translucent-skinned gnomes maintain an obsessive aristocracy based on ancestral bloodline purity. Their genealogies trace back thousands of years—elaborate family trees documenting which lineages carry the purest connection to the "First Bite," the legendary moment of their transformation into what they are now. Status in Bloodling society depends entirely on proving your blood is more ancient, more pure than your rivals.

They are vampiric. They emerge at night to prey on workers. They control the deepest and richest mines—the ones that would make Chimea truly wealthy—and they defend them with coordinated ferocity. Mining crews enter the deep shafts knowing some won't return.

### The Three-Front War

Chimea faces an impossible situation in the Blood Mountains:
- **Extract resources** from mines that the Bloodlings consider their larder
- **Suppress resistance** from Aureum who dream of liberation
- **Maintain occupation** with military force that could be better used elsewhere

The Second Legion—roughly five,000 soldiers—is permanently deployed here. Replacements arrive constantly. The costs never stop. Every ruby, every iron ingot that reaches the capital in Chimus is stained with blood.

### Settlements

**Gilla** — The primary administrative center, processing ore and coordinating Second Legion patrols. Imperial officials here have the highest mortality rate outside active war zones.

**Jenolan Caves** — A mining community built into the eastern cavern systems, uncomfortably close to Bloodling territory. Incursions are common; the population turns over frequently.

**Jindivick, Gorokan, Hell Creek, Bumbaldry** — Extraction settlements deep in the range. Life is hard. Bloodling attacks are routine. Aureum resistance makes every night uncertain.

**Courangra, Narara, Boggabilla** — Smaller mining villages along the jungle-mountain border, where the Second Legion's patrols thin and the jungle's predators add to the dangers.

### Recent Developments

The Empire's position has grown more precarious. Colonial adventures in New Chimea drain resources. Emperor Morrigan's health is failing. And whispers suggest both the Bloodlings and the Aureum are planning something unprecedented.

A Bloodling emissary has approached the Imperial Court—the first formal contact in centuries—with an offer of peace in exchange for something unspecified. What could vampiric gnomes want badly enough to negotiate?

And among the Aureum, a coordinated uprising is being planned. Not spontaneous violence but organized revolution. Someone is smuggling weapons. Someone is coordinating the cells. The Quiet Office knows something is coming but cannot find the leadership.

The Blood Mountains are about to become much bloodier.

## Bloodwood Forest

A forest within Shyona.

TODO

## Blyss

Tags: jungle, geography, ve, dragon-territory

The eastern reaches of the Dygon Beastlands, where the jungle grows thickest and the canopy blocks nearly all sunlight. Blyss is the domain of the green dragon Draphilir, and her presence has shaped the region in ways both obvious and subtle. This is the deepest, darkest part of the Beastlands—and one of the most dangerous places on Ve.

Blyss covers roughly fifteen thousand square miles, stretching from the Bay of Monkeys in the north to the approaches of Disaster Passage in the south. Its western edge bleeds into the central Beastlands without clear demarcation; locals know they've entered Blyss when the light dims, the air thickens, and the jungle's character shifts from merely dangerous to actively hostile.

### Character of the Jungle

The canopy in Blyss forms an almost unbroken ceiling a hundred feet or more above the forest floor. Very little sunlight penetrates. The understory exists in perpetual twilight, navigable only by those whose eyes have adapted or who carry their own light sources—which attracts predators.

**The vegetation is different here.** Plants in Blyss have evolved for low-light conditions: pale leaves, bioluminescent fungi, vines that climb toward any light source with disturbing speed. The trees themselves are massive—trunk circumferences measured in tens of feet, root systems that extend hundreds of yards, bark hard enough to turn steel blades.

**Sound travels strangely.** The dense growth absorbs noise in some places and amplifies it in others. Experienced guides learn to read the acoustic landscape, knowing which clearings echo and which swallow sound entirely. This unpredictability makes hunting and tracking difficult for outsiders—and easy for things adapted to exploit it.

**The air is thick and wet.** Humidity approaches saturation year-round. Metal rusts within days. Leather rots. Cloth mildews. Only the Ix'Meglyakuk have developed preservation techniques that work reliably in Blyss, and they don't share them.

### Draphilir's Domain

The dragon Draphilir has claimed Blyss for over five centuries. Her influence pervades the region.

**The Green Rot:** Draphilir's breath weapon—a cloud of corrosive, spore-laden vapor—has been deployed enough times over the centuries that its effects linger. Certain areas of Blyss harbor permanent concentrations of the dragon's exhalations. These "rot pockets" accelerate decay dramatically; fresh meat becomes bone in hours, living tissue exposed to the vapors develops necrotic infections. The Ix'Meglyakuk mark rot pockets with specific warning signs and detour around them.

**Tribute Zones:** Draphilir demands regular tribute from Ix'Meglyakuk tribes whose territories overlap her domain. Every three months, designated offerings—meat, precious stones, interesting artifacts—must be left at specific clearings. The dragon collects these at her leisure. Tribes that fail to provide tribute are hunted. The system has operated for generations; no one living remembers a time before it.

**The Lair:** Draphilir's primary lair is somewhere in central Blyss, its exact location known only to a few Ix'Meglyakuk elders who maintain necessary contact with the dragon. By all accounts, it occupies a massive sinkhole where an underground river surfaces briefly before diving back beneath the jungle floor. The cavern system is extensive, flooded in places, and filled with centuries of accumulated treasure.

### The Ix'Meglyakuk of Blyss

Several tribes make their homes in Blyss, adapted to conditions that would kill outsiders. They are distinct from other Ix'Meglyakuk in several ways:

**Night-Adapted Eyes:** Generations in perpetual twilight have given Blyss tribes larger eyes, capable of seeing in near-total darkness. They find bright light painful and prefer to conduct any necessary dealings with outsiders at dawn or dusk.

**Rot Immunity:** Through some combination of exposure, diet, or deliberate modification, Blyss Ix'Meglyakuk are resistant to the Green Rot that permeates their homeland. They can pass through rot pockets that would kill others in minutes. This immunity is not transferable and attempts to reproduce it have failed.

**Isolation:** Blyss tribes have minimal contact with the outside world. They don't trade at the coastal hubs. They rarely attend tribal gatherings at Lizard's Maw. Other Ix'Meglyakuk consider them strange—touched by their dragon, changed by their environment, no longer quite the same species.

**The Silence Keepers:** One tribe in central Blyss—the *Thykkalu*—serves as Draphilir's designated intermediaries. They deliver her messages, enforce her tribute demands, and negotiate on her behalf when she deigns to communicate. In exchange, they receive protection and certain privileges within her territory. Other tribes resent them; the Thykkalu don't care.

### Locations

#### The Breathing Pools

A cluster of hot springs in eastern Blyss, where geothermal vents heat the water to near-boiling. Steam rises constantly, creating a microclimate of fog and warmth that cuts through the usual humidity. The pools "breathe"—water levels rise and fall in slow cycles that take hours to complete, as pressure builds and releases in the underground system.

The pools are sacred to local tribes, used for coming-of-age rituals and the treatment of certain illnesses. Outsiders are not welcome. The last expedition to reach the Breathing Pools—a Shyonan scholarly party in 3,289 SD—was found three weeks later, bones scattered across a wide area, their notes and specimens vanished.

#### The Fungal Gardens

An area in western Blyss where bioluminescent fungi have colonized several square miles of forest floor. At night (not that day and night differ much here), the gardens glow in shifting patterns of blue, green, and sickly yellow. The effect is beautiful from a distance. Up close, it's nauseating—the spores interfere with balance and perception, causing disorientation that builds over hours into full hallucinations.

The Ix'Meglyakuk harvest certain fungi from the gardens for medicinal and recreational purposes. They know which species are safe, which are poisonous, and which unlock visions that might be prophetic or might be the prelude to death. They do not explain the distinctions to outsiders.

#### The Swallowing Mire

A vast bog in southern Blyss where the boundary between land and water dissolves entirely. The Swallowing Mire extends for miles in every direction—a maze of stagnant pools, floating vegetation mats, and stretches of ground that look solid until you step on them. The water is dark, acidic, and home to things that pull prey under.

The mire marks the southern edge of Draphilir's claimed territory. Beyond it lies the transition zone between Blyss and the central Beastlands, and eventually the approaches to Disaster Passage. Crossing the mire is possible with guides; without them, it's suicide.

#### Draphilir's Graveyard

A clearing in central Blyss filled with the bones of creatures Draphilir has killed over the centuries. Dragon-sized skeletons lie alongside tyrannosaur remains, giant crocodilian bones, and the occasional humanoid. The dragon deposits carcasses here after feeding, creating a record of her hunts stretching back five hundred years.

For scholars, the Graveyard would be invaluable—a fossil record of Beastlands megafauna spanning centuries, plus whatever artifacts the dragon's victims carried. For treasure hunters, the temptation is even stronger: Draphilir doesn't bother recovering valuables from her kills, meaning the Graveyard is littered with the possessions of centuries' worth of failed adventurers.

The Graveyard is, of course, very close to Draphilir's lair. She visits often. The bones of would-be looters join the collection regularly.

### Threats and Opportunities

**The Rot Spreads:** The concentration of Green Rot in Blyss has been increasing for decades. Pockets that were once isolated are merging. Areas previously safe now require caution. Some Ix'Meglyakuk believe Draphilir is deliberately seeding new rot zones; others think the dragon's presence is simply accumulating over centuries. Either way, habitable territory is shrinking.

**Draphilir's Mood:** The dragon has been restless lately, hunting more frequently, demanding larger tributes. The Thykkalu claim she's preparing for something but won't say what. The most common speculation: she's girding for another war with her sibling Pyaganos. The second most common: she's preparing to expand her territory into the buffer zone.

**The Scholarly Expedition:** Despite the fate of the 3,289 expedition, Shyonan academics are planning another attempt to document Blyss's unique ecology. They're hiring guards, guides, and specialists in dragon negotiation. The pay is excellent. The survival rate for previous expeditions is not.

**What Lies Beneath:** The geothermal activity beneath the Breathing Pools hints at something larger—a volcanic system, perhaps, or something stranger. Local tribes tell stories of tunnels that descend into warmth and light, of a world beneath the world where the darkness gives way to fire. Whether these are myths, memories of actual expeditions, or warnings, the stories persist.

## Chimea

Tags: state, nation, jungle, empire

A hungry empire sprawling across southwestern Ve—its jungles stretch from the Blood Mountains to the Gulf of Chimea, its mines burrow into conquered Aureum territory, its colonies spread across distant Rimihuica. Chimea is built on expansion, exploitation, and relentless opportunism.

For full political details, see the [state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Chimea.md).

### The Suki Jungle

The dense tropical jungle that covers much of Chimea's territory, divided into three regions:

**West Suki** — Stretches from the Blood Mountains to the coast. The most settled region, with established roads and harvesting operations. Towns like Miltalie and Kargunyah anchor the interior.

**South Suki** — The southern interior, wilder but productive. The Tonyfall River runs through it, with Aldaville and Frowat controlling river traffic. The capital Chimus sits where the jungle opens into cultivated plains.

**North Suki** — Borders the Boneswamps and Dern. The most dangerous region—close to enemy territory and haunted by the undead. Settlements like Bowning, Kinglake, and Chatford watch the swamps nervously.

#### Boneswamps

A cursed swamp on the Chimea-Dern border, filled with the animated dead from the War of Bone (roughly 200 years ago). The bones of fallen Dernish and Chimean soldiers rise from the murky water, driven by residual hatred and the trauma of violent death. The skeletal warriors reenact their final battles, attacking any living creatures that enter their domain.

Neither nation claims the Boneswamps; both patrol their edges. The constant presence of undead makes this one of the most dangerous regions in Ve—and also the only reason Chimea and Dern aren't currently at war. The swamps serve as an impassable barrier.

#### Tonyfall River

The major river system running through South Suki, navigable for much of its length. Aldaville and Frowat control key points along its course. The river serves as the primary transportation route for jungle products heading to market.

### Blood Mountains

The northwestern mountain range, conquered from the Aureum dwarves roughly a century ago. Rich in rubies, iron, and copper—essential to Chimea's economy and a constant drain on its military.

The Aureum population resists assimilation; the Bloodlings (vampiric gnomes) control the deepest mines and emerge at night to prey on workers. Every gemstone that reaches Chimus is stained with blood.

For details on the Bloodlings, see the [gnome racial entry](../../races/Gnome.md#bloodlings-vampire-gnome).

#### Major Blood Mountain Settlements

- **Gilla** — Primary administrative center for the occupation, coordinates the Second Legion
- **Jenolan Caves** — Mining community built into cavern systems
- **Jindivick, Gorokan, Hell Creek, Bumbaldry** — Extraction settlements deep in the range
- **Courangra, Narara, Boggabilla** — Smaller mining villages on the jungle-mountain border

### Settlements

**Chimus** (★ Capital, ~40,000) — Imperial capital in the southern plains, built for display with broad avenues and marble government buildings. Ve's second-largest city.

**Old Tyabb** (■ City, ~15,000) — Gateway to New Chimea. Staging ground for colonial expeditions—soldiers, supplies, convicts, and "redemption colonists" pass through here on their way to Port Vincent and the ships. A city perpetually saying goodbye.

**Port Vincent** (▲ Town) — Primary western port on Traitor Bay, departure point for colonial ships.

**Jungle Towns:**
- Miltalie, Kargunyah, Nugent — Interior anchor settlements
- Aldaville, Frowat — River towns on the Tonyfall

### Adjacent Waters

**Traitor Bay** — Named for a civil war naval battle where captains switched sides. Now Chimea's primary western port, though the name remains uncomfortable.

**Gulf of Chimea** — The southwestern coastal indentation, less developed than Traitor Bay but important for local fishing and trade.

## Chitin Cove

Tags: cove, geography, ve, krell, coast

The only safe landing point on the Krell Lands coast, Chitin Cove is named for the cast-off exoskeletons that wash up on its beaches—debris from Krell molting cycles carried downstream and deposited by coastal currents. Ships occasionally anchor here to trade with the survivors who've learned to live at the edge of insect territory.

### Geography

Chitin Cove occupies a natural harbor on the eastern coast of Ve, where a river mouth creates a protected anchorage sheltered from the worst weather. The cove is roughly two miles across, with sandy beaches giving way to jungle on three sides.

The beaches are distinctive. Krell chitin—pale, iridescent fragments ranging from fingernail-sized to shield-sized—accumulates in drifts along the waterline. The exoskeletons wash downstream from the hive territories, accumulating where the currents slow. During certain seasons, the beaches are more chitin than sand.

The jungle presses close to the waterline, but the Krell don't venture to the coast here. The cove lies far enough from major hive territories that scout presence is minimal, and something about the salt air or the water seems to discourage their approach.

### The Coast-Dwellers

A scattered population survives along the Chitin Cove shoreline—perhaps two hundred people in shifting family groups who've built their existence around mobility, observation, and knowing when to run.

These coast-dwellers are descendants of fishing communities that predated the Consumption, supplemented by refugees who reached the coast during the fall of the old kingdoms. They live in temporary structures that can be abandoned within hours, own nothing they can't carry, and maintain constant watch on the jungle treeline.

Their survival strategy is simple: never stay in one place long enough for the Krell to notice, never accumulate enough resources to be worth swarming, and always have boats ready to flee into the water if necessary. The approach has worked for two centuries.

### Trade

Chitin Cove's value lies in what washes up on its beaches. Krell exoskeletons have alchemical and industrial applications:

- **Chitin powder** — Used in potions, armor treatments, and certain enchantments
- **Large plates** — Can be worked into lightweight armor or decorative items
- **Specialized organs** — Occasionally intact glands wash up, valuable for specific alchemical processes
- **Intelligence** — The coast-dwellers observe Krell behavior patterns and sell information to Yuki and others

Ships from Shyona, Chimea, and occasionally more distant ports anchor in the cove to trade. They bring food, tools, and luxuries that the coast-dwellers can't produce; they leave with chitin, information, and occasional passengers seeking escape.

The trade is irregular—perhaps a dozen ships per year—but profitable enough to sustain the coast-dweller economy. Prices are negotiated on the beach, payment in goods rather than currency, and transactions completed within hours. No one lingers in Chitin Cove.

### Dangers

The cove is safer than the interior, but "safer" is relative:

**Krell scouts** — Patrols occasionally reach the coast. The coast-dwellers have learned to read the signs and evacuate before contact, but mistakes happen.

**Pirates** — Ships visiting Chitin Cove sometimes decide taking is easier than trading. The coast-dwellers have little defense against armed crews.

**The jungle** — Non-Krell threats persist: predators, poisonous creatures, and the general hazards of tropical wilderness.

**The sea** — Storms, currents, and the creatures of the Sea of Fools all threaten those who flee by water.

### The Chitin Harvest

Twice yearly, the coast-dwellers conduct organized harvests—gathering the accumulated exoskeletons for trade. These events draw the entire population to the beaches for several days of collection, sorting, and processing.

The harvests are dangerous periods. Concentrated activity attracts attention, and the Krell seem to sense when their cast-off shells are being disturbed. Scout presence increases. The coast-dwellers post extra watchers and keep boats ready throughout.

Despite the risks, the harvests are essential. They provide the bulk of trade goods that sustain the coast-dweller economy through the year. Missing a harvest means poverty; mishandling one means death.

### Reaching Chitin Cove

**By sea** — The most common approach. Navigation is straightforward; the cove is well-charted and visible from offshore. The main danger is the Sea of Fools, whose poisoned waters lie not far to the south.

**Overland** — Possible but rarely attempted. The route passes through active Krell territory or the Raptor Hills, neither of which is casual travel. Expeditions sometimes exit via Chitin Cove after missions in the interior, arranging pickup by pre-positioned ships.

**By air** — The astral currents don't reach this far east, but smaller flying vessels occasionally make the journey. The coast-dwellers view aerial visitors with suspicion—anyone with that kind of resources probably wants something they can't easily refuse.

## Coquray Sound

Tags: sound, geography, water

The empty arm.

Coquray Sound is the western inlet of Turquish Bay, a long, narrow body of water that penetrates deep into the coastline west of Droughd Sound. Despite its sheltered waters and defensible position, Coquray Sound hosts no permanent settlements—an oddity that various explanations fail to fully account for.

### Geography

Coquray Sound stretches roughly twenty miles inland, narrower than Droughd Sound but deeper, its waters reaching sixty feet in places. The shoreline is rocky, with steep cliffs along the eastern edge and lower, marshy ground to the west where the sound approaches Sestros territory.

The sound's mouth opens to Turquish Bay between two prominent headlands. In theory, this creates an ideal harbor—defensible, sheltered from storms, with deep water for large vessels. In practice, no one has built there.

### Why It's Empty

Several explanations circulate:

**The Currents**: Coquray Sound has unusual water patterns. Currents flow unpredictably, changing direction without warning. Ships anchoring overnight sometimes find themselves dragged toward the cliffs despite secure moorings. Experienced sailors call the sound "treacherous" and avoid it when possible.

**The Depths**: Fishermen report the sound is deeper than soundings suggest—that instruments sometimes fail to find bottom where charts show forty feet of water. Whether this reflects actual depth variations or equipment malfunction remains unclear. Stories of things in the deep are common but unsubstantiated.

**The Claim**: Sestros technically claims Coquray Sound as part of its territorial waters, though they've never established presence there. Some believe Sestros deliberately keeps the sound empty as a potential naval staging area—somewhere ships could gather unobserved before operations elsewhere. If so, they've never used it for that purpose.

**The Practical**: Most likely, Coquray Sound is simply inconvenient. It leads nowhere valuable—no river connection, no inland resources worth accessing, no reason to build there when Droughd Sound serves perfectly well. Empty land stays empty when there's no profit in filling it.

### Current Use

Coquray Sound sees occasional traffic—ships seeking shelter from storms, smugglers looking for privacy, fishermen working waters their competitors avoid. None stay long. The sound has a reputation, deserved or not, and reputation shapes behavior.

Sestros naval vessels patrol the area irregularly, asserting the claim no one contests because no one cares enough to contest it. These patrols report nothing unusual. The sound remains empty, and no one seems motivated to change that.

## Cydoris River

Tags: river, geography

A seasonal lifeline through dying hills.

The Cydoris River flows through the southwestern Hills of Dolor, emerging from springs in the high ground near the Widebarrow Mountains and winding northeast toward Gnotobi's lake. Along with its tributary the Marshal River, it provides the primary water source for the western desert region and ultimately feeds the Golden River system.

### Course

The Cydoris begins as multiple small streams in the rocky highlands where the Hills of Dolor meet the northern Widebarrows. These streams converge in a narrow valley, forming a proper river that cuts through increasingly arid terrain as it flows northeast.

The river passes through some of the harshest parts of the Hills of Dolor, its banks offering the only reliable water and vegetation for miles in any direction. Travelers crossing the hills follow the Cydoris whenever possible—straying from it means gambling with dehydration.

Near the center of its course, the Cydoris passes **Cydorite Bluff**, a dramatic cliff formation where millennia of erosion have exposed layers of colored stone. The bluff is visible for miles and serves as a navigation landmark throughout the region.

The Marshal River joins from the south roughly halfway along the Cydoris's length. Beyond this confluence, the combined waters continue northeast, eventually feeding Gnotobi's lake.

### Seasonal Flow

The Cydoris is highly seasonal. During Ve's brief rainy season, the river runs strong—sometimes violently so, with flash floods capable of sweeping away anything in the valley floor. During the long dry months, it shrinks to a trickle or disappears entirely in some stretches, surviving only in isolated pools fed by underground seepage.

This seasonal variation makes travel timing critical. Cross during the rains and risk being caught in flash floods. Cross during the dry season and find the water sources you were counting on reduced to mud.

### Significance

For Keshwindi, the Cydoris represents the western approach—the route exiles traditionally took from Shyona, and the path by which the city maintains tenuous contact with the outside world beyond Gnotobi. Goldwatch patrols sometimes range this far west, watching for bandits or threats approaching from Sestros.

For Gnotobi, the Cydoris is simply one of the water sources that feeds their lake and, by extension, their wealth. The Harvest Council pays little attention to what happens upstream as long as the water keeps flowing.

## Dern

Tags: state, nation, mountains

The middle child of the Widebarrow mountain states, Dern occupies the central peaks between Thorum's northern strongholds and Mez's nightmare warrens below. A kingdom defined by siege—not the dramatic kind, but the grinding, generational kind. The Lyzine have been coming up from below for centuries. The Dernish have been pushing them back down for just as long.

For full political details, see the [state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Dern.md).

### Settlements

**Dodi** (Capital) — The capital clings to a defensive valley in the central mountains, built around the entrance to the oldest Dernish mines. Perhaps 15,000 people live here. The city is constructed in concentric rings: the outermost residential districts can be abandoned and sealed if Lyzine break through; the inner fortress holds the palace, the armories, and the deepest food stores.

**Foster** (Town) — A fortified town on the northeastern border where Dern meets Shyona. Guards the only reliable pass between the two nations. The town's 3,000 residents are a mix of Dernish soldiers, merchants, and Shyonan observers.

**Lush** (Village) — A small village of perhaps 800 souls, tucked into an interior valley that sees the most sun in all of Dern. The name is aspirational—Lush is merely less bleak than its neighbors. Families who've served their deep-debt sometimes retire here.

### Geographic Features

**Central Widebarrow Range** — Less dramatic than Thorum's Steadfast peaks but more extensive. Below the surface, the mountains are honeycombed with natural caves, ancient mines, and Lyzine-carved tunnels.

**Promisewood** — A forested slope on the northwest border descending toward Avalon. Essential for timber. Named for the marriage pacts it witnessed when Dern and Avalon's royal houses allied three centuries ago.

## Draphilir

Tags: dragon, creature, ve, green

A green dragon who has claimed the eastern Dygon Beastlands—the region called Blyss—as her domain for over five centuries. Draphilir is patient, calculating, and profoundly territorial. Where her clutch-sibling Pyaganos rules through visibility and fear, Draphilir rules through rot, disease, and the certainty that she is always watching from somewhere you cannot see.

### Appearance

Draphilir is large even by dragon standards—her wingspan exceeds two hundred feet, and her body stretches nearly as long from snout to tail-tip. Her scales are the deep green of jungle canopy, darker along the spine and fading to yellowish-green on the underbelly. Centuries in the lightless depths of Blyss have given them a mottled pattern that breaks her outline against the foliage.

Her most distinctive feature is the **spore-growth** that covers portions of her hide. Patches of fungal matter—the same bioluminescent species that colonize her territory—grow directly on her scales, pulsing with faint light in the darkness. The growth is symbiotic; the fungi feed on dead tissue from her molts, and in return they provide camouflage, antibacterial protection, and—some believe—an extension of her sensory awareness.

Her eyes are pale yellow, almost luminescent, and they track movement in near-total darkness. Those who've survived encounters describe the experience of seeing those eyes appear in the shadows, realizing they'd been watched the entire time.

### Character

Draphilir is **patient** in ways that unsettle even other dragons. She doesn't react to provocation immediately—she waits, sometimes for years, until the perfect moment to respond. Insults to her dignity have been answered a decade later, when the offender had long forgotten the slight but Draphilir had not.

She is **possessive** to an extreme degree. Everything in Blyss belongs to her: the land, the creatures, the Ix'Meglyakuk tribes who pay her tribute. She doesn't share. She doesn't negotiate. Trespassers are either killed, driven out, or—if they prove interesting—added to her collection.

She is **curious** about things she doesn't understand, which is increasingly rare after eight centuries of life. Novel creatures, unusual magic, unprecedented situations—these things attract her attention in ways that can be either fortunate or catastrophic for the subject.

She **hates** her brother Pyaganos. The hatred is old, layered, and fundamental. They were clutch-siblings, hatched together, and they competed from their first breath. Centuries of territorial conflicts, betrayals, and grudges have calcified into something that transcends mere enmity. Given opportunity, she would destroy him utterly—but she's patient enough to wait for the right moment.

### The Green Rot

Draphilir's breath weapon is not fire but a **cloud of corrosive, spore-laden vapor**—the Green Rot that pervades her territory. The effects are devastating:

**Immediate:** Living tissue exposed to the breath begins to necrotize within seconds. Armor corrodes. Wood rots. Stone develops fissures as organic matter in the rock breaks down.

**Lingering:** Areas where Draphilir has used her breath retain traces of the rot for decades. The spores settle into soil and vegetation, creating "rot pockets" that can kill unwary travelers years after the original attack.

**Deliberate Seeding:** Draphilir has learned to control the concentration and dispersion of her breath. She can kill instantly or inflict slow, agonizing decay. She uses this control strategically, creating rot pockets at territorial boundaries, marking paths she wants to discourage, and—occasionally—as a form of torture for prisoners.

### The Lair

Draphilir's primary lair occupies a **massive sinkhole** in central Blyss, where an underground river surfaces briefly before diving back beneath the jungle floor. The sinkhole is nearly a mile across and several hundred feet deep, its walls thick with vegetation and fungal growth.

**The Approach:** No path leads to the lair. Draphilir clears approach routes periodically, ensuring the jungle remains impassable. The only way in is to cut through miles of dense growth—or to be invited.

**The Caverns:** Below the sinkhole, flooded caves extend deep into the earth. Draphilir can swim through sections completely submerged, reaching air pockets where she rests and stores her hoard. The water is dark with the same tannic compounds that fill the Blackpits to the west.

**The Hoard:** Five centuries of tribute, treasure from kills, and items collected for reasons only the dragon understands. The hoard includes expected valuables—gold, gems, artifacts—but also odder items: preserved specimens of extinct species, tablets inscribed in unknown languages, a collection of Ix'Meglyakuk skulls arranged by some organizing principle Draphilir won't explain.

### Relationships

**Pyaganos:** Her clutch-sibling and eternal rival. They've fought six wars over territorial boundaries since claiming their respective domains. The current truce—forty years old—is the longest period of peace in their shared history, but Draphilir is preparing for its end. She believes Pyaganos will strike first; she intends to be ready.

**The Thykkalu:** The Ix'Meglyakuk tribe that serves as her intermediaries. Draphilir treats them as useful tools—valued, maintained, but ultimately expendable. She protects them from other tribes because their service benefits her, not from any attachment.

**Outsiders:** Draphilir is more interested in the outside world than Pyaganos, though she expresses this interest differently. Where he invites observers into his territory, she sends the Thykkalu to gather information, building a picture of events beyond Blyss without revealing her own interest. She knows more about continental politics than most Ix'Meglyakuk realize.

### History

Draphilir and Pyaganos hatched from the same clutch roughly eight hundred and fifty years ago, somewhere in the mountains north of the Beastlands. They competed from the beginning—for food, for territory, for their mother's attention. When they matured enough to seek their own domains, they traveled south together, drawn by the Beastlands' abundance of prey.

**The First Division (circa 2,550 SD):** The siblings claimed adjacent territories—Pyaganos in the hills, Draphilir in the deep jungle. For a century, they maintained an uneasy peace, hunting their own grounds and avoiding conflict.

**The First War (2,661-2,679 SD):** A territorial dispute over hunting rights in the buffer zone erupted into open conflict. The war lasted eighteen years and killed thousands of Ix'Meglyakuk caught between the dragons. It ended inconclusively, with both siblings withdrawing to their cores.

**Subsequent Wars:** Five more conflicts followed, each lasting years or decades, each ending in bloody stalemate. The most recent (3,201-3,219 SD) saw Pyaganos push deep into Blyss before Draphilir counterattacked, creating the Burned Valley in Phriorys as she drove him back.

**The Current Truce (3,336 SD - present):** Established after the last war exhausted both dragons' patience for immediate conflict. Draphilir has spent the forty years since preparing—expanding her rot pockets, strengthening her grip on the Thykkalu, gathering intelligence. She believes the truce will end within a decade.

### Interactions

Draphilir rarely meets with outsiders directly. Those seeking audience must first negotiate with the Thykkalu, who will evaluate the request and—if they deem it worthy—arrange passage to the lair's edge. The dragon decides whether to appear.

**Approach:** Never enter Blyss uninvited. Draphilir considers all trespassers hostile unless they've received explicit permission. The Thykkalu can grant passage, but only the dragon can grant audience.

**Tribute:** Draphilir expects offerings from anyone seeking her attention. The nature of the tribute matters less than its quality—she's seen enough gold to be unimpressed by quantity. Unusual items, rare specimens, or valuable information are more likely to interest her.

**Conversation:** If Draphilir deigns to speak, expect questions. She interrogates visitors about the outside world, probing for information about politics, magic, and—always—Pyaganos. She offers little in return, and promises less. Making deals with Draphilir is possible but dangerous; she honors the letter of agreements while finding creative interpretations that serve her interests.

### Hooks

**The Rot's Spread:** The Green Rot is expanding beyond its historical boundaries. Rot pockets are appearing in territories that were safe a decade ago, and the Thykkalu claim Draphilir is responsible—but they won't say why. Someone with the skills to negotiate with a dragon might learn what's changed.

**The War's End:** The current truce is failing. Draphilir is positioning for the next conflict, but she lacks information about Pyaganos's current strength. She might hire outsiders to scout his territory—or she might need mediators to delay the inevitable war until she's ready.

**Something in the Caves:** The flooded caverns beneath Draphilir's lair connect to something else. The dragon has been spending more time below than usual, and the sounds rising from the water suggest activity. What she's found—or what's found her—remains unknown.

## Droughd Sound

Tags: sound, geography, water

The gateway to Gnotobi's empire.

Droughd Sound is the central arm of Turquish Bay, a sheltered inlet on Ve's northern coast where the Golden River empties into the sea. Orangeport occupies its southern shore, making this body of water the funnel through which virtually all Orange Flake exports pass on their way to the wider world.

### Geography

Droughd Sound extends roughly fifteen miles inland from Turquish Bay proper, narrowing gradually from its wide mouth to the river delta at its head. The water is shallow—rarely exceeding forty feet—with sandy bottom and minimal tidal variation. Ships approaching Orangeport follow a dredged channel to avoid the sandbars that shift with seasonal floods from the Golden River.

The sound's western shore is low-lying marshland, uninhabited and prone to flooding. The eastern shore rises more steeply, with the Bluffs district of Orangeport occupying the higher ground. The southern shore, where the Golden River enters, hosts Orangeport's main docks and commercial district.

### Maritime Traffic

Droughd Sound sees more ship traffic than any comparable body of water in this part of Ve. Vessels arriving to load Orange Flake, coastal traders moving goods between Turquish Bay communities, fishing boats working the sound's productive waters, and the occasional naval patrol from Shyona or Sestros making a show of presence—all share these waters.

The traffic creates opportunity and hazard alike. Legitimate merchants compete for dock space at Orangeport. Pirates scout the sound's mouth for vulnerable cargo. Smugglers use the marshy western shore for clandestine transfers. The Harbormaster's patrol boats struggle to maintain order.

### The Droughd Sound Tariff

All commercial vessels entering or leaving the sound pay the **Droughd Sound Tariff**, a navigation fee that theoretically funds Orangeport's government. In practice, the tariff is a contested prize—Gnotobi, Shyona, and Sestros all claim portions, and the actual collection involves complex negotiations, bribes, and occasional violence.

Ships flying certain flags pay reduced rates. Ships carrying Orange Flake for Harvest Council families sometimes pay nothing at all. Ships without connections pay whatever the tariff collector thinks they can extract. The system is corrupt by design.

### Orangeport

The town of **Orangeport** dominates Droughd Sound's southern shore, existing entirely because of the sound's position as the Golden River's outlet.

See [Orangeport](Orangeport.md) for full details.

## Dunes of Evioli

Tags: desert, dunes, geography, region

A sea of sand hiding an empire of orange.

The Dunes of Evioli stretch across north-central Ve, a vast desert of rolling sand dunes that shifts color from pale gold to deep amber depending on the light. At its heart lies Gnotobi's lake—the source of Orange Flake and the reason anyone cares about this otherwise hostile expanse.

### Geography

The Dunes occupy the low basin between the Hills of Dolor to the west and the beginnings of Shyona's settled lands to the east. The terrain is classic erg desert: wave after wave of sand dunes, some reaching heights of two hundred feet, their crests sculpted by winds that blow constantly from the northwest.

The sand is fine and mobile, making permanent structures difficult outside the lake basin. Dunes migrate slowly but relentlessly, occasionally swallowing abandoned camps or burying roads that weren't maintained. Navigation requires either following the Golden River or knowing the patterns well enough to read the landscape.

The climate is brutal: scorching days, cold nights, and almost no rainfall. What precipitation does fall evaporates before reaching the ground or drains quickly into the porous sand. The only reliable water is Gnotobi's lake and the rivers that feed it.

### Gnotobi's Lake

The lake at the heart of the Dunes is an anomaly—a vast, shallow body of water in the middle of a desert. Fed by the Cydoris and Marshal Rivers from the southwest and countless smaller springs along its bed, the lake has no outlet except the Golden River flowing north to Turquish Bay.

The water is warm, brackish, and rich in minerals that support the unique orange algae found nowhere else in the world. From the dunes surrounding it, the lake glows like molten copper at sunset—one of Ve's most striking natural sights, and the source of its most controversial product.

See [Gnotobi](Gnotobi.md) for details on the city-state and the Orange Flake trade.

### The Golden River

The **Golden River** is the lifeblood of the region, flowing from Gnotobi's lake north through the dunes to Orangeport on Droughd Sound. The river is the only practical route for moving goods out of the Dunes of Evioli; overland caravans through the shifting sands are slow, expensive, and dangerous.

The river carved its course before the dunes existed, when this basin was wetter. Now it flows through a relatively stable channel where the water table remains high enough to prevent sand encroachment. The banks support scattered vegetation—date palms, reeds, scrubby trees—creating a green ribbon through the otherwise barren landscape.

See [Golden River](Golden%20River.md) for full details.

### The Mobari Reach

The eastern portion of the Dunes, where sand gives way to rocky hardpan approaching Shyona's borders, is called the **Mobari Reach**. The terrain here is more stable but no less harsh—flat, sun-baked earth broken by occasional rock outcrops and seasonal creek beds that flow only during rare storms.

The Mobari Reach serves as the main overland approach to Gnotobi from Shyona. A poorly maintained road connects the lake to Shyona's western settlements, used primarily by those who can't afford river transport or need to avoid Orangeport's scrutiny.

### Hazards

The Dunes of Evioli are actively dangerous:

**Navigation**: Without landmarks, travelers become disoriented within hours. The dunes look identical in every direction. Getting lost here kills.

**Sandstorms**: The northwest winds occasionally intensify into full sandstorms that can last for days. Visibility drops to nothing; sand infiltrates everything; unprotected travelers suffocate.

**Subsidence**: Some dunes conceal unstable ground—old lake beds, collapsed tunnels, pockets of loose sand. Animals and occasionally people have been swallowed by suddenly shifting terrain.

**Heat**: Daytime temperatures in summer exceed safe limits. Travel happens at night or not at all during the hot months.

**Raiders**: The dunes provide excellent concealment for those preying on Gnotobi's trade. Bandit groups operate in the southern reaches, striking caravans and disappearing into terrain they know better than any pursuer.

### Settlements

**Gnotobi** is the only significant settlement in the Dunes of Evioli, positioned on the lake's shore where water makes permanent habitation possible.

Scattered throughout the dunes are temporary camps—nomadic herders who follow sparse grazing, prospectors searching for valuable minerals, and the occasional hermit or fugitive who prefers the desert's dangers to civilization's laws. None of these constitute permanent population.

### Travel

Those crossing the Dunes typically choose one of two routes:

**The River Road**: Following the Golden River from Orangeport to Gnotobi. Slower but safer—water is available, the path is clear, and Goldwatch patrols provide some security. This is how goods move.

**The Mobari Trail**: The overland route from Shyona through the Mobari Reach. Faster but harder, used by travelers who want to avoid Orangeport entirely or can't afford river passage. High casualty rate among the unprepared.

Crossing the dunes directly—away from rivers or established trails—is possible but inadvisable. Even experienced desert travelers disappear regularly.

## Dygon Beastlands

Tags: jungle, plains, forest, ve, region

The Dygon Beastlands sprawl across the entire southern end of Ve, a primordial wilderness roughly four hundred miles north to south and six hundred miles east to west. This is the largest continuous jungle on the continent—and one of the most dangerous regions in all of Alaria. Dinosaurs rule here. The jungle itself seems hostile to civilization. And two green dragons have claimed territories that together encompass most of the interior.

The Beastlands are not unexplored. The Ix'Meglyakuk—raptor-riding lizardfolk who have lived here since before human memory—know every trail, every hunting ground, every danger zone. But they don't share that knowledge freely, and the jungle they navigate would kill most outsiders within days.

### Why Civilization Fails

Every major power on Ve has attempted to establish footholds in the Dygon Beastlands. Chimea has tried three times. Shyona mounted expeditions during its expansionist periods. Even the Krell—before they became what they are now—attempted to push westward into the jungle.

All failed. Not through single catastrophes, but through accumulation.

**The jungle reclaims.** Roads cut through vegetation regrow within weeks. Cleared fields sprout new growth overnight. Buildings left unattended for a season vanish under vines and roots. The rate of growth here exceeds anything natural—some scholars believe the Beastlands sit on an earth leyline that accelerates plant life, though no one has mapped leylines this far into the interior.

**The predators adapt.** Every permanent settlement attracts attention. First the scavengers, then the mid-sized hunters, then the apex predators. A village of fifty might hold off jungle cats and terror birds. It cannot hold off a pack of hunting allosaurs that have learned where the easy prey gathers.

**The Ix'Meglyakuk don't want you here.** They're not uniformly hostile—some tribes trade at the margins, and a few have served as guides for expeditions. But they consider the Beastlands their homeland, and they've perfected the art of making outsiders unwelcome without open warfare. Trails that lead in circles. Warnings that come too late. Game that's been driven away from your hunting parties. Most colonial attempts don't fail to violence—they fail to attrition, supplies running out faster than expected, until the survivors retreat to the coast.

### The Ix'Meglyakuk

The raptor-riders are the only sapient species to successfully inhabit the Beastlands interior. Their population is unknown—estimates range from twenty thousand to over a hundred thousand, scattered across dozens of tribal territories.

They live in semi-permanent villages built in the canopy, structures of woven vines and shaped branches that can be abandoned and rebuilt as hunting grounds shift. Young Ix'Meglyakuk bond with utahraptor hatchlings in ceremonies that mark the beginning of adulthood; the partnership lasts until death, and losing a bonded mount leaves permanent psychological scars.

**Tribal Organization:** The Ix'Meglyakuk have no central government. Each tribe—typically two to five hundred individuals—controls a hunting territory and governs itself through councils of senior riders. Inter-tribal relations range from alliance to open warfare depending on recent history, resource competition, and the personalities of tribal leaders.

**Relationship to Dragons:** The Ix'Meglyakuk acknowledge both Pyaganos and Draphilir as powers to be respected but not worshipped. They avoid the dragons' core territories, offer tribute when demanded, and otherwise maintain careful distance. The dragons, in turn, rarely hunt Ix'Meglyakuk directly—the raptors make the lizardfolk too mobile to be worth the effort.

**Outsider Contact:** A few tribes near the coast and the Phriorys hills maintain trading relationships with Chimea and the nations to the north. They exchange jungle products—rare woods, medicinal plants, dinosaur parts—for metal tools and weapons they cannot manufacture themselves. These trading tribes are looked down upon by interior groups, who consider contact with outsiders a contamination.

### Geography

The Beastlands divide into several distinct zones, each with its own character and dangers.

**The Coastal Margins:** A strip of lighter jungle and mangrove swamp along the southern and western coasts, extending roughly twenty miles inland. This is the "accessible" Beastlands—still dangerous, but survivable for prepared expeditions. Most outsider contact happens here.

**The Deep Jungle:** The interior, where the canopy blocks most sunlight and the understory is a maze of roots, vines, and deadfall. Navigation is nearly impossible without Ix'Meglyakuk guidance. The megafauna here—brachiosaurs, tyrannosaurs, creatures that dwarf anything in the northern lands—move through clearings and river corridors.

**The Dragon Territories:** Pyaganos claims the Phriorys hills and surrounding jungle in the northwest. Draphilir holds Blyss in the east. Between them lies contested ground where neither dragon hunts regularly—and where the most dangerous predators gather, freed from draconic predation.

### Subregions

#### Phriorys

The hilly region in the northwest, where the jungle gives way to scattered groves and grassland. Home to the dragon Pyaganos. See [Phriorys](Phriorys.md) for details.

#### Blyss

The eastern jungle, denser and darker than the rest of the Beastlands. Territory of the dragon Draphilir. See [Blyss](Blyss.md) for details.

#### Blackpits

A swamp in the north-central Beastlands, where dark water pools beneath the canopy. See [Blackpits](Blackpits.md) for details.

### Water Features

#### Bay of Monkeys

A deep inlet on the northeastern coast, where the Beastlands jungle meets the Krell-infested territories to the east. The bay takes its name from the howler colonies that infest the coastal trees—thousands of primates whose screaming can be heard miles out to sea.

The howlers are not ordinary monkeys. Something in the Beastlands has made them larger, more aggressive, and disturbingly coordinated. Ships anchoring in the bay have been swarmed by howlers swimming from shore, the creatures boarding vessels and stealing anything not secured. The attacks seem almost organized—diversionary groups drawing attention while others raid the holds.

Local Ix'Meglyakuk avoid the bay entirely. They call it *Kraak-Shrill*, which translates roughly to "the screaming water," and consider the howlers touched by something unnatural. Whether this is superstition or genuine knowledge, the lizardfolk won't say.

**The Wreck Garden:** Deeper in the bay, past the howler territories, lies a collection of sunken and beached vessels—perhaps thirty ships accumulated over centuries. Some were driven ashore by storms. Others seem to have been deliberately grounded, their crews fleeing something aboard. The wrecks contain salvageable cargo, but reaching them means passing through howler territory.

#### Ender's Inlet

A major indentation in the southern coast, roughly forty miles wide at its mouth and extending twenty miles inland. The inlet marks the traditional boundary between the Dygon Beastlands and the approaches to Disaster Passage and Phyr Island.

The name has multiple claimed origins:
- **The Chimean account** holds that an early explorer, Captain Ender Valois, charted the inlet before his expedition was destroyed by something in the interior
- **Ix'Meglyakuk tradition** calls it *Thuk-Mezzal*—"where the land stops"—and considers it a boundary marker between their territory and cursed ground
- **Local sailors** believe the name is a warning: the end of safe waters, beyond which Disaster Passage begins

The inlet itself is relatively calm, sheltered from ocean swells by a curved peninsula on the eastern side. Several Ix'Meglyakuk tribes use its shores as seasonal fishing grounds, the only time they venture into open water. A few Chimean trading posts have attempted to establish themselves here—the most recent, abandoned fifteen years ago, still stands in overgrown ruin on the western shore.

**Inlleyuk:** A semi-permanent Ix'Meglyakuk settlement on the inlet's eastern shore, one of the largest concentrations of lizardfolk outside the deep interior. Inlleyuk serves as a trading hub where coastal tribes exchange goods with interior groups, and occasionally with Chimean merchants brave or foolish enough to visit. Perhaps eight hundred Ix'Meglyakuk live here at peak seasons, though the population fluctuates as tribes come and go.

#### Lizard's Maw

A distinctive inlet on the southwestern coast, where the Beastlands meet the Gulf of Chimea. From above, the coastline forms a shape resembling an open reptilian jaw—a curved peninsula forming the upper palate, a sandbar the lower jaw, and a narrow channel between them like a throat.

The Ix'Meglyakuk consider Lizard's Maw sacred. Their creation myths hold that the Beastlands themselves are the body of a primordial lizard-god, sleeping beneath the jungle, and the Maw is where the god will speak when it finally wakes. Tribal gatherings happen on the shores during certain astronomical alignments, and outsiders who approach during these ceremonies are killed without warning.

At other times, the Maw serves as the primary point of contact between the Ix'Meglyakuk and Chimea. The channel is navigable for shallow-draft vessels, and a Chimean trading post—Fort Vaylen—has survived on the outer peninsula for over sixty years, protected by treaties negotiated with the nearest tribes and by its location outside the sacred boundaries.

**Fort Vaylen:** The only permanent non-Ix'Meglyakuk settlement in the Beastlands, Fort Vaylen is a stockaded compound housing perhaps a hundred Chimean traders, factors, and guards. They purchase jungle products from willing tribes and sell them upriver to Chimea proper. The fort's survival depends entirely on maintaining good relations with local Ix'Meglyakuk—when those relations sour, as they did in 3,298 SD, the jungle closes in fast. That incident left forty Chimeans dead and Fort Vaylen abandoned for a decade before new treaties were negotiated.

### Creatures

The Beastlands host the greatest concentration of dinosaurs in Alaria. Species that went extinct elsewhere millennia ago thrive here, alongside creatures found nowhere else.

**Megafauna:**
- **Tyrannosaurs** — apex predators in the deep jungle, hunting in mated pairs or small family groups
- **Allosaurs** — pack hunters, more dangerous than tyrannosaurs due to coordination and numbers
- **Brachiosaurs and diplodocids** — massive herbivores that reshape the jungle as they move
- **Ceratopsians** — herd animals that can trample a village when panicked
- **Utahraptors** — the bonded mounts of the Ix'Meglyakuk, intelligent and loyal to their riders

**Other Threats:**
- **Terror birds** — flightless predators that hunt the margins and clearings
- **Giant crocodilians** — in every river and swamp, some exceeding fifty feet
- **Jungle cats** — including species with venomous bites, chameleon-like camouflage, or pack-hunting intelligence
- **Insects** — clouds of biting, stinging, disease-carrying swarms in the wet season

### The Dragons

Two green dragons divide the Beastlands between them: Pyaganos in the northwest and Draphilir in the east. Their relationship is complex—they are clutch-siblings, hatched from the same nest over eight centuries ago, and they have spent those centuries alternating between alliance and rivalry.

Currently, they maintain an uneasy truce. Each claims their territory as sovereign, each avoids the other's domain, and the space between them serves as a buffer zone where neither hunts. This arrangement has lasted forty years. Previous truces have lasted anywhere from a decade to a century before collapsing into open conflict.

When the dragons fight, the Beastlands suffer. Their last war, from 3,201 to 3,219 SD, killed thousands of Ix'Meglyakuk caught between their territories and drove entire tribes from their traditional grounds. The lizardfolk pray the current peace holds.

See [Pyaganos](../../bestiary/dragons/Pyaganos.md) and [Draphilir](../../bestiary/dragons/Draphilir.md) for details on each dragon.

### Threats and Opportunities

#### For Players

**Expedition into the Interior:** Someone wants something from the deep Beastlands—a rare plant, a dinosaur specimen, a ruin from pre-Ix'Meglyakuk civilizations. Reaching it requires Ix'Meglyakuk guides, which means earning tribal trust or paying prices measured in more than gold.

**The Dragon Truce:** After forty years of peace, signs suggest another war is coming. Draphilir has been seen hunting closer to the buffer zone. Pyaganos has demanded increased tribute from nearby tribes. An outside party might be hired to mediate, to sabotage one dragon's position, or simply to evacuate vulnerable communities before the fighting starts.

**Fort Vaylen's Crisis:** The Chimean trading post is in trouble—a new tribal leader has repudiated the old treaties, demanding renegotiation. The Chimeans need someone to broker new terms before the jungle closes in. The Ix'Meglyakuk need someone who can explain what Chimea will actually accept. Both sides might be lying about their intentions.

**The Howler Mystery:** Something is organizing the howlers of the Bay of Monkeys. The attacks are becoming more sophisticated, the swarms larger. Someone or something has taken control of the colonies, and their goals—beyond theft and harassment—are unclear.

**The Sleeping God:** Ix'Meglyakuk mythology speaks of a primordial entity beneath the Beastlands—the lizard-god whose body became the land. Recent earthquakes near Lizard's Maw have the tribes worried. Some believe the god is stirring. Others believe something is trying to wake it.

## Edari

Tags: region, state, savannah, ve

The golden savannah of northwestern Ve, Edari is a vast wilderness claimed by no settled nation. It is the homeland of the Korel—the Wildborn Koren—who roam its grasslands in loose hunting bands, following prey and season across terrain that has never known a permanent wall.

### Geography

Edari occupies a broad peninsula roughly 300 miles across, bounded by water on three sides and mountains to the south. The terrain is predominantly flat savannah—golden grasses stretching to every horizon, broken by scattered acacia-like trees and seasonal watering holes.

**Boundaries:**
- **North**: Open ocean (Norswell Sea)
- **West**: Mesyula Bay
- **East**: Coquray Sound (inlet of Turquish Bay)
- **South**: Shepherds' Stones (mountain range marking the border with Sestros)

The interior is trackless. No roads cross Edari—the Korel don't build them, and outsiders rarely survive long enough to need them.

### Mesyula Bay

The western coastline indents around Mesyula Bay, a shallow body of water rich in fish and seabirds. The Korel occasionally fish these waters from small hide boats, but they build no permanent fishing villages. Foreign ships sometimes anchor in the bay to take on fresh water, though doing so risks attracting Korel attention.

### Coquray Sound

The eastern coast opens into Coquray Sound, which connects to the larger Turquish Bay separating Edari from Shyona. The sound's waters are calmer than the open ocean, and Shyonan fishing vessels sometimes venture into its western reaches—though they rarely go ashore.

### Estri Islands

A small archipelago lies offshore to the northwest, separated from the mainland by a few miles of open water. The islands appear uninhabited by the Korel, who show little interest in seafaring.

#### Hume Une

Ruins of a Kor colony on the largest of the Estri Islands. Centuries ago, the Kor—the "civilized" Koren—attempted to establish a foothold on Ve, building a walled settlement in the traditional Kor style: orderly streets, stone structures, a central hall for social rituals. The colony failed within two generations. Disease, supply problems, and increasingly hostile relations with the mainland Korel made the position untenable. The survivors evacuated by ship; the settlement was left to rot.

The Korel don't fear Hume Une—they find it disgusting. The ruins represent everything they rejected: walls, permanence, suppression of instinct, the Kor obsession with propriety. Entering the ruins is taboo, an act of spiritual contamination. Young Korel sometimes dare each other to approach the islands; actually setting foot on them would mean exile from the pack.

The ruins themselves are overgrown but largely intact. Stone doesn't rot. The central hall still stands, its interior dark and silent. Whatever the Kor left behind when they fled—records, artifacts, supplies—remains untouched. No Korel will retrieve it. No outsider has bothered to look.

### Howlwood

The one major forest in Edari sprawls across the northeastern corner of the region, near where Coquray Sound meets the coast. The forest takes its name from the eerie sounds that drift from its depths at night—whether from wildlife, wind, or something else is debated by the few outsiders who've heard it.

See [Howlwood](./Howlwood.md) for details.

### The Korel

Edari has no cities, towns, or villages because its inhabitants don't build them. The Korel—Wildborn Koren—are nomadic hunters who follow game across the savannah in loose pack structures. They are territorial and view outsiders as either prey or competitors.

The Korel are not a unified people. Each pack operates independently, sometimes cooperating with neighbors, sometimes fighting them. Attempting to cross Edari without Korel permission is extremely dangerous. Attempting to settle is suicide.

See [Koren](../../../races/Koren.md) for details on the Korel.

### Why It Matters

Edari is effectively impassable overland. Anyone traveling between Sestros and the northern coast must either:
- Sail around the peninsula (adding weeks to the journey)
- Negotiate passage with Korel packs (unreliable at best)
- Fight through (rarely successful)

This geographic reality shapes trade routes across northern Ve. The Shepherds' Stones and Korel territory together create a natural barrier that isolates the northwestern coast from the rest of the continent.

## Garlow

Tags: citystate, ve, frontier, industry

The industrial heart of the Twin Cities, Garlow produces the weapons, traps, and supplies that keep Yuki's defenses functional. Where Yuki watches the border, Garlow forges the tools that make watching worthwhile.

### Character

Garlow is louder, dirtier, and more practical than its sister city. Forges run day and night. Alchemical workshops fill the air with acrid smoke. Workshops produce everything from crossbow bolts to tunnel-flooding pumps. The city smells of metal, chemicals, and sweat.

The residents are craftspeople first, soldiers second. Every adult in Garlow knows a trade—blacksmithing, alchemy, engineering, carpentry—and contributes to the Twin Cities' survival through production rather than patrol. Children apprentice as soon as they're old enough to hold tools.

This industrial focus creates a different culture than Yuki's watchful vigilance. Garlow people are builders, makers, problem-solvers. They take pride in the quality of their work and measure status by skill rather than martial prowess.

### The Workshops

Garlow's economy centers on several major production facilities:

**The Foundry** — The largest smithing operation in the Suki Hills, producing weapons, armor, and the metal components for Yuki's trap systems. Run by the Ironwright Guild, which maintains quality standards and apprenticeship programs.

**The Alchemist's Row** — A street of competing workshops producing poisons, incendiaries, acids, and other chemicals essential to Krell defense. The competition keeps prices reasonable and drives innovation, though occasional explosions remind everyone why the Row is located on Garlow's downwind edge.

**The Trapwright's Hall** — Where the deadliest defensive devices are designed and assembled. The guild that operates this facility guards its techniques jealously—trap designs are Garlow's most valuable intellectual property.

**The Aether Refineries** — Joint operations with Yuki's etherweavers, processing raw goblin aether into usable forms. The refineries produce everything from lamp fuel to enchantment catalysts.

### Governance

Garlow maintains its own city assembly for internal matters while participating in the Twin Cities Council for shared concerns. The assembly is dominated by guild representatives—master craftspeople whose economic power translates directly into political influence.

The current Assembly Speaker is **Forgemaster Daven Korr**, an aging human smith whose family has run the Foundry for four generations. He's conservative, production-focused, and skeptical of any expenditure that doesn't directly contribute to defense.

### Relations with Yuki

The Twin Cities' division of labor creates natural tensions. Yuki's watchers sometimes view Garlow as soft—civilians who don't understand the reality of the border. Garlow's craftspeople sometimes view Yuki as parasitic—warriors who consume resources without producing anything.

These tensions never escalate beyond grumbling. Both cities know they need each other. Yuki without Garlow would run out of weapons within a year. Garlow without Yuki would be overrun within a month. The arrangement works precisely because neither side can afford to let it fail.

### The Refugee Quarter

Garlow absorbs most of the Twin Cities' refugee population—survivors from the Krell Lands who trickle in over the years, displaced farmers from the borderlands, goblins seeking citizenship. The Refugee Quarter occupies the city's southern edge, a crowded district where newcomers learn trades and integrate into Garlow's workshop economy.

The Quarter has developed its own character over generations. Cuisines from the lost kingdoms survive here. Languages that haven't been spoken outside these streets for a century persist in family homes. Cultural practices from Theoron, Valifax, and the Jaipon Confederacy blend into something new—a community defined by what was lost and what was built in its place.

### What Garlow Makes

Beyond weapons and traps, Garlow produces:

- **Communication devices** — Aether-powered signaling equipment for the watchtower network
- **Protective gear** — Sealed suits for the burner teams, masks against Krell pheromones
- **Extraction equipment** — Ropes, harnesses, climbing gear for expedition teams
- **Trade goods** — Quality metalwork and alchemical products for export to Chimea and beyond

The city's reputation for quality draws buyers from across Ve. Garlow steel commands premium prices, and Garlow alchemicals are considered among the most reliable in the region.

## Glory River

Tags: river, geography, ve, sestros

The sacred waterway of Sestros, flowing from the foothills of the Shepherds' Stones through the kingdom's heartland. The Shailin believe water that touches Talresses's chosen land carries his blessing—and since Talresses has chosen all of Sestros, the Glory River is considered especially holy.

### Course

The Glory River rises from springs in the southeastern Shepherds' Stones, near where the mountains diminish toward the Hills of Dolor. It flows south and then east, winding through the central grasslands that form Sestros's agricultural core. The river eventually feeds into the systems that drain toward Shyona and the eastern coast.

The total length is roughly 150 miles. For most of that distance, the river is slow and shallow—easily forded, ideal for watering livestock, but not navigable by anything larger than a flat-bottomed barge.

### Settlements

The densest population in Sestros clusters along the Glory River. A string of ranching towns follows its banks: Lolani, Phuklean, Wadala Sindhuan, Banda Lamman, Karborai, and dozens of smaller villages. These communities depend on the river for drinking water, irrigation, and the spiritual benefits the Shailin ascribe to proximity to flowing water.

The main road from Mu to the eastern borders roughly parallels the Glory River, connecting the ranching towns to the capital and to each other.

### Religious Significance

The Shailin treat the Glory River as more than water. Pilgrims travel to bathe in its currents, believing the experience purifies the spirit and brings them closer to Talresses. Children are named beside its banks. The dying ask to be carried to the river so their last breath can be drawn near blessed water.

None of this requires Talresses's actual intervention. The daemon encourages the belief because it binds the Shailin to their land and to him—but whether the water carries any genuine blessing is impossible to verify. The Shailin don't question it. They don't question anything.

### Practical Value

Religious significance aside, the Glory River makes central Sestros habitable. The grasslands would be marginal for ranching without reliable water. The river's presence allows sheep and goat herds that produce the wool underlying Sestros's famous textile industry.

The best grazing lands lie within a day's walk of the river. Move farther away and the land dries out, supporting only seasonal pasture. The Glory River's course essentially defines where Sestros can sustain significant population.

## Gnotobi

Tags: citystate, settlement

The orange city. Gnotobi sprawls along the shores of its vast lake in the Dunes of Evioli, a haze of refinement smoke hanging over its warehouses and the sweet-chemical smell of processing hanging in the air. This is the only place in the world where Orange Flake is made—and that monopoly has made Gnotobi obscenely wealthy.

The lake itself dominates everything. Miles across, shallow, warm, and carpeted with the distinctive orange algae that grows nowhere else. From the surrounding dunes, the water looks like molten copper at sunset. Up close, it smells of salt and something faintly medicinal.

### The Harvest Council

Gnotobi is governed by the **Harvest Council**, an oligarchy of the families who control algae harvesting rights. Power in Gnotobi is measured in shoreline. Each family's voting weight on the Council corresponds to how much lakefront they own. More shore means more harvesting capacity means more wealth means more influence.

The current Council comprises seven major families and a rotating coalition of minor ones who occasionally accumulate enough combined shoreline to matter. Council sessions are legendarily vicious—alliances shift, marriages are arranged and broken, and the occasional family finds itself mysteriously bankrupt and forced to sell its holdings.

No single family has achieved majority control in living memory. The Council's dysfunction is, in a sense, its stability: everyone is too busy scheming against each other to unite behind a single tyrant.

**The Golden Seat** is the Council's nominal leadership position, held by whichever family currently controls the most shoreline. The Golden Seat sets the agenda and breaks ties but has no special authority otherwise. Families have bankrupted themselves pursuing it for the prestige alone.

### Orange Flake

The drug that built an empire.

Orange Flake is processed from the algae that grows only in Gnotobi's lake. When refined and dried, it produces an orange crystalline powder that dissolves easily in liquid or can be inhaled directly. The high is warm, euphoric, and remarkably safe—overdose is nearly impossible, and the drug causes no physical damage even with heavy use.

The problem is psychological. Orange Flake is extraordinarily addictive. Users describe the high as feeling *loved*—a profound sense of acceptance and peace that makes ordinary life feel hollow by comparison. Most users can maintain functionality while using, which makes the addiction easier to hide and harder to break. Withdrawal isn't physically dangerous, but the emotional crash drives relapse rates above ninety percent.

The drug commands staggering prices in foreign markets. A single dose in Gnotobi costs a day's wages for a laborer. By the time it reaches Shyona's cities, it costs a week's. In distant lands across the sea, it's worth its weight in gold.

### The Harvest

Collecting the algae is miserable work.

Harvesters wade into the lake's shallows—rarely deeper than chest-height—and scrape algae into fine mesh nets. The work continues for hours, bent over in the water, under the desert sun. The lake's minerals stain skin orange within weeks of regular exposure. Long-term harvesters develop joint problems, persistent fatigue, and a distinctive cognitive fog—an ironic echo of the drug's effects.

The orange stain never fully fades. In Gnotobi, orange palms mark you as underclass.

Who does this work?

**Debt laborers**: The cruelest irony. People who became addicted to Orange Flake and couldn't pay their debts work off what they owe in the lake—surrounded by the source of their addiction, paid in the drug they're trying to escape.

**Criminals**: Gnotobi sentences lawbreakers to harvest duty. Theft, assault, unpaid debts—the punishment is the same. A season in the lake.

**The desperate**: Some come voluntarily. The pay is regular, food is provided, and for those with nothing else, that's enough. Many are migrants from the surrounding desert, refugees from Shyona's internal conflicts, or foreigners who arrived chasing opportunity and found only this.

The Harvest Council does not discuss labor conditions publicly.

### The Processing District

Raw algae is worthless. The refinement process—closely guarded by the Council families—transforms harvested algae into Orange Flake through a multi-stage process involving drying, chemical treatment, and crystallization.

The **Processing District** occupies Gnotobi's northeastern quarter, a maze of warehouse-refineries owned by various Council families. The air here smells of chemical solvents and burns the throat. Workers in the refineries develop their own health problems, different from the harvesters but no less debilitating.

Each family guards its refinement techniques jealously. The broad strokes are similar, but small variations produce noticeably different product. Connoisseurs can identify which family processed a batch by its color, texture, and the character of its high. Some families have better reputations than others.

### The Golden River

All roads lead to Orangeport—or rather, all water does.

The **Golden River** flows through Gnotobi's lake and continues north to Droughd Sound on Turquish Bay. This is the only practical route for moving product to market. Overland caravans through the desert are slow, expensive, and vulnerable to raiders. The river is faster, cheaper, and easier to defend.

Gnotobi maintains a fleet of shallow-draft cargo boats that shuttle Orange Flake downstream to Orangeport. The **Goldwatch**—mercenaries from Keshwindi under the Goldwatch Compact—escort every shipment. River pirates are a persistent problem, despite (or because of) the enormous value of the cargo.

The river was called something else once, before Orange Flake made Gnotobi rich. No one remembers the old name.

### Architecture and Layout

Gnotobi is a city of contrasts. The lakefront is beautiful: elegant villas of the Harvest Council families, pleasure gardens, promenades where the wealthy stroll at sunset watching the orange water glow. Behind this facade, the city deteriorates quickly—crowded worker housing, the stinking Processing District, and the tent camps of migrants hoping for harvest work.

The **Council Hall** sits on a promontory overlooking the lake, an ostentatious structure of imported stone that cost more than most cities' entire treasuries. Council families compete to fund expansions and decorations, resulting in an architectural hodgepodge of clashing styles unified only by expense.

### Security

Everyone wants what Gnotobi has.

The Council maintains extensive security operations:

**Lake Patrols**: Armed boats circling the lake, watching for unauthorized harvesting or sabotage of family holdings.

**The Goldwatch**: Keshwindi mercenaries under the Compact, providing muscle for caravan escorts, district patrols, and occasional enforcement of Council decisions.

**Informant Networks**: Spies in Orangeport, Shyona, Sestros, and beyond, watching for theft rings, smuggling operations, or foreign powers planning moves against Gnotobi's monopoly.

**The Refinement Guard**: Each major family maintains private security for its processing facilities. These forces answer to their families first, the Council second, and are as likely to spy on rival families as to protect against external threats.

### Relations

**Keshwindi**: The Goldwatch Compact binds the two cities. Gnotobi pays for Keshwindi's soldiers; Keshwindi provides the muscle Gnotobi's merchant families lack. The relationship is purely transactional. Neither side pretends otherwise.

**Orangeport**: Gnotobi's gateway to the world, and a perpetual headache. The Council would prefer to control Orangeport directly but has never managed to unite long enough to conquer it. Instead, they bribe, threaten, and manipulate Orangeport's factions, trying to ensure favorable treatment without provoking unified resistance.

**Shyona**: The largest market for Orange Flake, and the most complicated relationship. Shyona's noble houses publicly condemn the drug trade while privately consuming enormous quantities. This hypocrisy suits everyone: Shyona maintains moral authority, Gnotobi maintains profits, and no one examines the arrangement too closely.

**Sestros**: Minimal direct trade. Sestros lacks the wealth to afford Orange Flake in quantity, and Gnotobi has little interest in Sestros's goods. Some smuggling passes through Sestros territory to avoid Shyona's nominal tariffs.

## Golden River

Tags: river, geography, trade

The most profitable waterway in Ve.

The Golden River flows north from Gnotobi's lake through the Dunes of Evioli, emptying into Droughd Sound at Orangeport. This single river carries virtually every dose of Orange Flake that leaves the desert—a stream of narcotic wealth that has made fortunes, broken treaties, and shaped the politics of an entire region.

### Course

The river begins at Gnotobi's lake, the only outlet for waters that have nowhere else to go. Fed by the Cydoris and Marshal Rivers from the southwest, the lake overflows northward through a channel that predates the surrounding dunes.

From Gnotobi, the Golden River winds roughly seventy miles through increasingly sparse desert before reaching the green margins of Turquish Bay. The final stretch passes through cultivated land—small farms and fishing villages that exist because the river makes settlement possible—before emptying into Droughd Sound at Orangeport.

The river is navigable for its entire length by shallow-draft vessels. Deeper ships can travel the lower reaches from Orangeport to the edge of the dunes; beyond that point, sandbars and narrow channels require specialized craft.

### The Name

The Golden River was called something else before Orange Flake made Gnotobi rich. Scholars claim the old name was the Evioli—the same word that gives the surrounding dunes their name—but usage shifted within a generation of the drug trade's emergence. Now everyone calls it the Golden River, and the old name survives only in academic texts.

The new name is apt. The river carries gold in the most literal sense: Gnotobi's Orange Flake shipments, each cargo worth fortunes by the time it reaches foreign markets. The water itself sometimes takes on an orange tinge near Gnotobi, stained by runoff from the algae-rich lake.

### Trade Route

The Golden River is Gnotobi's lifeline. Without it, the city-state would be landlocked in hostile desert, its products unsaleable, its wealth unreachable.

**Downstream (Gnotobi to Orangeport)**: Cargo boats carry Orange Flake, processed and packaged for export. Each shipment travels under Goldwatch escort. The journey takes three to five days depending on river conditions and weather.

**Upstream (Orangeport to Gnotobi)**: Return vessels carry supplies Gnotobi can't produce locally—foodstuffs, manufactured goods, luxury items for the Harvest Council families, and labor (willing or otherwise) for the harvest.

Traffic is constant. On any given day, dozens of boats move along the river, creating a perpetual flow of commerce that makes the Golden River one of Ve's busiest waterways despite serving only two settlements.

### Security

Everyone wants what moves on this river.

The **Goldwatch** maintains the primary security presence—Keshwindi mercenaries under the Goldwatch Compact, hired specifically to protect Orange Flake shipments. Goldwatch boats patrol the river continuously, and armed escorts accompany every cargo vessel.

Despite these precautions, piracy remains a persistent problem. The dunes along the river's middle reaches provide concealment for raiders who strike quickly and disappear into terrain they know better than any pursuer. Small-scale theft is constant; major heists occur every few years, usually involving inside information from someone in Gnotobi or Orangeport.

The Harvest Council has standing bounties on known river pirates. The Goldwatch collects these bounties regularly. Neither measure has eliminated the problem.

### River Communities

Small settlements cluster along the lower Golden River where it approaches Turquish Bay. These communities exist because the river exists—farming the irrigated land along its banks, fishing its waters, and providing services to passing traffic.

None of these villages are large or significant. They pay nominal taxes to no one in particular, maintain careful neutrality between Gnotobi and the powers that covet it, and prosper quietly in the shadow of the drug trade they pretend not to notice.

### The River Road

A track follows the Golden River from Orangeport to Gnotobi, used by travelers who prefer land to water or need to move faster than river traffic allows. The road is maintained—barely—by no one in particular, kept passable mainly by constant use.

Walking the River Road takes roughly a week. Riding cuts that to three or four days. Either option is slower than river travel but provides alternatives for those avoiding the water or unable to afford passage.

## Goldwood

Tags: forest, geography, ve, avalon

A sacred forest in western Avalon, between the settled heartland and Munari Inlet. The trees here have distinctive golden-yellow bark that catches afternoon light, making the forest seem to glow from within. The Temptari consider Goldwood sacred to the aspect of time governing autumn and endings.

### Character

Goldwood covers roughly 80 square miles of western Avalon, spreading from the coastal hills to the edge of the Honor River valley. The dominant trees are a species found nowhere else on Ve—tall hardwoods with smooth, golden bark and leaves that turn brilliant orange in autumn. Even in other seasons, the bark retains its warm color.

The forest floor is carpeted with fallen leaves that decompose slowly, building up into a soft, rustling layer that muffles footsteps. Light filters through the canopy in golden shafts. The overall effect is one of perpetual late afternoon, even at midday.

### Religious Significance

Pilgrims visit Goldwood to contemplate mortality and endings. The forest represents the final season of life, the time when work is done and harvest gathered, when what remains is reflection and rest. Elderly Temptari often make a final pilgrimage here, walking among the golden trees before returning home to await death.

Small shrines dot the forest's edge, maintained by priests who help pilgrims interpret what they experience among the trees. Deeper in, the forest is left wild—the priests say the dying need no guides in their final season.

### Practical Use

Despite its sacred status, Goldwood is not forbidden territory. Logging operations work the northern edges, harvesting the golden-barked trees for furniture and ritual implements. The wood is prized for its color and durability; items made from Goldwood timber are considered auspicious for elderly owners.

The forest also provides game, nuts, and medicinal plants. Temptari declared for forestry spend part of their training here, learning to take from the forest without diminishing it.

### Location

Goldwood lies between the main population centers and Munari Inlet, roughly 30 miles west of Tarolin. The main road to Ismail skirts its northern edge.

## Hardshell Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, ve, krell

A diagonal range running through the northern Krell Lands, the Hardshell Mountains are the insectoid heartland—the most densely populated Krell territory on Ve. Multiple queens have carved their hives into these peaks, their tunnels extending miles beneath the surface.

### Geography

The Hardshells run roughly northeast to southwest for about eighty miles, rising from the jungle floor to peaks exceeding six thousand feet. The range gets its name from the mineral composition of its rock—dense metalite deposits give the mountains a shell-like iridescence when struck by sunlight, and the stone itself resists erosion to an unusual degree.

The terrain is rugged. Cliffs, gorges, and knife-ridge peaks make surface travel difficult even without the Krell presence. Streams cascade down from the heights, feeding Snakemarsh to the south and eventually reaching Meadow Sound.

### The Hives

The Hardshells host the largest concentration of Krell hives on the continent. At least five major queens maintain territory here, their domains separated by natural barriers and the scars of ancient territorial wars.

**The Mother of Shells** — The largest hive occupies the central Hardshells, ruled by a queen whose soldiers are distinguished by unusually thick carapaces. This hive alone is estimated at over two hundred thousand individuals. The Mother has held her territory for at least three human generations.

**The Burrower** — A queen whose hive specializes in tunneling. Her workers have excavated an underground network that extends well beyond the mountains, possibly reaching as far as the Suki Hills. Yuki's burner teams have collapsed dozens of her tunnels over the years.

**The Clutch Sisters** — An unusual arrangement where three smaller queens maintain cooperative territories in the southern Hardshells. Whether this represents a genuine alliance or simply queens too weak to destroy each other remains unclear.

### The Hive Wars

Krell queens compete for territory, resources, and genetic supremacy. When conflict erupts between hives, the battles can devastate entire valleys. Millions of Krell have died in these wars over the centuries—their chitin fields littering the mountain slopes, slowly being reclaimed by jungle growth.

These internal conflicts are the main reason the Krell haven't swept westward. The queens spend more energy fighting each other than expanding. Yuki's strategists actively monitor hive politics, hoping to identify patterns that might predict when a queen will turn her attention outward.

### What Remains

Before the Consumption, the Hardshells were home to mining communities, trading posts, and at least one small kingdom. These settlements were among the first to fall when the Krell arrived. Their ruins dot the mountains—empty towns, collapsed mine entrances, the occasional fortress still visible on defensible peaks.

The Krell ignore these structures. They have no use for buildings designed for creatures with different body plans. The ruins stand as they fell, preserved by the dry mountain air, occasionally explored by treasure hunters willing to risk the hive territories.

**Irongate** — The largest pre-Krell settlement, once a mining center controlling access to the metalite deposits. Its walls still stand on a mountain saddle, its gates still closed. No one has entered in over two centuries.

### The Metalite

The Hardshells contain rich deposits of metalite—a mineral prized for its resonance properties. Metalite alloys hold enchantments longer and more stably than standard metals, making them valuable for magical item construction.

The Krell don't mine metalite. They don't use metal at all. But they've incorporated the substance into their hives regardless—metalite threads through many tunnel walls, and some soldiers have carapaces with a distinctive metallic sheen. Whether they're absorbing the mineral incidentally or deliberately remains debated.

Regardless, Hardshell metalite commands extraordinary prices. A single pound is worth more than most laborers earn in a year. This has driven countless expeditions into the mountains, most of which don't return.

### Approaching the Hardshells

The Shell Road from the Suki Hills provides the most direct approach, following a river valley into the range's western foothills. This route passes close to the Burrower's territory—travelers must watch for tunnel entrances and scout patrols.

An alternate approach from the south passes through Snakemarsh, avoiding the densest hive concentrations but adding days of travel through difficult wetlands. Most expeditions choose the faster, more dangerous route.

The eastern approaches are rarely used. The terrain is worse, the hives more active, and there's no clear path back to friendly territory if things go wrong.

## Hills of Dolor

Tags: hills, geography, region

The hills where the nameless come to die—or to begin again.

The Hills of Dolor are a barren expanse of rocky ridges and sun-scorched valleys in north-central Ve, wedged between the Dunes of Evioli to the east and the plains of Sestros to the west. The name translates from old Shyonan as "Hills of Grief," and for most of Ve's history, that grief was literal: these hills were where Shyona sent its exiles to perish.

### Geography

The Hills of Dolor cover roughly two thousand square miles of broken terrain. Low ridges of red and ochre rock alternate with narrow valleys where seasonal streams flow during the brief rainy season. The soil is poor, the vegetation sparse—tough scrub, twisted thorn trees, and the occasional cactus adapted to months without rain.

Water exists but must be found. Deep wells tap into underground aquifers, and a few permanent springs emerge from the rock in sheltered valleys. Those who know where to find water can survive here. Those who don't find bones.

The hills transition gradually into the Dunes of Evioli to the east, the rocky terrain giving way to sandy desert as elevation drops toward Gnotobi's lake basin. To the west, the land flattens into Sestros's plains. To the south, the terrain rises toward the Widebarrow Mountains.

### The Cydoris River

The **Cydoris River** flows through the southwestern Hills of Dolor, emerging from springs in the high ground and cutting a winding path northeast toward the Golden River system. The Cydoris is seasonal—a rushing torrent during the rains, a trickle or dry bed during the long dry season. Its banks support the only significant vegetation in the western hills.

The **Marshal River** joins the Cydoris from the south, draining the northern slopes of the Widebarrows. Together, they eventually feed the Golden River that flows through Gnotobi.

**Cydorite Bluff** rises along the Cydoris's course, a dramatic cliff formation where the river has carved through layers of colored stone over millennia. The bluff is visible for miles and serves as a navigation landmark for travelers crossing the hills.

### History

For centuries before Keshwindi existed, the Hills of Dolor were simply *where exiles went*. Shyonan custom held that those stripped of name and clan should walk into the western desert and never return. Most complied—where else could they go? The hills were not a destination but an ending.

The bones of those who died here are everywhere. Old campsites, abandoned shelters, the remnants of desperate last efforts to survive. The hills earned their name honestly.

When the exiles who became Keshwindi decided to live instead of die, they broke a tradition that had lasted generations. They found the wells, learned the land, and built a city in defiance of what these hills were supposed to mean. The name remains as a reminder—and as a warning to Shyona about what happens when you underestimate the condemned.

### Keshwindi

The city-state of **Keshwindi** occupies the most habitable portion of the Hills of Dolor, clustered around a series of deep wells in a protected valley. It is the only significant settlement in the region.

See [Keshwindi](Keshwindi.md) for full details.

### Hazards

The Hills of Dolor are not actively hostile, merely indifferent. The hazards are environmental:

**Dehydration**: Water sources are scattered and easily missed. Travelers without local knowledge or adequate supplies die regularly.

**Heat**: Summer temperatures exceed human tolerance. Travel during the day is inadvisable; most crossing attempts happen at night or during the brief spring and autumn seasons.

**Flash Floods**: During the rains, dry valleys become torrents without warning. The Cydoris and its tributaries can rise ten feet in an hour.

**Wildlife**: Desert predators—primarily serpents and large hunting cats—avoid humans when possible but will take advantage of the weak or sleeping.

**Bandits**: Small groups of raiders sometimes operate in the hills, preying on travelers and Gnotobi caravans. The Goldwatch deals with them harshly when caught.

### Travel

Few enter the Hills of Dolor by choice. Those who do are typically:

- Exiles from Shyona, making the traditional walk into disgrace
- Traders using the overland route between Sestros and the Dunes of Evioli (a poor alternative to the Golden River, but sometimes necessary)
- Goldwatch patrols securing the western approaches to Gnotobi
- Prospectors hoping to find copper or other minerals worth the effort of extraction

The journey from Shyona's western borders to Keshwindi takes roughly two weeks on foot, longer if you don't know where the wells are. Many don't make it.

## Honor Creek

Tags: river, creek, geography, ve, avalon

A tributary of the Honor River, branching northeast through Shorolyn Forest before joining the main watercourse. The creek drains the northeastern highlands and passes through terrain where the Temptari believe glimpses of the future can be found—for those foolish enough to seek them.

### Course

Honor Creek splits from the Honor River roughly 20 miles east of Tarolin, flowing northeast through the edge of Shorolyn Forest before curving back to rejoin the main watershed. The total length is perhaps 40 miles—a modest waterway by Ve standards, but significant for the settlements along its banks.

The creek is shallow and fast-moving, tumbling over rocky beds in the higher stretches before slowing as it approaches the main river. Not navigable, but reliable for water supply and small-scale irrigation.

### The Vision Pools

Certain pools along Honor Creek are said to grant visions of the future to those who drink from them. The priests neither confirm nor deny this—they simply warn that unguided visions bring madness more often than wisdom.

The pools are not marked. Finding them requires local knowledge or dumb luck. Some seekers spend years walking the creek's length without success. Others stumble onto a vision pool their first day and never recover from what they see.

The visions, when they come, are fragmentary and contextless. A face you'll meet in ten years. A building that will burn. Your own death, or someone else's. Without the Ecclesiarch's interpretive framework, these glimpses illuminate nothing—they just add knowledge without understanding, which the priests consider worse than ignorance.

### Settlements

Several towns cluster along Honor Creek:
- **Civicvler**: Near the creek's headwaters, in the Shorolyn Forest
- **Sarihalliler**: Downstream, where the terrain begins to level
- **Kochisar**: Near where the creek approaches the main Honor River system

These towns are small, dependent on forestry and the creek's water supply. Their priests maintain shrines warning visitors about the vision pools—and, some say, maintaining records of who goes looking for them.

### Location

Honor Creek flows through northeastern Avalon, roughly 30 miles from the Dern border at its closest point.

See [Honor River](./Honor River.md) and [Avalon](./Avalon.md) for broader context.

## Honor River

Tags: river, geography, ve, avalon

The central waterway of Avalon, flowing from the eastern highlands westward through the kingdom's heart before emptying into Munari Inlet. The Honor River valley contains Avalon's best farmland, its capital city, and most of its population.

### Course

The Honor River rises in the foothills where Avalon meets Dern, fed by snowmelt from the Widebarrow Mountains. It flows roughly 120 miles westward, passing through Tarolin before reaching Munari Inlet. The river is navigable for most of its length—shallow-draft boats carry goods between the coast and the interior.

Major tributaries include **Honor Creek** to the northeast and **Pale Run** to the south. The river also spreads into **Honor Moss**, a marshy region near Tarolin where the current slows and wetlands form.

### Settlements

The densest population in Avalon clusters along the Honor River. Tarolin, the capital, sits at the river's central bend. Smaller towns dot the banks upstream and down: Zindi, Incebolu, Kenzek, Burga, and dozens of villages dependent on the river for water, irrigation, and transport.

The main road through Avalon roughly parallels the river, connecting the coastal port of Ismail to the eastern settlements and eventually to Dern.

### Religious Significance

The Temptari don't worship the river itself, but they view it as evidence of the Ecclesiarch's providence. The river flows exactly where Avalon needs it, providing water to the fertile heartland, defense for the capital, and a transport route to the sea. This perfection is attributed to the Ecclesiarch's foresight—or perhaps to divine ordering of the land to match his visions.

Certain pools along the river are said to grant visions to those who drink from them. The priests warn against seeking such visions without guidance; uninterpreted glimpses of the future bring confusion more often than clarity.

### Practical Value

The Honor River makes central Avalon habitable and prosperous. Its waters irrigate the fields that feed the population. Its current carries trade goods. Its valley provides the flat, fertile land where most Temptari live and work.

Without the river, Avalon would be a minor forest kingdom. With it, the theocracy commands the most productive agricultural land on western Ve.

## Howlwood

Tags: forest, geography, edari, ve

A dense forest sprawling across northeastern Edari, where the golden savannah gives way to thick woodland near the coast of Coquray Sound. The forest earned its name from the eerie howling that echoes through the trees at night—a sound that carries for miles across the surrounding grassland.

### Character

Howlwood is darker and cooler than the surrounding savannah, its canopy thick enough to block the harsh Ve sun. The trees are ancient, their trunks wide enough for several people to hide behind, their roots tangled and treacherous. Undergrowth is sparse where the canopy is densest, but clearings and edges are choked with thorny brush.

The forest feels old in a way the savannah doesn't. The Korel hunt its edges but won't go deep.

### The Howling

The sound comes from **wind-singers**—massive, solitary apes that claim territories deep within the forest. Each adult stands eight to ten feet tall, covered in dark fur that blends perfectly with the shadows under the canopy. They're nocturnal, emerging at dusk to hunt and patrol their domains.

The "howling" is territorial communication. Each wind-singer maintains a territory of several square miles and calls nightly to warn neighbors away. The calls carry extraordinary distances—a quirk of the forest's acoustics amplifies them, sending the sound rolling across the savannah like distant thunder. Multiple wind-singers calling creates the eerie, almost musical quality that gives the forest its name.

Wind-singers are apex predators. They hunt by ambush, dropping from branches onto prey below. A single wind-singer can kill a leopard; a Korel hunting party that wanders into one's territory rarely returns intact. The Korel learned this lesson generations ago. They hunt the forest's edges, take what game strays out, and don't push deeper. Pride isn't worth dying for.

The creatures are fiercely territorial toward each other as well. They don't form groups. Encounters between wind-singers typically end in one retreating or dying. This limits their population—Howlwood supports perhaps two dozen adults at any time—but makes each one extraordinarily dangerous within its domain.

### Why It Matters

Howlwood is one of the few places in Edari where the Korel aren't the apex predator. Travelers who think "the Korel avoid it, so it must be safe" have the situation exactly backwards. The forest offers no safe passage—only a choice between leopard-folk who might let you live and giant apes who definitely won't.

The forest also blocks the most direct overland route from Coquray Sound to the interior, funneling any movement around its edges—right through Korel territory.

## Jaipon

Tags: ruins, fortress, ve, krell

The ruined fortress-city of Jaipon stands at the edge of Blisterswamp, its towers still visible above the jungle canopy after two centuries of abandonment. Once the seat of the Jaipon Confederacy, it fell to the Krell during the Consumption and has remained untouched ever since—a monument to what the insects destroyed.

### History

The Jaipon Confederacy was a political alliance of seven city-states that controlled the western Krell Lands for nearly four centuries before the Consumption. The fortress-city of Jaipon served as the confederacy's administrative capital, housing the Council of Seven and serving as the repository for the alliance's collective treasury.

The confederacy's founders chose the site deliberately. Blisterswamp protected the western approaches; the jungle terrain complicated assault from other directions; the city's walls and towers provided layered defenses against conventional enemies. The strategy worked for generations.

When the Krell came, they came from the north—directions the confederacy's defenses weren't designed to handle. The other six cities fell first, their refugees flooding toward Jaipon. The fortress-city held for three years, its walls protecting a swelling population of survivors, before the insects found a way through.

What happened inside during those final days is unknown. No one escaped to tell the story.

### The Ruins

Jaipon's outer walls remain standing, thirty feet of stone and earth that the jungle hasn't managed to topple. The main gates are closed and apparently intact—massive iron-bound doors that no one has opened from either side in over two centuries.

Within the walls, towers rise above the canopy. Observers from safe distances have counted at least a dozen still standing, though partial collapses have taken others. The layout suggests a city designed for defense at multiple levels, with inner walls, fortified buildings, and what appear to be underground sections.

The Krell left the structures intact. They had no use for stone walls and human architecture. Whatever they wanted from Jaipon, it wasn't the buildings.

### What Might Remain

The Jaipon Confederacy was wealthy. Four centuries of trade, taxation, and resource extraction had filled the treasury vaults with gold, gems, and magical artifacts accumulated from across eastern Ve. When the other cities fell, their portable wealth was sent to Jaipon for safekeeping.

If the vaults weren't emptied before the fall—and there's no evidence they were—their contents still lie beneath the ruins. Conservative estimates suggest wealth comparable to a small kingdom's annual revenue. Optimistic estimates are considerably higher.

Beyond treasure, Jaipon likely contains:

- **Historical records** — The confederacy's archives, documenting the lost civilizations of eastern Ve
- **Magical artifacts** — Items accumulated over four centuries from across the region
- **The bodies** — Whatever happened to Jaipon's final population

### The Approaches

Reaching Jaipon requires crossing either Krell territory or Blisterswamp—both options carry extreme risk.

**From the north** — Through the jungle past Snakemarsh, avoiding Krell patrol routes. This is the longer, more commonly attempted route. Expedition teams from Yuki typically take this approach, spending weeks in Krell territory before reaching the fortress-city's northern gates.

**From the west** — Across Blisterswamp from Chimean territory. Faster but physically brutal. The few successful crossings have emerged onto the fortress-city's western walls, which might offer entry points the Krell haven't thought to monitor.

Both approaches end at sealed gates and walls. Getting into the city presents its own challenges.

### Krell Activity

The Krell maintain an unusual presence around Jaipon. Scout patrols circle the walls regularly, more frequently than terrain or resources would seem to justify. Workers have been observed examining the walls, though they don't damage them. Occasionally, larger groups gather near the gates for unknown purposes before dispersing.

This behavior has generated speculation:

- **Something inside attracts them** — Pheromone traces from the final siege, perhaps, or something older
- **Something inside repels them** — Like the Winger Mountains, Jaipon might contain defenses the Krell can't overcome
- **The city is important to them** — For reasons that don't translate to human understanding

Whatever the explanation, the Krell presence makes approaching Jaipon dangerous. The insects don't inhabit the city, but they watch it.

### Expeditions

Multiple expeditions have attempted to reach Jaipon over the past two centuries. Most failed in Krell territory before reaching the city. A handful reached the walls. None have returned with confirmed entry.

The most recent serious attempt, roughly thirty years ago, involved a well-funded Chimean expedition that crossed Blisterswamp with specialized equipment. They reached the western walls and found what appeared to be a breach—a section where the stonework had partially collapsed. Radio contact (via aether communication devices) continued for two days after they entered.

Then silence. No survivors. No bodies. No explanation.

Yuki's records list the expedition as "presumed lost to interior hazards." What those hazards might be, no one knows.

## Keshwindi

Tags: citystate, settlement

The city-state of the nameless. Keshwindi rises from the Hills of Dolor like a rebuke to the desert that was meant to kill its founders—a sprawl of mud-brick buildings, shaded markets, and terraced gardens fed by deep wells. Its people are halflings: small in stature, fierce in pride, and bound together by the shared disgrace that brought them here.

### The Nameless Ones

Keshwindi's population descends from exiles. In Shyona, to betray one's family is the ultimate dishonor. The punishment is exile and the stripping of one's name—offenders become *nobody*, erased from family records, forbidden to speak their former identity. These nameless ones were sent into the desert to die.

They didn't.

The first exiles who survived the Hills of Dolor were Shontobi nobles and the servants who followed them into disgrace. Over generations, these two groups merged. Former masters and former servants rebuilt themselves as something new: a people defined not by the families that rejected them, but by their refusal to disappear. They call themselves halflings—reclaiming the Shontobi slur for the nameless ("half-people," those without identity) as a badge of defiance.

Physically, Keshwindi halflings are shorter than their Shontobi ancestors, a trait that emerged over centuries of intermarriage and harsh desert conditions. Whether this is natural adaptation or something stranger—some whisper of old curses woven into Shontobi bloodlines—remains debated by scholars who will never receive a straight answer from Keshwindi itself.

### Princess Keleila Watazari

Keshwindi is ruled absolutely by Princess Keleila Watazari, called the "Desert Beauty" across Ve. She holds no council, recognizes no nobles, answers to no law but her own judgment. Her word reshapes Keshwindi's policies overnight. Her displeasure ends careers—or lives.

She chooses mercy.

Exiles arrive in Keshwindi broken: nameless, ashamed, often starving from the journey through the Hills of Dolor. Keleila welcomes them. She provides housing, work, a place in her city. She asks nothing of their past crimes. In Keshwindi, everyone begins again.

This generosity is genuine—and calculated. Keleila understands that every exile she saves becomes loyal to her personally, not to whatever faction or family they once served. Her kindness builds an unshakeable power base of people who owe her everything.

The other edge of her rule is less visible but no less real. Those who threaten Keshwindi, who scheme against her, who attempt to exploit her mercy—they discover why no coup has ever succeeded. Keleila was a legendary blade-dancer before her own exile, trained in Shyona's deadliest schools. She remains dangerous. More dangerous still is her network of utterly loyal agents, many of them exiles who repay her welcome with absolute devotion.

She is not soft. She has chosen kindness from a position of absolute strength.

### The Goldwatch Compact

Keshwindi is poor. The Hills of Dolor produce little—some copper mining, goat herding, subsistence gardens around the wells. What Keshwindi has is *people*: generations of exiles who were once Shontobi warriors, trained from childhood in the blade.

Gnotobi, the neighboring city-state, is rich beyond measure—but its ruling merchant families are schemers, not fighters. They need protection for their drug caravans, their river shipments, their council members' lives.

The **Goldwatch Compact** binds the two city-states. Keshwindi provides soldiers; Gnotobi provides gold.

The **Goldwatch** mercenary company is Keshwindi's largest employer. Mostly halfling warriors, they guard Orange Flake shipments along the Golden River, patrol Gnotobi's streets, and provide muscle for the Harvest Council's internal disputes. The work pays well. The irony is bitter: exiled for dishonor, now selling their swords to protect a drug empire.

Princess Keleila negotiated the Compact and takes a percentage of every Goldwatch contract. This is how she funds Keshwindi's generosity—her open arms are paid for in Orange Flake money. She doesn't discuss this publicly.

### Society and Culture

Keshwindi operates on deliberate amnesia. No one asks about your past. No one uses family names. Children are raised communally in neighborhood groups rather than households, preventing the reformation of dynastic structures. The only titles that matter are those earned in Keshwindi itself.

This creates a society of radical equality and radical instability. Without family networks, status depends entirely on current reputation. A merchant can rise to prominence in a decade; a falling-out with the wrong people can destroy everything just as fast. Keshwindi politics are vicious precisely because no one has inherited protection.

The exception is Princess Keleila herself, whose position has solidified over her long reign into something approaching sacred. To most Keshwindi, she *is* the city.

### Architecture and Layout

Keshwindi clusters around its wells. The city has no walls—the desert itself is defense enough—but its buildings press close together, creating shaded alleyways and covered markets that stay cool even in the worst heat. Mud-brick construction dominates, with buildings rarely exceeding two stories. Wealthier residents paint their homes in desert colors: ochre, sand, rust-red.

The **Princess's House** is modest by the standards of rulers—a sprawling compound rather than a palace, distinguished mainly by its gardens. Keleila receives petitioners in an open courtyard, sitting on cushions like everyone else.

### Relations

**Gnotobi**: Economic partnership through the Goldwatch Compact. Gnotobi needs Keshwindi's soldiers; Keshwindi needs Gnotobi's gold. Neither city fully trusts the other.

**Shyona**: Officially, Shyona considers Keshwindi a den of criminals and traitors. Unofficially, Shyona's noble houses rely on Keshwindi's existence—it gives them somewhere to send exiles rather than executing them. Some houses maintain quiet contacts, occasionally "losing" family members to the desert rather than acknowledging their disgrace publicly.

**Sestros**: Minimal contact. Sestros lies to the west, separated by more desert. Some trade passes through, but neither state has much the other wants.

## Krell Lands

Tags: jungle, region, ve, krell

A colossal expanse of jungle in southeastern Ve, consumed by the Krell over the past three centuries. What was once a patchwork of human kingdoms, elvish enclaves, and free cities is now a chitinous nightmare—millions of insectoid creatures serving their queens beneath the canopy.

### The Consumption

The Krell arrived from somewhere else. No one knows where—the swarmings simply began appearing from the deep jungle around 3100 SD, overwhelming settlements faster than messengers could carry warnings. Within two generations, every civilization east of the Suki Hills had fallen.

The pattern was always the same: scouts first, then workers preparing the ground, then the swarm itself—a tide of clicking, chittering bodies that stripped a settlement of everything organic. Buildings left standing. Fields reduced to bare soil. People simply gone.

The old kingdoms—Theoron, Valifax, the Jaipon Confederacy—exist now only in histories and the memories of refugees. Their ruins dot the jungle, slowly being digested by roots and fungus, occasionally explored by the suicidal or the desperate.

### Geography

The Krell Lands span roughly three hundred miles from the Suki Hills to the eastern coast, and perhaps two hundred miles from the Dygon Beastlands border in the south to the edges of Shyona's jungle in the north. The terrain varies:

**The Hardshell Mountains** — A diagonal range running through the northern Krell Lands, so named for the thick mineral deposits that give the peaks a shell-like appearance. Multiple Krell hives are carved into these mountains, their tunnel networks extending miles underground.

**The Winger Mountains** — A smaller range in the central-south region. Less extensively colonized by the Krell, possibly because something in these mountains makes them uncomfortable. Local legend speaks of "the stone that burns," though no expedition has survived long enough to verify.

**Snakemarsh** — A vast wetland in the western Krell Lands, fed by streams from the Hardshell Mountains. The Krell avoid deep water, making Snakemarsh one of the few refuges within the territory—though what lives in the marsh is not necessarily friendlier than the insects.

**Blisterswamp** — A caustic wetland near the Chimean border, where geothermal activity creates bubbling pools of acidic water. Another Krell-free zone, for obvious reasons.

**Raptor Hills** — The southeastern corner, where the jungle thins into savannah-like hills. Named for the predatory dinosaurs that hunt here—creatures large enough to be threats even to Krell swarms.

### The Hives

An estimated twelve to fifteen major hives operate within the Krell Lands, each centered on a queen and her attendant population of workers, soldiers, and drones. The hives compete as much as they cooperate—territorial wars between queens are common, and the resulting battles devastate whatever jungle lies between them.

Border-watchers at Yuki and Garlow have given names to the hives they can identify. The names reflect observable characteristics—soldier appearance, behavior patterns, territorial location—but the Krell themselves may have entirely different concepts of identity.

#### Major Hives

**The Mother of Shells** — The largest known hive, occupying the central Hardshell Mountains. Her soldiers display distinctively thick, iridescent carapaces that deflect arrows and resist blades. She has ruled for at least three human generations, suggesting Krell queens can live centuries. Population estimated at 200,000+.

**The Burrower** — A southern Hardshell hive that specializes in subterranean expansion. Her tunnel network extends far beyond her surface territory—possibly reaching beneath the Suki Hills themselves. Yuki's "Burner" teams spend most of their time collapsing her exploratory tunnels before they breach the city's perimeter.

**The Clutch Sisters** — An unusual arrangement in the southern mountains: three smaller queens maintaining cooperative territories. Whether this represents genuine alliance, mutual weakness preventing dominance, or something stranger, observers cannot determine. Together they control perhaps 25,000 individuals.

**The Hollow Queen** — A lowland hive in the eastern jungle, named for the distinctive sound her warriors make—a hollow clicking that carries for miles. Her soldiers are lighter, faster, optimized for pursuit rather than siege. Raids attributed to her hive penetrate further into surviving human settlements than any other.

**Ironjaw** — A northern hive whose soldiers develop enlarged mandibles capable of severing limbs. Smaller than the Mother of Shells (~80,000) but ferociously territorial. The ruins of Jaipon sit within her claimed territory—she posts guards around the old city walls but never enters.

**The Weaver** — A hive specializing in web-like structures made from secreted resin. Her territory in the eastern lowlands is almost impassable—sticky threads span between trees, anchor to the ground, create three-dimensional mazes that trap prey and invaders alike. Smaller than most major hives but nearly impossible to assault.

**The Brood Eternal** — A hive in the far eastern jungle known for prolific reproduction. Her soldiers are individually weaker but she produces them faster than any other queen. Border-watchers believe she's lost three territorial wars to neighboring hives but rebuilt her population within a decade each time.

**The Silent Swarm** — A hive whose soldiers make almost no sound—no clicking, no chittering, no warning. Expeditions have been overwhelmed without any auditory warning. Her territory in the western Krell Lands borders the Snakemarsh, and her scouts probe the wetland edges constantly, testing whether water truly stops them.

**The Sculptor** — A hive whose workers create elaborate structures from chewed wood and secreted adhesive. Her territory contains the most visible Krell architecture—spires and domes rising above the canopy, visible from miles away. Some scholars believe she's attempting to recreate something the species remembers from wherever they came from.

**The Pale Tide** — A coastal hive whose soldiers display bleached, almost white carapaces. She controls territory along the eastern shore, including approaches to Chitin Cove. Her swarmings follow tidal patterns—most active during new moons, nearly dormant during full moons. The reason is unknown.

#### Lesser Hives

Beyond the major queens, dozens of smaller hives persist in the spaces between—some with only a few thousand individuals, perpetually struggling to grow before larger neighbors absorb or destroy them. These minor hives represent opportunity for the desperate: smaller, less organized, theoretically assailable by well-equipped expeditions.

No such expedition has succeeded.

#### Hive Dynamics

The queens don't coordinate. Territorial conflicts are constant, with battles consuming thousands of soldiers on both sides. These wars benefit everyone outside the Krell Lands—resources spent fighting each other aren't spent expanding westward.

But the border-watchers have noticed a troubling pattern. The larger hives grow larger. The Mother of Shells has absorbed at least two minor hives in the past decade. If one queen eventually dominates the others, unified swarmings would follow.

The Krell haven't tried to push west in force since the Consumption ended. Yet.

### What Survives

Not everything died when the Krell came. Some creatures proved too dangerous, too fast, or too unpalatable to consume. The Raptor Hills still host their namesake predators. The swamps shelter their own ecosystems. And deep in the jungle, certain things have learned to coexist with the Krell—or to hide from them.

Rumors persist of survivors within the Krell Lands: isolated communities that found ways to avoid detection, refugees who never made it out, even collaborators who've reached some form of accommodation with the hives. These stories are impossible to verify without entering the territory, which few attempt.

### The Ruins

The old civilizations left behind cities, fortresses, and monuments that the Krell have no interest in destroying. These structures stand empty, slowly decaying, occasionally raided by treasure hunters willing to risk the swarms.

**Jaipon** — A fortress-city near Blisterswamp, once the seat of the Jaipon Confederacy. Its walls still stand, its towers still visible above the canopy. No one has entered and returned in over a century.

**Tomb of Theoron** — The burial complex of King Theoron III, last ruler of the kingdom that bore his name. Located in the Winger Mountains, supposedly containing the accumulated wealth of a three-century dynasty. The Krell show unusual interest in this site—workers patrol its perimeter, though they don't seem to enter.

### The Border

The Suki Hills mark the western edge of the Krell Lands—the frontier where Chimea's expansion meets the insects' expansion. Two city-states, Yuki and Garlow, have established themselves in these hills as watchposts and trading centers for those foolish enough to venture into Krell territory.

The border is not stable. Krell scouts probe westward constantly. Occasionally a small hive attempts to establish beyond the hills, triggering military responses from Yuki and Garlow. Larger swarmings—when a queen leads her followers to establish new territory—have not occurred in the direction of Chimea yet.

Yet.

### Chitin Cove

The only safe landing point on the Krell Lands coast, Chitin Cove is named for the shells that wash up on its beaches—cast-off exoskeletons from Krell molting cycles. Ships occasionally anchor here to trade with the coast-dwellers who've survived by staying mobile and watching the treeline.

## Lake Splendor

A small alpine lake nestled in a cirque between the highest peaks of the central Widebarrow Mountains, on the border between Dern and Thorum. The light leyline runs directly beneath it, and the Palace of Light stands on its western shore.

### Properties

The water is unnaturally clear—so transparent that the bottom appears visible even at its deepest point (roughly 200 feet). This is the leyline's influence: light penetrates where physics says it shouldn't.

The lake never freezes. Even in the harshest mountain winters, when ice locks the surrounding peaks, Lake Splendor steams gently, its surface catching and holding whatever light touches it. On overcast days, the water glows faintly from within—stored sunlight slowly releasing.

Local legend claims anything submerged in Lake Splendor casts no shadow for seven days after removal. Dernish miners test for curses this way: if your shadow returns early, something's wrong with you.

### The Drowned Garden

Visible through the crystalline water, ancient stone structures cover the lake floor—temples or monuments from a civilization that predates the current mountain states. No one has successfully explored them. Divers report that descending past thirty feet causes disorientation: up and down become indistinguishable when light comes from everywhere equally. Several expeditions have drowned swimming confidently toward what they believed was the surface.

Scholars believe the lake-floor ruins predate humanity on Ve. Some theorize they were built by the same civilization that created the Shepherds' Stones in Edari—giant worked-stone formations whose purpose remains unknown. If the Garden could be explored, it might reveal secrets about Ve's pre-human history. The Order of the Aureate Eye forbids attempts, citing the danger. Critics suspect they've already found something and are keeping it secret.

## Locquine

Tags: citystate, ve, pixie, fae

A city-state deep in the jungles of southern Ve, ruled by pixies whose perception of reality has fundamentally diverged from that of other races. Outsiders call them insane. The Locquine pixies call everyone else blind.

### The Weeping Wood

The jungle surrounding Locquine grows thick and strange. Trees here weep a pale sap that glows faintly at night, and the canopy filters sunlight into shifting patterns that seem to move with intention. The Misery River and its countless tributaries thread through this forest, their waters carrying something that has shaped everything living here for millennia.

The pixies of Locquine drink from the Misery River. They bathe in it. They sing to it. Over generations, this has changed them. They hear frequencies of Faesong that other pixies cannot—deeper notes, older harmonics, sounds that predate the imprisonment of Melera. Whether this is enlightenment or corruption depends on who you ask.

### The Discordant Court

Locquine has no formal government recognizable to outsiders. The pixies organize around what they call "truth-lines"—invisible currents of meaning that they perceive flowing through reality. Those who can read the truth-lines most clearly become guides; those who cannot follow or fall.

To visitors, this appears as chaos. Pixies interrupt conversations to address empty air. They laugh at nothing, weep at sunshine, and occasionally fly in spiraling formations for hours without explanation. Negotiations are impossible in any conventional sense—the pixies respond to questions that weren't asked and ignore questions that were.

Yet Locquine persists. The pixies build elaborate structures from woven vines and river-clay. They maintain gardens of medicinal plants. They wage coordinated defense against jungle predators with uncanny effectiveness, as if they know where threats will emerge before they do.

### The Misery's Gift

The Misery River's waters produce a specific effect on non-pixies: crushing, inexplicable sorrow. Travelers who drink from it report sudden grief—memories of losses they haven't experienced, mourning for people they've never met. The effect fades within hours for small amounts, but prolonged exposure has driven explorers to suicide.

For pixies, the effect is different. The sorrow becomes perception. They see the accumulated grief of the forest—every death, every loss, every moment of suffering that has occurred in this jungle since the Second Eon. The Locquine pixies don't consider this a burden. They consider it truth.

Some scholars theorize the Misery River's source lies somewhere in the mountains to the northwest, where something ancient bleeds its pain into the watershed. The pixies refuse to discuss it. When asked, they simply say: "She remembers. We remember with her."

### Relations with Outsiders

Locquine tolerates visitors who follow the unspoken rules—rules that visitors cannot perceive and therefore inevitably break. The pixies have killed traders for stepping on the wrong patch of moss. They've showered gifts on explorers for breathing at the right rhythm. There is no predicting them.

What makes Locquine valuable despite the danger: the pixies create things. Weavings that show glimpses of possible futures. Elixirs that grant temporary truth-sight (and temporary madness). Maps of places that don't exist yet. Those brave or desperate enough to trade with Locquine sometimes emerge with artifacts worth fortunes—if they emerge at all.

The safest approach, according to the few repeat visitors, is to bring gifts of music. The pixies respond well to songs, especially sad ones. They'll gather to listen, swaying in unison, and afterward are more likely to engage in something resembling rational exchange.

### The Five Who Speak

Among the thousands of pixies in Locquine, five have learned to translate between their perception and that of outsiders. They call themselves the Five Who Speak, and they serve as the closest thing Locquine has to diplomats. Each speaks in riddles, but the riddles contain real information if properly decoded.

The Five rotate. When one dies or "ascends" (a process the pixies celebrate but don't explain), another learns the art of speaking to the blind. Currently:

- **Whispergleam** — Speaks through questions, never statements
- **Thornlace** — Speaks only in metaphors involving water
- **Mothquiet** — Speaks backward; requires patience to understand
- **Sungrief** — Speaks normally but lies constantly; the lies encode truth
- **Rootsong** — Speaks through humming; words emerge from the melody

### What Outsiders Miss

The pixies of Locquine are not broken. They function according to a logic that incorporates information others cannot access. When they stare at empty space, they're watching the truth-lines. When they laugh at nothing, they've perceived something genuinely funny in the pattern of reality. When they attack without provocation, they've seen a threat that hasn't manifested yet.

Whether this makes them prophets or psychotics is an ongoing debate among scholars. The pixies themselves find the question meaningless.

## Lurza

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi, ve, sestros, daemon

A fortress of black volcanic glass standing at the western edge of the Red Desert, where the Shepherds' Stones meet the arid sands. Lurza was built by followers of the daemon Vekkroth before Talresses drove that rival power from Ve. The fortress remains intact, its gates standing open, its halls empty—a monument to a war the Shailin have been taught to forget.

### History

Vekkroth and Talresses both sought worshippers among the early human settlers of western Ve. For generations they competed, their cults growing in parallel, each daemon whispering promises of power and purpose to different communities. The conflict turned violent when the cults grew large enough to matter.

Talresses won. His followers were more numerous, more organized, more willing to fight for their god. Vekkroth's cult was destroyed—their priests killed, their temples burned, their worshippers forced to convert or die. The daemon itself was expelled from Ve, driven to seek followers elsewhere.

Lurza was Vekkroth's primary temple. The cult imported volcanic glass from across the sea to build it, constructing walls of gleaming black stone that stood in stark contrast to the golden rock of the surrounding mountains. The architecture followed Vekkroth's alien aesthetic: wrong angles, windowless halls, chambers designed for rituals no Shailin ever learned.

When the cult fell, no one destroyed Lurza. Perhaps the victors feared what breaking it might release. Perhaps Talresses wanted it left standing as a warning. The fortress was simply abandoned, its gates left open, its halls left dark.

### Present Day

Lurza stands exactly as it was left centuries ago. Wind and sand have scoured the exterior but done little structural damage—volcanic glass is hard, and Vekkroth's builders knew their craft. The gates remain open. The courtyards lie empty. The interior halls are dark, silent, and untouched.

The Shailin avoid Lurza completely. Talresses teaches that it is cursed, that entering brings spiritual contamination, that some places should remain undisturbed. He doesn't explain why. The Shailin don't ask.

The Korel avoid it too. They sense something wrong about the place—a lingering wrongness that makes their fur stand on end. Vekkroth's power persists in the stones even without worshippers to sustain it. Not enough to do anything, but enough to feel.

### What's Inside

The fortress contains exactly what you'd expect from an abandoned temple: ritual chambers, priest quarters, storage rooms, and a central sanctum where Vekkroth's worshippers performed their rites. Dust covers everything. Rats have claimed the lower levels. The structural integrity remains sound.

The valuable contents include:
- **Cult records** carved into obsidian tablets, documenting Vekkroth's teachings, rituals, and the history of the daemon war from the losing side
- **Ritual implements** of volcanic glass and strange metals, designed for ceremonies Talresses's followers never learned
- **A reliquary** in the central sanctum containing fragments of offerings to Vekkroth—bones, gems, and objects of unclear purpose
- **The Binding Circle**, a permanent magical construction in the sanctum's floor that once allowed priests to communicate directly with Vekkroth. It still works. The daemon still answers, if someone knows the ritual. No one has called in centuries.

The Binding Circle is why Talresses forbids entry. Not because the fortress is cursed, but because Vekkroth remains accessible to anyone willing to use it. The rival daemon lost Ve but didn't die. It found worshippers elsewhere and would happily reclaim a foothold here if given the chance. Every potential visitor to Lurza is a potential convert.

Talresses solved this problem by making the place taboo. Easier than destroying it—and destruction might have released something worse.

### Location

Lurza sits where the Shepherds' Stones meet the Red Desert, roughly 50 miles northwest of any Sestran settlement. The approach crosses barren terrain with minimal water. Reaching the fortress requires planning; reaching it and returning requires more.

See [Shepherds' Stones](./Shepherds' Stones.md) for the broader geographic context.

## Marmoroy River

Tags: river, geography, ve

The largest northern tributary of the Misery River, the Marmoroy flows south from the highlands near Shyona's interior before joining the main channel east of Locquine. Its waters carry a milder version of the Misery's grief—still melancholic, but more wistful than crushing.

### Course

The Marmoroy rises in the forested hills that mark the transition between Shyona's settled farmland and the wild jungles of the south. It flows generally southwest, gathering smaller streams as it descends through increasingly dense vegetation. The river joins the Misery roughly twenty miles east of Locquine, their combined waters continuing toward Belanorn Bay.

The Marmoroy is navigable for small craft along much of its length, making it the preferred approach for traders seeking to reach the Misery River watershed from Shyona. The journey upstream is demanding but possible, unlike the Misery's main channel where the psychological effects intensify the closer one gets to the source.

### Character

The Marmoroy's waters produce melancholy rather than despair. Travelers report a sense of nostalgic sadness—memories of happier times, awareness of opportunities lost, gentle regret rather than crushing grief. Some find it almost pleasant, in a bittersweet way. Others compare it to the feeling of visiting a childhood home that has changed beyond recognition.

This milder effect likely results from distance. The Marmoroy doesn't flow from whatever contaminates the Misery's source. It merely joins the afflicted water partway through its course, picking up a diluted version of the grief before carrying it to the confluence.

### The Marmoroy Settlements

Several small communities line the Marmoroy's banks, particularly in its upper reaches where the effect is weakest. These villages serve as staging points for expeditions into Locquine territory and as trading posts for jungle products. The largest, **Sorrow's Rest**, sits at the navigable limit of the river—a cluster of perhaps fifty families who've made their peace with perpetual melancholy.

The villagers of the Marmoroy have developed customs around their environment. They celebrate the past rather than the future. They tell stories of the dead with fondness rather than grief. They've found that accepting the sadness rather than fighting it makes life in the watershed bearable.

### Trade Route

The Marmoroy provides the most practical water route into Locquine territory. Traders travel upstream by poled barge, spending several days on the river before transferring to smaller boats at Sorrow's Rest. From there, they can either continue up minor tributaries or travel overland to the Misery's main channel.

This route avoids the worst of the Misery's psychological effects while still providing water transport for bulky goods. The trade is modest but consistent—luxury items heading into Locquine, pixie artifacts heading out, and provisions moving in both directions.

### Why "Marmoroy"

The name comes from an old Shyonan word meaning "remembrance of stone." Early explorers noted that the river's rocky bed seemed to hold echoes of the past—travelers would find themselves remembering events that happened in this place before they arrived, as if the stones themselves retained memories. Whether this is a real phenomenon or simply the river's psychological effects manifesting as vivid imagination remains unclear.

## Marshal River

Tags: river, geography

A tributary of the Cydoris, draining the northern Widebarrow slopes.

The Marshal River flows north from the Widebarrow Mountains, joining the Cydoris River in the Hills of Dolor. It is smaller than the Cydoris but more reliable—fed by snowmelt from the higher peaks, it maintains flow even during the driest months when other water sources fail.

### Course

The Marshal begins high in the Widebarrows, where winter snows accumulate on the northern slopes. Meltwater gathers in steep ravines, cascading down through increasingly gentle terrain until it reaches the hills proper.

The river's upper reaches are impassable—narrow gorges, waterfalls, and unstable slopes that have killed prospectors and explorers for generations. The lower stretches are calmer, the river widening as gradient decreases, becoming navigable (barely) for small craft in its final miles before joining the Cydoris.

### Significance

The Marshal's reliable flow makes it valuable. When the Cydoris dries to pools and the Hills of Dolor become truly deadly, the Marshal still runs. Keshwindi knows this; the city maintains knowledge of the Marshal's course and its water sources as insurance against the worst droughts.

Some believe the Marshal's name commemorates an ancient military figure—perhaps a commander who used the river valley for troop movements, or a general who died here. If so, the story has been lost. The name remains without context.

## Meadow Sound

Tags: sound, geography

A sound in Ve.

TODO

## Misery River

Tags: river, geography, ve, fae

The largest river system in the jungles between Shyona and the Krell Lands, the Misery River drains a vast watershed through a network of tributaries before depositing into Belanorn Bay. Its waters carry an ancient grief that has shaped everything along its banks.

### Course

The Misery River's source remains disputed. The main channel emerges from the mountains northwest of Locquine, fed by dozens of streams that wind down from the highlands. From there, it flows generally eastward, gathering tributaries as it goes—the Marmoroy from the north being the largest. The river passes through or near the pixie city-state of Locquine before continuing through increasingly dense jungle, finally widening as it approaches Belanorn Bay.

The tributary system is extensive. Countless smaller streams feed the Misery, creating a web of waterways that makes overland travel in this region difficult. During wet season, the entire watershed floods, turning low-lying areas into temporary lakes.

### The Water's Nature

Something is wrong with the Misery River. Not poisoned—the water supports abundant life, and drinking it causes no physical harm. But those who drink from it experience sudden, inexplicable sorrow. Memories of grief that isn't theirs. Mourning for losses they've never suffered. The sensation passes within hours for small amounts, but lingers for days after heavy exposure.

Prolonged contact is worse. Explorers who've spent weeks traveling the Misery's tributaries report creeping despair, inability to feel joy, and eventually active suicidal ideation. Several expeditions have lost members to self-inflicted death without any apparent external cause.

The effect doesn't seem to be magical in the conventional sense—no detection spells reveal enchantment, and antimagic fields don't suppress it. Scholars theorize the water carries something older than structured magic, perhaps connected to Faesong or to the emotional residue of an ancient catastrophe.

### The Source

Whatever taints the Misery begins somewhere in the northwestern mountains. Expeditions to find the headwaters have uniformly failed—those who venture too far upstream either turn back overwhelmed by despair or don't return at all. The last documented attempt, funded by Shyonan scholars in 3,298 SD, lost six of eight members to self-inflicted deaths. The survivors reported that the grief became *specific* as they climbed: not random sorrow but the unmistakable sensation of a single consciousness mourning something lost so long ago that time itself had forgotten it.

The pixies of Locquine know something. When asked about the source, they say only: "She remembers. We remember with her."

### Who Remembers

Three theories dominate scholarly debate:

**The Melera Theory:** The imprisoned goddess of harmony—trapped by Azus in a "prison of specificity" billions of years ago—is the most compelling candidate. Her song leaks into the world as Faesong, the ambient magic of emotion and connection. The Misery River would then be a place where that leakage *pools*, concentrated grief from an entity who has mourned her imprisonment for longer than life has existed on Alaria. The pixies of Locquine hear "deeper harmonics, sounds that predate Melera's imprisonment"—which would mean the river carries notes of the goddess's song from *before* she was caged. This theory is supported by the grief's emotional specificity: it feels like losing something precious, not like abstract sadness.

**The Catastrophe Theory:** A titanic disaster occurred at the source—perhaps during the Ezz Rift that fractured reality 120 million years ago, or during the God War that ended the Second Eon. The grief would be an echo, reality itself still reverberating from a wound that never healed. This theory explains why the effect isn't magical in the conventional sense: it's older than structured magic.

**The Prison Theory:** Something is *held* at the source. Not Melera herself—her prison exists outside normal space—but perhaps a fragment of her, a piece that broke off during her failed escape attempt. Or something else entirely, a being whose nature is suffering, deliberately contained where it cannot harm anything except explorers stupid enough to go looking.

The pixies won't clarify which theory is correct. They simply smile sadly and repeat: "She remembers."

Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: the source is not a natural phenomenon. The Misery River was made—or is being made—by something capable of grief on a cosmic scale.

### Ecology

Despite its psychological dangers, the Misery River teems with life. Fish species found nowhere else swim its waters. Amphibians and reptiles congregate along its banks. The jungle flora along its course grows particularly lush, as if the water's grief nourishes rather than poisons.

This has led to a disturbing theory: the creatures here have adapted to the sorrow the way life adapts to any environmental factor. The jungle itself may have developed a capacity for grief. Some researchers report that the forest along the Misery feels watchful—not hostile, but mournful. Trees that seem to lean toward travelers. Animal calls that sound almost like weeping.

### Travel and Trade

Few traders use the Misery River, despite it being the most direct water route from the interior to Belanorn Bay. The psychological toll is too high. Those who do usually employ protective measures: earplugs stuffed with specific herbs, masks soaked in alchemical compounds, or hired pixie guides from Locquine who can navigate the river's moods.

The river's mouth at Belanorn Bay is the safest portion—the water's effect dilutes significantly where it meets the sound. Small fishing communities operate here, though even they report melancholic dreams and a higher-than-average incidence of depression.

### Naming

The river earned its name from the first Shyonan explorers to chart this region. Their journals describe the expedition's mood shifting dramatically once they entered the watershed—laughing companions becoming withdrawn, optimistic plans giving way to bitter argument. By the time they reached Locquine, three of their number had walked into the jungle and never returned. The survivors named the river for what it had cost them.

## Orangeport

Tags: town, settlement, port

The most corrupt town in Ve, and proud of it.

Orangeport squats at the mouth of the Golden River where it empties into Droughd Sound, a chaotic sprawl of docks, warehouses, taverns, and establishments catering to sailors with money to spend. Every dose of Orange Flake that leaves the Dunes of Evioli passes through here. That fact has shaped everything about the town: its wealth, its politics, its complete moral flexibility.

### The Free Port

Orangeport is technically independent—a "free port" governed by its own laws, beholden to no nation. In practice, this means it's beholden to everyone with enough money or muscle to matter.

The town is governed by a **Harbormaster**, elected every three years by a council of ship captains and merchant houses who maintain permanent presence in the port. The current Harbormaster is **Venn Kolosi**, a former Shyonan merchant captain who has held the position for two consecutive terms by being slightly less corrupt than the alternatives.

The Harbormaster's actual power is limited. Real authority in Orangeport belongs to whoever can pay for it that particular day. The position exists mainly to maintain enough order that ships keep coming—and to serve as a convenient point of contact for the various powers trying to influence the town.

### The Interested Parties

Everyone wants Orangeport. No one can take it without the others objecting. The result is a perpetual cold war fought with bribes, blackmail, and occasional violence.

**Gnotobi's Harvest Council**: The Council would dearly love to control Orangeport directly. Every shipment of Orange Flake passes through here; controlling the port would eliminate tariffs, secure their supply line, and cut out the middlemen. But the Council has never united long enough to conquer the town, and doing so would provoke Shyona and Sestros into action. Instead, they maintain extensive bribery networks, "suggest" policies to the Harbormaster, and ensure that Orange Flake shipments receive priority treatment.

**Shyona**: The great state to the east officially disapproves of the drug trade while profiting enormously from taxing it. Shyona maintains a permanent trade delegation in Orangeport that exists primarily to ensure their cut of every transaction. They would object strenuously to Gnotobi or Sestros taking direct control.

**Sestros**: The western state has less direct interest in Orange Flake but resents being cut out of the region's most profitable trade. Sestros sponsors smuggling operations that bypass Orangeport entirely, carrying product overland to alternate markets. They maintain agents in town to monitor the competition and occasionally sabotage rivals.

**Criminal Syndicates**: Where there's money, there's organized crime. Multiple syndicates operate in Orangeport, some local, some with foreign backing. They handle the services the official economy won't acknowledge: smuggling, theft, murder-for-hire, and the town's extensive prostitution trade. The syndicates have an understanding with the Harbormaster—they keep violence off the main streets, and he doesn't look too closely at their operations.

**Independent Operators**: Pirates, smugglers, and opportunists of every stripe pass through Orangeport. The town asks no questions about cargo origins, making it ideal for fencing stolen goods or moving contraband.

### The Droughd Sound Tariff

Ships entering or leaving Droughd Sound pay a "navigation fee" that funds Orangeport's government (and lines various pockets). The rate varies depending on cargo, flag, and how well the captain knows the right people.

Who actually collects this tariff is a source of constant negotiation. Officially, it's the Harbormaster's office. In practice, Gnotobi's agents often waive fees for their own shipments, Shyona's delegation demands their percentage, and everyone else pays according to their leverage.

The system is transparently corrupt. It also works, after a fashion. Ships keep coming because Orangeport is still cheaper than the alternatives, and the chaos creates opportunities for those clever enough to exploit it.

### Layout and Character

Orangeport has no walls, no plan, and no pretensions. Buildings sprawl along the waterfront in whatever configuration their builders could afford, creating a maze of crooked streets and narrow alleys. The docks are the town's heart: long wooden piers extending into Droughd Sound, perpetually crowded with vessels of every size and origin.

**The Wet Quarter**: The dockside district, named for its tendency to flood during storms. Cheap taverns, cheaper lodging, and establishments offering services polite society pretends don't exist. Sailors spend their pay here; locals avoid it after dark.

**Merchant's Row**: The slightly more respectable commercial district, home to trading houses, warehouses, and the offices of the various factions competing for influence. The Harbormaster's Hall anchors the northern end.

**The Narrows**: A dense residential district where workers, small traders, and the town's permanent underclass live packed together. Crime is common; the watch rarely visits.

**The Bluffs**: Higher ground overlooking the harbor, where the wealthy maintain homes away from the smell and chaos of the waterfront. Some Harvest Council families keep residences here to oversee their shipping interests directly.

### What You Can Buy

Anything.

Orangeport's markets deal openly in goods that would be contraband elsewhere. Orange Flake is sold in dedicated shops (taxed, theoretically). Stolen cargo from across Ve finds buyers. Weapons, poisons, forged documents, information about shipping schedules—if it exists and someone will pay for it, Orangeport has a vendor.

The slave trade is officially prohibited. Unofficially, "indentured labor contracts" change hands regularly, and no one examines the consent of the contracted too closely.

### Relations

**Gnotobi**: The source of Orangeport's prosperity and its greatest threat to independence. The Harvest Council's money flows through every level of town government, but their failure to unite prevents direct takeover. For now.

**Keshwindi**: Goldwatch mercenaries are a common sight, escorting shipments from Gnotobi. They spend money, keep to themselves, and cause less trouble than most armed groups passing through.

**Shyona**: The elephant in the room. Shyona could crush Orangeport militarily but tolerates its independence because controlling the town would mean taking responsibility for the drug trade. Easier to condemn from a distance while collecting taxes.

**Sestros**: Competitors and occasional partners. Sestros-backed smugglers use Orangeport as a base while working against Gnotobi's interests. The contradictions don't seem to bother anyone.

## Palace of Light

A fortress-monastery built directly over the point where the light leyline surfaces, located in the high Widebarrow Mountains on the border between Dern and Thorum. The original structure dates to the late Second Eon, though it has been rebuilt, expanded, and partially destroyed multiple times across millennia.

### Architecture

The Palace is constructed from white granite quarried from peaks further south, but centuries of leyline exposure have transformed the stone. It no longer merely reflects light—it *accumulates* it. The walls glow softly at night, brightest in the hours after sunset, dimming toward dawn as the stored radiance bleeds away. During the day, looking directly at the Palace from certain angles causes temporary blindness.

The central tower—the Beacon—rises 300 feet above the shore of Lake Splendor. Its peak is visible from both Dern's capital Dodi and Thorum's highland settlements, serving as a literal landmark for mountain navigation.

### The Order of the Aureate Eye

The Palace is held by the Order of the Aureate Eye, a religious order dedicated to Kunus (the elemental plane of Light). They are not priests in the conventional sense—more like scholars who worship through study. The Order believes that light is the universe's memory: every photon has witnessed something, and with sufficient understanding, that witnessing can be read.

The Order numbers roughly 200 members: monks, scribes, and a smaller cadre of "Luminars" who have undergone leyline exposure rituals that permanently alter their vision. Luminars can see magical auras, read by starlight alone, and allegedly perceive truth in ways others cannot—but they are also slowly going blind to ordinary sight. Most Luminars are functionally blind to anything not magically illuminated by their fortieth year.

### Political Status

The Palace claims neutrality between Dern and Thorum, and both mountain states grudgingly respect this. The Order provides services too valuable to alienate: they maintain the Beacon (critical for mountain travel), arbitrate disputes using their "truth-sight," and—most importantly—they guard the leyline.

Light leylines are less dangerous than fire or void, but uncontrolled surges can still blind entire valleys. The Order dampens fluctuations, channeling excess energy into their architecture. When they fail, Lake Splendor boils with radiance for days and travelers for miles around see persistent afterimages.

### The Vault of Illumination

Deep beneath the Palace, carved into the mountain below lake level, the Order maintains a vault of artifacts too dangerous to expose to natural light. These include mirrors that show the past, crystals that store years of continuous vision, and a single lantern that allegedly holds the last light of the Third Moon—captured the moment it was destroyed in the Ezz Rift. The Order denies this last item exists.

### Tensions

**Dern-Thorum Rivalry:** Both states would love to control the Palace. Its neutrality is enforced partly by the Order's usefulness and partly by mutual suspicion—neither state will let the other seize it. Recently, Thorum has been "donating" more recruits to the Order, slowly tilting its internal politics northward.

**The Luminars' Burden:** Older Luminars, the ones going blind, have begun reporting disturbing visions. They claim to see something vast approaching from the east—something that casts no shadow because it consumes all light reaching it. The Order's leadership dismisses this as leyline madness, but younger members are worried.

## Pathanul

Tags: forest, geography, ve, avalon, time-magic

A forest of ancient trees spreading across northern Avalon, where the kingdom's heartland meets the Sestran border. The priests claim this is where time moves slowest in Avalon—and whether that's metaphor or reality, travelers consistently report disorientation in Pathanul's depths.

### Character

Pathanul's trees are old. Not merely large—old in a way that shows in their gnarled trunks, their patient growth rings, their sense of having stood in the same spots since before the Ecclesiarch first sat upon his throne. The forest floor is thick with centuries of accumulated debris, soft and silent underfoot.

The canopy is dense. Little light reaches the ground except in clearings, and the clearings are rare. Sound carries strangely; voices seem muffled even a few feet away, while distant bird calls arrive with startling clarity.

### The Time Effect

Whether time actually moves differently in Pathanul is theologically contested. The priests say the forest represents eternity—the moment between one breath and the next, stretched indefinitely. Skeptics say the dense canopy and uniform terrain simply make travelers lose track of time.

The experiences are consistent regardless of cause. Travelers who enter Pathanul expecting a short journey emerge hours later than planned, convinced only minutes passed. Others experience the reverse—hours of walking that seem to take days. Hunger and thirst don't correspond to clock time while in the forest.

The effect is stronger in the forest's interior. The edges, where Pathanul meets cleared farmland, behave normally. But venture deep enough and your sense of duration becomes unreliable.

### Religious Interpretation

The Ecclesiarch's priests consider Pathanul a demonstration of time's malleability. The forest proves that duration is not fixed—that the Ecclesiarch's manipulation of temporal forces is a difference of degree, not kind, from what the forest does naturally.

Pilgrims sometimes enter Pathanul seeking visions or enlightenment. Results vary. Some emerge unchanged. Some emerge convinced they've touched eternity. Some don't emerge at all, though whether they died, became lost, or simply chose to stay is unknown.

### Practical Matters

The Sestran border runs through Pathanul's northern reaches. Neither Avalon nor Sestros maintains strong presence in the forest—the terrain is difficult, the time effects unsettling, and neither kingdom has reason to push into territory the other doesn't want anyway.

Logging operations work the eastern edges, where the forest is younger and the time effects minimal. The interior is left alone. Whatever lives there has claimed it, and the Temptari are content to let it.

### Location

Pathanul lies north of the Honor River valley, spreading from Avalon's settled heartland toward Sestros. The forest is roughly 60 miles across at its widest point.

See [Avalon](./Avalon.md) for broader context.

## Phriorys

Tags: region, hills, geography, ve, dragon-territory

The northwestern edge of the Dygon Beastlands, where the jungle breaks against a landscape of rolling hills, scattered groves, and open grassland. Phriorys marks the transition between the primordial wilderness to the south and the Suki Jungle of Chimea to the north—and serves as the domain of the green dragon Pyaganos.

The region covers roughly eight thousand square miles, a crescent of elevated terrain that curves from the Gulf of Chimea in the west to the central Beastlands in the east. The hills rise several hundred feet above the jungle floor, high enough that the canopy breaks, allowing sunlight to reach the ground. This makes Phriorys the most accessible part of the Beastlands—and therefore the most contested.

### Character of the Land

Phriorys doesn't look like the rest of the Beastlands. The endless jungle gives way to something more varied: hills crowned with wind-bent trees, valleys filled with tall grass, groves of ancient hardwoods separated by open savannah. The change feels sudden, like crossing a threshold.

**The Hills:** Dozens of named hills dot the region, their slopes covered in grass that turns gold in the dry season. The Ix'Meglyakuk call them *Thyrak-Kesh*—"the bones of the land"—and believe they're the exposed spine of the primordial lizard-god that sleeps beneath the Beastlands. Geologists would note the hills are limestone formations, remnants of an ancient seabed uplifted by tectonic forces. Both explanations can be true.

**The Groves:** Scattered across Phriorys are stands of massive trees—some single specimens, others clusters covering several acres. These groves are old, their root systems extending deep into the limestone, their canopies providing the only shade in the open grassland. Wildlife concentrates around them, making them prime hunting grounds—and prime ambush sites.

**The Edge Zone:** Where Phriorys meets the jungle proper, the transition creates a unique ecosystem. Jungle creatures that hunt in open ground compete with savannah species that shelter in the forest edge. This zone sees some of the most intense predator activity in the Beastlands, as different hunting strategies collide.

### Pyaganos's Domain

The dragon Pyaganos has claimed Phriorys for over eight centuries, making it the longest continuously held dragon territory in Ve. His approach to rulership differs markedly from his sibling Draphilir's.

**Visibility:** Where Draphilir hides in her jungle, Pyaganos is often seen. He hunts in the open, sometimes circling for hours before striking, letting everyone in the region know he's present. He roosts on hilltops in plain view. He conducts tribute collections personally rather than through intermediaries. The Ix'Meglyakuk of Phriorys live under constant awareness that the dragon is watching.

**Selectivity:** Pyaganos doesn't demand tribute from every tribe. Instead, he's chosen three "favored" groups—tribes that provide him with whatever he requests in exchange for protection from all threats, including other Ix'Meglyakuk. These favored tribes have grown powerful, expanding their territories under draconic patronage, while unfavored groups struggle to survive.

**The Hunts:** Once each season, Pyaganos conducts a ceremonial hunt across Phriorys. He doesn't hunt to eat—he hunts to demonstrate. For three days, he ranges across the hills, killing whatever catches his attention: megafauna, Ix'Meglyakuk who've displeased him, occasionally Chimean travelers who've strayed too far south. The hunts are terrifying, unpredictable, and apparently recreational. The dragon enjoys the fear.

**The Lair:** Pyaganos's primary lair occupies a hill called *Thyrak-Vor* in the central region—a limestone formation riddled with caves, its summit cleared of vegetation by centuries of dragon landing. The caves extend deep into the earth, connecting to underground rivers and eventually to an air pocket where the dragon stores his hoard. Unlike Draphilir, Pyaganos doesn't hide his lair's location. Everyone knows where he lives. The knowledge doesn't help; the caves are trapped, patrolled, and visited frequently by the dragon himself.

### The Ix'Meglyakuk of Phriorys

The tribes of Phriorys have adapted to life under a visible, capricious dragon. They're different from their jungle cousins in several ways:

**Open-Ground Hunting:** Where jungle Ix'Meglyakuk use stealth and ambush, Phriorys tribes have developed pursuit predation—running down prey across the grasslands on their raptors, exhausting animals over miles rather than striking from concealment. This makes them the most mobile Ix'Meglyakuk, capable of covering vast distances quickly.

**The Favored and Unfavored:** Social hierarchy in Phriorys revolves around relationship to Pyaganos. The three favored tribes—the *Thyrak-Uli*, the *Kesh-Morru*, and the *Vorrikan*—dominate the region, controlling the best hunting grounds and water sources. Unfavored tribes survive in the margins, constantly pressed by both their more powerful neighbors and the dragon who might decide to hunt them at any moment.

**Chimean Contact:** Phriorys sees more interaction with the outside world than any other part of the Beastlands. Chimean traders, explorers, and occasionally soldiers enter the region from the north, and Pyaganos tolerates this—even seems to encourage it. The dragon appears to enjoy having an audience beyond the Ix'Meglyakuk, observers who can carry word of his power back to "civilized" lands.

### Locations

#### Thyrak-Vor (The Dragon's Hill)

The limestone hill that serves as Pyaganos's primary lair, rising three hundred feet above the surrounding grassland. The hill's slopes are steep and largely bare—the dragon has burned away the vegetation enough times that nothing grows there anymore. The caves that riddle the interior are visible from a distance, dark openings in pale stone.

**The Approach:** Anyone attempting to reach the caves must cross open ground under Pyaganos's gaze. The dragon can see approaching visitors from miles away. Sometimes he lets them come. Sometimes he doesn't.

**The Caves:** The upper caves are trophy galleries—skulls and bones of the dragon's most notable kills, arranged with care. Deeper chambers hold treasure accumulated over eight centuries: gold, gems, artifacts, and items of sentimental value the dragon refuses to explain. The deepest chambers flood periodically, filled by underground rivers that connect to the water table.

**The Summit:** Pyaganos rests on the hilltop more often than in the caves—a display of confidence that says he fears nothing. Visitors granted audience are sometimes required to climb the hill to meet him at the summit, an exhausting ascent under the dragon's constant observation.

#### The Burned Valley

A long depression between two hill ridges, roughly ten miles long and one mile wide, where nothing grows. Two centuries ago, during one of the sibling wars between Pyaganos and Draphilir, the battle reached Phriorys. Pyaganos burned the valley to deny his sister cover, and something in his fire—or perhaps his fury—rendered the soil permanently sterile.

The Burned Valley serves as a boundary marker. Ix'Meglyakuk do not cross it. Chimean expeditions that enter it report feeling watched, unsettled, wrong. The ground is ash-gray and powdery, and footprints in it remain visible for months. Some say the valley records everything that crosses it—that Pyaganos can read the traces and know who's been where.

#### The Chimean Approach

The northern edge of Phriorys, where the hills meet the Suki Jungle of Chimea. This strip of borderland sees regular traffic: Chimean traders seeking jungle products, Ix'Meglyakuk willing to sell them, and occasional military patrols testing how far they can push into dragon territory.

Pyaganos allows this commerce—even seems to enjoy it. He's been known to appear during negotiations, circling overhead while deals are struck below, never attacking but always reminding everyone present whose land they're on. The psychological effect keeps Chimea from ever getting too comfortable with the idea that Phriorys might be conquerable.

**Outpost Viyen:** A Chimean trading station at the very edge of the approach, staffed by merchants too ambitious or too desperate to fear the dragon. The outpost has survived for thirty years—a record for Chimean establishments in the Beastlands—by paying tribute to both Pyaganos and the nearest favored tribe. The arrangement is expensive, unstable, and immensely profitable for those involved.

#### The Gathering Stones

A formation of standing stones on a prominent hilltop in eastern Phriorys, their origin unknown. The stones predate Ix'Meglyakuk presence in the region—possibly predate intelligent life on Ve entirely. They're arranged in a pattern that doesn't match any known astronomical alignment, their surfaces carved with symbols no one can read.

The Ix'Meglyakuk use the Gathering Stones for inter-tribal councils, treating the site as neutral ground. Even Pyaganos respects the location; he's never hunted there, never interrupted a gathering. Some believe the stones hold power that constrains even dragons. Others believe the dragon simply finds the meetings useful—a way to observe tribal politics without direct involvement.

### Threats and Opportunities

**Pyaganos's Favor:** The dragon has grown bored with his current favored tribes. Rumors suggest he's considering replacing one of them—or adding a fourth to create new dynamics. Outside parties might be drawn into the resulting competition, hired by tribes seeking to win or keep favor, or by unfavored groups hoping to seize opportunity from the chaos.

**The Chimean Problem:** Chimea's generals have been studying Phriorys for decades, looking for weakness. They believe Pyaganos is predictable—that his territorial patterns could be mapped, his hunting schedule anticipated, his lair eventually assaulted. They're almost certainly wrong, but they might hire outsiders to gather intelligence before discovering how wrong they are.

**The Gathering Stones:** The symbols on the stones have attracted scholarly interest. A team from Shyona wants to document and translate them, believing they predate all known writing systems. The Ix'Meglyakuk are willing to allow research—but only if the scholars can convince Pyaganos, who's never formally acknowledged the stones' neutral status.

**Sibling Tensions:** Pyaganos and Draphilir haven't fought in forty years, but tensions are rising. Both dragons have been ranging closer to their territorial boundaries. Both have been demanding more tribute. War between them would devastate Phriorys and Blyss alike—but it might also create opportunities for those willing to exploit divided draconic attention.

## Phyr Island

Tags: island, geography, cursed

A jungle island in southeastern Ve, separated from the mainland by the treacherous Disaster Passage. Phyr Island bears the scars of an ancient magical catastrophe—the land itself transformed by a curse that turned an army to stone and warped the jungle into something hostile to all life.

The island is roughly eighty miles east-to-west and sixty miles north-to-south. Dense jungle covers nearly every surface, broken only by the ridge of the Statue Hills running through the eastern interior. A single village, Attla, clings to the eastern shore.

Ships avoid Phyr Island. Those that must approach come through Further Sound to the east, anchoring in Safety Bay on the northern coast—the only approach that doesn't require navigating cursed waters or landing in cursed jungle.

### History

#### The Reign of Queen Haegstra

Phyr Island was not always cursed. Three centuries ago, it was home to a modest population of fisherfolk and jungle foragers who lived in scattered villages across the island. Then came Haegstra.

The histories disagree on what Haegstra was before she came to power. Some accounts call her a Chimean exile, a noblewoman cast out for practicing forbidden magic. Others claim she was native to Phyr, a village witch who grew too powerful. A few darker texts suggest she was never human at all—that she crawled up from something buried deep beneath the island.

What the histories agree on: Haegstra could turn living things to stone with a touch, a word, or—at the height of her power—simply by willing it. She consolidated control over the island's villages through terror. Those who resisted became statues in her garden.

She ruled for forty-three years. The islanders learned to obey.

#### The Invasion and the Curse

In 3,041 SD, the expanding power of Chimea sent a military expedition to claim Phyr Island. Three thousand soldiers landed on the western shore and marched inland toward Haegstra's tower.

They never reached it.

Haegstra met the army in the island's central highlands. The details of what followed are unclear—there were no survivors among the invaders, and the islanders who witnessed it from a distance speak only of a sound like breaking glass and a light that turned the sky gray.

When the light faded, three thousand soldiers stood frozen in stone. Horses, pack animals, war dogs—all petrified mid-stride. An entire army transformed into a forest of statues stretching across the hills.

But Haegstra had overreached. The magical energy released in that single act was catastrophic. The curse did not stop with the soldiers.

The jungle began to change. Trees hardened, their bark crystallizing into glass-like spines. Animals developed strange afflictions—partial petrification, stone growths, the ability to petrify prey. The waters around the western shore became deadly, filled with petrified reefs and creatures warped by the curse's residue.

And Haegstra herself was consumed. Her tower still stands in the northwestern jungle, but what remains of the queen is unknown. Some say she turned to stone like her victims. Others say she became something worse—neither alive nor dead, neither flesh nor stone, still waiting in the ruins for someone to wake her.

The surviving islanders fled east, beyond the Statue Hills, to the shores of Further Sound. Their descendants founded Attla and learned to live in the shadow of the curse.

### Geography

#### Disaster Passage

The strait separating Phyr Island from the Dygon Beastlands mainland, running roughly north-south along the island's western edge. The passage earns its name.

The waters are treacherous for multiple reasons:
- **Petrified reefs** lurk just below the surface—razor-sharp stone formations that can hull a ship before the lookout spots them
- **Unpredictable currents** twist through the strait, the result of the curse warping the water's flow in ways that defy navigation
- **Curse-touched creatures** hunt the passage—things that were once normal sea life, now partially petrified and predatory in ways their ancestors never were

Ships that must pass between Phyr and the mainland typically sail far to the south, around the island entirely, adding days to their journey rather than risk the passage.

#### Further Sound

The open water east of Phyr Island, connecting to the Sea of Fools to the south. Further Sound is relatively safe—the curse's effects diminish rapidly east of the Statue Hills. Ships approaching Attla come this way, and the sound sees occasional traffic from traders willing to deal with the islanders.

The name reflects the sound's position: further from Ve's mainland than any other named water, at the edge of the known world before the poisoned beauty of the Sea of Fools begins.

#### Safety Bay

A small inlet on Phyr Island's northern coast, sheltered by a curved arm of jungle-covered land. Safety Bay is the island's only reliable anchorage—the one approach that doesn't require navigating Disaster Passage or landing in curse-heavy jungle.

The bay earned its name honestly. Ships that anchor here and deal fairly with the people of Attla depart unharmed. The curse does not reach the bay's waters, and the jungle surrounding it is merely dangerous rather than actively malevolent.

A narrow trail leads from Safety Bay southeast to Attla, skirting the northern edge of the Statue Hills. The journey takes two days on foot. Attla's traders make it regularly; outsiders are advised to hire a guide.

### Regions

#### Jungle of Spines

The transformed jungle covering most of Phyr Island's western and central territory. What was once ordinary tropical forest is now something far more dangerous.

The trees themselves have changed. Their bark has crystallized into glass-like spines—sharp, brittle, and everywhere. Walking through the Jungle of Spines means constant small cuts unless you move with extreme care. These wounds would be merely painful in any normal jungle. Here, they can be fatal.

**Spine Sickness**: Wounds from the crystalline spines carry traces of the petrification curse. Left untreated, the flesh around the wound begins to harden over the following days. The process is slow—a week or more before it becomes dangerous—but inexorable. The hardening spreads from the wound site, eventually reaching vital organs. Death comes when the heart turns to stone.

The people of Attla know remedies: poultices made from certain eastern plants, rituals involving salt water and moonlight, careful excision of affected tissue. These treatments work if applied early. Visitors to Phyr Island are advised to either avoid the Jungle of Spines entirely or travel with someone who knows the cures.

The jungle's wildlife has adapted in various ways. Some creatures have developed immunity to the spine sickness. Others have become carriers—their bites or scratches transmit the curse more efficiently than the spines themselves. A few have evolved partial petrification as a defense mechanism, their hides studded with stone growths that turn aside predators' teeth.

#### Statue Hills

A ridge of hills running roughly north-south through Phyr Island's eastern interior, separating the Jungle of Spines from the relatively safer eastern shore. The hills take their name from what stands upon them.

Three thousand soldiers. Frozen in stone. Still there after three centuries.

The army that invaded Phyr Island in 3,041 SD remains exactly where Queen Haegstra stopped them. Stone legionnaires stand in marching formation, their faces frozen in expressions ranging from confusion to terror to simple blankness—those who were petrified before they understood what was happening. Stone horses rear or stand placidly. Stone supply wagons sit with stone goods still loaded. Stone war dogs crouch mid-lunge or lie curled as if sleeping.

Time and weather have damaged some of the statues. Arms have broken off. Faces have eroded. A few have toppled entirely, lying in fragments among the undergrowth. But most remain standing, an army that will never complete its march.

**The Treasures of the Hills**: The petrified soldiers still carry their equipment. Weapons, armor, coins, personal effects—three thousand soldiers' worth of military gear, untouched for three centuries. The temptation to loot the Statue Hills draws occasional treasure hunters to Phyr Island.

Most of them regret it. The curse lingers strongest here, at the site of its origin. Spending too long among the statues—sleeping in their shadow, touching them, disturbing their belongings—accelerates the spine sickness dramatically. Treasure hunters who fill their packs with ancient coins often find their fingers hardening before they reach the coast.

The people of Attla occasionally harvest from the hills, but carefully. They know which areas are safer, how long they can stay, which items carry more of the curse than others. They do not share this knowledge freely.

**The Soldiers' Faces**: Most statues show confusion or terror. But roughly two hundred show something else: recognition, calm acceptance, faint smiles.

These were Haegstra's agents—cultists and spies planted within the Chimean army. They fed her information about the invasion's timing and route. They believed she would spare them, or reward them, or grant them a place in her new order.

She petrified them with everyone else.

The Attla elders know this history. They can identify the smiling statues by unit position—the spies were concentrated in the command staff and supply trains, where they could do the most damage. Some treasure hunters specifically seek these statues, believing the agents carried hidden valuables or coded information. A few have found small caches. Most have found only stone and spine sickness.

The smiling faces are not a mystery. They're a reminder that Haegstra used people, then discarded them.

### Locations

#### Queen Haegstra's Tower

A ruined fortress in the northwestern interior of Phyr Island, deep within the Jungle of Spines. The tower was Haegstra's seat of power during her forty-three-year reign, and the site from which she worked the curse that transformed the island.

The tower still stands, though barely. The upper floors have collapsed. The walls are cracked and overgrown with crystalline vines. The main gate hangs open, has hung open for three centuries, as if inviting visitors.

No one goes there.

The Jungle of Spines is at its worst near the tower—the spines longer, sharper, the curse stronger. Creatures that would flee humans elsewhere on the island grow aggressive near the tower, as if defending it. The few expeditions that have attempted to reach the ruins report feeling watched, hearing sounds that couldn't be natural, seeing movement in the peripheral vision that vanished when looked at directly.

Some expeditions have reached the tower. Fewer have returned. Those who did describe:
- Chambers filled with statues that weren't soldiers—islanders, Haegstra's subjects, arranged in poses of supplication or service
- A throne room with a throne of fused stone, multiple petrified bodies melted together into a seat
- Sounds from below, from chambers beneath the tower, a rhythmic pulse like breathing or grinding stone
- The certainty, irrational but absolute, that something down there was aware of them

**The Petros Shard**: Beneath the tower, in chambers carved long before Haegstra arrived, lies the source of her power: a fragment of elemental earth roughly the size of a human torso, pulsing with petrification magic. The shard is not truly alive, but it responds to proximity and intent. It grants petrification abilities to those who bond with it—touch it, accept its presence in their mind, let it partially transform their flesh.

Haegstra found the shard when she first came to Phyr. She was its third known wielder. The ruins beneath the tower predate human settlement on Ve; whatever species carved them left no other trace.

The shard is why the curse persists. It's the engine that powers everything—the spine sickness, the warped creatures, the petrified army. Destroying it might end the curse. Or it might release three centuries of accumulated magical energy in a single catastrophic burst.

**What Haegstra Became**: When Haegstra petrified the army, the magical backlash didn't kill her. It *dispersed* her.

Her consciousness fused with the curse itself. She didn't die—she became the crystalline spines, the petrified reefs, the stone soldiers, the warped creatures. The curse IS Haegstra. Every spine that breaks skin carries a fragment of her awareness. Every statue contains a sliver of her attention. The island is her body now.

For three centuries, she's been fragmented—present everywhere but coherent nowhere, her mind shattered across thousands of cursed objects. But she's slowly reassembling. The shared dreams that occasionally sweep through Attla are Haegstra becoming focused enough to reach out intentionally. The lights in the tower are her attention gathering at the shard, the center of her distributed self.

The Attla elders understand this. They've tracked the dreams for generations, noting their increasing frequency and clarity. Thirty years ago, the dreams came once a decade. Now they come several times a year. Haegstra is waking up.

She won't have a body. But within another generation, she'll likely be coherent enough to direct the curse precisely—extend spines toward specific targets, control the creatures as extensions of her will, perhaps animate the stone soldiers as puppets. The island will stop being passively dangerous and become actively hostile.

The elders don't share this knowledge with outsiders. They don't want treasure hunters getting ideas about "killing the curse" by destroying the shard. An uncontrolled release could petrify everything within miles—including Attla.

#### Attla

A fishing village on Phyr Island's eastern coast, home to approximately three hundred permanent residents. Attla is the only surviving settlement on the island—the descendants of those who fled east when the curse transformed their home.

The village occupies a sheltered cove facing Further Sound, with the Statue Hills rising to the west. The location was chosen deliberately: the hills block the worst of the curse's effects, and the eastern waters remain safe for fishing. Three centuries of isolation have made Attla self-sufficient by necessity.

**The People of Attla**: The villagers are ethnically similar to the peoples of Chimea and the Dygon Beastlands—their ancestors came from the same stock. But three centuries of isolation have given them distinct traditions.

They know the curse intimately. Every child learns to recognize spine sickness, to prepare the poultices that slow it, to perform the rituals that can halt it entirely if caught early. They know which paths through the hills are safer, which seasons see the curse wax stronger, which signs indicate that something has stirred in the western jungle.

They are not hostile to outsiders, but neither are they welcoming. Visitors bring disruption—and on Phyr Island, disruption can be fatal. Traders who deal fairly and follow local guidance are tolerated. Those who ignore warnings or express interest in the tower are encouraged to leave.

**Trade**: Attla trades with the occasional ship from Further Sound. They offer:
- **Preserved fish** and other seafood from the uncursed eastern waters
- **Curse remedies**—the poultices and preparations that treat spine sickness, valuable to anyone planning to explore the island's interior
- **Carefully harvested artifacts** from the Statue Hills, selected for low curse contamination and sold only to buyers who understand the risks
- **Information** about the island, its dangers, and its history—for a price

They seek:
- Metal tools and weapons (the island has no smithing tradition)
- Cloth and textiles
- Salt (essential for their preservation methods and their curse treatments)
- News from the mainland

**The Village Council**: Attla is governed by a council of elders who make decisions by consensus. The council's primary concern is the village's survival, which means maintaining the careful balance between isolation and trade, between safety and opportunity.

The council controls access to the Statue Hills. No one harvests from the hills without council permission, and the council decides which artifacts can be sold and which must remain buried. They are not sentimental about the soldiers—the invasion was three centuries ago, and the petrified army tried to conquer their ancestors—but they are practical about the curse.

### Threats and Opportunities

#### For Players

Phyr Island offers several hooks for adventuring parties:

**The Treasure of the Statue Hills**: Three thousand soldiers' worth of military equipment, untouched for three centuries. Ancient weapons, armor, coins, and personal effects—enough to make a party wealthy. But the curse makes looting dangerous. A party would need to work with Attla's council, learn the safe methods, and still accept significant risk.

**The Tower Expedition**: The Petros Shard sits beneath the tower, still granting power to anyone willing to bond with it. A wealthy patron in Chimea wants it recovered—or destroyed. A scholar in Shyona wants to study it. A cult that worships earth elementals considers it a holy relic. Someone will pay for access. The party would need to traverse the Jungle of Spines at its worst and deal with Haegstra's concentrated attention at the curse's source.

**The Cure**: The shard grants petrification abilities. It might also hold the key to reversing them. Someone afflicted with late-stage spine sickness—or someone who loves them—might pay anything for the chance to touch the shard and bargain with whatever intelligence guides it. The elders of Attla know this is possible. They also know it's never worked; the shard takes more than it gives.

**Racing the Clock**: Haegstra is reassembling. The Attla elders have tracked the pattern for generations—thirty years ago, the shared dreams came once a decade; now they come several times a year. Within another generation, she'll be coherent enough to direct the curse intentionally. Someone needs to stop this before the island becomes actively hostile. The options: destroy the shard (risking catastrophic magical release), find a way to further fragment Haegstra's consciousness, or evacuate Attla before it's too late.

**Chimea's Unfinished Business**: The army that Haegstra petrified was Chimean. Three centuries later, some in Chimea consider the soldiers' recovery a matter of national honor—and the treasure they carried a matter of national interest. A Chimean expedition with military backing might arrive, expecting to succeed where their ancestors failed. They won't listen to warnings from a fishing village. They'll make everything worse.

## Promisewood

Tags: forest, geography, ve, avalon

The largest forest in Avalon, dominating the southern reaches of the kingdom where the land rises toward the Widebarrow Mountains. The name refers to the **Declarations**—the promises made to Temptari children at age eight that determine their life's path. Those declared for forestry, hunting, or druidic work spend their training decades in Promisewood's depths.

### Geography

Promisewood covers over 200 square miles of southern Avalon, a mix of deciduous and evergreen forest that thickens as elevation increases toward the mountains. The northern edges are managed—logging operations, hunting grounds, training camps—while the deep interior remains wild and largely unvisited.

The **Pale Run** river flows through the forest's heart, draining toward the systems that eventually reach Chimea. The river valley creates a natural corridor through the woods, but the corridor is controlled; not everyone may use it.

### The Training Grounds

Deep Promisewood contains the camps where young Temptari spend their formative decades. Children declared for forest-related paths—rangers, druids, hunters, foresters, herbalists—are brought here at age eight and don't emerge until their training is complete.

What happens during those years varies by path. Foresters learn to harvest sustainably, reading the forest's cycles to take only what can be replaced. Hunters learn tracking, ambush, and the ethics of killing. Druids learn something else entirely, and they don't discuss it with outsiders.

The training camps are not marked on any map. Finding them requires a guide, and guides are assigned only to those with business there.

### Restricted Access

Casual visitors are not welcome in deep Promisewood. The forest's edge is open—travelers can pass through on established paths, hunters can take game with appropriate permissions—but venturing off-path or pressing south brings increasing warnings, then confrontation, then (allegedly) disappearance.

The priests say this is for visitors' protection. The forest contains the kingdom's future soldiers, its future rangers, its future spiritual leaders. Disturbing their training disrupts the Ecclesiarch's designs.

Critics suggest other reasons: the training methods might disturb outsiders, or the children might be disturbed by contact with the outside world, or the priests simply enjoy having territory where ordinary rules don't apply.

### Connection to Chimea

Promisewood's southern reaches approach Chimean territory. The forest doesn't stop at the border; it merges into Chimea's jungle-edge woodlands through a contested zone where neither kingdom maintains clear control. Smugglers sometimes use the forest routes to move goods between Avalon and Chimea without passing through official channels.

The Ecclesiarch presumably knows about this. He hasn't ordered it stopped, which the priests interpret as tacit acceptance—the smuggling must serve some purpose in his visions.

## Pyaganos

Tags: dragon, creature, ve, green

A green dragon who has ruled the Phriorys hills and northwestern Dygon Beastlands for over eight centuries—the longest continuously held dragon territory in Ve. Pyaganos is theatrical, vain, and utterly confident in his dominance. Where his clutch-sibling Draphilir hides in her jungle, Pyaganos makes himself seen, conducting his hunts and his cruelties in full view of his subjects.

### Appearance

Pyaganos is slightly smaller than his sister—his wingspan reaches perhaps one hundred eighty feet, his body closer to one hundred fifty from snout to tail. But he carries himself as if he were the largest creature in existence, and in the open grasslands of Phriorys, he usually is.

His scales are **bright green**, almost emerald, lacking the darker mottling that helps Draphilir blend into shadows. Pyaganos doesn't want to blend in. His coloring catches light beautifully, especially at dawn and dusk when the Phriorys hills turn golden and the dragon's scales seem to glow against them. He maintains his appearance carefully—grooming, removing damaged scales, ensuring his hide always gleams.

A ridge of **prominent spines** runs from his skull to his tail-tip, each one ivory-white and sharp enough to pierce armor. The spines serve no practical purpose that scholars have identified; they appear to be purely decorative, a display of draconic magnificence that Pyaganos cultivates deliberately.

His eyes are **amber**, bright and intelligent, and they miss nothing. Pyaganos watches everything in his territory with the patient attention of a predator who knows he has all the time in the world.

### Character

Pyaganos is **vain** beyond any rational measure. He considers himself the most magnificent creature in existence—a belief that centuries of unchallenged dominance have only reinforced. He preens. He poses. He arranges his kills and his hoard for maximum aesthetic impact. The Ix'Meglyakuk call him *Thyrak-Mor*, "the Beautiful Terror," and he takes the name as his due.

He is **cruel** in a casual, almost playful way. The seasonal hunts that terrorize Phriorys are not about food—Pyaganos could eat his fill anytime he wished. They're entertainment. He enjoys the chase, the fear, the moment when prey realizes it cannot escape. He prolongs kills for amusement and sometimes releases victims just to hunt them again.

He is **theatrical** in all things. Pyaganos could conduct his business privately, but he chooses not to. Tribute collections happen in the open. Punishments are public spectacles. Even his roosting—visible on hilltops across Phriorys—is a performance, a constant reminder that the dragon is watching.

He **hates** his sister Draphilir with a passion that matches hers for him. But where Draphilir's hatred is cold and patient, Pyaganos's burns hot. He wants to destroy her *now*, to burn Blyss to ash and scatter her bones. Only the memory of their last war—and the scars he still carries—keeps him in check.

### The Breath

Pyaganos's breath weapon is **fire**, but not ordinary dragonfire. His flames burn green-tinged, leaving ash that remains faintly luminescent for weeks. Areas he's burned extensively—like the Burned Valley—retain a permanent glow visible on dark nights, a reminder of his power.

**Precision Control:** Unlike many fire-breathing dragons, Pyaganos has developed extraordinary control over his breath. He can torch a single target while leaving everything around it untouched, or he can blanket square miles in flame. He uses this control for effect—burning intricate patterns into hillsides, incinerating tribute that displeases him one piece at a time.

**The Lasting Mark:** Something in Pyaganos's fire renders soil permanently sterile. The Burned Valley has remained barren for two centuries, and smaller burned areas throughout Phriorys show similar persistence. Whether this is a natural property of his breath or something he's learned to add, the result is the same: places he burns stay burned.

### The Lair

Pyaganos's lair occupies **Thyrak-Vor**, a limestone hill in central Phriorys. Unlike Draphilir's hidden sinkhole, Thyrak-Vor is visible for miles—a bare-stone prominence rising three hundred feet above the grassland, its caves open and accessible to anyone who dares approach.

**The Summit:** Pyaganos spends more time on the hilltop than in the caves below. He rests there openly, surveying his domain, making himself visible to everyone within sight. The summit serves as his throne room, his audience chamber, and his stage.

**The Trophy Caves:** The upper caves display Pyaganos's most treasured kills—skulls and bones arranged with artistic care, each specimen positioned for maximum impact. The collection includes megafauna, rival dragons, unfortunate humanoids, and several creatures that don't match any known species. Pyaganos conducts tours for visitors he wishes to impress or intimidate.

**The Deep Hoard:** Below the trophy galleries, flooded chambers contain eight centuries of accumulated wealth. Pyaganos guards this hoard jealously but knows exactly where every piece is. He can describe specific items' locations, histories, and the circumstances of their acquisition. The hoard is not just wealth—it's a record of his reign.

### Relationships

**Draphilir:** His clutch-sibling and eternal enemy. Pyaganos believes he's stronger, faster, and more deserving of dominance. Every war they've fought has ended in stalemate because Draphilir fights dirty—retreating into her impenetrable jungle, using rot and disease rather than honest combat. He considers her a coward. He's waiting for the right moment to prove himself superior once and for all.

**The Favored Tribes:** Pyaganos has elevated three Ix'Meglyakuk tribes to favored status—the Thyrak-Uli, the Kesh-Morru, and the Vorrikan. He protects them from threats, grants them hunting rights in prime territory, and uses them as instruments of his will. In exchange, they provide whatever he demands without question. The relationship is transactional but stable.

**Chimea:** Pyaganos finds Chimean attention flattering. He allows traders and observers into his territory because their presence confirms his magnificence—here are representatives of a great nation, come to witness the power of Pyaganos. He would never admit it, but their admiration feeds his vanity.

**Other Dragons:** Pyaganos considers himself exceptional among dragonkind. He views other dragons with casual contempt—rivals to be defeated, inferiors to be ignored, or potential threats to be monitored. He's had no contact with dragons outside Ve for centuries and assumes none are his equal.

### History

Pyaganos and Draphilir hatched together roughly eight hundred fifty years ago. From their first moments, they competed—for food, for attention, for dominance. Pyaganos was faster, more aggressive, more willing to fight. He assumed he would always win.

**The Claiming (circa 2,530 SD):** The siblings traveled south together, seeking territories in the abundant Beastlands. Pyaganos claimed Phriorys for its visibility—he wanted a domain where everyone could see him rule. His sister took the jungle, and he dismissed her choice as weakness.

**The Wars:** Six conflicts have erupted between the siblings across eight centuries. Pyaganos won the early engagements—pushing into Blyss, hunting Draphilir through her own territory, burning swaths of jungle. But he could never finish her. She always retreated deeper, struck back from unexpected directions, outlasted his fury.

**The Last War (3,201-3,219 SD):** Pyaganos's deepest penetration into Blyss, reaching within twenty miles of his sister's lair before she counterattacked. The war ended when Draphilir's rot began affecting his troops, and Pyaganos realized continuing would cost him more than victory was worth. He withdrew, burned the valley to deny her pursuit, and agreed to truce.

**The Current Peace (3,336 SD - present):** Forty years of uneasy quiet. Pyaganos has used the time to consolidate his hold on Phriorys, expand his favored tribes' power, and plan his next move. He's convinced the next war will be decisive—that he'll finally destroy his sister and claim all the Beastlands for himself.

### Interactions

Pyaganos enjoys visitors. He grants audiences readily, especially to those who flatter him or bring interesting tribute. Unlike Draphilir, he doesn't hide—approach Thyrak-Vor openly, announce yourself, and the dragon will likely appear.

**Approach:** Come during daylight, visibly and without stealth. Pyaganos considers hidden approaches insulting. Make your presence known, state your business loudly, and wait. If he's interested, he'll come.

**Tribute:** Pyaganos appreciates tribute but cares more about presentation than value. A modest gift offered with eloquent praise pleases him more than a fortune dumped unceremoniously. He rewards good showmanship.

**Conversation:** Pyaganos talks. He enjoys explaining his magnificence, recounting his victories, describing his domain. He's not particularly interested in visitors' perspectives but tolerates them as audience. Flattery works; criticism doesn't.

**Deals:** Pyaganos keeps his word—openly breaking agreements would damage his reputation. But he defines agreements narrowly, and his interpretation of "assistance" or "protection" may differ from what supplicants expect. Get everything in specific terms.

### Hooks

**The Favor Game:** Pyaganos is considering changes to his favored tribes. The competition to win or keep his favor is intensifying, and outside parties are being recruited as allies, saboteurs, or fall guys. Someone needs to navigate tribal politics under a dragon's watchful gaze.

**The Chimean Scheme:** Chimea's generals believe Pyaganos is predictable enough to defeat. They're gathering intelligence, mapping his patterns, and planning an eventual assault on Phriorys. They need scouts willing to spend weeks in dragon territory documenting his movements.

**The Coming War:** Both dragons are preparing for conflict. Pyaganos wants information about Draphilir's current strength, her defenses, her plans. He might hire outsiders for reconnaissance—or he might want them to deliver a message, one designed to provoke his sister into premature action.

**The Gathering Stones:** The mysterious stones in eastern Phriorys have attracted scholarly interest. Pyaganos has never formally acknowledged the stones' neutral status, and researchers will need his explicit permission to study them. What he'll want in exchange is unclear—perhaps simply the pleasure of being asked.

## Raptor Hills

Tags: hills, geography, ve, krell, dinosaur

The southeastern corner of the Krell Lands, where the dense jungle thins into savannah-like hills prowled by predatory dinosaurs large enough to threaten even Krell swarms. The Raptor Hills represent a contested zone—territory neither the insects nor the great reptiles have managed to fully claim.

### Geography

The Raptor Hills occupy perhaps sixty square miles where the Krell Lands meet the coast and the Dygon Beastlands border. The terrain transitions here: jungle canopy gives way to scattered trees, then to open grassland broken by rocky outcrops and dry ravines.

The hills themselves are modest—gentle rises rather than dramatic peaks—but the vegetation change is stark. The dense undergrowth that characterizes most of the Krell Lands disappears, replaced by tall grasses and thornbush that offer little concealment. Sightlines extend for miles.

Several seasonal streams cut through the hills, flowing toward the coast. During wet season, these become genuine rivers; during dry season, they're mostly sand with occasional pools.

### The Raptors

The hills' namesakes are pack-hunting dinosaurs that range from wolf-sized to horse-sized, depending on species. They're fast, intelligent (for reptiles), and hunt cooperatively—coordinating ambushes, flanking maneuvers, and relay pursuits that can run down prey over miles.

The largest species—called "terror raptors" by the few humans who've observed them—stand nearly seven feet at the shoulder. A pack of these can bring down creatures many times their individual size. They've been observed killing Krell soldiers, though whether they consider the insects prey or competition remains unclear.

Beyond the raptors, the hills host other dinosaur species: herbivorous browsers, smaller predators, and the occasional massive carnivore that wanders up from the Dygon Beastlands. The ecosystem is violent and dynamic, with territorial boundaries shifting constantly based on which apex predators are currently dominant.

### Krell Presence

The Krell have attempted to colonize the Raptor Hills repeatedly. Small hives establish in the jungle-hill boundary zone, begin expanding, and then collapse—destroyed by raptor packs, starved when prey proves too dangerous to hunt, or simply overwhelmed by the ecological pressure.

No permanent hive has survived more than a few years in the hills. The terrain doesn't suit Krell tactics: the open ground negates their numerical advantage, the lack of dense vegetation limits their communication, and the raptors specifically target Krell scouts as if they've learned the insects represent a threat to be eliminated.

This has created an effective buffer. The Raptor Hills separate the main Krell Lands from the Dygon Beastlands, preventing the insects from expanding southward. Whether this arrangement is stable long-term is unknown—Krell adaptation is slow but persistent.

### Human Presence

Humans don't live in the Raptor Hills. The dinosaurs don't distinguish between insect invaders and mammalian intruders. But the hills offer something valuable: relatively safe passage between the Krell Lands and the coast.

Travelers who stick to the hilltops during daylight, move in groups, and maintain vigilant watch can cross the hills with acceptable risk. The raptors hunt primarily at dawn and dusk; midday travel through open terrain reduces (but doesn't eliminate) the danger.

This makes the Raptor Hills an alternate route to Chitin Cove—one that avoids the deep jungle and its Krell inhabitants. It's longer and more exposed, but some traders prefer dinosaur risk to insect risk.

### The Bone Fields

Where the hills meet the coastal flats, the remains of countless creatures lie scattered across the landscape. Krell exoskeletons, dinosaur skeletons, and occasionally human bones create a macabre plain that locals call the Bone Fields.

The fields mark the high-tide line of Krell expansion—the point where swarms have repeatedly broken against the raptor packs and been destroyed. The accumulation of bones over generations has created an ecosystem of its own: scavengers, bone-eating insects, and creatures that use the remains for shelter.

Treasure hunters sometimes explore the Bone Fields, searching for equipment from lost expeditions or valuable Krell chitin for alchemical use. The work is dangerous—scavengers don't care about the source of their meals—but occasionally profitable.

### Value

The Raptor Hills matter for three reasons:

**Containment** — They prevent Krell expansion into the Dygon Beastlands, maintaining one of the few boundaries the insects haven't crossed

**Access** — They provide an alternative route to the coast, bypassing Krell jungle territory

**Resources** — Raptor kills leave behind valuable materials: dinosaur hide, bones, and organs with alchemical properties

No one controls the Raptor Hills. They're too dangerous for permanent settlement, too contested for territorial claims. They simply exist—a violent, dynamic boundary that serves purposes no one intended.

## Red Desert

Tags: desert, geography, ve, sestros

The arid northern reaches of Sestros, where iron-rich sands glow crimson at sunset and nothing grows for months at a time. The Red Desert is technically part of the kingdom, but no one lives there permanently. It's too hot, too dry, too empty.

### Geography

The Red Desert covers roughly 400 square miles of northern Sestros, bounded by the Shepherds' Stones to the north, the savannah grasslands to the south, and the coast to the west. The terrain is mostly flat, broken by occasional rock outcroppings and dry wadis that flood briefly during the winter rains.

The sand itself is distinctive—high iron content gives it a rust-red color that intensifies as the sun sets, creating spectacular displays that travelers remember long after the heat and thirst fade from memory.

### Climate

Brutal in summer. Temperatures exceed what unprotected humans can survive for extended periods. The Shailin who venture into the desert do so in winter, following the brief rainy season when seasonal grasses attract their flocks. By late spring, everyone has retreated south.

Water exists but is scarce. A few permanent springs emerge from the rock near the Shepherds' Stones, and shallow wells can tap groundwater in certain locations. Knowing where to find water is the difference between crossing the desert and dying in it.

### Inhabitants

None permanent. Seasonal shepherds follow the winter grasses. Occasional traders cut through the desert's edge rather than taking the longer route around. Prospectors sometimes search for mineral deposits, though the heat makes sustained mining operations impractical.

The ruins of Lurza sit at the desert's western edge, but no one goes there. See [Shepherds' Stones](./Shepherds' Stones.md) for why.

### Significance

The Red Desert serves as a buffer zone. It separates the settled portions of Sestros from the Korel territory beyond the Shepherds' Stones, adding another obstacle to any would-be invader from the north. Not that the Korel organize invasions—but if they ever did, they'd have to cross the desert first.

The desert also limits Sestros's northern expansion. The Shailin could theoretically push into the foothills of the Shepherds' Stones, but why bother? Talresses teaches contentment. The grasslands provide everything they need.

## Resolution Bay

TODO

## Sestros

Tags: region, state, ve, savannah, desert

The heartland of western Ve—a kingdom of shepherds and silk-weavers ruled by a monarch who speaks for a god. Sestros stretches from the Red Desert in the north to Tukiwood in the south, from the coast at Nuin Bay to the Hills of Dolor in the east. It is orderly, prosperous, and unsettlingly content.

### Geography

Sestros occupies the most habitable portion of western Ve. The terrain transitions from dry savannah in the north, through rolling grasslands ideal for grazing in the center, to forested hill country in the south. The Glory River winds through the heart of the kingdom, providing water for the ranching communities that form the backbone of Sestran life.

**Boundaries:**
- **North**: Shepherds' Stones (mountain border with Edari)
- **East**: Hills of Dolor and the Dunes of Evioli (borders with the independent city-states)
- **South**: Tukiwood and the northern slopes of the Widebarrow Mountains
- **West**: Nuin Bay and the open coast

The kingdom is well-connected by road. A main route runs east from the capital at Mu, following the Glory River through the central grasslands before splitting—one branch heading northeast toward Shyona, the other southeast toward the Widebarrows.

### Mu (Capital)

The capital sits on Nuin Bay in the southwest, where the coastal trade meets the inland ranching economy. Mu is a modest city by continental standards—perhaps 15,000 people—but it's the largest settlement in Sestros by far. The royal palace dominates the skyline, a sprawling complex of whitewashed stone and silk banners that serves as both seat of government and primary temple to Talresses.

The harbor handles most of Sestros's textile exports, loading bolts of the finest silk in Ve onto ships bound for distant markets. The textile workshops cluster near the docks, their dye-vats producing the brilliant colors that make Sestran silk distinctive.

### Red Desert

The northern reaches of Sestros give way to true desert—the Red Desert, named for its iron-rich sands that glow crimson at sunset. Few live here permanently. Shepherds bring flocks to the desert's edges during the brief winter rains, when seasonal grasses sprout, but retreat south when the heat returns.

The ruins of Lurza stand at the desert's western edge, where it meets the Shepherds' Stones. See [Shepherds' Stones](./Shepherds' Stones.md) for details on that cursed place.

### Glory River

The primary waterway of central Sestros, the Glory River rises in the foothills of the Shepherds' Stones and flows east-southeast through the kingdom's heartland. Its banks support the densest settlement in Sestros—a string of ranching towns that depend on the river for water, irrigation, and transport.

The river's name comes from Shailin religious practice. They believe water that flows through Talresses's chosen land carries his blessing. Drinking from the Glory River is considered auspicious; bathing in it purifies the spirit. Whether Talresses actually blesses the water is debatable. The Shailin don't debate it.

### Tukiwood

The southern forest marks the transition between Sestros and the wilder lands beyond. Tukiwood is temperate woodland—oaks, maples, and scattered evergreens—that provides timber, game, and a buffer against whatever comes out of the Widebarrow foothills.

Logging operations work the forest's northern edges, but the Shailin don't push deep. Talresses teaches contentment with what one has. The deep woods remain largely unexplored.

### Nuin Bay

The southwestern coast curves around Nuin Bay, a sheltered natural harbor that makes Mu possible. The bay's calm waters allow year-round shipping, connecting Sestros to the broader world despite its relative isolation on Ve.

Fishing villages dot the bay's shores, providing seafood to supplement the meat-heavy Sestran diet. The fishermen worship Talresses alongside everyone else, though their prayers focus on calm seas rather than fat flocks.

### Why It Matters

Sestros controls the overland route across northern Ve. Anyone traveling between the western coast and Shyona, the Dunes of Evioli, or the eastern lands must pass through Sestran territory unless they want to risk Edari or sail around the continent. The Shailin don't exploit this—hospitality is a virtue Talresses demands—but their strategic position gives them quiet leverage they rarely need to use.

The kingdom also produces the finest textiles on Ve, possibly in the world. Sestran silk is a luxury good everywhere it reaches, and the merchants who trade in it make fortunes.

## Shepherds' Stones

Tags: mountains, geography, ve, edari, sestros

A dramatic mountain range running east-west across northern Ve, forming the natural border between Edari's empty savannah and the settled lands of Sestros. The range takes its name from the Shailin shepherds who graze their flocks on the southern slopes—the northern side belongs to the Korel.

### Geography

The Shepherds' Stones rise abruptly from the surrounding plains, their peaks reaching perhaps 8,000 feet at the highest points. The mountains are steep and rocky, with golden-brown stone that catches the light at dawn and dusk, seeming to glow against the sky. The passes are few and difficult—this is why Edari remains isolated despite being adjacent to settled territory.

The range runs roughly 200 miles from the coast near Mesyula Bay in the west to where it merges with the Hills of Dolor in the east. The western section is more dramatic, with sheer cliffs and narrow defiles; the eastern portion gradually diminishes into the broken hill country.

### The Border

The Shepherds' Stones serve as more than geography—they're a hard line between civilization and wilderness. South of the mountains, Sestran towns dot the landscape, roads connect communities, and the king's law nominally applies. North of the mountains, nothing. The Korel don't build, don't trade, don't negotiate. Cross the mountains uninvited and you become prey.

Sestran shepherds work the southern slopes, moving their flocks through seasonal pastures in the foothills. They don't cross the ridgeline. The Korel patrol the northern slopes and will kill anyone they find. This arrangement has held for generations—not through treaty, but through mutual recognition of the mountains as a boundary.

### Passes

Three passes allow crossing between Sestros and Edari, though "allow" is generous:

**Western Pass**: Near the coast, the lowest and easiest route. Also the most watched by Korel hunting parties. Traders occasionally attempt it; most turn back or die.

**Central Gap**: A high, difficult crossing through the heart of the range. Usable only in summer. The Korel patrol it less frequently because few are foolish enough to try.

**Eastern Descent**: Where the mountains diminish toward the Hills of Dolor. This route technically avoids the worst Korel territory by skirting into the exile lands. Travelers trade one danger for another.

### Lurza

At the western edge of the range, where the mountains meet the Red Desert, stand the ruins of **Lurza**—a fortress of black stone built by followers of a daemon called Vekkroth, a rival to Talresses who once contested control of western Ve.

The conflict ended badly for Vekkroth. Talresses's cult among the early Shailin grew stronger, more organized, more devoted. Vekkroth's followers were slaughtered, scattered, or converted. The daemon itself was driven from Ve entirely—not destroyed (daemons don't die that easily) but expelled, forced to seek worshippers elsewhere. Lurza was left standing as a monument to Talresses's victory.

The black stone is volcanic glass imported from somewhere outside Ve—a signature of Vekkroth's worship. The fortress's architecture is alien, all wrong angles and windowless halls, designed for rituals the Shailin never learned. The gates stand open because there's no one left to close them.

The Shailin avoid Lurza because Talresses told them to. He frames this as ancient wisdom about cursed places, but the truth is simpler: he doesn't want his followers examining the evidence of what happened here. Questions about Vekkroth lead to questions about daemon wars, which lead to questions about Talresses himself. Better to leave the black fortress empty and forgotten.

The Korel avoid it for different reasons. They sense something wrong about the place—a spiritual contamination that makes their fur stand on end. Vekkroth's power lingers in the stones even without worshippers to sustain it. The Korel trust their instincts. Their instincts say stay away.

### Why It Matters

The Shepherds' Stones shape travel across northern Ve. Anyone moving between the western coast and the eastern regions must either:
- Go south around the mountains through Sestros (safe but long)
- Sail around Edari entirely (expensive and weather-dependent)
- Risk the passes (dangerous)

This makes Sestros essential to overland trade, funneling traffic through their territory whether travelers like it or not. The Shailin don't abuse this position—hospitality matters to Talresses—but they benefit from it nonetheless.

## Shorolyn Forest

Tags: forest, geography, ve, avalon

The eastern forest of Avalon, covering the highlands where the kingdom approaches Dern and the Widebarrow Mountains. Unlike Avalon's other forests, Shorolyn has no special religious significance—it's simply woodland, harvested for timber and left wild where harvesting isn't practical.

### Geography

Shorolyn Forest spreads across eastern Avalon's rising terrain, roughly 100 miles from the settled lowlands to the Dern border. The forest thickens and the trees grow shorter as elevation increases; the highest reaches are more scrubland than true forest.

The **Honor Creek** flows through Shorolyn's western portion, draining northeast from the main Honor River. Several smaller streams descend from the highlands, eventually feeding the same watershed.

### Character

Shorolyn is working woodland. Logging operations claim the accessible portions, cutting timber that builds homes and ships across Avalon. The forest regrows; the operations are sustainable, managed by foresters trained in Promisewood who know how much can be taken without depleting the resource.

The interior remains wild—not forbidden, just unprofitable. The terrain is steep, the timber harder to extract, and there's plenty of easier wood closer to the settled areas. Wildlife thrives where the loggers don't reach: deer, boar, wolves, and the occasional bear.

### Border Zone

Shorolyn's eastern edges approach Dern. The border is poorly defined—mountains don't follow straight lines, and neither does the forest. Dernish loggers sometimes work Shorolyn's eastern slopes; Avalonian hunters sometimes pursue game into Dern. Neither kingdom makes an issue of minor incursions.

The main road from Karahoroz to Dodi passes through a gap in the forest, following the easiest route between the kingdoms. Traffic is regular; Avalon and Dern maintain friendly relations, and trade benefits both.

### Settlements

Several towns cluster around Shorolyn's edges:
- **Karahoroz**: The city on the forest's western edge, hub of eastern Avalon
- **Civicvler**, **Sarihalliler**, **Kochisar**: Towns in the northeast, near Honor Creek
- **Yasyan**, **Taylilar**: Towns on the forest's southern edge

The interior has no permanent settlements—just logging camps that move as operations shift.

### Location

Shorolyn Forest fills eastern Avalon between the Honor River valley and the Dern border, roughly 50 miles east of Tarolin at its nearest point.

## Snakemarsh

Tags: swamp, geography, ve, krell

A vast wetland in the western Krell Lands, fed by streams descending from the Hardshell Mountains. The Krell avoid deep water, making Snakemarsh one of the few refuges within their territory—though the serpentine inhabitants that give the marsh its name are not necessarily friendlier than the insects.

### Geography

Snakemarsh sprawls across perhaps forty square miles of low-lying terrain between the Hardshell Mountains and the jungle lowlands. The water is murky, warm, and slow-moving—a maze of channels, pools, and partially-flooded forest where dry ground is rare and temporary.

The marsh is fed primarily by mountain runoff, with water levels fluctuating dramatically between seasons. During the wet season, Snakemarsh expands to nearly double its dry-season extent. During the dry season, some areas become navigable by foot, though "navigable" is relative—the footing is treacherous and the snakes are always present.

### The Serpents

Snakemarsh hosts the highest concentration of serpent species in Ve. Dozens of varieties inhabit the waters, from finger-length swimmers to constrictors capable of taking down jungle cats. The marsh's namesakes dominate every ecological niche, competing with each other rather than with the Krell.

The largest species—locals call them "marsh lords"—reach lengths of thirty feet or more. These ambush predators lie motionless in the murk for days, then strike with explosive speed when prey ventures within range. They're a significant threat to humans, but their presence helps explain why the Krell don't enter the marsh in force.

Several serpent species are venomous. Some are edible. A few are both. The marsh-dwellers have learned which are which through generations of painful trial and error.

### Why the Krell Avoid It

Krell physiology doesn't handle deep water well. Their exoskeletons aren't watertight, their respiratory systems can't function when submerged, and their pheromone-based communication fails in wet environments. A single Krell can cross a stream; a swarm attempting to traverse Snakemarsh would lose cohesion and drown.

The marsh also disrupts Krell tunneling. The water table is too high, the substrate too soft. Any tunnel dug here floods immediately. This has made Snakemarsh a natural barrier to Krell expansion in certain directions.

Scouts patrol the marsh's edges, and occasionally small parties attempt crossings during the dry season. But these incursions are rare, limited, and easily avoided by anyone who knows how to read the Krell patrol patterns.

### The Marsh-Dwellers

A scattered population survives in Snakemarsh—refugees from the Consumption who fled here when their homes fell, and their descendants who've never known anywhere else. These marsh-dwellers live on elevated platforms built into the largest trees, fishing the channels and hunting the snakes that would otherwise hunt them.

The population is small, perhaps a few hundred across the entire marsh, organized into extended family groups that rarely interact. They speak a creole of the old languages, worship gods their ancestors abandoned elsewhere, and trust outsiders only slightly more than they trust the Krell.

What the marsh-dwellers know about the Krell Lands is valuable. They've watched the insects for generations, noted patterns that Yuki's watchers haven't observed, mapped approaches that don't appear on any chart. Traders who earn their trust can access information worth fortunes in the right markets.

### Navigating Snakemarsh

Travel through the marsh requires boats—flat-bottomed craft that can be poled through shallow channels. The marsh-dwellers build these from local materials and occasionally sell them to outsiders, though they rarely include guidance on which channels lead where.

The main hazards beyond serpents:

- **Getting lost** — The maze of channels all look similar; without local knowledge, travelers circle for days
- **Rising water** — Rain in the mountains can raise marsh levels within hours, stranding travelers on shrinking dry ground
- **Disease** — The water carries parasites and infections that target the unwary
- **The marsh-dwellers themselves** — Some view outsiders as threats, others as opportunities; neither response is reliably safe

### Strategic Value

Snakemarsh offers a route between the Suki Hills and the central Krell Lands that avoids the densest hive territories. The Southern Descent from the hills leads here, and from here, travelers can reach the Winger Mountains or the southern jungle without passing through Hardshell territory.

This makes the marsh valuable to expeditions seeking the Tomb of Theoron or other sites in the southern Krell Lands. It also makes it valuable to anyone who wants to move through Krell territory without being observed—smugglers, spies, and those with reasons to avoid Yuki's documentation requirements.

## Suki Hills

Tags: hills, geography, ve, frontier

A range of forested highlands marking the western boundary of the Krell Lands, the Suki Hills serve as the last defensible terrain between the insectoid swarms and Chimea's eastern territories. The twin city-states of Yuki and Garlow anchor the human presence here.

### Geography

The Suki Hills rise gradually from the North Suki jungle to the west, reaching elevations of several hundred feet before descending steeply into the Krell-controlled lowlands to the east. The terrain is broken and irregular—ridges, valleys, and isolated peaks create natural defensive positions and limit the effectiveness of mass Krell assaults.

The hills are heavily forested with hardwoods distinct from the lowland jungle. The canopy is less dense here, the undergrowth more manageable. Streams run down from the heights, feeding the wetlands below.

The range extends roughly fifty miles north-to-south, with the Twin Cities occupying the central portion where the hills are highest and the defensive advantages greatest.

### Strategic Importance

The Suki Hills exist as a frontier for one reason: the terrain favors defenders. Krell swarms lose their numerical advantage in the broken ground. Their tunneling is hindered by rocky substrate. Their coordination falters when line-of-sight pheromone communication is blocked by ridges and forest.

This hasn't stopped Krell incursions—scouts probe constantly, and small hives have occasionally established in the eastern foothills—but it has prevented the overwhelming swarmings that consumed the lowland kingdoms. The hills buy time. Time to spot buildups, time to respond, time to evacuate if necessary.

### The Watchtower Network

A system of elevated observation posts spans the Suki Hills, positioned on ridges and peaks with clear sightlines into Krell territory. Each tower is staffed by rotating teams of watchers who monitor insect movement patterns and report via aether-powered signals.

The network has functioned continuously for nearly two centuries. Its data has allowed Yuki's strategists to predict Krell behavior, identify hive locations, and respond to incursions before they become crises. The towers themselves are built to be abandoned quickly—when a swarm approaches, the watchers flee rather than defend.

### The Approaches

Three main routes connect the Suki Hills to the Krell Lands proper:

**The Shell Road** — The most direct path, following a river valley toward the Hardshell Mountains. Heavily trapped and constantly monitored. Expedition teams typically use this route because it's the best-mapped, despite the danger.

**The Southern Descent** — A series of switchbacks leading toward Snakemarsh. Less monitored, more treacherous terrain. Smugglers and independent operators sometimes prefer this route to avoid Yuki's fees.

**The Ridge Path** — A high route along the hill crests, eventually descending toward the Winger Mountains. Exposed but offers long sightlines. Rarely used except by scouts.

### Life in the Hills

Outside Yuki and Garlow, the Suki Hills support a scattered population of hunters, trappers, and hermits. These hill-folk maintain a precarious existence, trading with the cities while avoiding both Krell incursions and the tax collectors who occasionally venture out from Chimea.

Some of these residents are refugees who never made it to the cities. Others are outcasts who found the Twin Cities' rules too constraining. A few are watchers who retired from the towers and couldn't bear to leave the frontier entirely.

The hill-folk know the terrain intimately. Their knowledge supplements the formal watchtower network—they notice things the watchers miss, track Krell scout patterns, and occasionally provide warnings that save lives. In exchange, Yuki and Garlow leave them alone.

### What Lies Beneath

The Suki Hills contain extensive cave systems, some natural, some excavated by unknown predecessors. These caves have been mapped and trapped by Yuki's defenders—they serve as shelters, supply caches, and fallback positions if the surface defenses fail.

The deeper caves remain unexplored. Stories circulate about pre-Krell ruins in the depths, about creatures that predate the insectoid invasion, about tunnels that connect to the old kingdoms' underground networks. No one has verified these claims, and few are willing to venture far enough underground to try.

## Tomb of Theoron

Tags: ruins, poi, ve, krell

The burial complex of King Theoron III, last ruler of the Kingdom of Theoron, lies in the Winger Mountains—one of the few locations within the Krell Lands where the insects maintain visible interest without apparent purpose. Workers patrol the tomb's perimeter endlessly, circling but never entering.

### History

The Kingdom of Theoron ruled the central Krell Lands for three centuries before the Consumption, controlling fertile lowlands between the Hardshell and Winger mountain ranges. The kingdom was known for its wealth, its magical tradition, and its royal line's obsession with immortality.

King Theoron III—the kingdom's final ruler—spent the last decades of his reign constructing his tomb. He drew on the kingdom's treasury, its magical resources, and rumors say darker sources to create a burial complex unlike any in Ve. The project was still incomplete when the Krell arrived.

Theoron III died during the evacuation, attempting to reach his unfinished tomb rather than fleeing west with the refugees. His body was reportedly recovered by loyalists who completed the internment according to his wishes—though how they managed this during a Krell swarm remains unexplained.

### The Complex

The Tomb of Theoron occupies a natural amphitheater in the Winger Mountains, a bowl-shaped valley surrounded by steep cliffs. The entrance is carved into the valley's northern wall—a massive portal flanked by carved figures that refugee accounts describe as "guardians bound in stone."

Beyond the entrance, the complex reportedly extends deep into the mountain. Multiple chambers, descending levels, and trapped corridors protect the burial vault where Theoron III lies with his accumulated wealth and power.

No recent account describes the interior. Everything known about the tomb's layout comes from pre-Consumption records and the testimonies of refugees who helped construct it.

### The Treasure

Conservative histories estimate that Theoron III was buried with:

- **The Crown of Binding** — A magical artifact supposedly capable of compelling obedience from any who hear its wearer speak
- **Three centuries of accumulated gold and gems** — The kingdom's treasury, consolidated from the falling realm
- **The Theoron Grimoire** — A collection of magical knowledge, possibly including necromantic techniques
- **The bodies of his court** — Theoron III reportedly ordered his advisors and servants entombed with him

The grimoire attracts the most scholarly interest. Pre-Consumption Theoron was known for magical experimentation that other kingdoms found disturbing. If those records survived, they might explain mysteries that have puzzled scholars for generations.

### The Krell Behavior

What makes the Tomb of Theoron unique: the Krell pay attention to it.

Worker patrols circle the complex's perimeter in regular patterns—not the random scouting typical elsewhere, but organized circuits that continue day and night. They don't approach the entrance. They don't attempt to excavate. They simply... watch.

This behavior has continued for as long as observers have monitored the site. The Krell show no such interest in any other ruin within their territory.

Theories include:

- **The tomb contains something that threatens them** — A weapon, a ward, or an entity they're afraid to wake
- **The tomb contains something they want** — But can't access due to whatever protections Theoron installed
- **The Krell are guarding it** — Perhaps compelled by something within, or perhaps for reasons entirely alien
- **The behavior is coincidental** — Patrol routes that happen to circle the tomb for geographic reasons

None of these theories is satisfying. The Krell don't explain themselves.

### Reaching the Tomb

The Winger Mountains are the safest region within the Krell Lands—the insects avoid the interior for unknown reasons. But reaching the Wingers requires crossing active Krell territory, and the tomb itself lies near enough to the range's edge that the patrol behavior complicates approach.

Successful expeditions have typically:

1. Traveled through Snakemarsh to avoid the Hardshell hives
2. Approached the Wingers from the south, where Krell presence is lightest
3. Observed the tomb patrols from concealment to identify gaps in coverage
4. Attempted entry during patrol transitions

Most expeditions fail at step three. Those that reach step four discover that the tomb entrance is sealed—and that whatever Theoron III installed to protect his rest remains active.

### The Warnings

Refugees who escaped the Kingdom of Theoron carried warnings about the tomb. Their descendants in Garlow's Refugee Quarter still tell the stories:

*Do not wake the king. Do not take what he took. Do not speak the name he found.*

What these warnings mean is unclear. The refugees refuse to elaborate, insisting that some knowledge is better lost. Whether this reflects genuine magical danger or simply cultural trauma from the Consumption, no one can say.

What is known: every expedition that has confirmed entry to the tomb has disappeared. No bodies recovered. No equipment found. No explanation offered.

The tomb keeps its secrets.

## Tukiwood

Tags: forest, geography, ve, sestros

The southern forest of Sestros, marking the transition between the kingdom's settled grasslands and the wilder country beyond. Tukiwood is temperate woodland—dense enough to provide timber and game, open enough that the Shailin don't find it threatening.

### Character

Tukiwood spreads across the southern reaches of Sestros where the land rises toward the Widebarrow Mountains. The forest is primarily deciduous—oaks, maples, and similar hardwoods—with scattered evergreens on the higher slopes. The canopy is thick enough to shade the forest floor but not so dense as to block all light.

The forest covers perhaps 200 square miles, though the boundaries are imprecise. Grassland gives way gradually to scattered trees, then to proper woodland. The southern edge climbs into the foothills before the terrain becomes too steep and rocky for large trees.

### Resources

The Shailin harvest Tukiwood's northern edges for timber, charcoal, and game. Logging operations are modest—Talresses teaches contentment, and the Shailin have enough grassland that they don't need to clear forest for pasture. They take what they need and leave the rest.

Hunting parties venture deeper, pursuing deer and wild boar that provide variety from the mutton-heavy Sestran diet. Professional hunters know the forest well enough to navigate safely. Casual visitors sometimes get lost.

### What Lies Beyond

The deep forest is largely unexplored. The Shailin have no reason to push into it—everything they need lies in the grasslands—and Talresses's teachings discourage unnecessary curiosity. The southern reaches of Tukiwood give way to the foothills of the Widebarrow Mountains, where the terrain becomes too rugged for casual travel.

What lives in the deep forest is unknown. The hunters report normal wildlife—deer, boar, wolves, the occasional bear. But they don't go far enough south to encounter whatever might dwell in the mountain approaches. The Shailin don't worry about it. They don't worry about much.

### Significance

Tukiwood serves as Sestros's southern buffer. Any approach from the Widebarrows or Chimea would have to cross the forest first, giving the Shailin warning and defensive advantage. The forest also limits southern expansion, keeping the kingdom compact and manageable.

The timber industry, while modest, produces the wood that builds Sestran homes, ships, and weaving looms. The textile workshops of Mu depend on Tukiwood lumber for their equipment.

## Winger Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, ve, krell

A smaller range in the central-southern Krell Lands, the Winger Mountains are less densely populated by the insects than their northern counterpart. Something about these peaks makes the Krell uncomfortable—they patrol the perimeter but rarely establish permanent hives within.

### Geography

The Wingers rise abruptly from the jungle floor, a compact range roughly thirty miles across at its widest point. The peaks are lower than the Hardshells—four thousand feet at most—but steeper, with dramatic cliff faces and deep ravines cutting through the rock.

The mountains are volcanic in origin, though no active eruptions have occurred in recorded history. Geothermal activity persists in the form of hot springs, steam vents, and the occasional sulfurous pool. The rock itself has a reddish tinge from iron oxidation.

### The Stone That Burns

Local legend speaks of "the stone that burns"—a substance found in the Wingers that causes Krell to avoid the area. Whether this is literal (some mineral that harms them on contact), chemical (fumes they can't tolerate), or mystical (an ancient ward) remains unclear.

What's confirmed: Krell scouts patrol the Winger perimeter but don't enter the peaks. Expeditions that reach the interior report finding no hive structures, no tunnel entrances, no sign of permanent Krell presence. This is unique within the Krell Lands.

Several theories circulate:

- **Geothermal gases** — The volcanic activity may produce fumes toxic to Krell respiratory systems
- **Mineral content** — The reddish rock may contain something the Krell can't process
- **Ancient magic** — Pre-Consumption civilizations may have warded the mountains
- **Territorial instinct** — Something else claimed this territory first, and the Krell recognize the claim

No theory has been proven. The Krell don't explain themselves.

### The Tomb of Theoron

The most significant ruin in the Wingers is the burial complex of King Theoron III, last ruler of the Kingdom of Theoron. According to histories preserved by refugees, the tomb contains the accumulated wealth of a three-century dynasty: gold, gems, magical artifacts, and the mummified remains of the king himself.

What makes the tomb unusual: the Krell show interest in it. Workers patrol the perimeter of the complex, circling endlessly without entering. They've done this for as long as anyone has observed. No one knows why.

Some speculate the tomb contains the source of whatever repels the Krell—and they're trying to find a way in to neutralize it. Others believe the Krell are guarding the tomb, though from what and for whom remains unexplained.

### Expedition Potential

The Wingers represent the safest region within the Krell Lands—"safest" being relative. Expeditions that reach the interior can operate without constant Krell harassment. This has made the range a target for treasure hunters, scholars, and anyone else willing to risk the journey through hostile territory.

The main obstacles are:

1. **Getting there** — The approach passes through active Krell territory
2. **The terrain** — The Wingers themselves are difficult to navigate
3. **The unknowns** — Whatever keeps the Krell out may not be friendly to humans either
4. **Getting back** — The return journey is just as dangerous

Several expeditions have reached the Wingers successfully. Fewer have returned. Of those that returned, most report finding nothing of value—empty ruins, barren peaks, volcanic hazards. Whether they're telling the truth or protecting profitable secrets is debated in Yuki's taverns.

### What Lives Here

If the Krell avoid the Wingers, something else must occupy the ecological niche. Reports are fragmentary and contradictory:

- Large predatory birds nesting on the cliffs (possibly the source of the range's name)
- Creatures in the hot springs that don't match any known species
- Lights moving on the peaks at night
- Sounds from underground that don't match any natural phenomenon

The pre-Consumption Kingdom of Theoron used these mountains for religious purposes. Temples and shrines dot the slopes, dedicated to deities that refugees no longer worship. What rituals occurred here—and what might have been summoned or bound—remains lost to history.

## Yuki

Tags: citystate, ve, frontier, goblin

A fortified city-state in the Suki Hills, standing as the first line of defense against Krell expansion into Chimean territory. Yuki is a city of watchers, trappers, and survivors—people who've built their lives around the knowledge that the swarm could come any day.

### The Twin Cities

Yuki and its sister city Garlow exist in unusual symbiosis. Founded by refugees from the fallen Jaipon Confederacy roughly two centuries ago, the two cities were originally rival settlements competing for the same hilltop. When the first major Krell probe reached the hills in 3180 SD, the cities realized they would survive together or die separately.

Today, Yuki handles defense and diplomacy; Garlow handles production and supply. The cities are connected by a fortified road and share a common council, though each maintains its own internal governance. In practice, they function as a single entity with two geographic centers.

### The Etherweaver Population

Yuki's most distinctive feature is its goblin population. Roughly a third of the city's twelve thousand residents are etherweavers—the aether-producing goblin variant whose secretions fuel magical devices throughout Alaria. These goblins fled the Krell Lands during the Consumption, and their descendants have become integral to Yuki's survival.

The etherweavers maintain the city's defenses. Their aether powers the alarm systems, the communication network, and the devastating trap arrays that ring the hills. A Krell scout cannot approach within two miles of Yuki without triggering enchanted sensors that alert the entire garrison.

In exchange, Yuki provides the etherweavers with something rare: respect. Most of Ve views goblins as vermin or resources to be exploited. In Yuki, they sit on the council, own property, and are addressed as citizens. This has made the city a magnet for goblin refugees from across the region.

### Defenses

Yuki's survival depends on making Krell incursions too costly to sustain. The city has developed defensive doctrine over two centuries of skirmishes:

**The Kill Zones** — The approaches to Yuki are laced with traps: pitfalls, spike arrays, poison gas vents, and alchemical fire triggers. The trappers know exactly which paths are safe; everyone else gambles. These defenses are constantly maintained and regularly repositioned to prevent Krell scouts from mapping them.

**The Watchtowers** — A network of elevated positions throughout the Suki Hills, connected by aether-powered signaling devices. Watchers rotate through these posts, observing Krell movement patterns and providing early warning of any buildup near the border.

**The Burners** — Specialist teams equipped with alchemical incendiaries. When a Krell tunnel is discovered, the burners descend and flood it with fire. The work is dangerous, claustrophobic, and essential—a single overlooked tunnel can allow thousands of Krell to bypass surface defenses.

### Economy

Yuki survives on three industries:

**Aether Production** — The etherweavers produce a steady supply of goblin aether, which Yuki exports to Chimea, Shyona, and the western city-states. The quality is high, the supply is reliable, and the prices are steep. Yuki can afford to be expensive because the alternative sources involve enslaving goblins, which many buyers find distasteful.

**Intelligence** — Yuki knows more about the Krell Lands than any other settlement. Maps, patrol patterns, hive locations, seasonal behaviors—all of this information has value. Scholars, military planners, and treasure hunters pay well for Yuki's accumulated knowledge.

**Expedition Support** — Those mad enough to enter the Krell Lands usually stage from Yuki. The city provides guides (expensive), supplies (expensive), and extraction guarantees (extremely expensive, limited coverage). Most expeditions fail. Yuki profits regardless.

### Governance

The Twin Cities Council consists of twelve members: six from Yuki, six from Garlow, with the goblin population guaranteed at least two seats. The council handles inter-city matters; internal affairs remain with each city's own assemblies.

The current First Speaker is **Matron Vesara Koh**, a human woman whose family has held leadership positions since the founding. She's pragmatic, ruthless about defense spending, and surprisingly diplomatic with Chimea—whose military assistance Yuki may eventually need.

### The Unspoken Fear

Everyone in Yuki knows the math. The city has twelve thousand people. The nearest Krell hive has over two hundred thousand. If a queen ever decides to swarm west, Yuki's defenses will buy time—perhaps days, perhaps weeks—but they will not hold indefinitely.

The city plans for this possibility without discussing it openly. Evacuation routes are maintained. Supplies are cached along the road to Chimea. Children are taught the escape protocols as soon as they can walk.

Yuki exists because the Krell haven't seriously tried to take it yet. Everyone hopes that continues.
