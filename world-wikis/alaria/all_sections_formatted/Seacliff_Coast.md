### Coral Hills

Hills made of coral/sandstone that have been revealed after sea levels fell. Full of deep caves. Rumored that lots of pirates have their treasure buried here. Immune to stone magic, so quite secure.

### Shardmaw Isles

Northwest of Gyosha and west of the Coral Hills lie the Shardmaw Isles—a treacherous archipelago rich in magical crystals. These razor-sharp crystalline formations jut from the seafloor, some rising up to forty feet above the water's surface. The crystals are prized for weapon-making, capable of holding an impossibly keen edge, but they are equally effective at destroying ships.

Navigating the Shardmaw Isles is a deadly proposition—the crystalline protrusions tear through hulls with ease, sending vessels to the bottom. The isles are adjacent to the Shipwreck Hills, where boats torn to pieces by the crystal fangs frequently wash ashore, their wreckage a testament to the danger these waters pose.

### Shipwreck Hills

West of Gyosha lie the Shipwreck Hills—a series of islands whose hills are dotted with the remains of countless wrecked vessels. Ships destroyed by the nearby Shardmaw Isles wash ashore here, their broken hulls littering the landscape like tombstones in a maritime graveyard.

The hills are inhospitable not just because of the treacherous terrain, but because they are home to rusalka and wyrms. The wyrms—serpentine creatures that once roamed the crust of the world as titans the size of mountain ranges—have diminished over the ages. Now they rarely exceed a thousand feet in length, but they are still formidable predators. The combination of predatory wyrms and deadly water spirits makes the Shipwreck Hills a place to avoid, despite the potential salvage opportunities among the wrecks.

## Iqes

Tags: state, nation

A state on the Seacleft Coast, notable for the dangerous archipelagos in its territorial waters.

### Golem's Teeth

An archipelago of jagged islands east of Iqes proper, named for the sharp, tooth-like rock formations that rise from the sea. The treacherous waters and razor-sharp rocks have claimed countless ships over the centuries.

#### Islands North of Golem's Teeth

The smaller islands scattered north of the main Golem's Teeth archipelago are avoided by sailors who know the local legends.

##### Dreadwreck

The location of a cursed shipwreck—a Gruynmar vessel that ran aground after its entire crew was petrified by a gorgon. The ship smashed against the rocks and now lies broken on the shore, its stone crew still frozen in their final moments of terror. The wreck is shunned by all who know of it, as the gorgon still makes its lair among the petrified sailors, waiting for new victims to add to its collection of statues.

### Ederri

An underwater sinkhole region off the eastern coast of Iqes in the Agreben Sea. The sinkholes descend into deep underwater caverns and passages.

#### Voidlock Passage

Deep within the Ederri sinkholes lies the collapsed, underwater Voidlock Passage—once a seagate leading to the underrealm of Zylogmus Eternus. The passage has collapsed but remains partially functional in a strange way: as you descend deeper and deeper into the flooded tunnels, the water becomes shared between the two locations, existing in both places simultaneously. This creates a dangerous phenomenon where currents from Zylogmus Eternus can pull swimmers into the underrealm without warning.

## Moigos

Tags: state, nation

A state on the Seacleft Coast, positioned between mainland Upoceax and the Tyvern Isles.

### Isle of the Night

West of the mainland settlement of Eskiloko, situated in the waters between Moigos and the Tyvern Isles, lies the Isle of the Night—a mysterious island enveloped within the Gloomterror Forest.

#### Gloomterror Forest

An otherworldly forest that covers the island, where darkness is absolute and unnatural.

##### Blackpoint

An island location within the Gloomterror Forest, totally shrouded in impenetrable shadows. No source of light works on this island—torches gutter, magical light fails, and even the sun seems unable to pierce the supernatural darkness.

Immense treasure is said to be buried on Blackpoint, drawing countless treasure hunters despite the impossibility of searching in absolute darkness. The island is guarded by umbral citadels—living shadows that have taken fortress-form, attacking any who dare set foot on the lightless shore.

## Tyvern Isles

Tags: island, geography

A group of islands off the Seacleft Coast, home to the Tuktuk people. The islands are dominated by dense jungle and mysterious ruins.

### Jungles of Tyvern

The interior of the Tyvern Isles is covered in thick tropical jungle, dangerous and wild.

#### Tower of Gwyndar

An ancient fortress deep in the jungles, serving as a landmark and strategic position. The tower predates current Tuktuk settlement and shows signs of much older construction.

#### Black Forest

Located in the jungles near the Tower of Gwyndar, the Black Forest is an unnatural place where nearly all color has been drained away. Your shadow can leave your body here, becoming separated and wandering independently—a deeply unsettling phenomenon that can result in permanent loss of one's shadow.

Large ogres that have lost their shadows live in this forest, hunting by the absence of light rather than its presence. The forest is extremely dangerous, as those who lose their shadows often lose part of their essence, becoming hollow and susceptible to possession by shadow entities.

### Southern Tyvern

The southern islands of the Tyvern archipelago feature different terrain and resources from the central jungles.

#### Ribwood Forest

A forest on the southern Tyvern Islands, home to a rare and valuable tree species known as ribwood. This remarkable wood is completely fireproof—it doesn't burn under any circumstances, making it incredibly valuable for shipbuilding. Wealthy merchants and pirates prize ribwood vessels above all others, as they're immune to fire arrows, Greek fire, and the countless other flame-based hazards of naval warfare.

However, harvesting ribwood comes at a cost. The Tuktuk people live in and around the Ribwood Forest, and they fiercely resent outsiders who ravage their homeland for profit. Logging expeditions into the forest frequently end in violence, with Tuktuk warriors ambushing the loggers. Despite the danger, the lure of fireproof ships ensures that treasure-seekers continue to risk the Tuktuk's wrath to harvest the precious wood.
