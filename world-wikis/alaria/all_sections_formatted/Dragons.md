## Chavux

Green dragon. No specialty, but growing older and more obnoxious. Has been making occasional raids on passing ships. Adron can't do anything about it because to kill a dragon is sacrilege.

## Straker

Tags: dragon

Tidal dragon. Master of waves, beaches, seas

A neutral dragon. Sailors ask for "Straker's Blessing" when crossing the sea, sometimes, because legend holds that Straker has saved the most courageous and worthy sailors in times of rough seas. 

Possesses a few elemental stones of water and air. Spends most of his time basking on the beach, relaxing among tidepools. Totally unreadable.

Desires to one day encounter a champion worthy to receive his mentorship. Straker once trained heros in the age of champions. Can turn a fighter into the best fighter they can become. Has an assistant Herexes (Sharabha revenant) who was right-hand man (and lover) of Straker's last hero, and he travels the world searching for another hero to take original hero's (Craggus??) place.

## Strolzaq

The Dwelyn queen's beautiful, emerald dragon. In Enapay. Absolutely ancient dragon, connected with the Dwelyn for as long as the Dwelyn have existed. The dragon is now sick, however. The song of Melera has been poisoned nearby.

Dragon of darkness, water, and earth. Serpentine, slippery, beautiful. Great powers over sleep, mind, and a ferocious melee fighter.

## Tepheranos

Tags: dragon

Tepheranos is a black dragon, and brother of Rothogomos. Long ago, they came to Argysis to conquer the mountain and steal the dwarven treasure. However, upon entry, Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, and took the treasure for his own. Tepheranos was forced to retreat, and took over the small, unassuming kingdom of Anarak nearby. Since then, Tepheranos has made Anarak much more successful, while Argysis has stagnated. Tepheranos still wants his revenge, and his relative failure has made Rothogomos bitter, and is likewise now intent on revenge.

## Xislmere

Tags: dragon

Xislmere resides in the far north, among the Knives Mountains. She guards the indestructible, and only current portal from the Material Plane to the Stalactites of Geth. Specifically, the portal leads to Chagus, the home of Volganor, king of demons.

Xislmere guards the portal, preventing demons from traveling through to this plane. She breathes ice and cold, which the demons are weak to. The portal is kept under 1000 feet of solid ice, deep inside the glacier that she resides within.
