## Agtakkeri

Tags: dragon, dark green, shacklands, tamadrez

The Flayed Banner. The Skinning Wind. Agtakkeri has many names among Gorathi sailors, none spoken willingly.

A dark green dragon of immense age and patient cruelty, Agtakkeri lairs on Shinori Island in the archipelago north of Tamadrez. For over two centuries, the dragon has made the northern approaches to Pesalolo a death sentence for Gorathi vessels. Any ship flying imperial colors—or carrying slaves—draws Agtakkeri's attention. The dragon has an uncanny ability to identify slave vessels even when disguised, though whether this is magic, informants, or simply the smell of suffering, no one knows.

The waters between Shinori, Pukot Island, and the Tamadrezan coast are called the Skinning Grounds. Gorathi naval maps mark them with a simple skull. Veterans of the Tamadrez run drink to forget what they've heard from survivors.

### The Grudge

Agtakkeri's hatred of Gorath is not righteous. It is petty, personal, and very, very old.

When Gorathi explorers first charted the northern islands six centuries ago, they encountered Agtakkeri's territory. The dragon demanded tribute—the traditional arrangement between dragons and the foolish mortals who sailed near their lairs. The expedition's commander, a man named Veryx, refused. Worse, when Agtakkeri's priest-envoy arrived to negotiate, Veryx had him killed and his body displayed on the ship's prow.

This insult began the grudge. The wound deepened two centuries later when another Veryx—a descendant of the original, now a renowned dragonslayer—tracked Agtakkeri to Shinori and scarred the dragon's left eye in single combat. The dragonslayer escaped. His descendants hold minor noble titles in Azantir to this day. Agtakkeri knows their names.

What started as a territorial dispute and metastasized through personal injury has become something like a religion for Agtakkeri. The dragon keeps a mental ledger of every Gorathi ship sunk—currently somewhere in the hundreds. It is not protecting anyone. It is keeping score.

### The Method

Agtakkeri strikes at dawn, when visibility is poor and crews are tired from night watch. The dragon rises from the waves without warning, capsizes smaller vessels with its bulk, and breathes poison gas across the decks of larger ships. Those who jump overboard and swim are ignored—they are not Gorathi, not anymore, just bodies in the water.

Those who remain are taken.

What Agtakkeri does to captured Gorathi sailors is infamous. The dragon keeps them alive for days on Shinori's rocky shores. Fishermen from Pukot Island have heard the screaming carry across the water. The dragon asks them questions—names, ranks, ship origins, family connections. It wants to know if any are related to the Veryx bloodline. It wants to update its ledger.

Occasionally a flayed skin appears nailed to driftwood, pushed by currents toward Azantir. These are Agtakkeri's messages. The dragon has never sent words. It has never needed to.

### The Accidental Protector

Agtakkeri does not free slaves. It kills everyone on Gorathi ships—crew, captain, and cargo alike. The dragon makes no distinction between slaver and enslaved. Hundreds of Drasnian dwarves have drowned in ships Agtakkeri sank "on their behalf."

The survivors are those who jump before the attack and swim for the islands. Agtakkeri ignores swimmers. It wants the *ships*.

And yet.

Because of Agtakkeri, the northern approaches to Tamadrez are impassable for Gorathi vessels. Small boats fleeing the Slave Coast can slip through waters no imperial captain will enter. The dragon has saved more escaped slaves than any underground railroad—not because it cares about them, but because it cares about hurting Gorath.

This creates an impossible moral situation. Agtakkeri is a monster. It tortures people to death. It drowns innocents along with slavers. But it is also the single greatest check on Gorathi naval power in the region. Kill the dragon, and Gorath's ships can finally seal the northern escape routes. Leave it alive, and the screaming continues.

### The Bounty

Emperor Veramus has made Agtakkeri's death a priority. The current bounty—accumulated over decades of increases—would purchase a county. Gorathi noble families have sent private expeditions. The Imperial Navy has attempted coordinated strikes. Adventurers from across Alaria have tried their luck.

No one has collected.

Agtakkeri is ancient, cunning, and fights in an environment it knows perfectly. The dragon uses the island chains for cover, attacks from underwater, and retreats into cave systems that flood at high tide. It has killed three dragonslayers, sixteen naval captains, and an uncounted number of would-be heroes.

More frustrating for Gorath: Agtakkeri is patient. It doesn't attack every ship—just enough to make the northern route unusable. Captains never know if this voyage will be the one. The psychological toll breaks crews faster than direct attacks ever could.

### Shinori Island

Agtakkeri's lair occupies the eastern face of Shinori Island, a network of sea caves accessible only at low tide or by swimming through flooded tunnels. The island itself is uninhabited—even the desperate avoid it. Pukot Island to the north and the Liki Forest island to the south give Shinori wide berth.

The shores are scattered with wreckage: rotting ship timbers, corroded metal fittings, and bones. Many bones. Some are arranged deliberately—a dragon's idea of decoration or warning.

Occasionally, escaped slaves wash up on Shinori after surviving an attack. They must survive on the island until they can build a raft to Pukot. Agtakkeri ignores them entirely. They are not Gorathi. They are not interesting.

### Appearance

Agtakkeri's scales are the dark green of jungle canopy at twilight—almost black in shadow, revealing their true color only in direct light. The dragon is large even by ancient standards, its wingspan sufficient to shadow a merchant vessel. The left eye is a ruin, scarred white from the Veryx dragonslayer's blade two centuries ago.

The dragon moves through water as easily as air, capable of holding its breath for hours and striking from beneath the waves. Salt crusts the scales permanently; Agtakkeri smells of brine and something else—something chemical and choking, the residue of its poison breath.

### Hooks

- **The Bounty Hunt**: Gorath offers enough gold to change a party's life forever. The moral weight might change them too.

- **Protect the Monster**: Tamadrezan resistance asks the party to stop a major Gorathi dragonslaying expedition. Success means keeping a torturer alive. Failure means sealing the escape routes.

- **The Survivor's Revenge**: A Drasnian dwarf who watched fellow slaves drown in an Agtakkeri attack wants the dragon dead—not for Gorath, but for the innocents it murdered. They don't care about the political consequences.

- **What the Dragon Knows**: Agtakkeri has observed Gorathi naval operations for two centuries. It knows shipping schedules, patrol routes, and the locations of hidden supply caches. This information could be invaluable to the right buyer—but the dragon only negotiates with those who bring it a Gorathi captain, alive.

- **The Veryx Heir**: One of the dragonslayer's descendants has had enough of looking over their shoulder. They want to finish what their ancestor started—or broker a peace, if such a thing is possible with a dragon keeping a six-century grudge.

## Bathemiel

Tags: dragon, free-isles, chained

The chained dragon beneath Mpehi, bound in the depths since before humans arrived at the Free Isles. Bathemiel grants the ruling patrón of Mpehi the power to transform any non-living matter into gold—a gift that has made the Gattorini family wealthy beyond measure and slowly driven each successive patrón mad.

### Nature

Bathemiel is ancient even by dragon standards. No living scholar can date the creature's arrival at the Free Isles, and the dragon itself offers no clarity on the subject. It sleeps in vast caverns beneath Mpehi, bound by chains of dull gray metal that defy identification—neither iron, nor steel, nor any known alloy. The chains predate the Gattorini, possibly predate human settlement entirely. Some believe Bathemiel bound itself. Others suspect a power older than dragons.

The dragon is massive, its scales a deep amber-gold that might be natural or might be a consequence of centuries producing golden gifts. Its eyes, when they open, reflect wealth—not fire, not hunger, but the glint of coins and the weight of obligation. It speaks rarely, and only through dreams, conveying messages that feel more like requirements than requests.

### The Bargain

When the first Gattorini arrived at Mpehi and discovered the caverns beneath, Bathemiel was already chained. The dragon offered a deal: tend the caverns, maintain the chains, and receive in return a gift beyond price. The exact terms were recorded in a vault that no subsequent patrón has been able to open. What remains is the power—the ability to transform non-living matter into pure gold through touch.

The gift is genuine. The gold is real. Every patrón who has wielded it has also eventually lost their mind, convinced that the transformation is spreading to their own flesh, that their blood is thickening to metal, that their heart is slowly transmuting. Several have died tearing at their own skin. The current patrón, Donna Serephina Gattorini, has worn golden gauntlets for fifteen years, refusing to touch anything—or anyone—directly.

### Recent Activity

After centuries of cryptic silence, Bathemiel's messages have become more urgent. Donna Serephina dreams of golden hands reaching up from the earth. The dragon speaks of payments due, of prices delayed too long, of a soul that must choose the chain. The Gattorini don't know what Bathemiel wants. They suspect they won't like it.

The dragon's caverns show signs of activity—fresh scratches on the chains, new patterns in the dust, warmth rising through stones that were cold for generations. Something is changing beneath Mpehi. The Gattorini are quietly researching ways to break the bargain, modify the terms, or simply understand what they agreed to. So far, they've found nothing.

### Disposition

Bathemiel is patient, ancient, and utterly alien in its priorities. It doesn't think in human timeframes or human terms. A century is a brief nap. A generation is an eyeblink. Whatever the dragon wants, it has been waiting for a very long time—and its patience appears to be ending.

Approaching Bathemiel requires Gattorini permission, which is never given. The cavern entrances are sealed, guarded, and protected by wards that kill intruders. Even Gattorini family members don't visit the dragon directly; dreams are considered sufficient communication.

If Bathemiel were freed—or if the bargain were broken—the consequences would be catastrophic. A dragon that old, that powerful, bound for that long, would have motivations beyond mortal understanding. The Gattorini have kept the chains maintained for centuries. They hope they never find out what happens if they stop.

## Chavux

Tags: monster, dragon

Green dragon. No specialty, but growing older and more obnoxious. Has been making occasional raids on passing ships. Adron can't do anything about it because to kill a dragon is sacrilege. There are merchants in Grey Port and Shipmarsh who would pay a lot of money to have the problem "solved" however.

## Elebria

Sad female dragon.

## Ezelmere

Ezelmere is the ancient, dragon saint of the Ythari elves. Lives in the forest, is immortal, and is visited by the Ythari who ask her for advice. BRing her sacrifices too. She hunts the deer of the forst. Has always hated Nabuhe.

## Ezra Olkanis

Tags: dragon, ancient, wycendeula, eyendra, riin

The dragon called Ezra Olkanis has dwelt in the Eyendra forest for longer than any human civilization on Upoceax has existed. The name itself is Riin—the language of a people who no longer exist as individuals—and translates roughly to "the one who remained." Whether the dragon chose this name or the Riin gave it to her is a question no one alive can answer.

### Appearance

Ezra Olkanis is vast even by dragon standards, though she moves with a stillness that makes her seem smaller until she chooses otherwise. Her scales have taken on the colors of the forest over millennia—deep greens and browns, bark-textured in places, with patches of moss and lichen that grow on her undisturbed. Her eyes are the amber of old sap, and they move slowly, tracking things mortals cannot see.

She rarely flies anymore. When she does, the forest goes quiet for miles.

Those who have seen her describe an impression more than a creature—the sense of something ancient and patient watching from the treeline, present in the way old growth is present. Her lair, somewhere in the deep forest west of Zor, has never been mapped. Those who go looking do not return, though whether the dragon kills them or the forest simply absorbs them is unclear.

### Nature

Ezra Olkanis operates on timescales that make mortal concerns nearly invisible to her. She has watched civilizations rise and fall, and the Riin were only one of them—though they were the one she cared about, in whatever way dragons care.

She is not cruel, but she is not kind. Cruelty requires attention, and she has too much time to waste it on malice. When she acts, it is because something has finally crossed a threshold she established centuries ago. The people of Zor tell stories of entire expeditions vanishing after disturbing the wrong ruin—not attacked, simply gone. Whether the dragon did this or merely allowed it, the effect is the same.

What she wants is unclear. She maintains the pact with Zor, enforces boundaries within Eyendra, and occasionally demands service—but toward what end? She has never explained. She has never explained anything.

When she speaks—rarely, and only to those who interest her—her voice is described as coming from everywhere at once, as if the forest itself were talking. Her words are precise, archaic, and often answer questions that weren't asked while ignoring the ones that were.

### The Riin Connection

Ezra Olkanis was old before the Riin built their first settlement. By the time they had grown into a civilization, she had been watching them for centuries. The nature of their relationship is preserved only in fragments—the Riin practiced a form of magic that merged them with the land, and some believe the dragon taught them. Others believe she merely observed. The dragon has never clarified.

What is certain: when the Riin reached the culmination of their art—when they attempted the final merger that would bind them permanently to Eyendra—the dragon did not stop them. Whether she couldn't, or wouldn't, or simply chose to see what would happen, the result was the same. The Riin did not die. They diffused. The forest absorbed them, or they became the forest, or some combination that mortal language cannot capture.

Now Ezra Olkanis is the only being alive who knew them as they were—every Riin face, every name, every conversation across two thousand years of civilization. Whether she carries this as burden or treasure, whether she grieves or simply observes, she has not said.

Some scholars believe she is waiting for the Riin to reconstitute—that the diffusion was not permanent, and given enough time, they will coalesce back into individuals. Others believe she is ensuring they never do. Still others suggest the dragon's goals have nothing to do with the Riin at all, that she is simply territorial in the way dragons are territorial, and the Riin connection is incidental. Her behavior supports any of these interpretations.

### Relationship with Zor

The city-state of Zor exists because Ezra Olkanis permits it.

The arrangement predates Zor's current form—the original agreement was made with a fishing village that eventually grew into a city. Every generation, Zor's rulers reaffirm the pact, though the dragon has not appeared in person for over two centuries. The terms are straightforward:

**Zor must not disturb the interior.** Certain ruins are forbidden. Certain lakes must never be approached. The boundaries shift over decades—the dragon sends word through channels no one discusses publicly—and Zor obeys. Those who don't tend to vanish.

**Zor must report what it observes.** Changes in the forest, unusual activity, strangers asking questions. The dragon wants eyes on her borders.

**The dragon may demand service.** Guides, supplies, artifacts, occasionally people with particular skills. Those summoned to the interior usually return.

**Zor may take from the forest's edge.** Timber, herbs, game—all permitted within a day's travel of the coast. Beyond that invisible line, permission ends.

In exchange, Zor survives. Whether the dragon actively protects them or merely refrains from destroying them is debated. Zor has never been attacked by the forest's deeper dangers, but whether that's the dragon's doing or simply luck is unknown.

### Moral Complexity

Ezra Olkanis defies simple categorization.

She allowed the Riin to destroy themselves—or become something else, depending on interpretation—and now guards the territory they became. She maintains a pact with Zor that costs the city little but binds them absolutely. She kills those who disturb the interior—but she has never attacked Zor itself, not once in eight hundred years.

Those who have spoken with her describe contradictions. She expresses something like grief when discussing the Riin, but refuses to say she could have stopped them. She hoards knowledge about them that she will not share. She treats mortals with indifference bordering on contempt, but has maintained a relationship with Zor longer than most nations have existed.

What drives her is unknown. Dragons are territorial; perhaps she simply claimed this forest long ago and the Riin were an interruption she's still processing. Dragons are possessive; perhaps the Riin were hers in some way, and what remains of them still is. Dragons live for millennia; perhaps her motives operate on timescales mortals cannot perceive, and what looks like vigil is simply patience.

The common theory: she is waiting. For what, no one knows.

### Lair

Ezra Olkanis dwells somewhere in the deep Eyendra, roughly 120 miles west of Zor. The exact location has never been established—those who get close enough to find it don't come back, and scrying fails within the forest's interior.

What is known: the lair is not a cave or a ruin but a section of forest so old and tangled that the canopy blocks all light. The trees there are massive, impossibly ancient, and they grow in patterns that suggest intention. The dragon rests among them, or beneath them, or possibly *as* them—reports vary. The Riin built nothing there, which is strange given how thoroughly they settled everywhere else. Either they respected it as the dragon's domain, or the dragon ensured nothing permanent rose near her.

Treasure, if it exists, is not gold or gems. Ezra Olkanis collects Riin artifacts—objects, documents, things the forest hasn't absorbed. Whether she hoards them possessively or preserves them deliberately, the effect is the same: if you want to understand the Riin, you would need to reach her lair. No one has.

### Hooks

- **The boundary moved.** Zor's foresters report that the safe extraction zone has shrunk—trees they've harvested for generations are now responding badly to approach. The dragon has sent no word explaining the change. Is she tightening control, or is something else happening in the interior that requires a larger buffer?

- **The dragon spoke.** For the first time in two centuries, Ezra Olkanis sent word to Zor's ruling council. A single sentence: "Something is moving in Wer Azenzi." No one knows what this means, but the council is seeking outsiders to investigate—Zor's own people are bound by the pact not to enter the lake region.

- **A Riin artifact surfaced.** A trader arrived in Zor with an object clearly of Riin make—a small stone that hums when touched and shows images of faces no one recognizes. He claims he found it on the coast, washed up after a storm. If true, the interior is reaching outward. If false, someone has been where they shouldn't.

- **The dragon wants to talk.** Word reaches the party that Ezra Olkanis has requested a meeting—specifically with outsiders, specifically those with no connection to Zor. She has never done this before. What she wants, and why now, is unknown. Getting to her lair alive is the first challenge.

- **Zor is pushing boundaries.** A faction within Zor's government believes the dragon is dead, gone, or exaggerated. They've begun planning expeditions into the interior to test the pact's enforcement. The traditionalist faction is horrified and seeking help—either to stop the expeditions or to warn the dragon before she demonstrates exactly how present she still is.

## Iorsi the Terrible

## Julrus the Fierce

Sand dragon. Guards the mirrored palace.

## Kanzekill

Tags: dragon, force, dragons-spine-coast, leyline

A rust-orange Force dragon who has hunted the same quarry for over four centuries. Kanzekill lairs in the southern Dragon's Spine mountains, near the village that bears a corruption of her name, and spends her existence searching for Mountainveil—a hidden fortress she cannot find, built by survivors of a kingdom she destroyed.

### The Obsession

Kanzekill doesn't rule her territory. She doesn't demand tribute or terrorize villages for sport. She barely notices the surface kingdoms anymore. Her entire existence has narrowed to a single purpose: finding Mountainveil.

The fortress exists. She knows it exists. She can feel its presence—a massive concentration of Force magic somewhere in the mountains, tantalizingly close. But every time she draws near, something turns her aside. The trail goes cold. Her certainty wavers. She finds herself circling back, searching ground she's already searched, following paths that lead nowhere.

The locals have learned her patterns. When Kanzekill is actively hunting, she's predictable—methodical sweeps through the peaks, systematic investigation of caves and valleys. During these periods, travelers know which routes to avoid. When the trail goes cold and she retreats to her lair in frustrated rage, the mountains shake with her fury, but she doesn't emerge to hunt easier prey. She broods. She plans. She begins again.

Four hundred years of this. The same search, the same failure, the same maddening certainty that the prize is *right there* if she could only see it.

### What She Wants

The "enumerable riches" Mountainveil supposedly contains aren't what drive Kanzekill. Gold means nothing to a dragon who hasn't added to her hoard in centuries. What Mountainveil holds is her *name*.

When Kanzekill destroyed the Kingdom of Vael—a human realm that once controlled the western Dragon's Spine passes—the survivors didn't just flee with treasure. They fled with something far more valuable: her true name, extracted through rituals she still doesn't fully understand, bound into an object she has never seen.

Without her true name, Kanzekill is diminished. Not weak—she remains one of the most dangerous creatures in the Dragon's Spine—but *incomplete*. Her mastery of Force magic, which should be absolute, has a ceiling she cannot break through. She can feel the leyline's power flowing beneath her, through her, and she cannot fully grasp it. The name is the key, and the key is in Mountainveil.

The cruelest irony: whoever holds her name could theoretically command her. The survivors didn't just steal her power—they forged it into a weapon pointed at her heart. Every day Mountainveil remains hidden is another day that weapon exists.

### The Kingdom of Vael

Five centuries ago, Vael was a prosperous mountain kingdom—humans and others who had carved out a civilization in the western Dragon's Spine, controlling the passes between the coast and the interior. They were scholars as much as merchants, and their mages had learned to tap the Force leyline that ran beneath their realm.

Kanzekill came because dragons come. She was younger then, already powerful, drawn by the leyline's song and the kingdom's accumulated wealth. What followed was standard dragon conquest: demands for tribute, then punishment when tribute proved insufficient, then systematic destruction when the kingdom resisted.

But Vael's mages had time to prepare. As their cities burned, they worked a ritual that had never been attempted—extracting a dragon's true name from her essence while she was distracted by slaughter. They bound it into a vessel, and the survivors fled with it while Kanzekill razed what remained.

She didn't notice the theft immediately. Dragons don't use their true names; they guard them. It was only later, when she tried to push deeper into Force magic and found herself blocked, that she understood what had been taken. By then, the survivors had vanished. Mountainveil had been built. The hunt began.

### Character

Kanzekill is patient in the way that water is patient—she will wear down mountains given time, but she's also capable of sudden, devastating violence when obstacles present themselves. She is intelligent, methodical, and utterly consumed by her purpose.

She doesn't negotiate. There's nothing anyone can offer her except the location of Mountainveil, and anyone who claims to know that location had better be telling the truth. She has torn apart liars before, and she can tell when someone is hiding something. The problem is that almost no one knows anything to hide.

Her rages, when they come, are terrifying but brief. Concussive force tears through the mountains—avalanches, shattered peaks, shockwaves that flatten forests. Then silence. Then the hunt resumes. The surface kingdoms have learned that her rages aren't directed at them; they're the tantrums of a hunter who has lost the trail again.

She speaks rarely, and when she does, her voice carries the weight of compressed air—words that hit like physical blows. She has no interest in conversation, no patience for those who waste her time, no mercy for those who get in her way.

### Force Magic

Kanzekill is Force-attuned, and her connection to the element shapes everything about her:

**Breath Weapon**: Pure concussive devastation. No fire, no acid—just a wave of kinetic force that pulverizes stone, shatters bone, and turns armor into shrapnel. At close range, her breath doesn't just kill; it *erases*, reducing targets to scattered components.

**Movement**: She doesn't fly so much as she *pushes* herself through air. Her wings are almost vestigial; Force magic handles most of her locomotion. She can accelerate to terrifying speeds, stop instantaneously, and change direction in ways that seem to violate momentum.

**Lair Effects**: The area around her lair experiences constant low-level tremors. Loose objects vibrate. Sound carries strangely—sometimes amplified, sometimes muffled—as Force currents eddy through the terrain.

**The Ceiling**: Despite all this, Kanzekill knows she should be capable of more. The leyline offers power she cannot access. Force magic has applications she cannot master. Her true name is the key to her full potential, and without it, she is perpetually one step below what she should be.

### Appearance

Kanzekill's scales are rust-orange—the color of dried blood, of autumn decay, of iron left too long in weather. In certain light, they seem to shift toward copper or bronze; in shadow, they darken toward brown. She is large for a dragon, though not the largest, and her build emphasizes power over grace: thick limbs, heavy tail, a head like a battering ram.

Her eyes are the most distinctive feature—they never quite focus on what she's looking at. They're always searching, always scanning, tracking something that isn't there. Even in conversation (on the rare occasions she deigns to speak), her gaze wanders, hunting for signs of what she seeks.

The air around her is never still. Currents and eddies play across her scales, lift loose debris, create micro-whirlwinds of dust and ash. Being near Kanzekill means feeling pressure—subtle, constant, like standing at the edge of a storm.

### The Surface Kingdoms

The human and mixed settlements in Kanzekill's shadow have adapted to her presence. They pay no tribute—she doesn't want it—but they've developed customs around her existence:

**Silence about Mountainveil**: No one discusses the fortress openly. Some know it exists; most have only heard rumors. But everyone knows that anyone caught selling information about Mountainveil to the dragon would be killed by their neighbors long before Kanzekill arrived. The fortress represents hope—hope that somewhere, someone has the power to stop the dragon if she ever turns her attention to conquest.

**Reading the Signs**: Locals can predict Kanzekill's movements by watching the weather, listening for tremors, noting when birds flee certain valleys. Entire communities have developed expertise in "dragon-reading," and this knowledge is shared freely across political boundaries.

**The Rage Shelters**: Most villages in the western Dragon's Spine have reinforced structures designed to survive Kanzekill's tantrums. When the mountains shake, people know to seek shelter and wait. The rages pass. They always pass.

### The Nydor Question

The dark dwarves of Emblydium dwell deep beneath the mountains, largely beyond Kanzekill's reach. She knows they're there; she doesn't care. They can't help her find Mountainveil—their tunnels don't extend to wherever the fortress hides—and they have nothing she wants.

The Nydor, for their part, consider Kanzekill a convenient surface hazard. Her presence discourages invasion, complicates rescue missions for escaped slaves, and keeps the mountain passes dangerous enough that only the desperate or the powerful attempt them. They don't worship her, don't fear her, don't interact with her. She's just weather to them—a phenomenon to account for, not a threat to address.

### Hooks

- **The Map**: Someone claims to have found a map leading to Mountainveil. Word reaches Kanzekill. Word reaches the Nydor. Word reaches adventurers who might want the fortress's treasures—or who might want to warn its inhabitants. Suddenly, everyone is racing for the same prize.

- **The Name-Seeker**: A scholar believes they can reconstruct the ritual Vael's mages used to steal Kanzekill's name—and use it again. If successful, they could control the dragon. If they fail, she will know someone tried.

- **Mountainveil Opens**: After four centuries, something has changed. The Force leyline has shifted, or Mountainveil's defenses have weakened, or the fortress's inhabitants have decided to reveal themselves. Kanzekill can feel it. The hunt is almost over.

- **The Last Vaelish**: A descendant of the Kingdom of Vael surfaces—someone who knows family secrets, who might know where Mountainveil is, who might be willing to trade that information for the right price. Kanzekill would pay anything. Others would kill to keep her from finding out.

### Relationships

**Mountainveil**: The obsession. The wound. The only thing that matters.

**The Nydor**: Irrelevant. Underground vermin who pose no threat and offer no help.

**Lady**: Kanzekill is dimly aware that another dragon lairs far to the east, at a Force/Void intersection. She has no interest in Lady and no desire to interact. Lady's lair represents mastery of Force magic that Kanzekill cannot achieve—a reminder of what was taken from her.

**Surface Kingdoms**: Furniture. They exist in her territory, but they don't matter. If they stay out of her way, she stays out of theirs.

## Lady

Tags: dragon, teal, leyline

A teal dragon who has made her lair at the intersection of Force and Void leylines, somewhere beneath the waters or islands near the Tyvern archipelago. Lady is ancient, reclusive, and profoundly disinterested in the affairs of the world above. She doesn't want to be bothered, and she has arranged her existence to ensure that bothering her is nearly impossible.

### The Leyline Nexus

Lady's lair sits at the crossing of Force and Void — an unusual combination. Force governs motion, impact, kinetic power; Void governs emptiness, negation, the space between things. Where they intersect, they create *stillness*. Absolute stillness. The power to stop.

The approach to Lady's lair passes through zones where this effect intensifies. Movement becomes difficult, then exhausting, then nearly impossible. Visitors find themselves wading through air that resists like water, then like mud, then like stone. The Void energy bleeds into the passages, creating pockets of absolute nothing — spaces where light fails, sound dies, and matter that enters doesn't always exit.

Those who reach Lady (very few do) have typically spent days or weeks in the approach, burning through magical resources, testing their will against the intersection's effects. By the time they arrive, they're desperate — which is exactly how Lady prefers her visitors.

### Character

Lady isn't hostile. She's *indifferent*. The distinction matters.

A hostile dragon wants something from visitors — to kill them, to drive them away, to make a point. Lady wants nothing. She doesn't care if visitors live or die, succeed or fail, exist or don't. She stopped caring a very long time ago, and the leyline nexus she's chosen reflects her nature: she is the stillness, the stopping, the void that swallows motion and meaning alike.

Conversations with Lady — for those who manage to have them — are exercises in frustration. She answers questions with questions. She offers nothing freely. She radiates an aura of profound emptiness that makes visitors question why they came, what they wanted, whether any of it matters. Many leave without getting what they sought, unable to articulate what went wrong.

Some scholars theorize that Lady has been changed by centuries at the leyline intersection — that the Void energy has drained something essential from her, leaving only this hollow shell. Others believe she sought out the intersection precisely because it matched what she already was. The truth, if there is one, Lady isn't sharing.

### The Name

"Lady" is what the locals call her — a polite title for something they don't understand and don't want to offend. The Tuktuk know she's there; they avoid the areas near her lair and warn others to do the same. The name is deliberately vague, deliberately respectful, deliberately *not* her true name.

If Lady has a true name, she doesn't share it. Names have power, and Lady has arranged her existence to minimize all forms of engagement — including the engagement of being known.

### Appearance

Lady is teal — her scales the blue-green of deep water, darker than the sea above and lighter than the abyss below. She is large, though visitors who've seen her disagree on exactly how large; the Void energy that permeates her lair makes distances and proportions unreliable.

Her eyes are the most unsettling feature. They're empty — not blind, but *vacant*, as if whatever looks out through them has withdrawn to somewhere very far away. Meeting her gaze feels like staring into nothing, and nothing staring back.

### Interactions

Lady can be reached. She can be spoken to. She might even answer questions or provide assistance — she has knowledge accumulated over millennia, and the leyline nexus gives her awareness of magical currents that few beings can perceive.

But getting anything from Lady requires understanding what she values, which is: nothing. She can't be bribed, because wealth means nothing to her. She can't be threatened, because she doesn't fear death or pain. She can't be bargained with, because she wants nothing in return.

The only approach that sometimes works is offering her something that disrupts her stillness in interesting ways. A problem she hasn't encountered. A question she can't immediately answer. A visitor who doesn't behave the way visitors usually behave. Even then, her interest is fleeting — a moment of engagement before she retreats back into indifference.

### Hooks

- **The Stillness Spreads**: The leyline intersection is destabilizing. The zones of frozen motion around Lady's lair are expanding, creeping into waters and islands that were previously safe. Lady doesn't care. The region might.

- **What Lady Knows**: Someone needs information only Lady possesses — the location of something lost, the nature of something ancient, the answer to a question no one else can answer. Getting it requires reaching her, surviving the approach, and somehow engaging a being who has no interest in being engaged.

- **Something Woke Her**: For the first time in centuries, Lady has moved. Not far — just enough for those who watch such things to notice. Something has disturbed her stillness, and whatever it is might be important enough to matter.

## Morgnor (dragon)

Tags: monster, dragon

Rules over the Hills of Red Gold. Verhy rich, has a kingdom of etherweaver goblins under his command. Very greedy, earth attuned, wants metals mined from earth and enchanted.

## Nabuhe

Tags: dragon

Evil, dragon goddess of winter. Seeks to spread its cold.

## Niquous

Tags: dragon

Niquous is a white dragon who makes his lair in the central Nysanna Range, east of Shananae's territory and west of the Wydling-inhabited tunnels of Witvein. Where Shananae is ancient and indifferent, Niquous is younger and far more actively malevolent—a cruel hunter who takes pleasure in the terror of his prey.

His scales have an unusual blue-white shimmer that makes him nearly invisible against glacial ice. He uses this camouflage to ambush travelers, caravans, and the occasional Wydling hunting party that strays too far from Pyoa Noi. The Wydlings have learned to read the signs of his presence—unusual silence, a certain quality to the light reflecting off distant ice—and flee when they sense him near.

Niquous and Shananae maintain a cold détente. Their territories do not overlap, and neither has reason to challenge the other. Travelers sometimes make the mistake of assuming this means there is a safe corridor between their domains. There is not. The space between them is simply where both dragons hunt.

## Nyinsyls

Tags: dragon

## Nyinsylys

Tags: dragon

Nyinsylys is a white dragon who claims the glacial highlands between the Nirvanis Mountains and the Knives, in the far northern reaches of the Kharvorn range. Her territory is a wasteland of ice and stone where nothing grows and the wind never stops—perfect for a creature who prefers solitude to scheming.

Unlike many dragons who crave treasure, political power, or worship, Nyinsylys seems to want only to be left alone. She hunts the mountain goats and ice-adapted creatures of her domain, sleeps in glacier caves, and ignores the world below. Travelers who pass through her territory without disturbing her are often allowed to live—a rarity among white dragons, known for their cruelty.

This apparent passivity masks tremendous danger. Nyinsylys has destroyed expeditions that lingered too long, mining operations that cut too deep, and entire Zwaeron caravans that strayed into her hunting grounds. She does not negotiate, does not warn, and does not accept tribute. Those who displease her simply die in a storm of ice and fury.

The Kyth-haunted Nirvanis Mountains to her south seem to hold no terror for her. Some scholars speculate she has some arrangement with the spirits there, or that she is old enough to remember when those mountains were inhabited by the living. Others suggest the Kyth simply recognize her as something more dangerous than themselves.

## Pfustias

Tags: dragon, swamp, emerald coast, phirexes

A swamp dragon of unusual temperament who dwells in the Ogzwad Swamp at the southeastern edge of Phirexes. Where most dragons hoard gold and gems, Pfustias collects secrets. Where most dragons rule through terror, she watches with patient curiosity. She has lived in Phirexes for fifty years—a decade less than Queen Phendexelas—and in all that time, she has never moved against the gorgon, nor the gorgon against her.

This restraint makes her more dangerous, not less. Dragons act from instinct and desire; Pfustias acts from calculation. She is waiting for something, and she has been waiting for half a century.

### Appearance

Pfustias is smaller than the great wyrms of legend—perhaps forty feet from snout to tail—but this is deceptive. Her body is adapted for swamp life: a low, sinuous profile that slides through fog and water with equal ease, scales the grey-green of lichen-covered stone, eyes that glow with phosphorescent light in the perpetual murk. She can hold perfectly still for hours, looking like nothing more than a moss-covered hummock, until prey (or visitors) comes close enough.

Her voice is cultured, even pleasant—nothing like the thunderous roars associated with her kind. She speaks multiple languages fluently and seems to enjoy conversation. Those who've met her describe the unsettling experience of having an intelligent discussion with something that could kill them between heartbeats.

### Personality

Pfustias is, above all, curious. She wants to understand things: how magic works, why people make the choices they make, what happens when systems break down. Phirexes is the perfect laboratory for her interests—a trapped population, a manipulative tyrant, a slow-motion tragedy playing out over decades. She watches it like a scholar watches an experiment.

This does not make her benevolent. Pfustias has no interest in saving the Dengar or overthrowing the queen. She wants to see how the story ends. She may help those who further her understanding or hinder those who would end the experiment prematurely. Her morality is alien, built on axes humans don't naturally comprehend.

She values information above all else—specifically, information she doesn't already have. Bringing her news, secrets, or insights earns her favor. Bringing her things she already knows earns her contempt. She has been watching Phirexes for fifty years; there is very little about the swamp she doesn't know.

### The Hoard

Pfustias' lair in Ogzwad Swamp contains no gold to speak of. Her hoard is made of paper: books, letters, maps, journals, confessions. She has accumulated the written secrets of generations—the last words of dying men, the forbidden correspondence of lovers, the encoded messages of spies, the private doubts of the faithful.

Her nest is literally lined with secrets. She sleeps on other people's truths.

The most valuable items in her collection are sealed and warded: things too dangerous even for her to leave accessible. Among these, rumor says, is something about Queen Phendexelas—a secret the gorgon would kill to protect. What it is, only Pfustias knows. What she plans to do with it is anyone's guess.

### Relationship with Phendexelas

The queen and the dragon maintain a careful distance. They do not meet, do not communicate directly, do not acknowledge each other's existence in public statements. Yet neither moves against the other.

The conventional wisdom is mutual deterrence: the queen is powerful, but a dragon is a dragon. Neither wants to risk open conflict when the outcome is uncertain.

The refugees whisper a different theory: Pfustias knows the queen's secret. Not just any secret—*the* secret, the truth about Phendexelas that could unravel everything. The dragon holds this knowledge as leverage, ensuring the queen never moves against her. In return, Pfustias does not share what she knows.

If this is true, it raises questions. Why hasn't Pfustias used the leverage? Why sit on world-changing information for fifty years? What is she waiting for?

### Relationship with the Dengar

Pfustias tolerates the Dengar in her territory but does not protect them. Those who wander into Ogzwad Swamp and encounter her may be questioned, may be allowed to leave, may be eaten—her decisions seem arbitrary but probably follow some internal logic.

She has been known to trade: information for information, secrets for secrets. A Dengar who brings her genuine news—something she didn't already know—might receive knowledge in return, or protection, or passage through her territory. A Dengar who wastes her time receives nothing but a chance to flee before her patience ends.

The refugees have tried to cultivate her as an ally. She has declined, politely but firmly. She is not interested in their freedom, their survival, or their revolution. She is interested in watching what happens next.

### Encounter Notes

Meeting Pfustias is disorienting. She is intelligent, articulate, and genuinely interested in conversation—but she is also an apex predator who could kill everyone present without effort. The cognitive dissonance of pleasant dinner conversation with something that views you as potentially edible is difficult to maintain.

She does not automatically attack visitors. She assesses them first: Do they have anything interesting to offer? Do they serve her curiosity? Are they connected to larger events she wants to understand? Those who pass this assessment may find her helpful, in her alien way. Those who don't may be dismissed, or eaten, or simply allowed to leave.

She lies rarely but omits constantly. Everything she says is technically true. Nothing she says is the complete truth. Working with her is like working with a particularly sophisticated fey—the letter of any agreement will be honored, but the spirit is up for negotiation.

### What She Knows

Pfustias has spent fifty years gathering information about Phirexes. She knows:
- The truth about how the fogs came (the queen created them)
- The extent of the fog-binding and how it works
- The location and disposition of the refugees
- The internal politics of Maurevelious, including who dissents in secret
- The nature of Old One's Wood and what dwells at its heart
- What the Croaking Briars really are
- Why the ancestors stopped speaking at the Grove of Migwam

Most importantly, she knows something about Phendexelas herself—something fundamental about the gorgon queen that the queen desperately wants to keep hidden. This secret is Pfustias' most valuable possession, and she has no intention of spending it cheaply.

When she finally reveals it—if she ever does—it will be at the moment of maximum impact. Dragons are patient, and Pfustias has been waiting a very long time.

## Pythalomos

Tags: monster, dragon

Dragon of constrictor snakes. A false dragon—self-declared god of constrictor snakes—who has terrorized the Ishnit Jungles for roughly four centuries. Hated by the Naruaghin and given a wide berth by all who value their lives.

### Appearance

Pythalomos is serpentine even by dragon standards. His body is extraordinarily long and sinuous, with a neck and tail that can each act independently. His scales shimmer between green and gold depending on the light, and his eyes hold the patient malevolence of a snake watching prey.

### Territory

Pythalomos claims the northern and central Ishnit Jungles, including the area around Ekomorn. His territory overlaps significantly with the North Naruaghin tribes, whom he treats as a food source. He hunts by patience—waiting coiled in the canopy for days until suitable prey passes beneath, then striking with crushing force.

The dragon maintains several lairs throughout his territory, moving between them unpredictably. The North Naruaghin track his movements obsessively but can never be certain where he'll appear next.

### Behavior

Pythalomos is intelligent but not ambitious. He has no interest in ruling, in accumulating treasure, or in the politics of other dragons. He wants to hunt, to feed, and to be worshipped—in that order. The false-god title satisfies his ego; he doesn't need actual divine power.

He views Senwyn the Agonizer as a rival and inferior. The two dragons' territories share a border, and skirmishes occur regularly. Neither has seriously attempted to kill the other—both seem to prefer the eternal competition to actual resolution.

### Combat

Very long neck, body and tail. Upon constriction, you make contested strength check. If you fail, take a wound. On fail by factor of 2 or more, you take two wounds instead. Fail by factor of 3, three wounds. Tail and neck can each attack independently. When captured in his coils, it's 5 levels of restrained.

### Counterpart

Senwyn the Agonizer is Pythalomos's mirror—the venom to his crushing grip. The Naruaghin hate them equally and refuse to say which is worse.

## Saygheod the Forgotten

Tags: dragon, monster

Saygheod was forgotten about by the rest of the world, so wanted to punish world. Makes the water that comes from his spring cause you to forget your memories.

## Senwyn the Agonizer

Tags: monster, dragon

Dragon of venomous snakes. A false dragon—self-declared god of venomous snakes—whose very name makes the South Naruaghin spit and curse. She has haunted the western Ishnit Jungles for roughly four centuries, and every year of that occupation has been marked by suffering.

### Appearance

Senwyn is smaller than Pythalomos but far more vividly marked—her scales ripple with warning colors, bands of red and yellow and black that shift as she moves. Her fangs drip venom constantly, and the ground beneath her lairs is poisoned for years after she moves on.

### Territory

Senwyn claims the western and southern Ishnit Jungles, including the cursed coast near Demonwatch. Her territory overlaps with the South Naruaghin tribes, whom she torments with sadistic creativity. Unlike Pythalomos, who simply hunts, Senwyn plays with her prey.

She's been known to poison water sources and watch villages die slowly, to strike hunting parties and leave one survivor to spread fear, to kill a chief's family while leaving the chief alive. The South Naruaghin call her "the Agonizer" because death by her venom is neither quick nor painless.

### Behavior

Senwyn is intelligent, cruel, and creative. Where Pythalomos is content with simple predation, Senwyn seems to genuinely enjoy suffering. She has no interest in treasure or territory beyond what she needs—her pleasure comes from the fear she inspires.

She views Pythalomos as a rival and a bore. Their territories share a border, and she raids into his lands regularly, not for resources but to remind him she can. The two have never fought to the death, but Senwyn has wounded him on several occasions.

### Combat

Some of the most potent venom in the world. 6d8 poison damage + 1d8 for every 5 feet you move or action you take + plenty of piercing from bite. Multiple actions per turn. The venom causes agony even at sub-lethal doses—victims describe it as liquid fire in the veins.

### Counterpart

Pythalomos is Senwyn's mirror—the crushing grip to her burning venom. The Naruaghin hate them equally, though the South argue that Senwyn is worse because she makes you suffer before you die.

## Shananae

Tags: dragon

Shananae is a white dragon who claims the western reaches of the Nysanna Range as her territory, dwelling in a labyrinthine glacier near where the range curves toward the Anderegnons. She is ancient even by dragon standards—old enough to remember when the Atowatowa first arrived in Anu'Itiklik, and patient enough to watch their civilization develop over millennia without interference.

Unlike most white dragons, Shananae is not actively cruel so much as profoundly indifferent. She views the beings below her territory as one might view lichen—present, occasionally interesting, ultimately beneath notice. This indifference makes her more dangerous in some ways; she will destroy a caravan crossing her hunting grounds not out of malice but simply because it was there.

The Atowatowa consider her a force of nature rather than a threat to be opposed. Their wind-callers can sense when she hunts by the way the air currents shift, and they adjust their migration routes accordingly. Some Atowatowa elders claim she has a bargain with the spirits of Top of the World—that she guards the western approaches to the sacred peak in exchange for something the spirits provide. What that might be, none will say.

## Straker

Tags: dragon

Tidal dragon. Master of waves, beaches, seas

A neutral dragon. Sailors ask for "Straker's Blessing" when crossing the sea, sometimes, because legend holds that Straker has saved the most courageous and worthy sailors in times of rough seas. 

Possesses a few elemental stones of water and air. Spends most of his time basking on the beach, relaxing among tidepools. Totally unreadable.

Desires to one day encounter a champion worthy to receive his mentorship. Straker once trained heros in the age of champions. Can turn a fighter into the best fighter they can become. Has an assistant Herexes (Sharabha revenant) who was right-hand man (and lover) of Straker's last hero, and he travels the world searching for another hero to take original hero's (Craggus??) place.

## Strolzaq

Tags: monster, dragon

Strolzaq is the pet dragon of Bzulakar. An undead, skeletal dragon. Breathes the song of death itself. Extremely, extremely dangerous, and also a lich as well, but not incredibly smart (lost that part of its soul).

## Surrey Mahaila

Tags: dragon

The Dwelyn queen's ancient, emerald dragon—protector of Enapay since before written Dwelyn history. Surrey Mahaila has been bonded to the royal line for longer than most civilizations have existed. Now she sickens, and the nation she protected faces an uncertain future.

### Appearance

Surrey Mahaila is serpentine and graceful, her emerald scales shifting toward teal in certain lights. Unlike the false dragons Pythalomos and Senwyn, she carries herself with the weight of true age—not predatory menace but patient wisdom. Her eyes hold intelligence and, lately, pain.

### Territory

Surrey Mahaila claims no territory in the traditional dragon sense. She resides in the Dragon's Roost, a colossal tree in Lise shaped over centuries to accommodate her. The Green Wilds are protected by her presence rather than marked as her hunting grounds—she has not needed to hunt for herself in generations.

Her influence extends throughout Enapay. Through her bond with Queen Teyara Greenmantle, she knows what happens in the nation almost as it happens. Or she did, before the sickness dulled their connection.

### The Sickness

The Faesong—the ambient magical melody of Melera—has been poisoned in the region around Lise. Surrey Mahaila, a dragon attuned to darkness, water, and earth, has always resonated with this harmony. Now the corrupted song is slowly killing her.

Her scales have dulled. Her mind, once sharp enough to coordinate with the queen across miles, feels foggy and slow. She rarely leaves the Roost. The bond with Teyara, once a constant presence in both their minds, has become intermittent and unclear.

What poisoned the Faesong remains unknown. Theories include shadow emergence from Ekomorn, demonic influence from Demonwatch, sabotage by enemies, or something older and stranger.

### The Bond

Surrey Mahaila's bond with the Dwelyn queens is unlike typical dragon-rider relationships. It is inherited, passed from mother to daughter through a ritual known only to the royal line. The queen and dragon share consciousness—not fully merged, but deeply intertwined.

This bond has preserved Enapay for generations. Surrey Mahaila's knowledge and the queen's authority complement each other. Now, as the bond weakens, so does the queen's legitimacy.

### Combat

Dragon of darkness, water, and earth. Serpentine, slippery, beautiful. Great powers over sleep and mind—she can plunge entire battlefields into slumber or drive enemies to madness. In melee she is ferocious, her coils crushing while her jaws tear. But she has not fought in years, and no one knows if the sickness has diminished her combat capability.

### Relationship to Other Dragons

Surrey Mahaila predates both Pythalomos and Senwyn in the region by centuries. She views them as vermin—dangerous vermin, but vermin nonetheless. Before her illness, neither false dragon would have dared approach Enapay. Now, with her weakness apparent, both have been testing the borders of the Green Wilds.

The Naruaghin oral tradition speaks of Surrey Mahaila from before the Dwelyn arrived. Some shamans believe she is not merely bonded to the royal line but is somehow responsible for the Dwelyn's existence. If so, her death might mean more than the end of a dragon.

## Svorinthak

Tags: dragon

Svorinthak is an ancient dragon who claims the Lyagnadarr Mountains as her territory—a domain that effectively separates the Luquihn Desert from the centaur plains of Siquestrya. She is among the older dragons of Alaria, though she keeps a lower profile than many of her peers.

Unlike dragons who build elaborate lairs filled with treasure, Svorinthak is a hunter. She maintains several cave networks throughout the Lyagnadarr range, moving between them seasonally to follow prey. The Lyndwyrmspren that infest the mountains are her get—lesser draconic creatures descended from her over millennia, now feral and pack-hunting.

Svorinthak's scales are the color of sun-bleached bone, allowing her to blend against the pale rock of the Lyagnadarr peaks. She prefers to hunt at dusk and dawn when the light is uncertain. Her breath is a searing wind that strips flesh from bone and can ignite dry vegetation at considerable distance.

### Disposition

Svorinthak is territorial but not aggressive beyond her borders. She has made no moves against the Bazaar of Scales at the edge of her territory, nor does she raid the centaur tribes of Siquestrya (though they fear her regardless). Some scholars believe she views these lesser creatures as beneath her attention; others suggest she values having a buffer of activity that warns her of approaching threats.

Those who enter the Lyagnadarr Mountains without permission rarely return. Svorinthak does not negotiate, does not accept tribute, and does not keep prisoners. She is, however, rumored to occasionally speak with those who interest her—though what might interest a dragon of her age is difficult to predict.

### The Lyndwyrmspren

The pack-hunting lesser dragons of the Lyagnadarr are Svorinthak's descendants, bred or evolved over thousands of years. They lack her intelligence and size but retain enough draconic cunning to be extremely dangerous. The Lyndwyrmspren hunt in groups of four to twelve, using coordinated tactics to bring down prey larger than themselves. Svorinthak tolerates their presence in her territory—they serve as both an early warning system and a first line of defense against intruders.

## Symonair

Tags: dragon

Symonair is a blue dragon who has claimed the lake that bears his name for longer than any orc state has existed. He dwells in the waters south of Cykravikus Lake, in the heart of the Wildwood's lake system, and his presence casts a long shadow over the politics of the orc nations—though few understand exactly how.

Blue dragons are known for patience, deception, and water affinity. Symonair embodies all three. He does not rage or rampage. He watches. He waits. He has been watching the orc states fight and scheme for centuries, and he has never once intervened directly.

This restraint is itself a kind of power.

### The Lake

Symonair Lake connects to Cykravikus Lake, the domain of the Hag Queen and her Griebi subjects. The waters flow between them. Whatever relationship exists between the dragon and the hag is unknown to outsiders—but neither has attacked the other in all recorded history, and that alone is remarkable.

The lake is deep, cold, and dark. Symonair's lair lies in underwater caverns that no surface dweller has ever mapped. Occasionally, travelers report seeing something massive moving beneath the surface—a shadow too large to be any fish, too deliberate to be a current.

### The Mystery

What does Symonair want?

He could destroy any of the orc states. He hasn't. He could claim tribute, demand worship, install himself as a god-king. He hasn't. He simply... watches. Some say he's playing a game that spans centuries, manipulating the orc wars for purposes only he understands. Others say he's simply waiting for something—but what?

The orc states give him a wide berth. The Griebi treat his lake as sacred and forbidden. The Hag Queen has never spoken of him publicly. The Tarni spirit-seers say his soul is "old and cold and deep," but they cannot read his intentions.

### Danger

Those who enter Symonair Lake without permission do not return. This is not rumor—it is fact. Fishing boats that drift too far, adventurers seeking dragon treasure, even orc war-parties pursuing enemies into the waters have all vanished without trace.

Symonair does not warn. He does not negotiate. He does not accept tribute in exchange for passage. His lake is his, and those who enter it belong to him.

### The Balance

Some scholars speculate that Symonair and the Hag Queen have divided the lake system between them—she controls the northern waters and the Griebi, he controls the southern waters and... whatever he controls. This arrangement, if it exists, may be what keeps the entire region stable.

If either of them fell—if the Hag Queen were killed, or if something drove Symonair from his lake—the consequences would ripple through every orc state. The Griebi might collapse. The other states might finally attack. Or something worse might emerge from the waters that two ancient powers have kept contained.

No one wants to find out.

## Tepheranos

Tags: dragon

Tepheranos is a black dragon, and brother of Rothogomos. Long ago, they came to Argysis to conquer the mountain and steal the dwarven treasure. However, upon entry, Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, and took the treasure for his own. Tepheranos was forced to retreat, and took over the small, unassuming kingdom of Anarak nearby. Since then, Tepheranos has made Anarak much more successful, while Argysis has stagnated. Tepheranos still wants his revenge, and his relative failure has made Rothogomos bitter, and is likewise now intent on revenge.

## Ural of the Third Moon

Tags: monster, dragon

Deep, purple color. Dragon born under the Killing Moon (a.k.a. the Third Moon). Possesses all but one of the elemental stones of darkness—has them inset in his forehead, and many of the stones of void as well. 

Hunts the elves of the Twilight Forest, as well as the beasts there. 

Lair is located in void-locked location, shrouded in absolute darkness (even darker than rest of forest). Built in caves in some random rock formations.

## Velorax the Unfinished

Tags: dragon, elderran, old-tolaria, temporal

A young dragon frozen above the ruins of Elderran, caught in the moment of the Apparatus of Severance's activation. She has been suspended in a state of magical unraveling for centuries—conscious, aware, and slowly going mad.

### Nature

Velorax was barely a century old when she flew into Elderran, drawn by the unprecedented magical energies of the Apparatus's activation. Young for a dragon, curious, and perhaps foolish. She arrived at the exact wrong moment.

The Apparatus was designed to separate magical traditions into their pure forms. Dragons are inherently creatures of multiple magics woven together—elemental fire in their breath, arcane power in their minds, divine resonance in their ancient blood. When the Apparatus tried to unweave Velorax, it partially succeeded.

### Appearance

From a distance, Velorax appears frozen in flight above Elderran's central spire—wings spread, jaws open, fire mid-breath. A dramatic statue of a dragon mid-attack.

Closer inspection reveals the horror. Distinct bands of energy spiral around and through her body, each trying to separate from the others:

- **Elemental fire** streams from her throat in frozen ribbons, looping back on itself
- **Arcane formulae** manifest as glowing sigils that drift across her scales, constantly rearranging
- **Temporal energy** creates afterimages—dozens of Veloraxes overlapping, each a fraction of a second apart
- **Something else**—a dark, thrumming power that may be divine, may be draconic essence, may be something the mage-kings never anticipated

She is being pulled apart and has been for centuries. The process is perhaps one percent complete.

### Consciousness

Velorax is aware. This is perhaps the cruelest aspect of her imprisonment.

Time moves differently for her—she experiences each moment stretched across years, watching her own dissolution in excruciating slow motion. She has had centuries to contemplate her fate, her choices, her nature. She has had centuries to go mad.

Those who enter the time-dilation zone around Elderran report hearing her voice—not in their ears, but in their minds. Fragments. Pleas. Threats. Philosophical musings on the nature of magic. Descriptions of sensations no mortal could understand. Sometimes she is lucid. Sometimes she is not.

### What Freeing Her Might Mean

The Apparatus has been slowly separating Velorax's component magics for centuries. If she were freed—if the temporal prison were broken—several outcomes are possible:

**Reunification**: Her magics snap back together. She emerges whole, if changed. Possibly grateful. Possibly vengeful. Certainly traumatized by centuries of conscious dissolution.

**Completion**: Without the temporal stasis, the separation completes instantly. Velorax ceases to exist as a coherent being. Her component magics scatter—a mindless elemental, a cloud of arcane energy, a divine echo, and whatever that dark power was.

**Transformation**: The partial separation has created something new. Velorax emerges as neither dragon nor elemental nor anything that has existed before. A new category of being, born from magical trauma.

**Explosion**: The energies held in tension are released all at once. The resulting detonation would make the original Unraveling look like a candle flame.

### Adventure Hooks

- A dragon cult believes Velorax is their god in chrysalis, transforming into something greater. They want to accelerate the process.
- A mage theorizes that Velorax's unique state makes her the only being capable of understanding—and reversing—the Apparatus's effects.
- Velorax has made mental contact with someone outside the time dilation. She is offering tremendous rewards to anyone who can free her. She is not mentioning what "freedom" might actually mean.
- The dark power within her is growing stronger relative to the others. Something is feeding on her imprisonment, and it's almost ready to hatch.

## Vulcanagak

Fire dragons. Frequently more violent and greedy.

!Dragon

### Vulcanagakari

A lot dumber than regular dragons, but similar. Agents of chaos and destruction.

!Dragon2

## Xislmere

Tags: dragon

Xislmere resides in the far north, among the Knives Mountains. She guards the indestructible, and only current portal from the Material Plane to the Stalactites of Geth. Specifically, the portal leads to Chagus, the home of Volganor, king of demons.

Xislmere guards the portal, preventing demons from traveling through to this plane. She breathes ice and cold, which the demons are weak to. The portal is kept under 1000 feet of solid ice, deep inside the glacier that she resides within.

## Zosuun

Tags: dragon

Zosuun is an albino dragon who lairs in the coastal mountains of Gümloskos, north of Solhalven where the land meets the frozen Ocean of Azuros. His scales are the pale white of old ice, and his eyes burn with an unsettling inner light—not the warmth of fire dragons nor the cold gleam of white dragons, but something between.

He is one of the rare ice-fire dragons, a paradoxical creature whose breath can freeze or burn depending on his mood, sometimes both at once. Alchemists and mages have spent lifetimes trying to understand how such opposing forces can coexist in a single being. Zosuun has never deigned to explain.

The Valkyries of Solhalven maintain a careful distance from Zosuun. The dragon predates their arrival by centuries, and some scholars believe the angels who cursed them to guard Starreach chose this location specifically because Zosuun already claimed the region—an additional complication to their eternal duty. The Valkyries neither worship nor war with him; they simply... coexist, each attending to their own ancient business.

Zosuun hunts the pack ice and coastal waters, taking seals and the massive walruses that haul out on the northern shores. He has been seen diving through ice floes, emerging with prey frozen and burned simultaneously. Sailors who glimpse his white form against the snow and ice often mistake him for a cloud or a distant glacier—until he moves.

Unlike many dragons, Zosuun seems to have no interest in accumulating treasure in the traditional sense. His hoard, if he has one, remains unknown. What he does collect, according to Valkyrie accounts, are moments—memories stolen from those who trespass in his territory. Travelers who encounter him and survive often find gaps in their recollection, pieces of their past simply... gone.
