# Western Isles

## Geography

The Western Isles occupy the waters between Clueanda to the north and Rimihuica to the south, marking the edge of the known world to the west. At its heart lies the Shattered Sea—a chaotic archipelago of hundreds of tiny islands, atolls, and shoals that makes navigation treacherous. The region serves as a buffer zone between the great continental powers, home to independent states, pirate havens, and mysterious island cultures.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Stratlan Sea**: The deep, empty ocean to the far west—the true edge of the known world
- **Western Sea**: The southwestern waters
- **Iron Sea**: Northern waters, between the islands and Clueanda
- **Sea of Merchants**: Eastern waters separating the islands from the Tarkhon Empire
- **Sea of Sharks**: Southern waters below the central archipelago
- **Solemn Sea**: Waters to the south of the Western Isles, home to Tyungula

### The Shattered Sea (Central)

The heart of the Western Isles is this chaotic archipelago—hundreds of distinct islands, atolls, and shoals packed into treacherous waters. Navigation here requires expert knowledge; the maze of islands has claimed countless ships.

### Northern Region

**Cliffs of Syquindonos**: A rugged coastline forming the northern edge of the island region, featuring dramatic cliffs.

**Kettle Bay**: A bay nestled into the northwest coast.

**Kinova**: A significant island territory in the northeast, marked by settlements.

**Iron Sea**: The body of water to the north, separating the Western Isles from the Westwilds of Clueanda.

### Central States

**Knova**: A state in the center of the region, one of the more established political entities in the Shattered Sea.

**White Oracle**: South of Knova and just north of the Dolphin Islands, in the heart of the Shattered Sea, dwells the White Oracle—an old priestess who speaks with the gods of time. People throughout the Shattered Sea seek her advice on matters great and small, for her counsel is said to be infallible. The Oracle grants guidance to those who can reach her remote location, though the journey itself often serves as a test of worthiness.

**Bynu Island Tribes**: West of Knova, a collection of tribal island communities.

**Pelican Isles**: East of the Bynu Island Tribes in the center of the Western Isles. These lush tropical islands are home to the Ansari—pelican-riding gnomes who live in scattered hut communities across the archipelago. The islands feature stunning natural beauty: stone arches, coral reefs teeming with fish, and forests of trees bearing brilliantly colored feathers that the Ansari trade.

Despite their rich resources—including undiscovered mineral deposits and gems—the Pelican Isles are fiercely isolationist. Past exploitation attempts by outsiders forced the Ansari to defend themselves violently, and they now shoot arrows at any approaching ships. Visitors are almost never seen again. The gnomes govern themselves through local shamans and wise-men rather than any centralized authority, maintaining their independence through lethal force and strategic isolation.

**Siren Islands**: Northwest of the Bynu Island Tribes, notorious islands with their namesake dangers.

**Murmuring Isles**: Due west of the Plains of Oblivion in the Shattered Sea, the Murmuring Isles are home to sirens and are exceedingly dangerous. The constant sound of haunting songs drifts across the waters surrounding these islands, luring ships to their doom. Those who hear the sirens' music find themselves helplessly drawn to the rocky shores, where their vessels are dashed to pieces. The isles are avoided by all experienced sailors, and stories of their dangers are told in every port across the Western Isles.

**Whisper Isles**: West of the Murmuring Isles in the northern Western Isles, south of Migos (where Iypos is located), lie the Whisper Isles—islands enchanted to be permanently silent. No sound can be made here; oaths cannot be cast, and communication through sound is impossible. The islands serve as a sanctum from Deoric magic (which requires spoken oaths).

The Whisper Isles are home to the ruins of Thergon, a city that was destroyed by the Pity Knights, a group of lich hunters. The city had been corrupted by Therguros, an ancient lich, so the Pity Knights arrived and destroyed everything—including many innocent people. They then used those innocent deaths to create a permanent silence, preventing all further Deoric magic from being cast here by silencing the entire area.

Now the islands harbor leftover artifacts of the lich and an old city of undead. Thergon was once famous for its coral and oyster jewelry relating to beauty and emotions, and remnants of this craft can still be found among the silent ruins.

### Eastern Shore (Tarkhon Frontier)

The eastern edge of the Western Isles meets the westernmost holdings of the Tarkhon Empire:

- **Sheîr**: A Tarkhon state jutting westward into the Shattered Sea
- **Dolphin Islands**: West of Sheîr in the Shattered Sea, these islands are sacred to the triton people. Thousands of dolphins travel here annually to breed in the warm, protected waters. Triton come to these breeding grounds to find the dolphins they will bond with and ride into battle—a sacred tradition that has lasted millennia. All ships are strictly forbidden from entering these waters; those who ignore the ban face the wrath of the entire triton nation.
- **Kabir**: Northeastern Tarkhon territory
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: South of Gissemari

These represent the southwestern frontier of the Tarkhon Empire.

### Southern Region

**Stokos**: A state south of the Sea of Merchants.

**Sea of Sharks**: The waters between Stokos and the Ember Isles, notorious for their dangers.

**Islands of Gold**: The southernmost archipelago still technically part of the Western Isles, positioned just north of the Seacleft Coast and due west of Mueras. Located south of the Sea of Sharks and southwest of Stokos. These islands are inhabited by colossal stone creatures that walk the seafloor—unable to swim, but massive enough that the rocky spires protruding from their backs rise above the waterline. These creatures roam the depths hunting ships, using their stone backs as reefs to snare and sink vessels before devouring the crews. Despite the extreme danger, the islands and surrounding waters are rich with gold deposits, drawing foolhardy treasure hunters.

**Ember Isles**: A cluster of islands in the southwest, shrouded in white mist—likely volcanic activity or magical fog. These islands glow with an inner heat.

### Connection to Neighboring Regions

- **North**: The Westwilds of Clueanda lie beyond the Iron Sea
- **Northeast**: The Plains of Oblivion (part of the Westwilds, north of Tarkhon)
- **East**: The Tarkhon Empire's western frontier
- **Southeast**: The coast of Rimihuica (Mueras visible on the eastern horizon)

## Notable Locations

### The Stratlan Sea

The deep, empty ocean to the far west—the true edge of the known world. The Stratlan Sea (also known as the northern region of the Solemn Sea) extends beyond the Western Isles into waters that few ships dare to explore. Most who venture too far into the Stratlan never return, lost to storms, sea monsters, or simply the crushing vastness of the empty ocean.

#### Lonely Island

Far out in the reaches of the Stratlan Sea, west and southwest of the Western Isles, sits a barren rock known as Lonely Island. No vegetation grows here, no ships call at its shores, and the island appears on no maps. It is a place of exile and despair.

##### Ognarad's Cave

Within a sea cave on Lonely Island lives Ognarad, a cyclops of extraordinary talent and bitter temperament. Ognarad was tricked long ago and cursed to remain bound to this desolate island, unable to leave by any means. His isolation has driven him half-mad, but his skills as a craftsman remain unmatched—he can forge weapons, armor, and magical items of incredible quality.

Ognarad will craft anything for anyone who can find a way to break his curse and free him from Lonely Island. Many have tried; all have failed. The cyclops grows more desperate and more dangerous with each passing year, his cave filled with masterwork items he has forged from salvaged shipwrecks, waiting for the hero who can finally grant him escape.

## Aikon Tidal Islands

Tags: archipelago, geography

A chain of low-lying islands north of Sheîr where the tides reshape reality twice daily. At high tide, only scattered peaks rise above the water. At low tide, a vast expanse of land emerges—temporary territory that the Aikon people have learned to use.

### Position

The Aikon Tidal Islands stretch across the waters north of Sheîr:
- **South**: Sheîr and its scattered islands
- **East**: The Xibli Islands
- **North**: Open water toward Phyndarr Sound
- **West**: The Shattered Sea proper

The islands sit on an unusually shallow shelf—deep enough to submerge at high tide, shallow enough to drain almost completely at low tide.

### The Tidal Rhythm

The transformation is dramatic. At high tide, the Aikon Islands are a scattered archipelago—perhaps twenty visible peaks rising from the sea, separated by channels of varying depth. At low tide, a single connected landmass emerges, miles across, with the former peaks now hills on a temporary plain.

The exposed seabed is firm sand and rock, walkable and even farmable in the brief windows between tides. The Aikon people have built their entire civilization around exploiting these windows.

Tidal cycles follow Alaria's moons—primarily Nyxara, whose 23-day cycle determines the extreme tides. During certain lunar alignments, the low tides expose even more land; during others, the high tides submerge peaks that are normally safe.

### The Aikon People

The inhabitants of these islands are humans who've adapted their entire way of life to the tidal rhythm. They call themselves the **Tidewalkers**, and their culture revolves around precise knowledge of when the waters will rise and fall.

**Permanent Settlements**: The peak islands hold the only permanent structures—stone buildings that can withstand submersion during extreme high tides. These are home bases, sleeping quarters, and storage for valuables.

**Tidal Farms**: At low tide, the Aikon work the exposed seabed. They plant fast-growing crops in the nutrient-rich sand, harvest shellfish from exposed beds, and collect materials deposited by the retreating water. Everything must be gathered before the tide returns.

**Tidal Paths**: The Aikon have memorized paths across the exposed seabed—routes that are safe to walk at various stages of the tidal cycle. Walking the wrong path at the wrong time means drowning.

**The Tide-Counters**: A specialized class of Aikon who track lunar cycles, predict tidal extremes, and announce the safe windows for different activities. Getting this wrong means death; the Tide-Counters are revered and rigorously trained.

### The Twice-Daily Migration

Aikon life involves constant movement. As the tide retreats, people stream down from the peaks onto the exposed land. They work frantically—farming, gathering, traveling between peaks that are islands at high tide but connected at low. As the tide returns, everyone climbs back to safe ground.

This happens twice every day. The Aikon have been doing it for centuries.

Children learn the rhythm before they can walk. Visitors find it exhausting and terrifying. The Aikon find it normal.

### What the Tides Reveal

The exposed seabed isn't just mud and sand. The tides reveal:

- **Tidal Gardens**: Cultivated beds of shellfish, seaweed, and fast-growing vegetables
- **The Shipwreck Fields**: Wrecked vessels from centuries of navigation errors, slowly being absorbed by the sand
- **The Old Roads**: Stone paths laid down by Aikon ancestors, now maintained and extended
- **The Drowned Ruins**: Structures from before the Aikon arrived—no one knows who built them or why they're underwater now

### The Drowned City

At the lowest extreme tides—occurring only a few times each year—parts of an ancient city emerge from the seabed. Carved stone walls, broken columns, the remnants of what might have been temples or palaces.

The Aikon don't build there. They don't linger there. They believe the Drowned City belongs to whoever lived there before, and that staying too long invites their attention.

Some outsiders have tried to excavate during extreme low tides. None have returned with anything valuable. Some haven't returned at all.

### Navigation

Sailing through the Aikon Islands requires precise tidal knowledge. Channels that are navigable at high tide become impassable shallows at low tide. Routes that are open at low tide are underwater at high tide. Ships have run aground in waters that seemed deep enough, only to find the tide was falling.

The Aikon offer pilot services—guides who know exactly which routes are safe when. The fees are reasonable. The alternative is losing your ship.

### What Brings People Here

- **Tidal Harvests**: The exposed seabed produces unique materials—shells, plants, minerals deposited by the sea
- **Safe Passage**: Aikon pilots guide ships through the treacherous tidal channels
- **The Drowned City**: Treasure hunters who think they can explore during extreme low tides
- **Curiosity**: Scholars studying the tidal adaptation, the Drowned City, or the unique ecology

## Bynü Island Tribes

Tags: state, nation

A sprawling archipelago in the western Shattered Sea, shrouded in permanent magical twilight. Home to the Xicrein elves, who kill anyone foolish enough to enter their waters uninvited.

### Position and Borders

The Bynü Islands occupy the western reaches of the Shattered Sea:
- **North**: Open water toward the Siren Islands and the Cliffs of Syquindonos
- **East**: The central Shattered Sea and Knova's distant lights
- **South**: The Drifting Isles and deeper Shattered Sea
- **West**: The Stratlan Sea—the edge of the known world

The border between "Bynü waters" and "safe waters" is not marked on any chart. The Xicrein know where it is. Outsiders learn when they see the light begin to dim.

### The Twilight Zone

Approaching the Bynü Islands, ships notice the light changing. The sun seems to fade. Shadows lengthen. By the time you're among the outer islands, it's permanent dusk—not quite night, not quite day, an eternal half-light that never changes.

The twilight boundary isn't a wall—it's a gradient. The transition takes roughly an hour of sailing. Once you're deep in Bynü territory, the sun is a dim glow on the horizon that never rises higher. Stars are visible but muted. Navigation by celestial observation becomes unreliable.

This phenomenon appears to be magical, but its source is unknown. Theories include:
- Ancient elven enchantment
- Planar bleeding from a realm of eternal dusk
- The presence of something beneath the islands that drinks light
- Simple curse, origin forgotten

### Terrain

**The Overhangs**

The most distinctive feature of the Bynü Islands is their massive rock overhangs. Sea cliffs rise from the dark water, then curve outward, creating sheltered spaces beneath. Some overhangs extend hundreds of feet, casting the waters below in even deeper shadow.

The Xicrein build in these sheltered spaces—cave complexes, hanging villages, structures that cling to cliff faces in ways that seem impossible. Looking up from the water, you might not see them at all.

**The Dark Forests**

Island interiors are covered in twilight-adapted vegetation. The palm trees have black leaves; flowers bloom in shades of gray and deep purple; everything photosynthesizes differently here. The forests are dense, silent, and full of things that watch.

**The Waters**

The sea around Bynü absorbs light. Surface water is dark as ink. You can't see below the surface at all—which means you can't see the Xicrein warriors swimming beneath your hull until they attack.

The darkness isn't pollution or sediment. It's just... dark. Magical, probably. Terrifying, definitely.

### Climate

The twilight affects temperature as well as light. The islands are cooler than the surrounding sea—comfortable for the Xicrein, chilly for visitors used to tropical waters. Humidity is constant; a thin mist often hangs in the air.

Rain comes frequently but gently. Storms from outside the twilight zone seem to weaken as they enter Bynü territory—another unexplained phenomenon.

### The Outer Islands

The boundary islands where the twilight first begins. These are the most dangerous waters for outsiders—where ships realize they've gone too far and the Xicrein are already watching.

Warning signs dot the outer islands: stakes with skulls, wrecked ships deliberately left visible, symbols painted in what might be blood. The Xicrein make clear that their border is defended.

**The Grim Nautili**

South of the main archipelago lies a region called the Grim Nautili—a scattered cluster of rocks and small islands where the Xicrein dispose of their kills. Bones, wrecks, and rotting cargo float in the dark water. Ships passing too close can smell death before they see it.

The Nautili serves as both warning and disposal site. The Xicrein don't bury their enemies; they feed them to the sea.

### The Inner Islands

Deeper in the archipelago, the twilight is absolute and the Xicrein grow bolder. These islands have never been mapped by outsiders. What little is known comes from the handful of survivors over centuries—and their accounts are fragmentary, confused, possibly unreliable.

**The Cliffdweller Territories** (north): Vertical islands where the elves live in cliff-face caves. Attacking these islands would require climbing while under arrow fire from above.

**The Deeproot Forests** (center): Dense vegetation so thick that the twilight beneath the canopy is nearly complete darkness. The Deeproot tribe hunts from the trees; intruders never see what kills them.

**The Tidewater Shallows** (south): Where the Tidewatcher tribe lives partially in the water. They've adapted to the darkness below the surface and can hold their breath for unsettling lengths of time.

**The Stonetongue Archives** (east): Rumored location of the Xicrein's oral histories, maintained by the Stonetongue tribe. No outsider has confirmed this exists.

**The Nightsinger Reaches** (west): Territory of the tribe whose sonic magic is most developed. Ships near these islands have reported hearing singing before their crews went mad.

### Navigation

Don't.

No reliable charts exist for Bynü waters. The Xicrein don't share their knowledge, and the few expeditions that returned did so without useful maps. Currents shift unpredictably. Islands seem to move—probably an optical illusion caused by the twilight, probably.

The only safe approach to Bynü territory is to not approach at all. Ships give the twilight zone a wide berth. Those that must pass nearby sail fast and armed, and they don't stop for anything.

### The Dragon's Teeth Connection

North of the Bynü Islands lie the Dragon's Teeth—obsidian rocks guarded by Qorgath and her Erzqin. The two regions share dark water, dangerous navigation, and absolute hostility to outsiders. Ships caught between them face death from two directions.

Some scholars speculate the Xicrein and Qorgath have an arrangement. Others think the dragon and the elves simply don't bother each other—they have no reason to, when outsiders provide plenty of targets.

### What Brings People Here

Nothing should bring people here. But:

- **Desperation**: Ships blown off course, crews fleeing enemies who won't follow into the twilight
- **Greed**: Rumors of Xicrein artifacts, twilight materials, ancient treasures
- **Curiosity**: Scholars who want to understand the twilight, the Xicrein, the history
- **Foolishness**: People who don't believe the warnings

Most don't return. The few who do rarely try again.

## Cliffs of Shondromos

Tags: cliffs, geography

A secondary cliff formation west of the Cliffs of Syquindonos—smaller but equally treacherous, marking where the Stratlan Sea meets the Western Isles. The Shondromos cliffs are known for their honeycombed structure: thousands of sea caves riddle the rock, creating a maze that smugglers, cultists, and stranger things call home.

### Geography

The Cliffs of Shondromos extend along the northwestern edge of the Western Isles:
- **North**: The transition to the Cliffs of Syquindonos
- **South**: The Shattered Sea and the Bynü Islands beyond
- **East**: The northern Western Isles and Kettle Bay
- **West**: The empty Stratlan Sea

The cliffs are lower than Syquindonos—rarely exceeding 300 feet—but what they lack in height they make up in complexity. The rock here is softer, more prone to erosion, riddled with passages that have been carved by water and time.

### The Honeycomb

The Shondromos cliffs are famous for their caves—not a few scattered openings but thousands of them, penetrating deep into the rock, connecting in ways no one has fully mapped.

**Cave Characteristics:**

- Multiple entrances at different levels, some underwater at high tide
- Internal passages that connect distant openings
- Chambers large enough to hold ships, if you know how to reach them
- Collapses and dead ends that change the layout over years

The honeycomb makes the cliffs simultaneously dangerous and valuable. Dangerous because navigation is nearly impossible without local knowledge. Valuable because the caves can hide anything.

### Who Lives Here

**The Smugglers**

Several smuggling operations use the Shondromos caves as bases. Ships slip in through underwater entrances, unload in hidden chambers, and emerge from different openings after their cargo has been moved overland. Customs inspectors from Jüt and Sheîr hate the place.

**The Cultists**

Various religious groups have claimed Shondromos caves over the years. Some worship sea gods, performing rituals where saltwater meets stone. Others have darker purposes. The isolation and secrecy attract those who don't want witnesses.

**The Hermits**

Not everyone in the caves is criminal or insane. Some are simply people who want to be left alone—refugees, exiles, philosophers who prefer solitude. They maintain their caves, fish for food, and avoid everyone.

**The Others**

Persistent rumors claim something else lives in the deeper caves—creatures that predate human arrival, entities drawn to the darkness, or simply very large predators that have learned the maze better than any person. Explorers occasionally don't return. Whether this is cave hazards or something hunting them, no one can prove.

### Kettle Bay

The cliffs partially enclose **Kettle Bay**—a body of water that would be an excellent harbor if it weren't surrounded by the honeycomb.

The bay is calm, sheltered from storms, with good anchorage. It's also riddled with cave openings at waterline, any of which might contain smugglers, cultists, or worse. Ships anchoring in Kettle Bay post guards constantly.

Despite the risks, the bay sees regular use. Ships needing shelter from storms, traders meeting contacts who prefer discretion, and explorers planning cave expeditions all pass through.

### The Deep Caves

Beyond the waterline openings, the Shondromos honeycomb extends into true caves—dark passages that haven't seen light in centuries.

**What Explorers Have Found:**

- Freshwater sources deep underground
- Mineral deposits including some valuable metals
- Ruins of unknown origin—carved chambers that predate human presence
- Bones of creatures that no longer exist
- Carved symbols in languages no one recognizes

**What Explorers Haven't Found (Yet):**

- The legendary "Heart of Shondromos"—supposedly a massive central chamber connecting all the caves
- The "Deep Dwellers"—whatever lives in the parts no one returns from
- Any reliable map of the full system

### Getting In

Accessing the Shondromos caves requires:
- Local knowledge (hired guides work the area, for steep fees)
- Appropriate boats (small enough to navigate cave passages)
- Courage or foolishness (the distinction is unclear)

The easiest approach is through Kettle Bay, where several guide services operate. These guides know the outer caves well; the deeper areas, they avoid.

### What Brings People Here

- **Smuggling**: Moving goods outside official channels
- **Research**: Scholars studying the caves, the ruins, or the creatures
- **Worship**: Religious groups with purposes best conducted in darkness
- **Hiding**: People who need to disappear more thoroughly than the Foggy Isles provide
- **Exploration**: Those who need to know what's in the depths

## Cliffs of Syquindonos

Tags: cliffs, geography

A dramatic wall of stone marking the northern boundary of the Western Isles—sheer cliffs rising hundreds of feet from the Iron Sea, carved by millennia of waves and wind. The cliffs are as much barrier as landmark, separating the island region from the mainland coast beyond.

### Geography

The Cliffs of Syquindonos stretch for roughly sixty miles along the northern edge of the Western Isles region:
- **North**: The Iron Sea
- **South**: The Shattered Sea and the island maze
- **East**: The mainland coast and routes to Tarkhon
- **West**: Open water toward the Stratlan Sea

The cliffs range from 200 to over 500 feet high—sheer faces of dark stone that seem to grow directly from the sea. There are no beaches at their base, only rocks and churning water.

### Formation

The cliffs are the exposed edge of a volcanic plateau—the same geological forces that created the Western Isles. Where the plateau meets the Iron Sea, it simply ends in a vertical face.

The stone is primarily basalt, dark gray to black, columnar in places where ancient lava cooled in distinctive hexagonal patterns. Wind and wave have carved caves, arches, and grottos into the lower sections, but the upper cliffs remain stark and unbroken.

### Navigation Hazard

The Cliffs of Syquindonos have claimed countless ships over the centuries. The dangers include:

**Limited Visibility**: Fog collects at the cliff base, hiding the rocks until it's too late.

**Unpredictable Currents**: The meeting of Iron Sea and Shattered Sea waters creates swirling currents that can push ships toward the rocks.

**No Shelter**: Ships caught in storms along this coast have nowhere to hide. The cliffs offer no harbors, no anchorages, no beaches to run aground safely.

**Cliff Collapse**: Sections of the cliff face occasionally break away, sending massive rock falls into the sea. Ships below have been crushed.

### The Watchfires

Several watchtowers stand along the cliff top, maintained by various powers to warn ships away from the rocks. The towers burn fires at night and fly flags during dangerous weather.

**Key Stations:**

- **Syquindonos Light**: The eastern lighthouse, marking the approach to Phyndarr Sound
- **The Western Watch**: Warning station at the cliffs' western extent
- **Fog Station**: Manned during frequent fog events to sound horns warning ships away

Maintaining these stations is expensive. Various nations have funded them over the years; currently Sheîr handles the eastern lights and Tollgate funds the western ones. Neither wants ships wrecking on "their" cliffs.

### The Cliff-Dwellers

A small population of hardy folk lives atop the cliffs, maintaining the watch stations and harvesting resources:

**Seabird Colonies**: The cliff faces host massive colonies of nesting seabirds. Their eggs, meat, and feathers are valuable; collectors rappel down the cliff faces to reach the nests.

**Cliff Fishing**: Some communities fish from the cliff top, lowering lines hundreds of feet to the waters below.

**Storm Salvage**: After bad weather, salvagers search the waters at the cliff base for wreckage that might contain valuable cargo.

The cliff-dwellers are insular and suspicious of outsiders. They answer to no government, pay no taxes, and prefer to be left alone.

### The Sea Caves

At the cliff base, erosion has carved an extensive network of sea caves. Most are only accessible by boat, and then only in calm weather.

**What's Inside:**

- Smuggler hideouts (several powers use the caves to move goods quietly)
- Nesting sites for rare creatures that prefer the darkness
- Ruins of unknown origin—carved chambers that suggest someone lived here before the caves flooded
- Persistent rumors of treasure hidden by pirates, refugees, or ancient civilizations

Exploring the caves is dangerous. Tides flood some chambers rapidly; others collapse without warning; and the creatures nesting inside don't appreciate visitors.

### Strategic Value

The cliffs prevent land assault on the Western Isles from the north. Any army wanting to invade would need to either sail around or somehow descend 500-foot cliff faces while defending against attacks from above.

This has never been attempted seriously. The cliffs are too formidable, the alternatives too practical. The Cliffs of Syquindonos remain what they've always been: a barrier, a hazard, and a boundary.

## Dragon's Teeth

Tags: island, geography

A group of islands in the Western Isles.

A region of more, treacherous terrain. Extremely sharp rocks made of obsidian stick up from the water, which can shred a boat, and definitely your body. Mysterious currents surround the area, and the Qorgath lives somewhere in its murky depths, guarding her hatch of Erzqin.

The Erzqin also patrol the waters, slaying and destroying those who dare to enter.

## Drifting Isles

Tags: archipelago

Islands that are literally adrift, carried on a combination of currents and magic. They are treacherous for sea captains, for some of these islands lie just beneath the surface as well. Only experienced captains sail through this region, using local knowledge, charts, and magic to navigate safely. 

They are home to the Swordsmen, a group of tribal, sword wielding experts who hold a connection with the sword fish of the sea.

## Ember Isles

Tags: archipelago, geography

A volcanic island chain in the southwestern Western Isles, where the earth still burns and ancient Neferati experiments left scars that haven't healed. The islands glow with inner heat, shrouded in steam and ash, home to things that thrive in fire.

### Geography

The Ember Isles stretch across the southwestern Shattered Sea:
- **North**: The central Shattered Sea
- **East**: The Sea of Sharks
- **South**: Open water toward distant continents
- **West**: The deep Stratlan Sea

The archipelago consists of perhaps thirty volcanic islands, ranging from tiny smoking rocks to substantial landmasses. All are geothermally active to some degree—hot springs, steam vents, occasional lava flows.

### The Fire Below

The Ember Isles sit on an active volcanic zone. The earth here is thin; magma pushes close to the surface. This creates:

**Hot Springs**: Found on every island, ranging from pleasantly warm to instantly lethal

**Steam Vents**: Columns of superheated steam that erupt unpredictably, sometimes with enough force to strip flesh from bone

**Lava Flows**: Slow-moving rivers of molten rock that occasionally breach the surface, destroying everything in their path

**Unstable Ground**: Areas where the surface can collapse without warning into magma chambers below

The volcanic activity makes the Ember Isles simultaneously dangerous and valuable. The heat powers unique ecosystems; the minerals deposited by volcanic action are found nowhere else.

### Firefell

The largest and most infamous location in the Ember Isles is **Firefell**—the ruins of the Neferati colony of Pyrathes, which collapsed into the volcanic chambers it was exploiting five centuries ago.

Firefell draws treasure hunters, scholars, and Kingdoms of Fire agents seeking lost Neferati knowledge. Most don't return. The ruins are guarded by fire elementals and worse things born in the catastrophe.

### The Inhabited Islands

Despite the dangers, several islands support small populations:

**Ember Harbor**: The closest thing to a safe port in the Ember Isles. Built on a relatively stable island with natural hot springs that have been channeled for domestic use. Population ~500, mostly supporting expedition staging.

**The Forges**: An island where smiths exploit geothermal heat for metalworking. The volcanic forge produces weapons and tools of unusual quality. Access is restricted; the smith-masters guard their techniques.

**Ash Garden**: A community of druids and naturalists studying the unique life forms that thrive in volcanic environments. They're strange people who've adapted to living alongside fire.

### Volcanic Ecology

The Ember Isles host life forms found nowhere else—plants and creatures that have evolved to survive in volcanic conditions:

**Fire-Adapted Plants**: Vegetation that tolerates extreme heat, grows in volcanic soil, and sometimes burns constantly without dying

**Thermal Creatures**: Animals that live in hot springs, near lava flows, or in the superheated caves beneath the surface

**Fire Elementals**: Whether native or drawn here by the concentrated elemental energy, fire elementals are common in the Ember Isles—especially around Firefell

### Navigation

Sailing the Ember Isles requires caution:

**Steam Banks**: Volcanic steam creates dense fog that can appear suddenly, hiding islands and navigation hazards

**Hot Water**: Some areas have water temperatures high enough to damage hulls or kill swimmers who fall overboard

**Unpredictable Eruptions**: Islands can become suddenly dangerous as volcanic activity shifts

**Ash Fall**: During active periods, volcanic ash can blanket ships, damaging sails and choking crews

Most vessels approaching the Ember Isles hire local pilots who know which areas are currently safe. "Currently" is the operative word—conditions change.

### What Brings People Here

- **Firefell**: Treasure, knowledge, or Kingdom of Fire business in the Neferati ruins
- **The Forges**: Commissions for volcanic-forged weapons and tools
- **Research**: Studying volcanic ecology, fire elementals, or Neferati history
- **Minerals**: Volcanic deposits include valuable metals and gems
- **Healing**: Some hot springs have medicinal properties (others are just hot enough to cook you)

## Firefell

Tags: poi, ruins

The shattered remains of an ancient Neferati colony in the Ember Isles—a city that tried to harness volcanic power and paid the price. Now half-submerged in cooling lava, haunted by fire elementals, and guarded by secrets the Kingdoms of Fire would kill to control.

### The Ember Isles

Firefell lies within the Ember Isles—a cluster of volcanic islands in the southwestern Western Isles. The entire region is shrouded in white mist (volcanic steam and magical fog) and glows with inner heat. The islands are geothermally active, with hot springs, lava flows, and vents scattered across every significant landmass.

### The Fall

Five centuries ago—before the Tarkhon Empire, before the Severance, when the Neferati fire-bloods were still building their civilization—a colony was established in the Ember Isles. The Neferati called it **Pyrathes**, the Flame's Foundation.

The colony's purpose was ambitious: tap the volcanic power directly. Use the earth's fire to fuel magical workings on a scale never attempted. The Neferati believed they could draw energy from the molten core itself.

They succeeded.

Then they succeeded too well.

The vents they opened didn't just provide power—they destabilized the volcanic system. In a single catastrophic night, Pyrathes didn't burn. It *fell*. The ground beneath the city collapsed into the volcanic chambers below. Half the city dropped into magma; the other half slid down after it.

The survivors—there were survivors—fled to the Tarkhon mainland. They carried with them knowledge, artifacts, and a warning: some fires shouldn't be touched.

That warning became one of the founding principles of the Kingdoms of Fire. The eternal flames they maintain are *controlled*. What Pyrathes attempted was something else.

### What Remains

Firefell today is a ruin spread across three zones:

**The Upper Ruins**

The portions that didn't fall completely. These structures cling to the edges of the massive caldera that swallowed the city's heart. Some buildings are intact; others are half-collapsed, their foundations ending in empty air over the lava lake below.

The upper ruins are accessible—dangerous, but accessible. Treasure hunters, scholars, and fools have explored them for centuries. Most of the valuable artifacts were stripped long ago. What remains is too heavy to move, too dangerous to touch, or hidden in places no one has found.

**The Rim**

The edge of the caldera itself. Here the heat is intense; the stone glows dull red in places. Vents release toxic fumes. The view down into the lava lake is spectacular and terrifying.

Fire elementals patrol the Rim. They weren't here before the Fall—they were *created* by it, or summoned by dying Neferati, or simply drawn to the concentrated elemental energy. They attack living things that approach too closely.

**The Sunken City**

Below the lava lake's surface—or partially visible through it—lie the ruins of central Pyrathes. The grand temple. The power conduits. The chambers where the Neferati conducted their most dangerous experiments.

No one has explored the Sunken City and returned. The heat is impossible. The fire elementals are denser there. And there are rumors of things worse than elementals—bound servants of the Neferati that still follow their final orders.

### The Kingdoms of Fire Interest

The Kingdoms of Fire maintain a complicated relationship with Firefell.

Officially, they condemn Pyrathes's hubris. The Fall is a cautionary tale they teach to every child: this is what happens when fire-bloods reach too far.

Unofficially, they're terrified of what's down there.

Pyrathes was working on techniques the Kingdoms have never replicated. The power conduits, the binding chambers, the methods for drawing energy from volcanic cores—all of this knowledge was lost in the Fall. Or was it? The Sunken City might contain records, artifacts, or intact systems that could give whoever retrieves them enormous advantage.

The Kingdoms send occasional expeditions. Most don't return. The ones that do bring back fragments—partial records, damaged artifacts, pieces of a puzzle that might never be complete. Queen Khalira of Wadiyah has been particularly aggressive in funding these expeditions. Her rivals wonder what she's looking for.

### Fire Elementals

Dozens of fire elementals inhabit Firefell, from minor sparks to beings of terrifying power. They're not organized—they simply exist here, drawn to the concentrated fire energy, maintaining whatever purposes they've developed over centuries.

The elementals are aggressive toward living intruders but seem to ignore each other. They patrol territories, guard specific locations, and occasionally engage in behaviors that might be ritual or might be incomprehensible elemental instinct.

**The Ember Lord**

Rumors persist of something ancient and powerful in the Sunken City—a fire elemental of immense size and intelligence, possibly bound there by dying Neferati mages. Whether this "Ember Lord" exists, and what it wants, no one knows.

### Reaching Firefell

The Ember Isles are accessible from the southern Shattered Sea, though the volcanic activity makes navigation hazardous. The mist provides cover but also hides rocks and sudden shoals.

Landing on Firefell's island requires finding a safe harbor—the original port was destroyed in the Fall. Most expeditions anchor offshore and row in through the steam.

**Approach Hazards:**
- Volcanic venting can occur without warning
- The mist hides navigation hazards
- Fire elementals sometimes range to the shore
- Other expedition parties may not be friendly

### What Might Be Found

- **Neferati Artifacts**: Fire-magic items of exceptional power, if they survived the Fall
- **Lost Knowledge**: Techniques for working with volcanic energy that the Kingdoms of Fire don't possess
- **Bound Servants**: Fire elementals or other entities still following ancient commands—potentially controllable, potentially deadly
- **The Truth**: What actually happened in those final moments? What were the Neferati really trying to do?

### What Brings People Here

- **Treasure**: Neferati artifacts command enormous prices
- **Knowledge**: Scholars and mages seeking lost fire-magic techniques
- **Kingdom Business**: Agents of the Fire Kingdoms pursuing their rulers' agendas
- **Revenge**: The Neferati made enemies; some of those grudges are long-lived
- **Desperation**: People who need something badly enough to risk the Sunken City

## Foggy Isles

Tags: archipelago, geography

A cluster of islands perpetually shrouded in thick fog, positioned between Knova and the mainland coast. The fog isn't natural—it's maintained by the **Veilkeepers**, a secretive order who use the islands as a sanctuary for those who need to disappear.

### Position

The Foggy Isles occupy waters near the coast, northeast of Knova:
- **South**: Open water toward Knova and the Shattered Sea
- **East**: The mainland coast
- **North**: The Iron Sea
- **West**: Phyndarr Sound

The islands sit where warm southern currents meet cold northern waters—conditions that would produce some natural fog. The Veilkeepers have enhanced this dramatically.

### The Fog

The mist surrounding these islands is thick enough to get lost in within a hundred feet of shore. It muffles sound. It diffuses light. Ships entering the fog banks find their compasses unreliable and their crews disoriented.

The fog extends roughly five miles from the outermost islands, creating a zone of navigational confusion that keeps casual visitors away. The Veilkeepers control the mist—they can thin it to allow passage or thicken it to blind intruders.

**Properties of the Fog:**
- Reduces visibility to arm's length in the densest areas
- Absorbs sound, making communication difficult
- Creates illusions at the edges—shapes that might be islands or might be nothing
- Affects magical detection and scrying

### The Veilkeepers

The order that maintains the fog and controls access to the islands. Their origins are unclear—they might be an offshoot of a mainland mystery cult, practitioners of a specialized fog magic, or simply people who discovered the islands' natural properties and learned to enhance them.

**What They Offer:**
- Sanctuary for those fleeing enemies, laws, or pasts
- Absolute discretion—the Veilkeepers don't ask questions
- Protection through obscurity—finding someone in the Foggy Isles is nearly impossible
- Time—the fog affects perception of duration; stays feel shorter than they are

**What They Require:**
- Payment in goods, services, or secrets
- Respect for island rules
- Acceptance that leaving is harder than arriving
- Never revealing the islands' secrets to outsiders

### The Sanctuary Population

The Foggy Isles shelter perhaps two thousand permanent residents—people who came to hide and chose to stay. They include:

- Political refugees from a dozen nations
- Criminals too dangerous or valuable to extradite
- Researchers pursuing forbidden knowledge
- Lovers whose relationships are illegal elsewhere
- People who simply wanted to disappear

The residents form loose communities across the islands, maintaining lives in the perpetual mist. Some never want to leave. Others are waiting for enemies to die, situations to change, or debts to be forgotten.

### Island Geography

The fog makes mapping difficult, but the Veilkeepers know perhaps eight significant islands and many smaller ones:

**The Welcome Isle**: Where new arrivals are processed. The fog is thinnest here—a courtesy for those adjusting to life in the mist.

**The Deep Sanctuary**: The largest island, where most permanent residents live. The fog is thickest here; finding someone on Deep Sanctuary without a guide is impossible.

**The Keeper's Hold**: Where the Veilkeepers maintain their headquarters and train new members. Access is restricted.

**The Exchange**: A market island where residents trade goods and services. The fog is managed to allow limited visibility—enough to do business, not enough to identify anyone.

**The Forgotten**: A smaller island where the Veilkeepers send those who've broken the rules. Not a prison exactly—just a place where the fog is so thick you can't find your way out.

### Navigation

Entering the Foggy Isles requires a guide. The Veilkeepers post contacts in major ports—Sheîr, Knova, coastal towns—who can arrange passage for appropriate payment.

The approach involves following a guide ship through the fog. The guide knows safe channels; following at the correct distance is essential. Ships that lose the guide are lost in the fog, sometimes for days, often forever.

Leaving requires similar arrangements. The fog doesn't just keep people out—it keeps people in. Residents who haven't arranged departure find themselves sailing in circles, eventually returning to the islands they tried to leave.

### The Fee

The Veilkeepers accept various payments:
- Gold and valuables (straightforward)
- Skills and labor (craftspeople, warriors, specialists)
- Secrets (information valuable to the Veilkeepers' obscure purposes)
- Service (a term of years working for the order)

The more dangerous your enemies, the higher the fee. Hiding from a jealous spouse costs less than hiding from an empire.

### What Brings People Here

- **Refuge**: People who need to disappear completely
- **Recruitment**: Organizations seeking to hire from the island population
- **Research**: Scholars studying fog magic or the Veilkeepers' methods
- **Retrieval**: Those trying to find someone hidden in the fog (rarely successful)
- **Trade**: Goods that move better outside normal channels

## Iron Academy

Tags: poi, school

The greatest combat school in Alaria, and the de facto capital of Knova. The Academy isn't just located in Knova—it IS Knova. The institution and the nation are one and the same.

### The Fortress

The Iron Academy is built into the central peak of Knova's main island. Stone walls reinforced with iron plate give the fortress its distinctive metallic sheen. The structure rises in tiers from the harbor to the peak, each level containing training facilities, dormitories, armories, and forges.

The main gate faces the harbor—a massive iron portal that has never been breached. Attackers would have to pass the triton patrols, navigate the treacherous approach, breach the harbor defenses, and climb the terraced walls. No one has ever come close.

### The Hierarchy

Rank at the Academy is determined by combat record. Students advance through tiers by winning matches against peers and superiors. Faculty earn their positions through demonstrated excellence. The Commandant holds supreme authority because no one has defeated them.

**Current Commandant: Irontide Vesk**

A massive, scarred veteran who killed a deep-sea serpent in single combat. He's held the position for twenty-three years (his second tenure—he lost it once, spent eight years rebuilding his skills, then reclaimed it). The beast's skull hangs in the central courtyard as proof of his prowess.

Vesk rules from the Iron Throne—literally a chair forged from weapons taken from defeated challengers over the Academy's four-century history.

### Training

Students master multiple combat disciplines before specializing. Sword, spear, axe, bare hands, thrown weapons, shields—the Academy produces complete fighters, not specialists. Training is brutal, injury is common, and death isn't unheard of.

The annual Iron Tournament draws observers from across Alaria. Victory in the tournament guarantees employment anywhere. Even showing well attracts recruiters from noble houses, mercenary companies, and royal guards.

### The Compact

The Academy's greatest asset is its relationship with the triton. Under an agreement dating back 350 years, triton warriors receive free training in exchange for defending Knova's waters. This has produced generations of elite triton fighters—and ensures the Academy is effectively impregnable.

**Tide-Captain Muravel** leads the current triton contingent. She's trained three generations of her people here and maintains the compact with religious devotion.

### Notable Locations

- **The Central Courtyard**: Open training space dominated by the Serpent Skull
- **The Proving Grounds**: Terraced areas where students fight for advancement
- **The Deep Forges**: Smithies built into the mountain using natural heat vents
- **The Armory Vaults**: Weapons collection spanning four centuries
- **The Iron Throne Hall**: Where the Commandant receives visitors and settles disputes

### What Brings People Here

- **Training**: Students pay fortunes for the world's best combat education
- **Recruitment**: Employers seek Academy graduates for elite positions
- **Challenge**: Ambitious warriors come to test themselves against the best
- **Consultation**: Nobles and generals hire Academy experts for strategic advice

## Islands of Gold

Tags: island, geography

The southernmost archipelago of the Western Isles—fantastically rich in gold and utterly deadly to reach. The waters here are prowled by colossal stone creatures that walk the seafloor, using the rocky spires on their backs to snare ships before devouring the crews.

### Position

The Islands of Gold occupy the southwestern extreme of the Western Isles:
- **North**: The Sea of Sharks and Teku's territory
- **East**: Distant view of Mueras and the Rimihuica coast
- **South**: The Seacleft Coast (Rimihuica)
- **West**: The open Solemn Sea

The islands sit at a convergence of warm and cold currents, creating waters that are rich in sea life—which feeds the creatures that make the Islands of Gold so deadly.

### The Walking Reefs

The true danger of the Islands of Gold isn't the islands themselves—it's what lives in the waters around them.

**The Seafloor Giants** are colossal creatures of living stone. They walk on the ocean bottom, unable to swim but tall enough that the rocky spires growing from their backs break the surface. From above, these spires look like small islands, reefs, or rocky outcroppings.

They're not.

The Giants are predators. They position themselves in shipping lanes, wait for vessels to approach what looks like a reef or island, and then move. Ships that run aground on a Giant's back find themselves lifted, tilted, and dragged underwater as the creature dives to feed.

**Characteristics:**
- Heights ranging from 60 to over 200 feet
- Stone bodies covered in barnacles, coral, and other sea growth that makes them indistinguishable from natural rock
- Rocky spires on their backs that grow over decades
- Movement speed of perhaps a mile per hour—slow, but they don't need to chase their prey
- Intelligence unclear—they hunt, they position themselves strategically, but whether they think is debated

### The Gold

The islands and surrounding seabed are phenomenally rich in gold. Veins run through every significant landmass. Gold dust settles in the sand. The creatures themselves sometimes have gold deposits visible in their stone flesh.

The gold exists because of ancient volcanic activity that pushed mineral-rich magma up through the seafloor. The same geological forces that created the gold may have created—or attracted—the Giants.

### Hunting Grounds

The Giants don't roam randomly. They stake out territories, usually near shipping lanes or the approaches to actual islands. Their hunting grounds create a maze—some routes are patrolled by Giants, others are temporarily safe, and the pattern shifts as the creatures move.

**Known Hunting Grounds:**
- **The Graveyard**: The densest concentration of Giants, named for the wrecks visible in the shallows. At least a dozen Giants patrol this area.
- **Golden Approach**: The most direct route to the richest islands—and the most heavily hunted.
- **The Shallows**: Where Giants that prefer smaller prey congregate. Ships sometimes survive here; crews rarely do.

### The Treasure Hunters

Despite the danger—or because the danger keeps competition down—treasure hunters attempt the Islands of Gold regularly. They launch from Teku, from Mueras, from anywhere a ship and crew can be assembled.

**Strategies That Sometimes Work:**
- **Speed runs**: Fast ships sprinting through Giant territory before the creatures can react
- **Disguise**: Coating hulls with substances that make ships "taste" like stone to Giant senses
- **Sacrificial escorts**: Multiple ships traveling together, accepting that some will be lost
- **Underwater approach**: Swimming or diving to the islands, avoiding ships entirely
- **Giant-reading**: Hiring specialists who claim to predict Giant movements

Most expeditions fail. The successful ones bring back enough gold to fund ten more attempts—which perpetuates the cycle.

### The Islands Themselves

The actual islands—the ones that don't move—are volcanic rock covered in sparse vegetation. They're accessible only by evading the Giants long enough to reach shore.

**What's There:**
- Surface gold deposits that can be gathered without mining
- Abandoned camps from previous expeditions—some with supplies, others with bones
- Caves that might contain richer deposits, or Giant lairs, or both
- The remains of a pre-human civilization that apparently lived here before the Giants arrived

### The Ruins

On the largest island, ruins of unknown origin emerge from the jungle. Carved stone buildings, broken statues, inscriptions in no known language. Whoever built this was here before the Giants—or possibly before the gold.

The ruins are architecturally impossible for humans—doorways too tall, stairs at wrong proportions, carvings depicting creatures that don't exist. Some scholars believe a giant race (not the walking reefs, something else) lived here in ancient times.

What happened to them is unclear. Whether they created the Seafloor Giants, or the Giants destroyed them, or something else happened entirely—no one knows.

### Survival Tips

From the few who've returned:
- The Giants sense vibration. Quiet ships survive longer.
- They hunt more actively at certain times—possibly related to tides or feeding cycles.
- A ship caught on a Giant's back has seconds to cut free before going under.
- The Giants ignore things that don't move. Playing dead sometimes works.
- If you reach an island, the Giants don't come ashore. You're safe on land—until you try to leave.

### What Brings People Here

- **Gold**: Enough wealth to retire on, if you survive
- **The Ruins**: Scholars seeking knowledge of the pre-human civilization
- **Giant Materials**: Stone from the Giants has unusual properties—but killing one is nearly impossible
- **Challenge**: Some people need to prove they can survive what kills everyone else
- **Desperation**: Those who have nothing to lose and everything to gain

## Istokos

Tags: state, nation

A southern island nation in the Western Isles, home to the Chargon—an eel race that has rejected their aquatic heritage in favor of land-dwelling and bloodline magic. The architecture, culture, and geography of Istokos all reflect this strange inversion: a sea people terrified of the sea.

### Position and Borders

Istokos occupies a cluster of islands in the southern Shattered Sea:
- **North**: The Sea of Merchants and Sheîr's southern reaches
- **West**: Open water toward the Sea of Sharks
- **South**: The Sea of Sharks and the Islands of Gold
- **East**: Distant view of Mueras and the Rimihuica coast

The islands are positioned south of the main Shattered Sea chaos, in calmer but still treacherous waters. Reefs and shoals make navigation difficult for outsiders; Chargon pilots—all commoners who can risk water exposure—guide foreign ships.

### Terrain and Climate

**The Islands**

Istokos consists of one large central island and perhaps thirty smaller ones. All are volcanic in origin, with steep rocky shores giving way to jungle interiors. Fresh water is abundant—streams and springs feed the islands, though the nobility avoids contact with even fresh water when possible.

The climate is tropical: warm year-round, with a monsoon season that tests the Chargon's elaborate rain-protection systems. Humidity is constant and oppressive to visitors; the Chargon seem unbothered.

**The Waters**

The seas around Istokos are warm, clear, and full of life. Fish schools are massive. Coral reefs ring the larger islands. This was once a paradise for aquatic hunters—and some part of the Chargon still yearns for it.

Currents between islands are dangerous. The Chargon know them perfectly, but foreign ships regularly run aground on unmarked shoals.

### Kargak

The capital city covers most of the main island's northern coast. Built by a people desperate to stay dry, Kargak is an architectural marvel of paranoia.

**Notable Features:**

- **The Dry Palace**: Central complex where the nobility conducts all business. Elaborate drainage, covered walkways, and sealed chambers keep seawater permanently excluded. The Tasting ceremonies occur in specially designed pools that can be drained and refilled with imported freshwater.

- **The Covered Streets**: During monsoon season, fabric awnings extend across every street in the noble quarter. Commoners walk in the rain; nobles never feel a drop.

- **The Piers of Exchange**: The waterfront where trade occurs. Nobles negotiate from covered platforms; goods are transferred by commoners who can afford to get wet. Foreign merchants find the arrangement baffling.

- **The House Compounds**: Each noble house maintains a sealed estate. Some haven't allowed outside water within their walls in generations.

### The House Islands

Surrounding the main island, smaller islands serve as noble house domains:

**Murk Isle**: Home estate of House Murk, the ruling bloodline. The island is perpetually shrouded in mist—not natural fog, but a manifestation of their Sight Beyond magic. Visitors see only what the Murk want them to see.

**Spark Reef**: House Spark's territory. The surrounding waters are dangerous—the Spark have seeded the reef with creatures that carry electrical charges. Unauthorized swimmers die.

**Coil's Shadow**: House Coil claims a small island that seems to have more caves and passages than its size should allow. Assassins train here in infiltration and escape.

**Slick Stone**: House Slick's domain, a steep rocky island with no safe landing points. Their bloodline lets them climb surfaces no one else can reach.

**The Depths**: House Depths controls an island with extensive underground complexes. They've excavated for generations, following structural weaknesses only they can sense.

### The Commoner Islands

Southern islands house the commoner Chargon—those without bloodline magic. These islands lack the elaborate water-protection systems of the noble territories. Commoners fish, sail, and dive freely. Some nobles consider them contaminated; others consider them pitiable.

The largest commoner settlement is **Wetside**—a fishing village that deliberately inverts noble customs. Buildings are open to rain. Streets flood during storms. Residents swim regularly. The name is both description and defiance.

### The Abandoned Reefs

Southwest of Istokos lie reefs that the Chargon inhabited in their aquatic days. Ruins of underwater structures are visible at low tide—carved coral, shaped stone, the remnants of a civilization that chose to abandon its home.

The reefs are forbidden to nobility. Commoners sometimes dive there, seeking artifacts or simply connecting with their past. Some never return. Whether they die, flee, or simply choose to stay beneath the waves, no one knows.

### Navigation and Approach

Foreign ships approaching Istokos must stop at designated anchorages and request pilots. Chargon commoners guide vessels through the reef channels—and charge substantial fees.

The waters are deliberately unmapped. Charts show only the approved approach routes. Anyone attempting to navigate independently risks reefs, currents, and (rumor claims) creatures that the Spark have modified to attack intruders.

**Approach Points:**
- **The Welcome Reef**: Official anchorage for trading vessels. Commoner pilots available for hire.
- **The Dry Dock**: Where ships undergo inspection before nobles will approach them. Wet decks are dried; any standing water is removed.
- **Kargak Harbor**: The main port, but nobles never set foot on the actual docks.

### The Sea of Sharks Connection

Istokos sits at the northern edge of the Sea of Sharks—those shark-infested waters that even experienced sailors avoid. The Chargon's rejection of the sea makes them uniquely willing to trade across these waters; they simply refuse to fall in.

Some speculate the Chargon originally fled to these islands because the sharks would discourage anyone from following them into the water. If so, the strategy worked—and continues to work.

### What Brings People Here

- **Bloodline Services**: House Murk seers, House Coil assassins, House Spark warriors—all available for hire at premium rates
- **Trade**: Istokos handles goods moving between the Shattered Sea and the Sea of Sharks
- **Curiosity**: The Chargon's rejection of water fascinates scholars and mages
- **Artifacts**: The abandoned reefs contain pre-Ascension Chargon relics, valuable to collectors
- **Refuge**: Commoner Istokos asks few questions and provides excellent places to disappear

## Iypos

Tags: city, state, nation

The dominant city-state on the island of Migos—a trading hub built on the lower slopes of Mount Iypos, controlling the only significant harbor on the largest island in the northern Western Isles.

### Position

Iypos occupies the southeastern coast of Migos, where Harbor Bay provides the only accessible anchorage on the island. The city climbs the mountain slopes in terraces, from the waterfront markets to the upper districts where the wealthiest families build their compounds.

### The City

**Population**: ~15,000

Iypos is built vertically. The waterfront handles commerce—docks, warehouses, markets, taverns for sailors. Above that, craftspeople and traders live in stacked buildings connected by staircases and rope bridges. Higher still, the wealthy maintain compounds with views across the harbor. The temple district occupies a plateau partway up Mount Iypos.

**Notable Features:**

- **The Long Docks**: Extending into Harbor Bay, capable of handling dozens of ships simultaneously
- **The Terrace Markets**: Commercial district climbing the lower slopes in stepped levels
- **The Rope Ways**: Networks of bridges and lifts connecting different city levels
- **The Upper Compounds**: Wealthy family homes built for defensibility as much as comfort
- **Temple of the Mountain**: Where the city's patron spirits (mountain and sea) are honored together

### Government

Iypos is ruled by the **Harbor Council**—representatives from the trading families that have dominated commerce for generations. Council seats are bought, inherited, and occasionally murdered for.

**Current Harbor Master**: **Theodras Vane**, a merchant prince who's held power for eighteen years by being slightly more competent and slightly less corrupt than his rivals. He maintains neutrality in regional conflicts because taking sides would be bad for business.

The Council controls:
- Harbor access and fees
- Trade agreements and tariffs
- The city militia
- Relations with the Vethrani mountain folk

What the Council doesn't control: the mountains. The Vethrani govern themselves and consider Iypos a convenient market, not a government.

### Economy

Iypos exists because of geography. Every ship traveling between the Iron Sea and the central Shattered Sea benefits from stopping here for supplies, repairs, or rest. The harbor charges fees; the merchants sell goods; the city profits.

**Major Industries:**
- **Maritime services**: Repairs, resupply, crew hiring
- **Trade brokerage**: Connecting buyers and sellers across the Western Isles
- **Mountain goods**: Processing and exporting what the Vethrani bring down
- **Information**: Iypos merchants know shipping routes, cargo values, and who's doing business with whom

### The Vethrani Relationship

The mountain folk tolerate Iypos because it's useful. They bring highland products—rare herbs, mountain furs, minerals—to trade for lowland goods they can't produce. They use Iypos merchants to sell to the outside world.

But they don't consider themselves part of Iypos. They maintain separate identity, separate governance, and separate territory. The Council knows better than to claim authority over the mountains.

**The Arrangement:**
- Vethrani can trade freely in designated market areas
- Iypos provides coastal defense that benefits the whole island
- Neither side interferes in the other's internal affairs
- Both sides unite against external threats

This works because both sides benefit. When it stops working, Migos will tear itself apart.

### Military

Iypos maintains a professional militia focused on harbor defense and keeping order in the city. They're adequate for pirates and street crime; they couldn't hold the mountains against the Vethrani and don't try.

**Militia Size**: ~800 regulars plus reserves

The real military value of Migos is the mountains themselves. Any invader who takes the harbor still has to deal with the Vethrani—and no one has ever managed that.

### Politics

Iypos practices aggressive neutrality. They trade with everyone, ally with no one, and avoid taking sides in conflicts that might disrupt commerce.

**Current Tensions:**
- Sheîr wants closer ties (Iypos suspects this means eventual absorption)
- Knova wants training access to the mountains (the Vethrani refuse)
- Various powers want preferential trade arrangements (Iypos offers the same terms to everyone)

Harbor Master Theodras navigates these pressures by being useful to everyone and committed to no one. This makes Iypos valuable and frustrating in equal measure.

### The Temple of the Mountain

The city's main religious site honors both the mountain spirits (Vethrani tradition) and sea spirits (coastal tradition). This dual worship reflects Iypos's position between two worlds.

The temple maintains:
- Priests from both traditions working together
- Neutral ground where Vethrani and city folk meet as equals
- Weather prediction services valuable to sailors and mountain travelers alike
- Funeral rites that satisfy both cultures

The Temple's priests have diplomatic immunity in Vethrani territory—one of the few groups that can move freely through the mountains.

### What Brings People Here

- **Trade**: The major commercial hub for the northern Western Isles
- **Supplies**: Ships traveling between the Iron Sea and Shattered Sea stop for resupply
- **Mountain Access**: The only reasonable approach to Migos's interior (if the Vethrani allow it)
- **Information**: Iypos merchants know what's happening across the region
- **Neutrality**: A place to do business without political entanglement

## Kettle Bay

Tags: bay, geography

A sheltered natural harbor at the base of the Cliffs of Shondromos—calm waters surrounded by honeycombed cliffs riddled with caves. An excellent anchorage if you don't mind what might be watching from the cave mouths.

### Geography

Kettle Bay is a roughly circular body of water, perhaps three miles across, partially enclosed by the Cliffs of Shondromos:
- **North**: The cliff faces and their cave openings
- **East**: More cliffs, curving around the bay
- **South**: The bay's entrance, opening to the Shattered Sea
- **West**: The outer Shondromos cliffs

The bay is deep enough for large vessels, sheltered from storms, and would be perfect harbor—except for the caves.

### The Caves

The Shondromos honeycomb opens into Kettle Bay through dozens of waterline cave mouths. Some are small openings barely visible above the waterline. Others are tall enough to sail a ship through, leading into the maze beyond.

**What Comes Out:**

- Smuggler vessels moving cargo after dark
- Small boats carrying supplies to cave-dwellers
- Guide services heading to or from cave expeditions
- Occasionally, things that no one wants to identify

**What Goes In:**

- Ships seeking shelter from storms (despite the risks)
- Merchants meeting contacts who prefer discretion
- Explorers attempting to map the cave system
- People who want to disappear

### The Anchorage

Ships anchoring in Kettle Bay follow unwritten rules:
- Post guards watching the cave mouths
- Anchor in the bay's center, away from the cliff faces
- Don't investigate unusual sounds from the caves
- Leave before dark if possible

These precautions exist because vessels that don't follow them occasionally have problems—crew members gone missing, cargo disturbed, or worse.

### No Government

Kettle Bay belongs to no one. It's technically in waters claimed by various powers, but no one enforces authority here. Ships anchor at their own risk; disputes are settled by those involved; and the caves provide escape routes for anyone who needs to disappear quickly.

This makes the bay useful for activities that don't survive official scrutiny. Black markets operate on anchored ships. Negotiations happen between parties who can't meet openly. Information changes hands for appropriate prices.

### The Guide Services

Several independent guides operate out of Kettle Bay, offering access to the Shondromos caves:

**Services Available:**
- Outer cave tours (relatively safe)
- Smuggling route access (expensive)
- Deep cave expeditions (dangerous, guides won't go far)
- Recovery operations (finding people or cargo lost in the caves)

The guides know the outer caves well. They maintain relationships with cave-dwellers who tolerate guided visitors. They also know when to turn back—the deeper caves are beyond their expertise, and they've seen what happens to those who push too far.

### What Brings People Here

- **Shelter**: Storm refuge for ships that can't reach safer harbors
- **Discretion**: Business that can't happen in public ports
- **Access**: Gateway to the Shondromos cave system
- **Freedom**: A place with no authorities and few rules
- **Disappearance**: Exit point for those who need to vanish

## Knova

Tags: state, nation

An archipelago in the northern Western Isles, south of the Iron Sea. Famous as the home of the Iron Academy—the greatest combat school in Alaria—and its sister institutions Seatower and Blackwater.

### Position and Borders

Knova occupies a cluster of rocky islands in the northeastern Shattered Sea:
- **North**: The Iron Sea, leading to Clueanda's Westwilds
- **South**: The Shattered Sea proper, toward the Drifting Isles
- **East**: Open water leading to Sheîr and the Tarkhon coast
- **West**: The Foggy Isles and deeper Shattered Sea

The archipelago sits at a natural crossroads—ships traveling between the Iron Sea and the Sea of Merchants often pass within sight of Knova's fortresses. This makes it valuable for trade and dangerous for enemies.

### Terrain and Climate

The islands are volcanic remnants—steep-sided, rocky, with little arable land. What they lack in farmland they make up in mineral wealth: iron deposits run through every major island, with copper and tin in the smaller outcroppings.

The climate is temperate maritime with frequent storms. Fog rolls in without warning. The waters between islands hide rocks that have claimed countless ships—the triton patrols know safe passages that outsiders don't.

### The Main Island

The largest island rises sharply from the sea, its central peak dominated by the **Iron Academy fortress**. The harbor is a narrow channel between two spurs of rock, easily blocked and heavily defended. Behind the fortress, the mountainside is terraced with training grounds, dormitories, and forges.

The fortress itself is built from local stone reinforced with iron—the walls have a metallic sheen in sunlight. The main gate faces the harbor; smaller gates lead to training grounds and the mine tunnels that honeycomb the mountain's interior.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Serpent Skull**: A massive sea-serpent skull displayed in the central courtyard—trophy of Commandant Vesk's legendary kill
- **The Iron Throne**: The Commandant's seat, forged from weapons taken from defeated challengers
- **The Deep Forges**: Smithies built into the mountain, using natural heat vents for metalworking
- **The Proving Grounds**: Terraced training areas where students fight for advancement

### Seatower Island

West of the main island, **Seatower** rises from a rocky spire overlooking the main shipping lanes. The fortress commands views in every direction—nothing approaches without being spotted.

The island is smaller and steeper than the main island, with almost no flat ground. Buildings cling to the rock face, connected by stairs and rope bridges. The harbor is barely a notch in the cliffs, accessible only in calm weather.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Watch**: An observation platform at the fortress's peak, staffed day and night
- **The War Room**: A vast chamber with sand tables, ship models, and maps covering every known coast
- **Signal Towers**: A network of fire signals connecting Seatower to the other fortresses

### Blackwater Island

North of the main island, **Blackwater** takes its name from the dark, deep waters of its harbor. The island sits lower than its neighbors, with a more accessible coastline—though "accessible" is relative in Knova.

The fortress here is less imposing than the Iron Academy but more practical. Libraries, archives, supply warehouses—Blackwater stores knowledge rather than showcasing strength.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Archives**: Records of campaigns, supply calculations, and strategic analyses dating back centuries
- **The Charting Halls**: Where students learn terrain analysis and logistics planning
- **The Black Harbor**: Deep anchorage where supply ships dock, protected from storms

### The Lesser Islands

Dozens of smaller islands dot the archipelago:

- **The Training Rocks**: Bare outcroppings used for survival exercises and punishment details
- **The Iron Veins**: Mining islands, pocked with tunnels and served by work crews
- **Garrison Points**: Small fortified positions watching approach routes
- **The Proving Ground**: An island used for final examinations—students are dropped there with minimal equipment and must survive, fight, or reach extraction points

### The Triton Waters

The sea around Knova belongs to the triton. Their patrols are constant and deadly—any ship approaching without permission faces warriors rising from the depths to investigate.

The triton maintain underwater camps in the deeper waters between islands. They know every current, every rock, every safe passage. This knowledge is Knova's greatest defense.

**Undersea Features:**
- **The Deep Barracks**: Triton living quarters carved into underwater cliff faces
- **The Hunting Grounds**: Waters where triton warriors practice combat
- **The Serpent's Grave**: Where Commandant Vesk killed the great sea-serpent—triton consider it sacred

### Navigation

Approaching Knova without a guide is suicide. The waters between islands hide rocks that don't show on standard charts. Currents shift unpredictably. And the triton don't warn intruders before attacking.

Legitimate visitors request permission from Sheîr or arrange escort through official channels. The triton will meet authorized ships at designated points and guide them through safe passages.

Unauthorized approaches end one of two ways: the rocks get you, or the triton do.

## Migos

Tags: island, geography

The largest single island in the northern Western Isles—a mountainous landmass that rises dramatically from Phyndarr Sound. Home to the city-state of Iypos and a population of independent-minded mountain folk who've never been successfully conquered.

### Position

Migos dominates the northern Shattered Sea:
- **South**: The Whisper Isles and the Murmuring Isles
- **East**: Phyndarr Sound and routes toward Sheîr
- **North**: The Iron Sea and the Cliffs of Syquindonos
- **West**: Open water toward the Dragon's Teeth

The island sits at the intersection of major shipping lanes—anything traveling between the Iron Sea and the central Shattered Sea passes within sight of Migos.

### Terrain

Migos is mountainous. The central peaks rise over 8,000 feet, snow-capped year-round. Steep valleys cut through the highlands, and the coastline alternates between sheer cliffs and narrow beaches.

The mountains make the interior nearly impassable for outsiders. Paths exist, but they're controlled by the mountain communities who know them. Armies that have tried to march into the interior have gotten lost, ambushed, or simply frozen in the high passes.

**Key Geographic Features:**

- **Mount Iypos**: The highest peak, sacred to the mountain folk. The city of Iypos is built on its lower slopes.
- **The Knife Ridge**: A mountain spine running north-south, dividing the island in half
- **The Harbor Bay**: The only significant natural harbor, where Iypos controls all maritime access
- **The Cloud Forest**: Mid-elevation jungle perpetually shrouded in mist

### Climate

The coast is temperate maritime—comfortable, rainy, suitable for farming. The mountains are brutal: extreme cold, sudden storms, conditions that kill the unprepared.

This creates a divided population. Coastal people live like typical Western Isles inhabitants. Mountain people live in a different world entirely—one that's made them hard, proud, and very difficult to conquer.

### The Mountain Folk

The interior of Migos is inhabited by communities that have resisted outside control for as long as anyone remembers. They call themselves the **Vethrani**, and they've developed a culture adapted to the extreme environment.

**Characteristics:**
- Extended family groups controlling specific valleys and passes
- Economy based on herding, highland agriculture, and controlling mountain trade routes
- Warrior culture—every adult can fight, raiding between families is traditional
- Deep distrust of coastal people and outsiders generally
- Oral tradition maintaining grudges and alliances for generations

The Vethrani have no central government. Families cooperate or conflict based on shifting alliances. Attempting to unite them under outside rule has been tried repeatedly and failed every time.

### The Coastal Strip

The narrow coastal areas, especially around Harbor Bay, are more accessible and more integrated with the Western Isles economy. The city of Iypos dominates this zone—collecting fees from everyone who wants to use the harbor, trading with whoever pays, and maintaining a wary relationship with the mountain interior.

The coastal population includes:
- Iypos citizens (traders, craftspeople, sailors)
- Foreign merchants with long-term residency
- Vethrani who've left the mountains for coastal life (often considered traitors by their families)
- Workers from across the Western Isles

### Strategic Importance

Migos's position makes it valuable:
- **The harbor** controls access to major shipping routes
- **The mountains** provide lookout positions visible across the northern Shattered Sea
- **The resources** include timber, mountain herbs, and minerals that don't exist elsewhere

Multiple powers have tried to take full control of Migos. None have succeeded. The mountains defeat armies; the harbor defeats blockades; the Vethrani defeat occupation.

### The Migos Problem

Every regional power wants Migos, and no one can have it.

- Knova has tried to establish training facilities in the mountains—the Vethrani drove them out
- Sheîr has tried to claim the harbor as a vassal state—Iypos refused and the Vethrani threatened war
- Various mainlanders have attempted conquest—the mountains ate their armies

The result is that Migos remains independent by default. Iypos trades with everyone but aligns with no one. The Vethrani ignore everyone except those foolish enough to enter their territory.

### What Brings People Here

- **Trade**: Iypos is a major commercial hub for the northern Western Isles
- **Mountain Products**: Herbs, minerals, and crafts available nowhere else
- **Passage**: Ships transiting between the Iron Sea and Shattered Sea stop for supplies
- **Refuge**: The mountains can hide people who don't want to be found
- **Challenge**: Some adventurers want to see if they can cross the interior and survive

## Phyndarr Sound

Tags: sea, geography

The major waterway connecting the northern Western Isles to the Iron Sea and mainland coast—a broad channel of relatively calm water between the Shattered Sea's chaos and the deeper ocean. Every ship traveling north-south through this region passes through Phyndarr Sound.

### Geography

Phyndarr Sound runs roughly northwest-southeast, bounded by:
- **East**: The mainland coast and Sheîr's territory
- **West**: Migos and the outer islands of the Shattered Sea
- **North**: The Iron Sea
- **South**: The entrance to the Shattered Sea proper

The Sound is roughly 80 miles long and 15-30 miles wide—broad enough for safe navigation, sheltered enough to avoid the worst weather.

### Why It Matters

Phyndarr Sound is the primary shipping lane for northern Western Isles commerce:

**North-South Trade**: Goods moving between the Iron Sea (and Clueanda beyond) and the Shattered Sea pass through the Sound. This includes Tarkhon trade, Knova supplies, and everything bound for the southern Western Isles.

**Coastal Access**: The Sound provides the easiest approach to the mainland coast. Sheîr's territory borders it; traders heading to Tarkhon often transit through here.

**Weather Shelter**: Ships fleeing storms in the Iron Sea or Shattered Sea can reach the Sound's calmer waters. Several anchorages along the route offer emergency shelter.

### Navigation

The Sound is well-charted compared to the Shattered Sea's chaos. Main channels are clearly marked; pilots are available for hire at both ends.

**Navigation Points:**

- **The Northern Gate**: Where the Sound meets the Iron Sea. Deep water, strong currents during certain tides, but manageable for experienced captains.

- **The Narrows**: A pinch point roughly midway through the Sound, where the channel contracts to perhaps five miles. This creates faster currents and limits maneuvering room.

- **The Southern Mouth**: Where the Sound opens into the Shattered Sea. Here the orderly channels dissolve into the archipelago's maze—pilots are essential beyond this point.

### Control Points

Several powers maintain presence along the Sound:

**Sheîr** controls the eastern shore. Ships using the Sound technically pass through Sheîr's waters and are subject to inspection. In practice, Sheîr collects tolls from foreign vessels but doesn't interfere with commerce that might enrich them.

**Iypos** on Migos controls the western approach. Their harbor serves ships entering or leaving the Sound—a natural resupply point.

**Knova** maintains no territorial claim but their ships patrol the northern entrance. The triton patrol the waters below.

**The Foggy Isles** lie near the Sound's eastern edge. Ships passing close report fog banks drifting into the channel—the Veilkeepers extending their influence, or just natural weather.

### The Sound as Neutral Zone

Despite multiple powers claiming various parts of the Sound, actual conflict here is rare. Everyone depends on the channel for trade; disrupting it would hurt the disruptor as much as their enemies.

This creates an informal agreement: the Sound is for commerce, not warfare. Pirates are hunted by whoever catches them. Disputes are settled at port, not at sea. Ships of hostile nations pass each other without incident.

This arrangement holds because the alternatives are worse. If the Sound becomes a war zone, trade collapses and everyone loses.

### Hazards

The Sound is safer than the Shattered Sea but not without dangers:

**The Narrows Currents**: During certain tides, the Narrows generates currents strong enough to carry ships into rocks. Pilots time their transits carefully.

**Storm Channeling**: The Sound's shape can focus storms, creating locally intense weather even when surrounding areas are calm.

**Fog Drift**: Mist from the Foggy Isles occasionally fills parts of the channel. Usually natural; occasionally not.

**Pirates**: Less common than in the Shattered Sea, but the Sound's predictable routes make ambush easier. Successful pirates don't last long—too many powers want the channel safe.

### Notable Locations Along the Sound

- **The Watchfires**: A series of signal towers along the eastern shore, maintained by Sheîr to guide ships and warn of threats
- **Shelter Bay**: A natural harbor on the western side, neutral ground where ships can anchor during storms
- **The Narrows Light**: A lighthouse at the channel's tightest point, maintained by whoever remembers to fund it
- **Ghost Anchor**: An anchorage near the northern gate where ships sometimes report seeing vessels that aren't there—probably fog and light playing tricks

### What Brings People Here

Everyone passing between the northern and central Western Isles comes through Phyndarr Sound. It's not a destination—it's a corridor. The question isn't whether to use it, but how fast you need to pass through and how much you're willing to pay for safe passage.

## Sea of Sharks

Tags: sea, geography

A cursed expanse of water in the southern Western Isles, infested with sharks so numerous, so aggressive, and so large that they make normal navigation nearly impossible. Ships avoid these waters entirely—unless they're desperate, foolish, or bound for Teku.

### Geography

The Sea of Sharks occupies the southern central Western Isles:
- **North**: The Shattered Sea and Istokos
- **East**: Distant Mueras and the Rimihuica coast
- **South**: The Islands of Gold
- **West**: The Ember Isles

The sea is roughly 200 miles across at its widest point, dotted with uninhabited islands that no one has successfully colonized.

### The Sharks

The sharks of this sea are wrong. Too numerous. Too aggressive. Too large.

**Behavior**: Normal sharks avoid ships. These sharks attack them. They circle vessels, ram hulls, and have been documented chewing through wooden planking to reach the crews inside.

**Size**: Sharks near the edges are merely dangerous—eight to twelve feet long. As you approach the center of the sea, they grow larger. The biggest specimens reported exceed forty feet, though survivors' accounts may be exaggerated.

**Numbers**: The sharks are everywhere. Drop a fishing line and you'll catch one. Fall overboard and you'll be dead before rescue arrives.

### Why?

No one knows why the Sea of Sharks is this way. Theories include:

**Magical Contamination**: Some ancient magical event poisoned the waters, driving the sharks to unnatural aggression

**Breeding Isolation**: The shark population has been isolated for millennia, evolving without normal predation or competition

**Something in the Deep**: The sharks are responding to something beneath the surface—feeding it, serving it, or fleeing from it toward the surface

**The Islands of Gold**: The Seafloor Giants to the south may somehow affect shark behavior in these waters

The truth remains unknown. Scholars who might study the phenomenon tend to get eaten.

### Survivor's Island

At the center of the Sea of Sharks lies **Survivor's Island**—home to the city-state of Teku. The inhabitants are descendants of refugees whose ships were destroyed here; they couldn't leave, so they learned to survive.

Teku has developed techniques for existing in shark waters:
- Metal-reinforced hulls that resist shark teeth
- Chemical compounds that discourage shark approach
- Trained shark-hunters who control the population around the harbor
- Knowledge of shark behavior that lets them predict relatively safe windows

Reaching Teku requires crossing shark-infested waters. Most ships hire Teku pilots who know the patterns; others simply sail fast and hope.

### Navigation

Most sailors have one rule for the Sea of Sharks: don't enter it.

**Alternative Routes**: Ships traveling between the Shattered Sea and southern destinations take longer routes around the Sea of Sharks. This adds days to voyages but avoids certain death.

**The Desperate**: Some captains risk the crossing anyway—smugglers, those fleeing pursuit, or ships already too damaged to reach safer ports. Many become shark food.

**The Teku Route**: Ships bound for Teku or the Islands of Gold must cross. They travel in convoys, post lookouts, and prepare for attacks. Casualties are expected.

### The Islands

Scattered through the Sea of Sharks are numerous small islands—volcanic rocks, sandy spits, and the occasional substantial landmass. All are uninhabited.

Previous colonization attempts have failed. Ships carrying supplies and settlers were attacked; survivors who reached the islands couldn't be resupplied. The islands remain empty except for seabirds and the occasional castaway who doesn't last long.

**Notable Features:**

- **Bonefish Reef**: A shallow area where shark-stripped skeletons of whales and ships accumulate
- **The Circle**: A ring of islands around unnaturally calm water—sailors avoid it, believing something waits there
- **Wreck Beach**: An island where currents deposit debris from destroyed ships. Occasionally salvageable.

### What Brings People Here

Almost nothing justifies entering the Sea of Sharks. Those who do have reasons:

- **Teku**: The city-state at the sea's heart is the only civilization here
- **Islands of Gold**: Treasure hunters heading south must cross the sharks
- **Smuggling**: Pursuit stops at the sea's edge; some criminals risk the sharks rather than face capture
- **Research**: Extremely brave (or foolish) scholars studying shark behavior, the sea's magical properties, or whatever lies beneath
- **Desperation**: Ships with no other options

## Shattered Sea

Tags: poi

A large ocean with thousands of islands dotting its entire area.

## Sheîr

Tags: state, nation

A sprawling island kingdom on the eastern edge of the Western Isles, where the Shattered Sea meets the Tarkhon coast. Home to the Bledreon Islanders—sailors with dual-lid eyes who've worked these waters for centuries.

### Position and Borders

Sheîr occupies the transitional zone between the Western Isles and Tarkhon:
- **East**: The Tarkhon coast and Sea of Merchants
- **West**: The Shattered Sea and Drifting Isles
- **North**: Phyndarr Sound, leading toward Knova
- **South**: Open water toward Istokos and the Dolphin Islands

The kingdom claims a small mainland strip (where the capital sits) plus dozens of islands spreading westward into the Shattered Sea. The boundary between "Sheîr islands" and "independent islands" is mostly theoretical—islanders acknowledge borders when convenient and ignore them otherwise.

### Terrain and Climate

**The Mainland Strip**

A narrow coastal territory running along the Tarkhon border. Rolling hills give way to rocky coastline. The capital city occupies the best natural harbor; smaller settlements dot the coast where fishing is good.

The climate is Mediterranean—warm, dry summers and mild winters. The mainland grows olives, grapes, and grain. It's more productive than most of Sheîr's territory.

**The Islands**

The islands vary wildly. Some are lush with timber and fresh water. Others are bare rock with nothing but seabirds. The larger islands support permanent communities; the smallest serve as fishing camps, hideouts, or navigational hazards.

Most islands are volcanic remnants—steep-sided with narrow beaches. The waters between them are treacherous, full of reefs and currents that the Bledreon know by heart and outsiders learn the hard way.

### Phyndarr Sound

The northern waters between Sheîr and the route to Knova. Phyndarr Sound is relatively calm compared to the Shattered Sea proper—wide enough for easy sailing, sheltered from the worst storms.

This makes the Sound a major trade route. Ships traveling between Tarkhon and the northern Western Isles pass through here. Sheîr collects tolls, offers pilots, and occasionally raids vessels that haven't paid proper respect.

### The Seat

Sheîr's capital city sits on the mainland coast, built around a natural harbor. Stone walls enclose the old city; newer districts sprawl along the waterfront and into the hills behind.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Driftwood Palace**: Royal residence, named for the throne carved from ancient ship timbers
- **The Raptor Pens**: Walled compounds where noble families breed and train their mounts
- **The Harbor Quarter**: Dense waterfront district where mainland trade meets island commerce
- **The Treaty Stone**: A ceremonial marker where the Ghost Treaty with the Neferati was signed

The Seat feels more Tarkhon than Western Isles—orderly streets, formal architecture, mainland customs. Island Bledreon visit for trade but rarely stay longer than necessary.

### The Inner Ring

The islands closest to the mainland, within a day's sail of the Seat. These islands are most influenced by capital politics—their elders attend court, their ships carry official cargoes, their communities acknowledge the king's authority (mostly).

**Notable Islands:**
- **Thornback**: Largest of the Inner Ring, with a proper town and shipyards
- **Salt Haven**: Major fishing center, supplies much of the capital's food
- **The Twins**: Two islands flanking the main approach to the Seat's harbor—heavily fortified

### The Drift

The central island clusters where traditional Bledreon culture survives strongest. Here the king is a distant concept, elders rule absolutely, and freedom means answering to no one you don't choose.

The Drift is hard to navigate for outsiders. Islands shift in fog and storm; the Bledreon know the waters, but charts are deliberately vague. This is both defense and privacy—the Drift's people don't want visitors.

**Notable Features:**
- **Elder Kresh's Hall**: Unofficial capital of the island faction, on an island whose name outsiders aren't told
- **The Gathering Rocks**: Natural amphitheater where island elders meet during disputes
- **Storm-Singer's Shrine**: Sacred site where Bledreon pray before dangerous voyages

### The Far Reach

The westernmost islands, barely connected to Sheîr's government at all. These communities acknowledge the king exists, pay no taxes, and handle their own affairs completely. Some are barely distinguishable from independent pirate havens.

The Far Reach borders the true Shattered Sea. Sailors here navigate waters where maps fail and magic interferes with compasses. Only the most experienced Bledreon captains operate this far out.

### The Dolphin Islands

Southwest of Sheîr proper, the Dolphin Islands are sacred to the triton. Thousands of dolphins breed in these warm, protected waters. Triton warriors come to bond with the dolphins they'll ride into battle.

The islands are strictly forbidden to surface vessels. Ships that enter without permission face the wrath of the entire triton nation. Sheîr enforces this prohibition—partly out of respect, partly because they can't afford to antagonize the triton.

### Navigation and Trade

Sheîr controls the eastern approach to the Western Isles. Ships traveling from Tarkhon to the Shattered Sea either pass through Sheîr's waters or take much longer routes.

This gives Sheîr significant leverage. They charge tolls, offer pilots for treacherous passages, and maintain the best charts of local waters. Captains who cooperate sail safely. Captains who don't... don't.

**Major Routes:**
- **The Merchant's Run**: From The Seat through Phyndarr Sound toward Knova and beyond
- **The Drift Passage**: Through the central islands—fast but dangerous without local guidance
- **The Southern Track**: Around Sheîr's islands toward Istokos and the Sea of Sharks

### What Brings People Here

- **Trade**: The Seat is the gateway between Tarkhon and the Western Isles
- **Ships**: Bledreon shipyards produce the best vessels in the region
- **Passage**: Pilots and charts for the Shattered Sea
- **Mercenaries**: Bledreon sailors and raptor cavalry for hire (at premium prices)
- **Smuggling**: The islands offer countless places to hide goods and ships

## Siren Islands

Tags: islands

The islands here are shear cliffs, and inhabiated by sirens who live in small caves within the cliffs. They can climb up the cliff-sides with their talons, and will sit in alcoves and sing to the sailors. Not only are the sirens dangerous (they'll eat you), but the cliffs themselves are treacherous, as huges swells come in and bash people against the rocks.

Only reason to come here is if you want to interact with the sirens, who know gaeic melodies.

## Stratlan Sea

Tags: sea, geography

The deep, empty waters west of the Western Isles—the edge of the known world. Beyond the Stratlan Sea lies nothing that any sailor has found and returned to report. Ships that venture too far west don't come back.

### Geography

The Stratlan Sea begins where the Western Isles end:
- **East**: The Shattered Sea, the Bynü Islands, the Cliffs of Shondromos
- **North**: The open waters beyond the Iron Sea
- **South**: Unknown
- **West**: Unknown

The transition from the Shattered Sea to the Stratlan is gradual—islands become sparser, depths increase, and eventually there's nothing but open water in every direction.

### The Edge of the World

Sailors call the Stratlan Sea the "edge of the world" because, practically speaking, it is. The furthest west anyone has sailed and returned is perhaps 500 miles into the Stratlan. Beyond that, nothing.

**What Explorers Report:**

- Increasingly empty water with no islands, reefs, or features
- Unusual weather patterns—storms that appear from nowhere, dead calms that last for days
- Compass irregularities that grow worse the further west you travel
- A growing sense of wrongness that affects crews psychologically

**What Explorers Don't Report:**

Anything beyond a certain distance. Ships that pass that threshold don't return. Whether they sink, are lost, or find something they can't escape, no one knows.

### Theories

Scholars and sailors have many theories about the Stratlan Sea:

**The Void**: The world simply ends somewhere out there. The Stratlan gives way to nothing—a boundary between existence and non-existence.

**The Far Shore**: Another continent lies beyond the Stratlan, but the distance is too great. Ships run out of supplies before reaching it.

**The Barrier**: Something prevents ships from proceeding—a magical ward, a planar boundary, or creatures that destroy intruders.

**The Trap**: Something in the Stratlan captures ships. They're not destroyed; they're taken somewhere. Where, no one can say.

**The Loop**: The Stratlan wraps back on itself. Ships that sail far enough west end up approaching from the east, but something in the crossing erases their memories—or their existence.

### The Waters

Near the Western Isles, the Stratlan is normal ocean—deep, cold, relatively lifeless compared to the teeming Shattered Sea. Further out:

**Depth**: The Stratlan is deep. Ships taking soundings have played out thousands of feet of line without touching bottom. Some scholars believe there is no bottom—the sea extends downward indefinitely.

**Currents**: Near the islands, currents flow predictably. Further out, they become erratic, sometimes reversing without explanation or carrying ships in circles.

**Life**: Sea life thins as you travel west. Eventually, nothing lives in the water at all—no fish, no plants, no creatures of any kind.

### Navigation

The Stratlan Sea defeats navigation:

**Celestial**: Stars appear different in the deep Stratlan—shifted positions, unfamiliar constellations. Celestial navigation becomes unreliable, then impossible.

**Magnetic**: Compasses behave erratically, spinning or pointing in directions that correspond to nothing.

**Dead Reckoning**: Without reliable references, dead reckoning accumulates errors rapidly. Ships lose track of their position within days.

### Who Sails Here

Most sailors avoid the Stratlan entirely. Those who venture in have reasons:

**Fishermen**: The edges of the Stratlan support different fish species than the Shattered Sea. Fishing boats work the boundary waters but don't go deep.

**Bynü Proximity**: The Xicrein twilight islands extend toward the Stratlan. Ships fleeing the Bynü sometimes end up in Stratlan waters by accident.

**Explorers**: Periodically, someone funds an expedition to discover what lies beyond. These expeditions don't return.

**The Desperate**: Ships fleeing pursuit sometimes take their chances with the Stratlan. Their pursuers don't follow.

### The Last Light

Sailors who've gone furthest into the Stratlan and returned describe "the Last Light"—a point where, looking back, the sun seems to dim. Beyond the Last Light, the sky darkens even at midday.

Whether this is optical phenomenon, magical effect, or proximity to whatever ends the known world, no one can say. Those who pass the Last Light don't come back to explain.

### What Brings People Here

Nothing should. The Stratlan Sea is empty, dangerous, and ultimately fatal to those who venture too deep. It exists as a boundary—the edge beyond which the world offers nothing but mystery and death.

## Teku

Tags: city, state, nation

A city-state on Survivor's Island, in the heart of the Sea of Sharks. Founded by people who couldn't leave, built by people who learned to thrive where nothing should survive.

### Position

Survivor's Island sits in the middle of the Sea of Sharks—those waters so infested with aggressive sharks that normal ships avoid them entirely. The island is equidistant from everywhere useful and accessible from nowhere safe.

- **North**: The central Shattered Sea, beyond the shark-infested waters
- **South**: The Islands of Gold and their walking stone creatures
- **East**: Distant Mueras and the Rimihuica coast
- **West**: The Ember Isles and deeper shark waters

Getting to Teku requires crossing some of the most dangerous ocean in Alaria. Getting away requires the same.

### The Sea of Sharks

The waters surrounding Survivor's Island are death for unprepared vessels. Sharks here grow larger and more aggressive as you approach the center. The smallest are merely dangerous; the largest can—and do—chew through wooden hulls to reach the crews inside.

No one knows why the sharks here are so aggressive, so large, or so numerous. Theories include magical contamination, breeding populations isolated for millennia, or something in the deep that drives them to feed constantly.

The Gruynmar's impenetrable ships can sail these waters safely, but even they avoid lingering. Anyone who falls overboard is dead within moments.

### How Teku Exists

The city exists because of desperation, adaptation, and spite.

**The Founding**: Centuries ago, a fleet of refugee ships fleeing some forgotten war was blown into the Sea of Sharks. Most were destroyed. The survivors—hundreds of people from a dozen cultures—washed up on the only significant island. They couldn't leave. The sharks made that clear when they destroyed the first escape attempts.

So they stayed. They adapted. They built a city on the one place the sharks couldn't reach, and they learned to live with the monsters swimming around them.

**The Adaptation**: Generations of Teku inhabitants have developed techniques for surviving shark waters:
- Ships with metal-reinforced hulls (expensive, heavy, effective)
- Poison and repellent compounds that discourage shark approach
- Trained shark-hunters who can kill the beasts before they kill you
- An intimate knowledge of shark behavior—when they feed, where they mass, how to move without triggering attack

**The Economy**: Teku survives by being the only stable settlement in the Sea of Sharks. Ships that need to cross—carrying goods between the Shattered Sea and the southern regions—stop at Teku for supplies, repairs, and guidance. The city charges premium rates because it can.

### The City

Teku is built into Survivor's Island's rocky interior, away from the shoreline that the sharks patrol. The harbor is an engineering marvel: a protected lagoon with underwater barriers that keep sharks out while allowing ships to enter through a maze-like channel.

**Population**: ~8,000 (fluctuates with trade seasons)

**Notable Features:**

- **The Barrier Harbor**: Metal grates and stone walls create a shark-free zone where ships can dock safely. The gates require precise timing to enter; mistakes mean sharks.

- **The High Town**: Built on the island's central hill, where the original survivors first camped. Now the wealthiest district, as far from the water as possible.

- **The Hunter's Quarter**: Where the shark-hunters live and train. These are Teku's elite—warriors who go into shark waters and come back alive.

- **The Salvage Markets**: Where goods recovered from wrecked ships are sold. Teku salvagers are experts at finding and retrieving cargo from shark-infested waters.

- **The Memorial**: A wall carved with the names of everyone who's died to sharks since the founding. It's very long.

### Government

Teku is ruled by the **Shark Council**—representatives from the founding families who've held power since the city's desperate early days. The Council manages the harbor, sets trade fees, and maintains the shark defenses.

**Current Council Head**: **Admiral Kess Ironhull**, a woman who's personally killed more sharks than anyone else alive. She earned her position through demonstrated competence in shark waters and maintains it through the same.

### The Shark Hunters

Teku's most respected profession. Shark-hunters venture into the surrounding waters in reinforced boats, armed with specialized weapons, to kill sharks before they threaten shipping or the harbor.

This isn't sport—it's survival. The shark population must be controlled, or the creatures would eventually breach the harbor defenses. Hunters are well-paid, well-honored, and frequently killed.

**Hunting Methods:**
- Harpoons and spears designed to penetrate shark hide
- Poison-tipped weapons that kill slowly but surely
- Bait traps that lure sharks into killing zones
- Diving hunters who attack from below (the most dangerous, most honored technique)

### The Crossing Trade

Most of Teku's wealth comes from ships that need to cross the Sea of Sharks. These vessels pay for:
- **Pilots**: Guides who know which routes are safest at which times
- **Escorts**: Armed ships that can drive off shark attacks
- **Supplies**: Fresh water, food, and shark repellent compounds
- **Repairs**: Reinforcing hulls against shark damage
- **Information**: Which shark masses are where, which routes are clear

The fees are enormous. The alternative is dying.

### The Islands of Gold Connection

South of Teku lie the Islands of Gold—rich in precious metals but inhabited by colossal stone creatures that hunt ships. Treasure hunters heading to the Islands stop at Teku for supplies and guidance; survivors return to sell their finds in Teku's markets.

This creates a steady flow of desperate, wealthy, and frequently dead adventurers through the city. Teku takes their money either way.

### What Brings People Here

- **Crossing**: Ships that must traverse the Sea of Sharks
- **Trade**: Goods moving between the Shattered Sea and southern regions
- **Treasure**: Adventurers heading to the Islands of Gold
- **Salvage**: Recovery of cargo from wrecked ships
- **Escape**: People who want to disappear somewhere no one will follow

## Tollgate

Tags: city, state, nation

A fortified city-state occupying a strategic island at the mouth of Phyndarr Sound—the self-proclaimed "Gatekeepers of the North." Tollgate charges tolls on ships passing between the Iron Sea and the Shattered Sea, and backs the claim with enough military force to make it stick.

### Position

Tollgate sits on a small, rocky island at the northern entrance to Phyndarr Sound:
- **North**: The Iron Sea and routes to Clueanda
- **South**: Phyndarr Sound, leading to the Shattered Sea
- **East**: The Cliffs of Syquindonos and the mainland coast
- **West**: Open water toward Migos

The island controls the bottleneck between the Iron Sea and everything south. Ships can bypass Tollgate, but the alternative routes add days of dangerous sailing.

### The Gatekeepers

Tollgate's inhabitants call themselves Gatekeepers, and they take the role seriously. For three centuries, they've collected tolls from ships passing through "their" waters and used the wealth to build fortifications that make their small island nearly unassailable.

**Population**: ~5,000

The population is almost entirely dedicated to three functions:
- **Collection**: Managing the toll system, inspecting cargoes, processing payments
- **Defense**: Maintaining the fortress and its garrison
- **Services**: Feeding, housing, and entertaining sailors who stop (or are stopped)

### The Toll System

Every ship passing through the northern approach to Phyndarr Sound owes Tollgate a toll. The rates are:
- Based on cargo value (assessed by Tollgate inspectors, who are notoriously generous to themselves)
- Higher for foreign vessels, lower for those with standing agreements
- Payable in coin, goods, or services

Ships that try to run the strait without paying are pursued by Tollgate's patrol vessels. Those caught face confiscation of cargo, imprisonment of crew, or worse. The Gatekeepers make examples of runners to discourage future attempts.

**The Protection Argument**: Tollgate claims the tolls fund defense of the strait against pirates. This is partially true—Tollgate does hunt pirates who threaten shipping. Critics note that Tollgate's definition of "piracy" conveniently excludes Tollgate's own forced toll collection.

### The Fortress

The island is essentially one massive fortification. Stone walls ring the harbor; towers command views in every direction; artillery positions can target any ship in range.

**Notable Features:**

- **The Gate Towers**: Paired fortifications at the harbor entrance that can close with chains and fire on anything approaching
- **The Toll House**: Where ships report, cargoes are assessed, and payments are processed
- **The Lookout**: Highest point on the island, with views across the northern approaches
- **The Garrison Quarters**: Housing for the soldiers who enforce Tollgate's claims

The fortress has never fallen to assault. Blockades have been attempted; Tollgate has enough stored supplies to outlast them.

### Government

Tollgate is ruled by the **Gatemaster**—a hereditary position that combines military command, tax authority, and judicial power.

**Current Gatemaster**: **Lord Brennan Toll**, whose family established Tollgate's toll system three centuries ago and has held power ever since. He's sixty-two, practical, and entirely focused on maintaining the revenue stream that keeps Tollgate powerful.

The Toll family name isn't coincidental—they took it when they established the gatekeeping system, and they've never let anyone forget it.

### The Navy

Tollgate maintains a small but effective patrol fleet:

**Size**: ~15 warships plus support vessels

The ships are built for speed and intimidation rather than extended combat. Their job is to catch runners, escort paying customers, and project force across the strait.

Tollgate's captains are experienced at pursuit and boarding. They train constantly because their livelihoods depend on maintaining the toll system.

### International Relations

Everyone hates Tollgate. Everyone also uses Tollgate's services.

**Sheîr** considers Tollgate an upstart competitor for strait control. They've proposed joint administration; Tollgate refuses to share.

**Iypos** maintains good relations—Tollgate sends toll revenue south for supplies, and Iypos appreciates a customer who pays reliably.

**Knova** tolerates Tollgate because disrupting the strait would hurt Knova's own trade. They've made clear that any attack on Tollgate shipping would invite response.

**Tarkhon** has threatened to "resolve the Tollgate problem" repeatedly. So far, the cost of conquering a fortified island has exceeded the benefit of eliminating the tolls.

### What Brings People Here

- **Necessity**: Ships traveling north-south pay the toll or take dangerous alternate routes
- **Services**: Tollgate offers resupply, repairs, and rest for those who've paid their way
- **Employment**: The Gatekeepers hire sailors, soldiers, and specialists
- **Negotiation**: Establishing standing agreements that reduce future toll rates
- **Espionage**: Various powers want intelligence on who's shipping what through the strait

## Vel Ithagas

Tags: poi, fortress

Home to the lich queen Sirinas. From here, she researches how to harness Gaeic melodies and use them for Deoric. How to turn the music of the world and bend it to darker purposes.

Soros, the island she's on, used to be home to the nation of Endoros, a country that highly valued music. They had some of the best bards in the world, and definitely the best instruments. The organ that resides in her palace is extremely magical.

In the north lies Songport, where the ruins of the old harbor lie. It has fallen into ruin, but it is the only place on the entire island that one could land a ship—everywhere else, underwater rocks sink ships, and horrible waves dash you on shore.

### Ithagas

An island of musical significance and dark ritual.

## Xibli Islands

Tags: archipelago, geography

A scattered archipelago east of the Aikon Tidal Islands, where the inhabitants have built their entire culture around competitive gift-giving. The Xibli don't trade—they give, and the giving creates debts that shape every relationship.

### Position

The Xibli Islands occupy waters between the Aikon Tidal Islands and the Sea of Merchants:
- **West**: The Aikon Tidal Islands
- **East**: The Sea of Merchants and the Tarkhon coast
- **South**: Sheîr's northern reaches
- **North**: Open water toward Phyndarr Sound

The islands are stable ground compared to their tidal neighbors—volcanic remnants with good harbors and reliable land.

### The Gift Economy

The Xibli don't buy or sell. They give.

This sounds generous until you understand how it works. Every gift creates a debt. Every debt must be repaid—with a greater gift. Failing to repay is social death. Repaying inadequately is humiliation. Repaying extravagantly establishes dominance.

**The Rules:**
- Accepting a gift creates obligation to give something greater in return
- The timing of repayment matters—too fast suggests eagerness, too slow suggests weakness
- The nature of the return gift must show understanding of what the giver values
- Refusing a gift is possible but creates different obligations

This system means the Xibli are constantly exchanging goods, services, and favors in an elaborate dance of competitive generosity. The wealthiest Xibli aren't those who have the most—they're those who've given the most and are owed the most in return.

### How Outsiders Fit In

Foreign merchants find the Xibli baffling. You can't just buy what you want—you have to enter the gift system.

**The Typical Pattern:**
1. A merchant arrives wanting to acquire something
2. A Xibli "gives" them what they want
3. The merchant is now obligated to give something greater in return
4. If they give appropriately, they've established a relationship; if not, they've been humiliated or exploited

Experienced traders learn to navigate this system. They bring gifts specifically calculated to create the right obligations. They accept gifts strategically, knowing what they'll need to give in return. Some merchants maintain complex ledgers tracking their gift-debts across multiple Xibli families.

### The Islands

The Xibli Islands comprise perhaps fifteen significant islands and many smaller ones. Each major island hosts one or more extended families, and interfamily gift-competition drives much of Xibli politics.

**Notable Islands:**

**Abundance**: The largest island, where the most powerful families maintain their compounds. Inter-family gift-wars here can reshape the archipelago's politics.

**The Giving Ground**: A neutral island where families meet to exchange gifts during formal ceremonies. Fighting here is forbidden; gift-giving is mandatory.

**Maker's Rest**: Where craftspeople produce the goods that flow through the gift economy. Artisans here are valued not for selling their work but for their ability to create worthy gifts.

**The Debtor's Refuge**: A small island where people who've failed in the gift system can live without obligation—but also without status. Social exile.

### The Festival of Obligations

Once each year, the Xibli hold a massive gathering where accumulated debts are settled, new obligations are created, and the social hierarchy is reshuffled. Families prepare for months, accumulating goods specifically for this event.

The Festival can make or break families. A brilliant series of gifts can elevate a minor house to prominence. A failed obligation can destroy generations of accumulated status.

Outsiders are invited—which means outsiders are obligated. Attending the Festival without understanding the gift system is extremely dangerous to one's social standing.

### Military Implications

The Xibli don't have a military in the conventional sense. They have obligations.

When threatened, families call on those who owe them. These debts might be repaid in warriors, ships, supplies, or shelter. A family with extensive gift-networks can raise substantial forces—not an army they command, but allies fulfilling obligations.

This makes Xibli politics complicated. Attacking one family might trigger obligations across the archipelago. Or it might not, if that family has failed to maintain their gift relationships.

### What Brings People Here

- **Unique Goods**: Xibli craftspeople produce items specifically designed to be impressive gifts—beautiful, valuable, memorable
- **Alliances**: Entering the gift system creates relationships that can be called upon later
- **Status**: Successfully navigating Xibli gift-culture earns respect across the Western Isles
- **Challenge**: Some merchants treat the Xibli as a game to master—can they profit within the gift system?
