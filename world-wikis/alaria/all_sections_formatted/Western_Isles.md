## Dragon's Teeth

Tags: island, geography

A group of islands in the Western Isles.

A region of more, treacherous terrain. Extremely sharp rocks made of obsidian stick up from the water, which can shred a boat, and definitely your body. Mysterious currents surround the area, and the Qorgath lives somewhere in its murky depths, guarding her hatch of Erzqin.

The Erzqin also patrol the waters, slaying and destroying those who dare to enter.

## Drifting Isles

Tags: archipelago

Islands that are literally adrift, carried on a combination of currents and magic. They are treacherous for sea captains, for some of these islands lie just beneath the surface as well. Only experienced captains sail through this region, using local knowledge, charts, and magic to navigate safely. 

They are home to the Swordsmen, a group of tribal, sword wielding experts who hold a connection with the sword fish of the sea.

## Sea of Sharks

Tags: sea

A large sea, dotted with uninhabitted islands. The ocean here is filled with extremely agressive sharks, of larger and larger size as you approach the center. Sailors avoid the sea, even from within their ships, as the sharks have been known to chew through wood to get to the crewmembers inside.

The Gruynmar ships are impenetrable to shark attacks, but they still avoid the waters, as anyone who would fall overboard is almost certainly shark food.

## Shattered Sea

Tags: poi

## Siren Islands

Tags: islands

The islands here are shear cliffs, and inhabiated by sirens who live in small caves within the cliffs. They can climb up the cliff-sides with their talons, and will sit in alcoves and sing to the sailors. Not only are the sirens dangerous (they'll eat you), but the cliffs themselves are treacherous, as huges swells come in and bash people against the rocks.

Only reason to come here is if you want to interact with the sirens, who know gaeic melodies.

## Vel Ithagas

Tags: poi, fortress

Home to the lich queen Sirinas. From here, she researches how to harness Gaeic melodies and use them for Deoric. How to turn the music of the world and bend it to darker purposes.

Soros, the island she's on, used to be home to the nation of Endoros, a country that highly valued music. They had some of the best bards in the world, and definitely the best instruments. The organ that resides in her palace is extremely magical.

In the north lies Songport, where the ruins of the old harbor lie. It has fallen into ruin, but it is the only place on the entire island that one could land a ship—everywhere else, underwater rocks sink ships, and horrible waves dash you on shore.

### Ithagas

An island of musical significance and dark ritual.
