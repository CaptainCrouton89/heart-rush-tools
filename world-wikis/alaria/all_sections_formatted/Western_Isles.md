# Western Isles

## Geography

The Western Isles occupy the waters between Clueanda to the north and Rimihuica to the south, marking the edge of the known world to the west. At its heart lies the Shattered Sea—a chaotic archipelago of hundreds of tiny islands, atolls, and shoals that makes navigation treacherous. The region serves as a buffer zone between the great continental powers, home to independent states, pirate havens, and mysterious island cultures.

### Surrounding Waters

- **Stratlan Sea**: The deep, empty ocean to the far west—the true edge of the known world
- **Western Sea**: The southwestern waters
- **Iron Sea**: Northern waters, between the islands and Clueanda
- **Sea of Merchants**: Eastern waters separating the islands from the Tarkhon Empire
- **Sea of Sharks**: Southern waters below the central archipelago
- **Solemn Sea**: Waters to the south of the Western Isles, home to Tyungula

### The Shattered Sea (Central)

The heart of the Western Isles is this chaotic archipelago—hundreds of distinct islands, atolls, and shoals packed into treacherous waters. Navigation here requires expert knowledge; the maze of islands has claimed countless ships.

### Northern Region

**Cliffs of Syquindonos**: A rugged coastline forming the northern edge of the island region, featuring dramatic cliffs.

**Kettle Bay**: A bay nestled into the northwest coast.

**Kinova**: A significant island territory in the northeast, marked by settlements.

**Iron Sea**: The body of water to the north, separating the Western Isles from the Westwilds of Clueanda.

### Central States

**Knova**: A state in the center of the region, one of the more established political entities in the Shattered Sea.

**White Oracle**: South of Knova and just north of the Dolphin Islands, in the heart of the Shattered Sea, dwells the White Oracle—an old priestess who speaks with the gods of time. People throughout the Shattered Sea seek her advice on matters great and small, for her counsel is said to be infallible. The Oracle grants guidance to those who can reach her remote location, though the journey itself often serves as a test of worthiness.

**Bynu Island Tribes**: West of Knova, a collection of tribal island communities.

**Pelican Isles**: East of the Bynu Island Tribes in the center of the Western Isles. These lush tropical islands are home to the Ansari—pelican-riding gnomes who live in scattered hut communities across the archipelago. The islands feature stunning natural beauty: stone arches, coral reefs teeming with fish, and forests of trees bearing brilliantly colored feathers that the Ansari trade.

Despite their rich resources—including undiscovered mineral deposits and gems—the Pelican Isles are fiercely isolationist. Past exploitation attempts by outsiders forced the Ansari to defend themselves violently, and they now shoot arrows at any approaching ships. Visitors are almost never seen again. The gnomes govern themselves through local shamans and wise-men rather than any centralized authority, maintaining their independence through lethal force and strategic isolation.

**Siren Islands**: Northwest of the Bynu Island Tribes, notorious islands with their namesake dangers.

**Murmuring Isles**: Due west of the Plains of Oblivion in the Shattered Sea, the Murmuring Isles are home to sirens and are exceedingly dangerous. The constant sound of haunting songs drifts across the waters surrounding these islands, luring ships to their doom. Those who hear the sirens' music find themselves helplessly drawn to the rocky shores, where their vessels are dashed to pieces. The isles are avoided by all experienced sailors, and stories of their dangers are told in every port across the Western Isles.

**Whisper Isles**: West of the Murmuring Isles in the northern Western Isles, south of Migos (where Iypos is located), lie the Whisper Isles—islands enchanted to be permanently silent. No sound can be made here; oaths cannot be cast, and communication through sound is impossible. The islands serve as a sanctum from Deoric magic (which requires spoken oaths).

The Whisper Isles are home to the ruins of Thergon, a city that was destroyed by the Pity Knights, a group of lich hunters. The city had been corrupted by Therguros, an ancient lich, so the Pity Knights arrived and destroyed everything—including many innocent people. They then used those innocent deaths to create a permanent silence, preventing all further Deoric magic from being cast here by silencing the entire area.

Now the islands harbor leftover artifacts of the lich and an old city of undead. Thergon was once famous for its coral and oyster jewelry relating to beauty and emotions, and remnants of this craft can still be found among the silent ruins.

### Eastern Shore (Tarkhon Frontier)

The eastern edge of the Western Isles meets the westernmost holdings of the Tarkhon Empire:

- **Sheîr**: A Tarkhon state jutting westward into the Shattered Sea
- **Dolphin Islands**: West of Sheîr in the Shattered Sea, these islands are sacred to the triton people. Thousands of dolphins travel here annually to breed in the warm, protected waters. Triton come to these breeding grounds to find the dolphins they will bond with and ride into battle—a sacred tradition that has lasted millennia. All ships are strictly forbidden from entering these waters; those who ignore the ban face the wrath of the entire triton nation.
- **Kabir**: Northeastern Tarkhon territory
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: South of Gissemari

These represent the southwestern frontier of the Tarkhon Empire.

### Southern Region

**Stokos**: A state south of the Sea of Merchants.

**Sea of Sharks**: The waters between Stokos and the Ember Isles, notorious for their dangers.

**Islands of Gold**: The southernmost archipelago still technically part of the Western Isles, positioned just north of the Seacleft Coast and due west of Mueras. Located south of the Sea of Sharks and southwest of Stokos. These islands are inhabited by colossal stone creatures that walk the seafloor—unable to swim, but massive enough that the rocky spires protruding from their backs rise above the waterline. These creatures roam the depths hunting ships, using their stone backs as reefs to snare and sink vessels before devouring the crews. Despite the extreme danger, the islands and surrounding waters are rich with gold deposits, drawing foolhardy treasure hunters.

**Ember Isles**: A cluster of islands in the southwest, shrouded in white mist—likely volcanic activity or magical fog. These islands glow with an inner heat.

### Connection to Neighboring Regions

- **North**: The Westwilds of Clueanda lie beyond the Iron Sea
- **Northeast**: The Plains of Oblivion (part of the Westwilds, north of Tarkhon)
- **East**: The Tarkhon Empire's western frontier
- **Southeast**: The coast of Rimihuica (Mueras visible on the eastern horizon)

## Notable Locations

### The Stratlan Sea

The deep, empty ocean to the far west—the true edge of the known world. The Stratlan Sea (also known as the northern region of the Solemn Sea) extends beyond the Western Isles into waters that few ships dare to explore. Most who venture too far into the Stratlan never return, lost to storms, sea monsters, or simply the crushing vastness of the empty ocean.

#### Lonely Island

Far out in the reaches of the Stratlan Sea, west and southwest of the Western Isles, sits a barren rock known as Lonely Island. No vegetation grows here, no ships call at its shores, and the island appears on no maps. It is a place of exile and despair.

##### Ognarad's Cave

Within a sea cave on Lonely Island lives Ognarad, a cyclops of extraordinary talent and bitter temperament. Ognarad was tricked long ago and cursed to remain bound to this desolate island, unable to leave by any means. His isolation has driven him half-mad, but his skills as a craftsman remain unmatched—he can forge weapons, armor, and magical items of incredible quality.

Ognarad will craft anything for anyone who can find a way to break his curse and free him from Lonely Island. Many have tried; all have failed. The cyclops grows more desperate and more dangerous with each passing year, his cave filled with masterwork items he has forged from salvaged shipwrecks, waiting for the hero who can finally grant him escape.

A region of more, treacherous terrain. Extremely sharp rocks made of obsidian stick up from the water, which can shred a boat, and definitely your body. Mysterious currents surround the area, and the Qorgath lives somewhere in its murky depths, guarding her hatch of Erzqin.

The Erzqin also patrol the waters, slaying and destroying those who dare to enter.

## Drifting Isles

Tags: archipelago

Islands that are literally adrift, carried on a combination of currents and magic. They are treacherous for sea captains, for some of these islands lie just beneath the surface as well. Only experienced captains sail through this region, using local knowledge, charts, and magic to navigate safely. 

They are home to the Swordsmen, a group of tribal, sword wielding experts who hold a connection with the sword fish of the sea.

## Sea of Sharks

Tags: sea

A large sea, dotted with uninhabitted islands. The ocean here is filled with extremely agressive sharks, of larger and larger size as you approach the center. Sailors avoid the sea, even from within their ships, as the sharks have been known to chew through wood to get to the crewmembers inside.

The Gruynmar ships are impenetrable to shark attacks, but they still avoid the waters, as anyone who would fall overboard is almost certainly shark food.

## Siren Islands

Tags: islands

The islands here are shear cliffs, and inhabiated by sirens who live in small caves within the cliffs. They can climb up the cliff-sides with their talons, and will sit in alcoves and sing to the sailors. Not only are the sirens dangerous (they'll eat you), but the cliffs themselves are treacherous, as huges swells come in and bash people against the rocks.

Only reason to come here is if you want to interact with the sirens, who know gaeic melodies.

Home to the lich queen Sirinas. From here, she researches how to harness Gaeic melodies and use them for Deoric. How to turn the music of the world and bend it to darker purposes.

Soros, the island she's on, used to be home to the nation of Endoros, a country that highly valued music. They had some of the best bards in the world, and definitely the best instruments. The organ that resides in her palace is extremely magical.

In the north lies Songport, where the ruins of the old harbor lie. It has fallen into ruin, but it is the only place on the entire island that one could land a ship—everywhere else, underwater rocks sink ships, and horrible waves dash you on shore.

### Ithagas

An island of musical significance and dark ritual.
