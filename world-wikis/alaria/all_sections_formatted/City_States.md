## Blackport

Tags: citystate, greenwater-isles, pirates, nyolci

A pirate haven on Crab Island in the Agreben Sea, named for the black lavarock bluffs that surround the harbor. What began as a convenient trading stop has grown into a notorious city-state where pirates operate freely under the protection of a retired corsair king.

### Overview

Blackport sprawls across a volcanic hillside, buildings stacked atop one another in haphazard layers rising from the harbor to the island's interior. The black lavarock that gives the city its name creates a dramatic backdrop—dark cliffs streaked with mineral veins, the stone still warm in places from the volcanic activity beneath.

The city serves two populations: legitimate traders from Mueras heading south who need a convenient resupply point, and the pirates who've made Blackport their sanctuary. Both coexist uneasily, their mutual need for the port's services creating an enforced peace within the city walls.

### Government

**Government Type**: Autocracy (the Blackport Baron)

**Ruler**: Bridger Blindeyes, retired Nyolci pirate captain

Bridger Blindeyes controls Blackport absolutely. A Savant—one of the magically gifted who face brutal discrimination in Mueras—he rose to infamy as a pirate captain before retiring to build something more lasting. He took the port, eliminated rivals, and established the simple rule that has made Blackport functional: no violence in the harbor, or you answer to him.

The "Blindeyes" epithet comes from his condition—magical sight that sees things others cannot, paired with mundane blindness. He knows what happens in his city through means that unsettle visitors. Those who've tried to move against him have discovered that his apparent blindness conceals something far more dangerous.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Primary Function**: Port services, pirate haven, grey market trade

Blackport produces nothing. Its economy runs on services: ship repair, resupply, crew hiring, information brokering, and asking no questions. Pirates spend their plunder here. Merchants pay premium prices for safe harbor. Smugglers find willing buyers for goods that can't be sold elsewhere.

The grey market thrives. Stolen cargo is laundered through Blackport merchants, emerging as "legitimately acquired" goods that can be sold in ports that wouldn't accept pirate plunder directly. This service makes Blackport valuable to criminals across the Agreben Sea—and makes enemies of everyone whose goods pass through.

### Relations

**Mueras**: Complicated hatred. Bridger despises Mueras for its treatment of Savants, and he doesn't particularly care that Mueran ships are being destroyed by pirates harboring in his port. Some say he actively encourages attacks on Mueran vessels. The merchant-kings of Mueras would love to see Blackport burned, but the logistics of attacking a volcanic island defended by pirates have stayed their hand.

**Iques**: Hostile. Iques is dealing with trade disruptions caused by pirates believed to operate from Blackport. Diplomatic protests have been ignored; military action is under discussion.

**Pirates**: Protective alliance. The various pirate crews operating in the Agreben Sea treat Blackport as neutral ground. Feuds are suspended within the harbor. Bridger enforces this peace brutally—he needs the pirates spending money, not killing each other.

**Legitimate Traders**: Grudging tolerance. Many merchants hate dealing with Blackport but have no practical alternative for the southern routes. The harbor services are excellent, the prices are fair, and as long as you don't ask questions about the ship anchored next to yours, business proceeds smoothly.

### Military

**Size**: Small but effective

Blackport maintains no formal military. Defense relies on Bridger's personal crew of veterans, the volcanic terrain that makes assault costly, and the implicit threat that attacking Blackport means fighting every pirate crew that shelters there.

The pirates themselves serve as an informal defense force. An attack on Blackport threatens their sanctuary—they'd fight to protect it, at least until they could establish a replacement.

### Culture

Blackport attracts outcasts, criminals, and those who've run out of options elsewhere. The population skews heavily Nyolci—Bridger's own people, drawn by the promise of a port that doesn't discriminate against them. But you'll find every race in Blackport, united by their willingness to overlook each other's pasts.

The city has developed its own code of conduct: pay your debts, don't start fights in the harbor, and never inform on fellow residents to outside authorities. Violations are handled by Bridger's enforcers, usually permanently.

### Notable Locations

**The Black Bluffs**: The volcanic cliffs surrounding the harbor, riddled with caves used for storage, hidden moorings, and less savory purposes.

**The Baron's House**: Bridger's residence overlooking the harbor. He holds court here, settling disputes and receiving visitors who seek his protection or services.

**The Stacks**: The densely packed residential district climbing the hillside. Buildings lean against each other, connected by bridges, ladders, and precarious walkways.

### Player Hooks

- A character's stolen property has been traced to Blackport's grey market
- Mueras or Iques might hire adventurers to disrupt pirate operations without direct military involvement
- Bridger Blindeyes possesses information about something the party needs
- A Savant NPC has fled to Blackport seeking Bridger's protection from Mueran persecution
- The pirates are organizing for something unusual—what are they planning?

## Blvnird

Tags: citystate, dwarves, first-brotherhood, westrim

One of the three leadership city-states of the First Brotherhood—the ancient dwarven coalition formed when the world was far more dangerous. Along with Üod and Melaia, Blvnird's citizens hold the exclusive right to lead the Brotherhood.

### Overview

Blvnird is a dwarven city-state in Westrim, likely in the Eronia Range that separates the region from the Tarkhon Empire. The city serves as a trading partner for Kura's northern city of Labakh, connecting the desert kingdom to the First Brotherhood's economic networks.

### Government

The city is governed according to First Brotherhood traditions. Only citizens of Üod, Blvnird, or Melaia may hold leadership positions in the Brotherhood's councils. This exclusivity has been a source of tension with dwarven settlements elsewhere, who pay membership fees to a union they can never truly lead.

### Relations

**Tarkhon Empire**: Tributary but influential. The First Brotherhood's relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they accept imperial authority nominally while maintaining independent diplomatic relationships with dwarven communities worldwide.

**Üod and Melaia**: Sister cities. The three leadership city-states coordinate on Brotherhood policy and present a united front to outside powers.

**Kura**: The desert kingdom of Kura trades with Blvnird through the city of Labakh, exchanging desert goods for dwarven metalwork and mountain resources.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: The Brotherhood claims to represent all dwarves, but not all dwarves agree. Some view the First Brotherhood as a relic institution more interested in collecting fees than serving dwarven interests.

### Economy

Blvnird's economy centers on metalwork, mining, and trade with the desert kingdoms to the south. The city's position in the Eronia Range makes it a natural gateway between the mountain-dwelling dwarves and the peoples of Westrim.

## Iypos

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Merchant oligarchy (Harbor Council)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Mixed humans, Vethrani mountain folk (trading presence)

**Population**: ~15,000 in the city; ~20,000 Vethrani in the mountains (not under city authority)

**Stability**: Stable (aggressive neutrality maintains balance)

**Core Values**: Trade, neutrality, independence, pragmatism

Iypos is a city-state built on geographic necessity. It controls the only significant harbor on Migos—the largest island in the northern Western Isles—and profits from everyone who passes through.

The city maintains careful independence from regional powers. Harbor Master Theodras Vane has spent eighteen years being useful to everyone and committed to no one. Iypos trades with Sheîr, Knova, Tarkhon, and whoever else brings goods. They take no sides in conflicts that might disrupt commerce.

The mountains above the city belong to the Vethrani—fierce highland clans who've never been conquered. Iypos doesn't claim authority over them. They trade with them, defend the coast that protects the whole island, and generally leave each other alone. This arrangement works because both sides benefit.

### Economy

**Size**: Medium

**Tech**: Standard

**Primary Exports**: Mountain products (herbs, furs, minerals), maritime services, brokered trade goods

**Primary Imports**: Grain, manufactured goods, luxury items, raw materials

Iypos's economy runs on location. Ships traveling between the Iron Sea and the Shattered Sea stop here for supplies, repairs, and rest. The harbor charges fees; merchants sell goods; everyone profits.

The Vethrani contribute unique mountain products that Iypos processes and exports. This creates economic interdependence—the city needs the mountains' goods, and the mountains need the city's market access.

### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Adequate for local defense

**Enrollment**: Professional militia (~800)

Iypos maintains a city militia focused on harbor defense and keeping order. They couldn't fight a major war and don't intend to.

The real defense is the mountains. Any invader who takes the harbor still has to deal with the Vethrani—and no one has managed that in recorded history.

### Geography

**Location**: Southeastern Migos, on Harbor Bay

**Biomes**: Coastal city at mountain base

**Climate**: Temperate maritime coast, brutal mountains above

**Named Features**: Harbor Bay, Mount Iypos, the Terrace Markets

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Iypos (the only significant settlement on Migos's coast)

### The Harbor Council

Seven merchant families control the Council, which controls the city. Seats are technically purchased, practically inherited, and occasionally contested through violence.

**Current Harbor Master**: **Theodras Vane**, whose family has held the position for three generations. He's kept power by being marginally more competent and marginally less corrupt than alternatives.

The Council manages:
- Harbor access and fees
- Trade agreements
- The city militia
- Relations with the Vethrani (carefully maintained)

### The Vethrani Question

The mountain folk aren't citizens of Iypos. They're neighbors with a mutually beneficial arrangement.

The Vethrani govern themselves through clan structures, maintain their own territory, and could overwhelm the city if they chose. They don't choose because Iypos is useful—a market for their goods, a buffer against outside powers, a source of lowland products they can't make themselves.

When external threats appear, the Vethrani defend the whole island. When external threats disappear, they go back to ignoring the coast. This works. Changing it would be catastrophic for everyone.

### Primary Conflicts

**External Pressure**

Sheîr wants Iypos as a vassal. Knova wants mountain training grounds. Various powers want preferential trade arrangements. Harbor Master Theodras refuses everyone equally, maintaining independence through consistent non-commitment.

**Vethrani Tensions**

The arrangement with the mountain folk holds, but it's not guaranteed. Some Vethrani clans want to expand coastal influence. Some city merchants want to claim mountain territory. The Temple of the Mountain mediates, but peace requires constant maintenance.

**Succession**

Theodras is aging. His likely successors are less skilled at the diplomatic balancing act that keeps Iypos independent. The next Harbor Master might make mistakes that invite exactly the intervention the city has avoided.

### Notable Figures

**Theodras Vane** — Harbor Master for eighteen years. A merchant prince who's kept Iypos independent through pragmatic neutrality. Aging, increasingly worried about what happens after him.

**High Priest Kavan** — Leader of the Temple of the Mountain. The only person with diplomatic immunity in both city and Vethrani territory. Uses this position to mediate disputes.

**Clan-Chief Dhorgal** — Leader of the largest Vethrani clan. Respects the arrangement with Iypos but could change his mind if provoked.

### History

**The Founding**: Iypos was established as a trading post centuries ago, when someone realized Migos's harbor was the only good anchorage for hundreds of miles.

**The Vethrani Wars**: Early attempts to claim the mountains failed catastrophically. The current arrangement emerged from that failure—cooperation rather than conquest.

**The Present**: Iypos at equilibrium. Profitable, independent, carefully balanced between powers who would absorb it if they could.

## Lacire

Tags: state, westwilds, human

A city-state of roughly fifteen thousand people built on the Springs of Vyowehr, deep within Ierya at the heart of the Walking Forest. Lacire is unique among human settlements: an entire city that communicates in silence.

### Overview

Lacire exists because its people have learned to live without speech. The Grayls—wooden humanoids who dwell throughout the Walking Forest—find mortal voices physically painful. Early settlers who spoke were driven out or worse. The survivors developed Stillspeech, an elaborate sign language, and over generations built a culture around the absence of voice.

The city sprawls across the springs and surrounding forest floor, its architecture organic and flowing—buildings that curve around massive roots, integrate fallen branches, and use stone from the springs' pools. No sharp angles, no hard edges; the aesthetic minimizes echo and sound reflection.

### Government

Lacire is governed by the Council of Hands—a body of twelve elders chosen for their wisdom in Stillspeech, their understanding of the Compact (the ancient bargain with the Grayls), and their ability to navigate the complex relationships between the city and the forest.

The Council rules by consensus, which is slower than autocracy but suits Lacirean temperament. Debates happen in formal signing chambers where every citizen can watch and participate through gesture. Major decisions can take weeks.

A Keeper of the Compact serves as the Council's spiritual advisor, responsible for maintaining the relationship with the Grayls and leading the generational pilgrimage to Ierya's heart.

### Culture

**Silence:** The defining trait. Speaking above a whisper within city limits is forbidden. Lacireans communicate through Stillspeech, written notes, and a vocabulary of gestures so sophisticated it can convey poetry, philosophy, and insult. Children learn to sign before they walk.

**Sound Discipline:** Lacireans minimize all sound, not just speech. They walk softly, handle objects carefully, build with sound-dampening materials. This creates a city that feels almost dreamlike to visitors—activity everywhere, but nearly silent.

**Music:** Not forbidden, but transformed. Lacirean music is percussion-only: drums, which the Grayls tolerate. Rhythms carry emotion and meaning; a skilled drummer can make listeners weep without a single melodic note.

**Patience:** Lacireans have absorbed something of the Grayls' character. They move deliberately, think slowly, plan for generations. Visitors often find them frustratingly unhurried.

### Economy

Lacire survives on three precious commodities:

**Spring Water:** The Waters of Vyowehr have genuine healing properties. Carefully controlled export ensures the springs are never depleted and prices remain high.

**Grayl-Amber:** Hardened sap from the Walking Forest's trees, occasionally purchased directly from Grayls. Valuable for enchanting and alchemy.

**Guidance:** Anyone crossing the Walking Forest needs a Lacirean guide. They know which paths are passable this season, which groves to avoid, how to navigate a forest that doesn't stay still. Essential and expensive.

### Military

Lacire doesn't need conventional defenses. The city's walls are modest; its militia is small. The Walking Forest itself is the defense.

Hostile forces entering the forest find paths closing, landmarks shifting, the trees themselves seeming to watch. Those who come with violence rarely find Lacire at all. The few who have reached the walls discovered the Grayls waiting—slow, patient, implacable defenders who fight like nothing else.

### Relations

**The Walking Forest:** The defining relationship. Lacire exists at the Grayls' sufferance, maintained by the Compact. The relationship is respectful, careful, and not entirely understood by either side.

**Jüt:** Primary trading partner. Lacirean caravans make the long journey to the coast regularly, carrying spring water and amber. The route through Tenekee Woods is arduous but well-established.

**Outsiders:** Lacireans are hospitable but alien to most visitors. The silence is oppressive at first; the sign language takes years to learn properly; the patience can feel like obstruction.

### The Compact

The ancient bargain with the Grayls, known only in fragments:

- No fire larger than a candle within Ierya (cooking uses geothermal vents)
- No cutting of living wood (construction uses only deadfall and stone)
- The springs must remain open to all who come in peace
- Once per generation, a pilgrimage reaffirms the agreement

In exchange, Ierya doesn't shift around Lacire. The city exists in a pocket of stability within the ever-moving forest.

### Notable Locations

**The Springs of Vyowehr:** Sacred pools at the city's heart, their waters cold and clear with subtle magical properties.

**The Grayl Market:** Outside the walls, where Grayls occasionally come to trade. Transactions take days; the results are worth fortunes.

**The Signing Hall:** Where the Council of Hands meets, built in a natural amphitheater where hundreds can watch debates conducted entirely in gesture.

### Player Hooks

- Seek healing at the Springs of Vyowehr
- Hire a guide for the Walking Forest crossing
- Learn Stillspeech—the language opens doors across the Westwilds
- Investigate a breach of the Compact that threatens Lacire's existence
- Participate in the generational pilgrimage to Ierya's heart
- Trade with the Grayls for materials available nowhere else

## Maun

Tags: citystate

A dwarven city-state on the southern coast of SW Urok, where the Maun River empties into Beauty Bay. Maun is home to the most famous school of music and theater in Alaria—an institution that has trained generations of bards, performers, and composers. But unlike most conservatories, Maun demands more than artistic talent from its students. Everyone who enters the School must spend a year fighting in the tunnels below.

### Overview

Maun is a city of sound. Music drifts from every quarter at every hour—students practicing scales, masters demonstrating techniques, street performers competing for coins, orchestras rehearsing for evening concerts. The buildings themselves seem designed to carry and enhance music; acoustic engineering is as important as structural engineering here, and the finest concert halls are considered architectural masterpieces.

The city sprawls along both banks of the Maun River, connected by bridges of increasing architectural ambition. The oldest bridges are functional stone; the newest are elaborate constructions that incorporate wind chimes, resonating chambers, and materials chosen specifically for how they ring when struck. Walking across a Maun bridge is meant to be a musical experience.

The School of Music dominates the city's eastern bank—a complex of practice halls, performance spaces, instrument workshops, and dormitories that houses thousands of students at any given time. Admission is competitive but not expensive; Maun wants talent, not wealth, and scholarships are common for promising applicants. The real cost comes later.

### The Requirement

Every student who enters the School of Music must serve one year in the military.

This is non-negotiable. No exceptions for nobles, no exemptions for prodigies, no alternatives for pacifists. You can serve before your studies, during them, or after graduation—but you will serve, or you will not study at Maun.

The service isn't ceremonial. Students spend their year in the tunnels beneath the Pearly Mountains, fighting the things that rise from the depths. The Shattered Court—ancient dwarven nobles transformed into hungry revenants—is drawn toward beauty, and Maun's music summons them more powerfully than anything except Wisgarrd's finest gems. Someone has to fight them back.

The military year is brutal. Students train for three months above ground, learning to fight in close quarters with weapons that don't require much space to wield—short swords, hammers, crossbows. Then they descend. For nine months, they patrol the tunnels, man the defensive positions, and respond when something breaks through. Casualties vary year to year; bad years see one in five students die or suffer permanent injury. Good years, only one in twenty.

Survivors emerge changed. They've seen things no musician should have to see, done things no performer should have to do. Many find that their art deepens—pain and survival giving their music an emotional weight it previously lacked. Others break, unable to reconcile their experiences with their aspirations. The School offers no counseling; Maun's philosophy holds that true art requires suffering, and the tunnels provide.

### The School of Music

Despite its military requirement—or perhaps because of it—the School of Music produces the finest performers in Alaria. Its graduates are sought by royal courts, theatrical troupes, and wealthy patrons across the continent. A Maun-trained bard commands respect wherever they go.

The curriculum is comprehensive. Students study theory and composition, master at least one instrument, train in vocal performance, learn theatrical technique, and develop their own artistic voice. The faculty includes legendary performers who could have their pick of positions anywhere in the world but choose to teach at Maun because they believe in its mission.

Instruction is divided into three tracks:

**Performance** focuses on technical mastery and stage presence. Students learn to captivate audiences, to project emotion through music, to make a thousand-seat hall feel intimate. Performance graduates become soloists, orchestra leads, and celebrity entertainers.

**Composition** emphasizes creation over execution. Students learn to write music in every style, to orchestrate for any combination of instruments, to craft songs that will outlive their creators. Composition graduates become court composers, theatrical songwriters, and preservers of musical tradition.

**Craft** teaches instrument-making. Students learn to build everything from simple drums to complex pipe organs, using materials both mundane and magical. The finest instruments in Alaria come from Maun's workshops, and Craft graduates can name their price for commissions.

### The Yearly Competition

Each year, the School holds a competition open to all students. The details vary—some years emphasize composition, others performance, others innovation—but the prize is always the same: a magical instrument of extraordinary power.

These instruments are created by the School's master craftsmen, incorporating techniques passed down through generations and materials gathered from across Alaria. Past prizes have included a flute that charms any creature that hears it, a drum that can shatter stone, and a harp whose music heals wounds. Winning the competition is the fastest path to fame and fortune for any Maun student.

The competition is fierce and occasionally deadly. Sabotage happens; students have been known to poison rivals, destroy instruments, or arrange "accidents" in the tunnels. The School officially discourages such behavior but does little to prevent it. Competition, they argue, produces excellence.

### The Ghost

Something haunts the School's halls.

Students report encountering a figure in old-fashioned clothing who offers advice, encouragement, and occasionally harsh criticism of their work. The Ghost—as students call it—appears most often to those struggling with their art or their military service. Its advice is invariably useful; those who follow it tend to improve dramatically.

No one knows who the Ghost was in life. The most popular theory holds it was one of the School's founders, unable to leave the institution even in death. Others suggest it's a former student who died in the tunnels and returned to guide future generations. A minority view claims the Ghost isn't a ghost at all but a living person who's found a way to move unseen through the School's corridors.

The faculty refuses to discuss the Ghost officially. Unofficially, most have encountered it at least once. Several credit it with saving their lives during their own military service.

### The Martial Tradition

Maun's military isn't just a requirement—it's a culture. The School celebrates its warrior-musicians, maintains memorials to students who died in the tunnels, and incorporates martial themes into its curriculum. Battle songs are as respected as love ballads; percussion students learn to play drums that can coordinate troop movements; graduates often serve as military musicians in armies across Alaria.

This tradition connects to something older. Some scholars believe Maun was founded by students of the Order of the Falling Leaf—the warrior-monks whose spirits now guard Shenchen Forest. The Order's philosophy held that martial discipline and artistic excellence were two expressions of the same underlying principle. Maun seems to agree.

The connection is speculative but suggestive. Maun's fighting techniques share elements with what's known of Falling Leaf styles. The School's emphasis on precision, on finding beauty in violence, on transcending the self through performance—all echo the Order's teachings. Whether the connection is historical or coincidental remains debated.

### Beauty Bay

The bay where Maun meets the sea has earned its name. The mineral-rich waters—runoff from Tyberoskos's limestone sinkholes—create sunsets of impossible color, oranges and purples that painters struggle to reproduce. Maun has embraced this gift; the School holds outdoor performances in a natural amphitheater on the eastern shore, timing finales to coincide with the sunset's peak.

The bay also provides Maun's connection to the wider world. Ships arrive carrying would-be students from across Alaria and depart bearing graduates, instruments, and the city's famous theatrical costumes. The harbor district is the one part of Maun where music competes with commerce—the bustle of trade drowning out even the most determined street performer.

The same minerals that color the sunset make the bay's water unsuitable for drinking but perfect for certain dye-making processes. Maun's costumes are famous partly for colors that can't be reproduced elsewhere. Theatrical troupes pay premium prices for authentic Maun dyes, and the secret recipes are guarded as jealously as any musical technique.

### Relations with Wisgarrd

Maun and Wisgarrd need each other and hate that they do.

The relationship is simple: Wisgarrd pays, Maun fights. The jewelry school's extraordinary tuition provides the gold that funds Maun's military—weapons, armor, supplies, veteran salaries, compensation for families of the fallen. Without that money, Maun couldn't maintain the force necessary to hold the tunnels. Without Maun's force, Wisgarrd would be overrun within months.

The cultural tension is less simple. Wisgarrd's jewelers consider themselves the true artists—patient craftsmen who create works of lasting beauty, not performers chasing applause. Maun's musicians consider themselves the true artists—people who bare their souls before audiences, not technicians polishing rocks. Each city mocks the other's pretensions; each city secretly envies what the other does well.

Officially, relations are cordial. A standing committee coordinates military operations, negotiates funding levels, and resolves disputes. Unofficially, students from both schools have been known to brawl when they encounter each other, and romances between Maun and Wisgarrd citizens carry the same frisson as forbidden love affairs.

The greatest art, everyone admits, comes from collaboration between the two cities. A Wisgarrd gem set in a Maun instrument creates something neither could produce alone. Such collaborations are regulated carefully—they attract the Shattered Court more powerfully than anything—but when they work, the results are legendary.

### Government

Maun is governed by the **Chorus**—a council of twelve masters representing different aspects of the School. Four represent the three academic tracks plus the instrument workshops; four represent the military; four are elected by alumni to represent the broader community's interests.

The Chorus makes decisions by consensus when possible, by majority vote when necessary. The system is slow but ensures all perspectives are heard. Critics argue Maun is too conservative, too resistant to change; defenders argue that tradition is precisely what makes the School excellent.

Below the Chorus, the city operates through a web of guilds, associations, and committees that would confuse any outsider. The important thing to understand is that everyone answers to the School. There is no separate civic government; Maun is the School, and the School is Maun.

### Player Hooks

- **The Silent Song**: A student has discovered a technique for making music that doesn't resonate into the tunnels—sound that the Shattered Court can't hear. If perfected, it could revolutionize Maun's relationship with the deep. But the student has disappeared, and her notes are missing.

- **Tunnel Collapse**: Something has blocked the main defensive tunnel, trapping a patrol on the wrong side. Rescue is possible but dangerous—the route requires passing through territory held by the Court, and time is running out.

- **The Competition**: A student needs protection during the yearly competition. Someone is eliminating rivals, and they're next on the list. The saboteur's identity is unknown, but they're skilled, ruthless, and connected enough to operate freely within the School.

- **Ghost Hunt**: A scholar from Xi Chin wants to study the Ghost—to determine what it is, who it was, and whether it poses any danger to the School. The Chorus has reluctantly agreed to allow the investigation. The Ghost, however, seems to have opinions about being studied.

- **The Falling Leaf Connection**: Evidence has surfaced suggesting that Maun's founders came from the Order of the Falling Leaf—and that they brought something with them from Shenchen Forest. Something the Order was supposed to destroy. Whatever it is, it's been hidden in the School for centuries, and someone is looking for it.

## Melaia

Tags: citystate, dwarves, first-brotherhood

One of the three leadership city-states of the First Brotherhood—the ancient dwarven coalition formed when the world was far more dangerous. Along with Üod and Blvnird, Melaia's citizens hold the exclusive right to lead the Brotherhood.

### Overview

Melaia is a dwarven city-state, one of the three seats of First Brotherhood power. The city maintains a complex relationship with the Tarkhon Empire—technically tributary, but exercising influence over dwarves across the world through its position in the Brotherhood.

### Government

The city is governed according to First Brotherhood traditions. Only citizens of Üod, Blvnird, or Melaia may hold leadership positions in the Brotherhood's councils. This exclusivity has been a source of tension with dwarven settlements elsewhere, who pay membership fees to a union they can never truly lead.

### Relations

**Tarkhon Empire**: Tributary but influential. The First Brotherhood's relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they accept imperial authority nominally while maintaining independent diplomatic relationships with dwarven communities worldwide.

**Üod and Blvnird**: Sister cities. The three leadership city-states coordinate on Brotherhood policy and present a united front to outside powers.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: The Brotherhood claims to represent all dwarves, but not all dwarves agree. Some view the First Brotherhood as a relic institution more interested in collecting fees than serving dwarven interests.

### Economy

Melaia's economy centers on metalwork, mining, and the administration of First Brotherhood affairs. The city charges membership fees to dwarven communities worldwide, funding Brotherhood operations and maintaining the city's prosperity.

## Rilyn

Tags: state, splinkreen

A city-state of the Splinkreen — the tree-souled people who dwell in Puma Wood on Petrona Septia Island. Rilyn is less a political entity than a community that happens to occupy the same forest, its "governance" emerging from consensus among beings who've had centuries to learn patience.

The Splinkreen are the legacy of an ancient wizard's experiment, their souls transplanted from mighty trees into humanoid forms. They move through their forest home with eerie calm, speaking in slow deliberate tones, showing little concern for their own mortality. Death, they believe, is simply returning to the earth that birthed them.

### Government

Rilyn has no formal government — no council, no leader, no laws in the conventional sense. Decisions emerge through discussion that can take weeks or months, as the Splinkreen consider all perspectives and gradually reach consensus. Urgent matters are handled by whoever happens to be present and willing; long-term matters are handled by everyone, eventually.

This works because the Splinkreen share fundamental values and have centuries to resolve disagreements. It fails when dealing with outsiders who expect decisions in hours rather than seasons. Visitors to Rilyn learn quickly that "we will consider your proposal" means something very different from Splinkreen than from humans.

The closest thing to authorities are the eldest Splinkreen — those who've lived longest and accumulated the most wisdom. Their opinions carry weight not through any formal position but through respect earned over centuries. When an elder speaks, others listen. They still take their time about acting.

### The Splinkreen

The inhabitants of Rilyn share certain characteristics: bark-like skin ranging from smooth birch white to rough oak brown, a tendency to sprout small leaves or moss in places of rest, and a perspective shaped by their origin as trees.

They're not emotionless — they feel joy, sorrow, affection, anger — but they feel these things slowly, deliberately, without the urgency that characterizes shorter-lived peoples. A Splinkreen grieving a death might mourn for a decade, but the grief is genuine. A Splinkreen celebrating a birth might celebrate for years. Time moves differently when you expect to live three centuries.

Their relationship with death is particularly unusual. The Splinkreen view dying as transformation rather than ending — a return to the earth from which they emerged. They don't seek death, but they don't fear it either. This makes them disconcertingly willing to sacrifice themselves for causes they deem worthy, and equally willing to accept losses that would devastate other communities.

### Economy

Rilyn's economy is minimal by outsider standards. The Splinkreen need little — they don't eat much (some claim they photosynthesize, though this may be exaggeration), don't require elaborate shelter, don't accumulate possessions. What trade exists involves forest products, craftwork, and the occasional service as guides through Puma Wood or the Screech Peaks.

The Splinkreen produce nothing in quantity and see no reason to start. They have what they need; more would require effort that could be spent on contemplation. Merchants who visit Rilyn hoping to establish trade relationships usually leave disappointed. The Splinkreen are happy to trade; they're just not interested in trading much.

### Culture

Life in Rilyn centers on the forest and the community. The Splinkreen spend their long lives in contemplation, conversation, and the slow cultivation of wisdom. They create art — intricate woodwork, woven tapestries, songs that take hours to perform — but creation is a process to be savored rather than a goal to be achieved.

They remember being trees. Not clearly, not in detail, but as a deep awareness of what it meant to stand in one place for centuries, growing slowly, feeling the seasons pass. This memory shapes everything about them — their patience, their rootedness, their acceptance of time's passage.

Outsiders often find Rilyn peaceful but unsettling. The Splinkreen's calm acceptance of mortality, their indifference to urgency, their willingness to let matters resolve themselves over decades — these qualities feel alien to those accustomed to human timeframes. Some visitors find enlightenment in Rilyn's pace. Others find it maddening.

### Relations

**With Ios**: The Splinkreen observe Ios's decline with philosophical interest. A civilization built on artificial servants, now forced to rediscover labor — it's the sort of irony the Splinkreen appreciate. Some have traveled to Todakres to study the stone dolls, curious about the animation techniques and what they might reveal about the nature of transferred souls.

**With Moigos**: The Kappa and the Splinkreen have nothing to offer each other. The toad-folk deal in debts, urgency, and leverage; the Splinkreen have no debts, feel no urgency, and cannot be leveraged. The two peoples exist in parallel without interaction.

**With the wider world**: Rilyn receives occasional visitors and maintains correct relations with distant powers. The Splinkreen don't seek isolation, but they don't seek connection either. They're content in their forest, engaged with the world when the world comes to them, otherwise focused on their own long contemplations.

### Notable Locations

- **Rilyn (city)**: The arboreal city built among the trees of Puma Wood
- **Puma Wood**: The old-growth forest that contains and defines the city-state
- **The Eastern Traverse**: Mountain pass through the Screech Peaks, maintained by Splinkreen guides

### Player Hooks

- **The Patient Teacher**: A Splinkreen elder offers to teach something valuable — a skill, a secret, a piece of wisdom. The catch: the teaching will take months, conducted at Splinkreen pace. Is the knowledge worth the time?

- **Ancient Memory**: A Splinkreen claims to remember something from their time as a tree — something they witnessed centuries ago, something relevant to current events. But tree-memories are fragmentary and strange. Interpreting what they saw requires patience and lateral thinking.

- **The Willing Sacrifice**: The Splinkreen have decided that a particular cause is worth dying for, and they're prepared to do exactly that. Their allies must decide whether to accept this aid or try to find another way.

## Sweivyon

Tags: city-state, dragons-spine-coast, silver-slopes, mining

A city-state of approximately twelve thousand souls perched in the Silver Slopes, controlling the richest silver deposits in the southern Dragon's Spine. Sweivyon is younger than most city-states—founded only four centuries ago by prospectors who struck a vein so pure it changed the region's economics—but it has accumulated wealth faster than many older polities accumulate history.

The city occupies a naturally defensible position: a broad shelf of relatively flat terrain between two peaks, accessible only by a handful of passes that ice over in winter. The founders chose the location for the silver underneath it; the defensive advantages were a fortunate bonus they've since learned to exploit.

Sweivyon smells like money. The refineries run constantly, producing the characteristic sulfurous tang of silver processing. The markets display wealth openly—jewelry, fine metalwork, imported luxuries. The architecture trends toward ostentation, with even modest houses sporting silver-inlaid doors and windows. Visitors either find it impressive or vulgar, depending on their background.

### Government

**The Silver Council** governs Sweivyon—eleven seats divided among the founding families, the major guild representatives, and two rotating positions elected by property owners. The council elects a Warden from among its members to handle executive functions, but real power lies with the controlling families who vote as blocs.

The current Warden is **Helkos Varn**, a third-generation mining magnate who built his family's position by consolidating smaller claims during a price collapse forty years ago. He's competent, ruthless about competitors, and generous with civic improvements that happen to benefit his properties. Most citizens consider him acceptable. His enemies consider him inevitable.

Below the council, governance is largely guild-based. The Miners' Compact regulates extraction rights and safety standards. The Refiners' Guild controls processing and quality certification. The Merchants' Assembly manages trade and external relations. These organizations handle daily administration while the council focuses on policy and patronage.

### Economy

Silver dominates everything. The city extracts, processes, certifies, and exports silver in quantities that influence markets across southern Alaria. The famous "slope silver" commands premium prices for its purity, and the Sweivyon stamp has become a guarantee of quality that competitors can't easily replicate.

The **Sunbeam Catchment**—a system of sluices and settling pools along the upper river—captures mineral runoff that would otherwise wash down to the strait. This operation employs hundreds and produces a significant fraction of city income, while also limiting opportunities for independent prospectors downstream.

Secondary industries have grown around the silver trade: jewelry-making, assaying, banking, security services. Sweivyon hosts the only reliable banking house in the southern Dragon's Spine, and its letters of credit are accepted throughout the region.

Trade flows primarily through **Glintwater**, a settlement at the mouth of the Sunbeam River that serves as Sweivyon's de facto port. A portage road connects the navigable lower river to the city proper. Overland trade reaches Gondurak through mountain passes and the Dalizi lowlands through longer routes that skirt the Miramar region.

### Culture

Sweivyon's culture is transactional. Wealth is respected, poverty is pitied, and everyone is always calculating. Social status correlates directly with property holdings, and the founding families maintain elaborate records of who owns what. A prospector who strikes rich can rise to council-adjacent status within a generation; a family that loses its claims can fall just as fast.

The **Assay Festival** occurs twice yearly, when the refineries announce their production totals and the council sets tax rates. It's part civic celebration, part anxious speculation, and part excuse for the wealthy to display new acquisitions. The streets fill with silver-themed decorations, and even the poorest residents wear something shiny.

Religion is practical—shrines to various daemons of commerce and craft dot the city, and citizens make offerings based on what they need rather than theological conviction. The most popular shrine honors **Rodton**, daemon of deals and bargains, whose priests serve as informal arbitrators for disputes the guilds can't resolve.

### Defenses

Sweivyon's military capacity is modest. The city maintains a professional guard of roughly four hundred, adequate for keeping order and patrolling the passes but not for fighting a war. The mountain geography provides natural protection—the passes can be held by small forces, and the winter closures give the city months of effective isolation.

The real defense is economic. Sweivyon trades with everyone and threatens no one. Gondurak values the silver supply. The Dalizi value the trade route. Even Kanzekill, far to the west, has no interest in a city that doesn't interfere with her hunt. Sweivyon survives by being useful to everyone and dangerous to no one.

This strategy has limits. If a power decided Sweivyon's wealth was worth taking, the city couldn't resist alone. The council quietly maintains contingency agreements with Gondurak for military support, though the terms have never been tested.

### Relations

**Gondurak** is Sweivyon's most important trading partner. Fengruk metalworkers turn slope silver into finished goods of exceptional quality, and the trade benefits both parties. Relations are cordial but not warm—the Fengruk consider Sweivyon nouveau riche, and Sweivyon considers the Fengruk insufferably traditional.

**The Splinter Villages** of the Shrapnel Strait theoretically acknowledge Sweivyon's authority, though enforcement is minimal. The city claims tariff rights on strait trade and occasionally sends inspectors, but the villagers largely govern themselves. The relationship works because neither side pushes too hard.

**Glintwater** and the glitter-panners present ongoing friction. The river-mouth prospectors resent the catchment system that limits their take, and conflicts over water rights occasionally turn violent. Sweivyon's position is that the upstream owners control what reaches downstream; the panners' position is less legal and more visceral.

**The Miramar region** and its dragon problems are kept at careful distance. Sweivyon doesn't trade with Kanzekill's territory, doesn't discuss Mountainveil, and doesn't ask questions about refugees who arrive from the west. The city has no interest in drawing dragon attention.

### Notable Features

**The Stamp House** certifies all silver exports, applying the famous Sweivyon brand that guarantees purity. The building is heavily fortified and rumored to contain the largest silver reserve in the region—a claim the council neither confirms nor denies.

**The Varn Spire** rises from the city's highest point, a tower of silver-inlaid stone that the current Warden's family built as a monument to their success. It serves no practical purpose beyond demonstrating that the Varns can afford a monument that serves no practical purpose.

**The Lower Slopes** house the working population—miners, refiners, laborers—in densely-packed neighborhoods that contrast sharply with the upper city's ostentation. Conditions are adequate but not generous, and labor organizers occasionally attempt to improve terms. These efforts rarely succeed; the council has experience containing unrest.

**The Prospectors' Quarter** accommodates the constant stream of fortune-seekers who arrive hoping to stake claims in the Silver Slopes. It's rough, transient, and dangerous after dark, but it's also where new wealth enters the city before climbing to respectability.

### Hooks

**The Claim War**: Two founding families dispute a boundary in the deep mines, where a newly-discovered vein runs exactly along the legal division. Both sides are hiring—surveyors, lawyers, thugs, and anyone who might tip the balance.

**The Catchment Sabotage**: Someone is damaging the Sunbeam Catchment system, allowing silver-rich runoff to reach the glitter-panners below. The council wants the saboteur found quietly; the panners want them protected; someone is getting very rich.

**The Gondurak Offer**: A Fengruk delegation has arrived with an unusual proposal: joint operations in mines that cross into both territories. The deal would be lucrative but would tie Sweivyon's economy even more closely to its larger neighbor. Not everyone considers this wise.

**The Dragon Question**: A scholar claims to have evidence that Kanzekill's true name once passed through Sweivyon—that the refugees who built Mountainveil sold something in the city before vanishing into the mountains. The council wants this rumor suppressed before it reaches the wrong ears.

## Tollgate

Tags: state

### Government & Peoples

**Government Type**: Hereditary autocracy (the Gatemaster)

**Primary Inhabitants**: Humans (the Gatekeepers)

**Population**: ~5,000

**Stability**: Very stable (wealth and fortifications maintain control)

**Core Values**: Control, collection, self-sufficiency, the toll

Tollgate is a city-state built on one principle: whoever controls the strait controls the wealth flowing through it. For three centuries, the Toll family has held that control, charging every ship that passes through Phyndarr Sound's northern entrance.

The inhabitants call themselves Gatekeepers, and they take the role seriously. The entire population is dedicated to three functions: collecting tolls, defending the fortress, and providing services to ships that have paid their way. There is no agriculture, no manufacturing beyond what's needed for the fleet—Tollgate exists to collect.

### Economy

**Size**: Small (but wealthy per capita)

**Tech**: Standard, specialized in fortifications and patrol vessels

**Primary Exports**: Nothing (Tollgate produces nothing)

**Primary Imports**: Everything (food, materials, goods—all purchased with toll revenue)

Tollgate's economy is the toll. Ships pay based on cargo value; Tollgate uses the revenue to import everything the island needs. The system has made the Toll family enormously wealthy and created a population entirely dependent on maintaining the collection system.

Secondary income comes from services: repairs, resupply, and entertainment for sailors who've stopped (voluntarily or otherwise).

### Military

**Size**: Small but effective

**Quality**: Excellent at pursuit and boarding

**Enrollment**: Professional (~1,500 soldiers and sailors)

Tollgate maintains a garrison for fortress defense and a patrol fleet for toll enforcement. The patrol vessels are built for speed; their captains are experts at pursuit and boarding.

The fortress itself is the primary defense. Stone walls, artillery positions, and chokepoints make the island nearly impossible to assault. Blockades have been tried; Tollgate's stored supplies outlast them.

### Geography

**Location**: Northern entrance to Phyndarr Sound

**Biomes**: Rocky island, heavily fortified

**Climate**: Temperate maritime

**Named Features**: The Gate Towers, the Toll House, the Lookout

### Political Geography

**Capital**: Tollgate (the only settlement on the island)

### The Toll Family

The Toll family has ruled Tollgate for three centuries, since the first Gatemaster established the toll system. The name wasn't original—they took it when they claimed the strait, and it's been their identity ever since.

**Current Gatemaster**: **Lord Brennan Toll**, age sixty-two. Practical, focused entirely on maintaining revenue, with no ambitions beyond holding what his family built.

Succession passes within the family, usually to the most competent candidate. "Most competent" is determined by the current Gatemaster, creating occasional succession disputes that are resolved quietly and sometimes violently.

### Primary Conflicts

**Universal Resentment**

Everyone who uses the strait hates paying Tollgate's tolls. Sheîr, Tarkhon, Knova—they've all considered eliminating the problem. So far, the cost of conquering a fortified island has exceeded the benefit of eliminating the tolls.

**Bypass Attempts**

Ships try to run the strait without paying. Tollgate's patrol fleet exists to catch them. The chase-and-capture game is constant, and Tollgate wins more often than not.

**Sheîr Competition**

Sheîr controls the eastern shore of Phyndarr Sound and considers Tollgate an upstart competitor. They've proposed joint administration; Tollgate refuses to share.

### Notable Figures

**Lord Brennan Toll** — Gatemaster for twenty-eight years. A practical man focused entirely on maintaining the system his ancestors built.

**Captain Vess Ironchain** — Commander of the patrol fleet. The best pursuit captain in the Western Isles, responsible for catching more toll-runners than anyone else alive.

**Steward Mira Toll** — Lord Brennan's niece and likely successor. More ambitious than her uncle; she's been quietly building relationships with powers who might support Tollgate's expansion.

### History

**The Founding** (~300 years ago): The first Toll established a checkpoint at the strait's narrowest point and began collecting from ships that passed. Early resistance was crushed; the toll became established.

**The Fortress Era**: Revenue funded fortification. Each generation expanded the walls, added towers, improved the harbor. Tollgate became nearly impregnable.

**The Present**: Tollgate at its height—wealthy, fortified, hated by everyone who pays and protected by the value of the trade route they control.

## Wisgarrd

Tags: citystate

A dwarven city-state built into the foothills where the Pearly Mountains descend toward the southern coast of SW Urok. Wisgarrd is home to the most prestigious school of jewelry-making in Alaria—an institution that has produced master craftsmen for over a thousand years and guards secrets of magical enchantment that nobles would kill to possess.

But Wisgarrd exists for a darker reason than artistry. The city was built to fund a war that never ends—a war against something that lives beneath the mountains and hungers for beauty.

### Overview

From the outside, Wisgarrd appears prosperous and serene. The city cascades down the hillside in terraces of pale stone, workshops and residences nestled among gardens where the famous peonies bloom. The School of Jewelry dominates the upper terraces—a complex of workshops, libraries, and demonstration halls where students spend years learning to cut gems with supernatural precision.

The tuition is extraordinary. A single year costs what a skilled craftsman earns in a decade. Nobles across Alaria pay it gladly, sending their personal jewelers to learn techniques that can't be found anywhere else. The wealthiest students gain access to the Inner School, where masters teach the secrets of binding magic into metal and stone—creating jewelry that doesn't just display wealth but confers power.

What the students don't know—what visitors never learn—is where the money goes.

### The Shattered Court

Beneath the Pearly Mountains lies a vast cavern system carved over millennia by underground rivers. The caverns are not empty. Something lives there—many somethings—that were once the ruling class of an Uline Dwarven kingdom that predated Wisgarrd, Maun, and perhaps Xi Chin itself.

When that kingdom fell—to invasion, to civil war, to causes now forgotten—the nobles refused to accept death. Through rituals that modern scholars can barely comprehend, they bound themselves to the stone itself, becoming something between ghost and golem. Their bodies crumbled. Their minds fragmented. But their hunger remained.

The Shattered Court, as they're called, still holds session in the deepest chambers. Noble houses that haven't existed for two thousand years still compete for status among the ruins of their underground palaces. They remember being patrons of the arts—remember loving beautiful music, collecting exquisite gems, hosting celebrations where the finest craftsmen displayed their work.

They still want those things. The wanting has become all they are.

### The Resonance

The caverns beneath Wisgarrd and Maun *resonate*. Sound carries strangely through the tunnels, amplified and transformed. A song performed in Maun might echo through miles of stone, reaching chambers where the Shattered Court waits. A gem cut in Wisgarrd, when light strikes it, sends reflections rippling through crystal formations that connect to the deep places.

The Court responds. When something beautiful enough reaches them—a masterwork composition, a perfectly cut diamond, a performance of transcendent skill—they rise. They climb through tunnels toward the surface, drawn by the beauty they crave. They want to witness it. They want to possess it. They want to consume the artists who created it.

This is the curse that Maun and Wisgarrd live with: the better they become at their arts, the more monsters they attract.

A mediocre jewelry student poses no danger. A master whose work achieves perfection might trigger an incursion that costs dozens of lives. The greatest artists of both cities have learned to work in cycles—producing their finest pieces only when the defenses are ready, then retreating to lesser work while the Court subsides.

### The Arrangement

Wisgarrd and Maun hate each other. The jewelry-makers consider the musicians pretentious dreamers; the musicians consider the jewelers mercenary snobs. They've feuded for centuries over prestige, students, and which art is more essential to civilization.

But they need each other to survive.

Wisgarrd has wealth. The tuition from noble patrons fills its coffers year after year. What it lacks is warriors—gem-cutters don't make effective soldiers, and the city's guards are barely adequate for peacetime duties.

Maun has warriors. The School of Music requires every student to serve a year in the military, fighting in the tunnels beneath the mountains. Generations of martial tradition have produced soldiers who know the underground terrain, who've faced the Shattered Court, who understand how to fight things that are already dead.

The arrangement is simple: Wisgarrd's gold pays for Maun's army. Maun's army protects both cities from what rises below. Neither city could survive without the other, which only makes them resent the dependency more.

### The School of Jewelry

The School occupies Wisgarrd's highest terrace, its workshops oriented to catch the best natural light. Students begin with fundamentals—metallurgy, gem identification, basic cutting techniques—and progress over years to increasingly sophisticated work. Competition is fierce; only the top students advance to each subsequent level.

The curriculum is divided into the Outer School and the Inner School.

**The Outer School** teaches technical mastery. A graduate can cut gems with supernatural precision, design settings that enhance a stone's natural beauty, and create jewelry that wealthy patrons will treasure for generations. This is what most students come for, and it's enough to justify the extraordinary tuition.

**The Inner School** teaches magic. Only students personally selected by the faculty—those who demonstrate not just technical skill but what the masters call "resonance"—are invited to continue. Here, they learn to bind enchantments into their creations: rings that protect their wearers, amulets that enhance specific abilities, gems that store magical energy for later release.

The Inner School's deepest secrets are recorded in the **Book of Gems**, an ancient text kept in the library's most secure vault. The book supposedly contains techniques for creating artifacts of genuine power—items that rival the work of legendary artificers. Access is granted only to the most trusted masters, and even they are forbidden from copying its contents.

### The Peonie River

The Peonie flows past Wisgarrd's walls, its banks carpeted with the flowering plants that give the river its name. The blooms—pink, white, and occasionally a deep crimson—have inspired Wisgarrd's jewelers for centuries. Peonie motifs appear in the oldest and most traditional designs, and graduating students traditionally receive a brooch in the peonie pattern.

But the flowers serve another purpose. Something in their scent—or perhaps in the mineral content of the water that feeds them—seems to dampen the resonance effect. During the blooming season, incursions from below decrease noticeably. Some scholars theorize the original founders planted the peonies deliberately, knowing their properties; others think it's coincidence. Either way, Wisgarrd guards its riverbanks carefully, and damaging the peonie fields is a capital offense.

### Culture

Wisgarrd values precision, patience, and discretion. Loud displays of emotion are considered vulgar; residents communicate through subtle gestures and carefully chosen words. The city's architecture reflects this restraint—beautiful but understated, designed to showcase the jewelry its citizens create rather than compete with it.

The contrast with Maun couldn't be sharper. Where Maun fills its streets with music at all hours, Wisgarrd maintains a studied quiet. Where Maun celebrates performers as heroes, Wisgarrd's master jewelers work in anonymity—their pieces speak for themselves. The rivalry between cities often manifests as cultural snobbery: Wisgarrd dismisses Maun as attention-seeking noise, while Maun mocks Wisgarrd as cold and emotionally stunted.

Despite the animosity, students from both schools sometimes collaborate. A Wisgarrd gem set in a Maun instrument creates something neither city could produce alone—and attracts the Shattered Court more powerfully than anything else. Such collaborations are regulated carefully, permitted only when the military is prepared for what they might summon.

### Government

Wisgarrd is governed by the **Gemcutters' Council**, composed of the school's senior masters. The Council controls both the city and the school, making no distinction between civic and academic authority. All citizens are either students, faculty, or support staff; there is no separate merchant class or nobility.

The Council's primary concerns are maintaining the school's reputation, managing the flow of tuition money, and—above all—coordinating with Maun's military for defense. A standing committee meets weekly with Maun's commanders to plan patrol schedules, discuss threat assessments, and argue about whose fault the latest incursion was.

### Player Hooks

- **The Perfect Piece**: A master jeweler believes she can create something that will satisfy the Shattered Court permanently—a gem so beautiful that they'll retreat to their depths and stay there. She needs rare materials from dangerous places, and she needs someone to protect her while she works. If she's wrong, her masterpiece might trigger the worst incursion in centuries.

- **The Book of Gems**: Someone has stolen pages from the Book of Gems. The Council wants them recovered before the thief can use the knowledge—or sell it to competitors. The trail leads through both Wisgarrd and Maun, suggesting the thief knows both cities well.

- **Resonance Sickness**: Some students develop "resonance sickness"—an attunement to the caverns below that lets them sense when the Court is stirring. The condition is useful for early warning but devastating to the afflicted; most go mad within years. A student with the sickness wants to find a cure before it's too late.

- **The Old Alliance**: Before Wisgarrd and Maun, before the Shattered Court, another kingdom ruled these mountains. Records suggest they had a way to control or pacify the Court—a technique lost when the kingdom fell. Someone needs to explore the deep tunnels, find the old archives, and learn what the ancients knew.

## Zor

Tags: city-state, wycendeula, eyendra, dragon-pact

A city-state of roughly 15,000 souls on the western shore of Moornik Bay, Zor is the only permanent settlement in the vast Eyendra forest. It exists because a dragon permits it, and eight centuries of survival have taught its people that some bargains are worth keeping.

Zor turns its back on the forest. The city faces the sea—economically, culturally, psychologically. The forest behind them is not wilderness to be tamed but a presence to be acknowledged and carefully avoided. Every citizen grows up knowing the rules: extract only from the permitted zones, disturb no ruins, never enter the interior without cause. The penalty for breaking these rules is not execution by the council. It's simply vanishing, and no one asks too many questions about those who do.

### The Dragon Pact

Zor's existence is predicated on an agreement with Ezra Olkanis, an ancient dragon who dwells in the Eyendra interior. The pact was made eight centuries ago with a fishing village that eventually grew into the current city. Every generation, the ruling council formally reaffirms the terms:

**Zor must not disturb the interior.** Certain ruins are forbidden. Certain lakes—particularly in the Wer Azenzi region—must never be approached. The boundaries shift over decades as the dragon sends word through channels the council doesn't discuss publicly.

**Zor must report what it observes.** Changes in the forest, unusual activity, strangers asking questions. The dragon wants eyes on her borders.

**The dragon may demand service.** Guides, supplies, artifacts, occasionally people with particular skills. Those summoned to the interior usually return.

**Zor may take from the forest's edge.** A strip roughly twenty miles deep along the coast is open for extraction—timber, herbs, game. Beyond that boundary, permission ends.

In exchange, Zor survives. Whether the dragon actively protects the city or merely refrains from destroying it is a theological debate. Pragmatists note the distinction is academic.

### Government

Five hereditary families rule Zor—descendants of those who negotiated the original pact. Power rotates on a complex schedule, with one family holding the Speakership (executive authority) for fifteen years. The system is stable but rigid. Reform movements exist but rarely gain traction; most citizens prefer a functioning arrangement to an exciting collapse.

The current Speaker is **Maera Theln**, a practical woman in her sixties known for cautious competence rather than vision.

Below the council, guilds manage daily governance: the Foresters' Guild (extraction rights), the Fishers' Guild (harbor control), the Archive scholars, and various lesser organizations. The guilds defer to the council on anything touching the pact.

### Economy

Maritime and extractive. Zor exports Eyendra timber (prized for shipbuilding), forest herbs (some enhanced by proximity to whatever the forest has become), and preserved fish. It imports grain, metal goods, and lumber from outside the forest for buildings where Eyendra wood might be unreliable.

Trade happens by sea. Overland routes exist but are rarely used—the journey through the coastal fringe is uncomfortable, and the risk of accidentally crossing boundaries deters most merchants.

### Culture

Zor's people are practical, superstitious, and acutely aware of their precarious position. The first thing visitors notice is the quiet—conversations tend toward the hushed, as if everyone is instinctively avoiding the forest's attention.

The Telling shapes civic life—a ritual Zor developed (not demanded by the dragon) to ensure everyone understands the dangers that surround them. Children learn what happens to those who cross boundaries before they learn to fish. The midsummer Telling lasts three days. It's survival education disguised as civic ceremony.

The dragon is acknowledged in ways that blur the line between respect and worship. Oaths are sworn on her name. When something goes well, people say she permitted it. When something goes wrong, people check whether anyone broke the pact.

### Relations

Zor trades with other Wycendeula coastal settlements but maintains no close alliances. The city is too isolated, too specialized, too strange. Merchants welcome Zor's timber and herbs; they're less comfortable with Zor's culture.

The dragon is not technically a diplomatic entity, but she might as well be. Anything that threatens Zor risks drawing her attention, which means Zor has enjoyed remarkable security for a city its size. No one has seriously attempted to conquer it since the pact was established.

### Threats

**The Rationalists**: A merchant faction arguing the dragon is dead, gone, or exaggerated. They want to explore the interior and exploit resources beyond the current boundaries. Their numbers grow when trade is poor.

**Resource Pressure**: Zor's population has grown but the extraction zones haven't. Demand is outpacing sustainable supply. Eventually someone will cross a boundary.

**The Interior Dreams**: People in Zor sometimes dream of the forest—walking paths they've never seen, seeing faces that feel familiar. The frequency seems to be increasing.

## Üod

Tags: citystate, dwarves, first-brotherhood

One of the three leadership city-states of the First Brotherhood—the ancient dwarven coalition formed when the world was far more dangerous. Along with Blvnird and Melaia, Üod's citizens hold the exclusive right to lead the Brotherhood.

### Overview

Üod is a dwarven city-state in the Eronia Range, the mountain barrier forming Tarkhon's southern boundary. The city maintains a complex relationship with the Tarkhon Empire—technically tributary, but exercising influence over dwarves across the world through its position in the First Brotherhood.

### Government

The city is governed according to First Brotherhood traditions. Only citizens of Üod, Blvnird, or Melaia may hold leadership positions in the Brotherhood's councils. This exclusivity has been a source of tension with dwarven settlements elsewhere, who pay membership fees to a union they can never truly lead.

### Relations

**Tarkhon Empire**: Tributary but influential. The First Brotherhood's relationship with Tarkhon is complex—they accept imperial authority nominally while maintaining independent diplomatic relationships with dwarven communities worldwide.

**Blvnird and Melaia**: Sister cities. The three leadership city-states coordinate on Brotherhood policy and present a united front to outside powers.

**Other Dwarven Nations**: The Brotherhood claims to represent all dwarves, but not all dwarves agree. Some view the First Brotherhood as a relic institution more interested in collecting fees than serving dwarven interests.

### Economy

Üod's economy centers on metalwork, mining, and the administration of First Brotherhood affairs. The city charges membership fees to dwarven communities worldwide, funding Brotherhood operations and maintaining the city's prosperity.
