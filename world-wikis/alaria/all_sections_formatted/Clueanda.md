# Clueanda

Clueanda forms the frozen crown of northwestern Alaria. Twin mountain ranges define it: the east-west Nysanna Range hugging the polar edge, and the diagonal Kharvorn Mountains that sweep down toward the temperate Middle Sea. Between them lie the polar Northlands, the windswept Celedrim Plains, and countless fjords and glacial valleys. South of the Kharvorn range the climate softens enough to support bustling Middle Sea trade cities and the arid Westwilds coastline that faces the Tarkhon Strait.

## Featured Regions

- **Northlands** – Arctic tundra beneath the Nysanna Range.
- **Celedrim Plains** – Frozen steppes north of the Kharvorn Mountains.
- **Kharvorn Mountains** – The diagonal range dividing polar wastes from civilized southlands.
- **Middle Sea** – Temperate coasts and inland waters dotted with city-states.
- **Westwilds** – Scrublands and cursed plains along the southern coast.
- **Frostmarch Peninsula** – The eastern land bridge toward the Northern Isles.
- **Northern Isles** – An archipelago of icebound islands in the Ocean of Azeros.

## Middle Sea

### Geography

The Middle Sea is a large body of water lying south of the Kharvorn Mountains, in the temperate heart of Clueanda. It occupies the space between Clueanda to the north and the great peninsula extending from Rimihuica to the south, forming a distinctive upside-down U shape of coastline that creates an enormous amount of valuable coastal real estate.

#### Shape and Position

The sea forms where land from both Clueanda and Rimihuica curves to create an enclosed basin:
- **Northern shore**: The Clueanda coast curves in a broad arc, hosting the major trading states
- **Southern shore**: A large peninsula or island extends northward from Rimihuica
- **Western passage**: The wide waters narrow to a much straighter, narrower strait that runs due-west, eventually connecting all the way to the Western Isles—this chokepoint is controlled by Tarkhon

#### Coastal States (Clueanda Shore)

Traveling counterclockwise from the eastern end of the Middle Sea, the northern shore hosts these states, forming a curved "roof" around the Rimihuican peninsula:

- **Adron** (easternmost, where the Kharvorn Mountains end)
- **Camaran**
- **Ubrik**
- **Bestacia**
- **Erasnus**
- **Watar**
- **Echea**
- **Ta'minn**
- **Thespia**
- **Stipen**
- **Zintacas**
- **Kazül** (near where Tarkhon begins)

#### Connection to Tarkhon

West of Kazül, the Middle Sea region transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. The broad upside-down U of the Middle Sea narrows dramatically into the Tarkhon Strait—a due-west passage that serves as the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the open ocean beyond the Western Isles.

#### Coastal States (Rimihuica Shore)

The southern shore of the Middle Sea belongs to Rimihuica, dominated by:

##### Ofrenia

A large island (technically separated from the mainland by Swampdeep) that extends northward into the Middle Sea, creating the distinctive upside-down U shape. Ofrenia is divided among three independent states ruled by warring siblings—a political powder keg at the heart of Middle Sea commerce. The island is absolutely central to the region's military and economic affairs.

##### Swampdeep

A saltwater swamp and bayou region that technically separates Ofrenia from the Rimihuican mainland. Located south of Ofrenia, appearing as a cloudy white band between the Gray Sea and the Oblivion storm to the east.

#### Surrounding Waters

- **Gray Sea**: The waters north of Swampdeep, between Ofrenia and the mainland
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm east of the Middle Sea proper and south of Adron—a hundred-mile-wide fog bank that causes complete memory loss. Those who enter forget everything and sail out in confusion, with no recollection of what lies within. At the center of Oblivion lies the Maw of Chao, a volcanic island that serves as the hatching ground for thousands of dragons. The memory fog protects this sacred place, where Damasaki Edara (daughter of the great dragon Nagatayora) raises dragon eggs before setting the young dragons free. In ancient times, the dragon riders of Adrus (now Adron) would brave the fog to reach the Maw of Chao and receive Damasaki Edara's blessing, earning the right to raise and ride with dragons

### Notable Locations

#### Fantasy Lakes

Home to many rusalka and dwarven skeletons. Lots of loot at the bottom of the lakes.

#### Ofrenia - Tornia

Tornia is the northernmost state within Ofrenia, one of the three kingdoms controlled by feuding siblings on the strategically vital island at the heart of the Middle Sea.

##### Catalina

The capital city of Tornia, located on a river delta.

###### Besnoumeru

Besnoumeru is an extremely wealthy city within Catalina, where merchants have made fortunes by predicting changes in supply and demand with uncanny accuracy. Rent is impossibly expensive—very few options exist for those on a budget. The gorgeous city architecture reflects centuries of wealth accumulation, and its position on the river delta makes it a crucial trade hub.

However, Besnoumeru's prosperity comes with a dark edge: the city is secretly controlled by time-gangs, criminal organizations that use temporal manipulation to maintain their iron grip on commerce and politics.

##### Glowbud Forest

A forest in Tornia, now overrun by feral jaguars that escaped captivity from the royal menagerie in Catalina. The king once kept these great cats as exotic pets, but they broke free and established themselves in Glowbud Forest. The jaguars have grown bold and dangerous, actively hunting people who enter the woods. What was once a peaceful woodland is now deadly hunting ground, and travelers avoid the forest whenever possible.

#### Lier - Erpeus Island

Lier is a coastal state within the Middle Sea region, home to the main port settlement of Hessam on Erpeus Island.

##### Bay of Whispers

Outside Hessam lies the Bay of Whispers, a place where secrets of long-lost time travel across the winds. Here, you can hear secrets you aren't supposed to know—everything spoken on the wind is captured forever, across all time. The bay acts as a temporal repository of whispered words, preserving conversations from the past, present, and even glimpses of the future. Those who listen carefully might learn things they were never meant to hear.

### Denrik Sea

The Denrik Sea lies east of Adron's coast and south of the Frostmarch Peninsula, forming the cold waters between the Middle Sea proper and the northern polar regions. These frigid waters are treacherous, with shifting ice and violent storms.

#### Kyorda

A small state on the southern coast of the Frostmarch Peninsula, clinging to the harsh shoreline where the peninsula meets the Denrik Sea.

#### Darkstone Caves

Located approximately one hundred miles south of Kyorda, deep beneath the Denrik Sea at the intersection of earth and dark leylines, lies an extensive underwater cave system known only as the Darkstone Caves. This is the sole known source of darkstone in all of Alaria—a rare mineral that emanates a natural aura of darkness and resists all geomantic manipulation unless the wielder is paragon-attuned to darkness itself.

The caves are perpetually shrouded in supernatural shadow that cannot be dispelled by normal light sources. The leyline convergence creates zones of absolute darkness where even magical sight fails. Currents within the underwater tunnels are unpredictable and deadly, formed by the interaction between earth magic stabilizing the cave structure and dark magic warping space within.

Mining darkstone requires specialized diving equipment, dark-attuned mages to navigate the lightless depths, and extraordinary courage. Most who attempt the descent never return—claimed by the crushing pressure, the disorienting darkness, or the strange creatures that have adapted to live in a realm of eternal shadow beneath the waves.

### Western Middle Sea

#### Kazül

A desert state in the western Middle Sea, positioned near where the sea transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. Kazül's arid climate and strategic position make it a crucial waypoint for trade.

##### Buffalo Islands

A small archipelago just south of Kazül, named for the massive sea buffalo that once migrated through these waters. The islands are remote and avoided by most sailors.

###### Pavik's Cave

On one of the Buffalo Islands lives Pavik, a flesh-eating cyclops with unmatched crafting abilities. Unlike most cyclopes who trade honestly, Pavik demands human flesh as payment for his work. He will craft weapons, armor, or tools of extraordinary quality, but only in exchange for a whole person—no less will suffice.

Pavik swallows his victims whole, alive, in a horrifying display that has traumatized those who witnessed it. Despite the grotesque nature of his business, desperate individuals still seek him out when they need craftsmanship that no one else can provide. The surrounding islands are littered with the bones of those who tried to negotiate or cheat him.

Hidden within the Gozwin Mountains lies Waterdark, the fortress where those who overthrew the dragons once lived. The residents were masters of water and darkness magic—secretive, hated, and deadly, but undeniably competent. A secret order still resides in Waterdark, but the fortress appears completely empty unless you know what to look for. The order continues its dark work in the shadows, manipulating water and darkness to pursue goals known only to themselves.

#### Stillwater

North of the Ámas Kiori region in the central basin, west of the Majesty Mountains, lies Stillwater—a sacred pool that forms in a river, watched over by Naga priests. The pool exhibits extraordinary temporal properties: in the eddies surrounding the still center, time passes very quickly, while in the perfectly motionless water at the pool's heart, time does not pass at all.

The Naga guard this sacred site with reverence, understanding that Stillwater is a place where the normal flow of time bends and breaks. Those who enter the still center may emerge to find decades have passed in the outside world, while those caught in the swift eddies age in moments.

### Desert of One Million Shards

Tags: desert, geography, Yolus breach, Scorching of Clueanda

The Desert of One Million Shards is the scarred remains of **The Scorching of Clueanda**, a catastrophic breach of the Yolus plane approximately 25,000 BSD. Three Infernals—building-sized entities of pure fire—emerged from the breach and walked the land for weeks, their passage incinerating everything in their wake. The oasis kingdoms that once flourished in this region were utterly obliterated.

In desperation, fire mages attempted to redirect the overwhelming heat to prevent further devastation. However, their efforts only spread the destruction wider across the landscape. The concentrated and dispersed heat fused vast stretches of sand into glass for hundreds of miles in every direction. Over the millennia, this glass has been sandblasted and fractured by winds and weathering, creating immense fields of jagged glass shards that give the desert its ominous name.

The deepest shards still harbor echoes of that ancient catastrophe—Cinder Swarms occasionally emerge from the fractured glass depths, drawn forth by heat and flame-magic, serving as a grim reminder of the Infernals' terrible passage.

Rocs in the nearby mountains now hunt large prey by lifting them up into the sky, and dropping them on the desert to break their bones before bringing them back to their enormous nests in the mountains.

Home to swamp goblins—adapted to the poisons and venoms a d toxic swamp gasses of the swamp.

Also has witches, which prey upon the goblins. Entire swamp fills with toxic gas, totally poisonous, causes your lungs to begin to bleed and you drown in your own blood in a minute.

Infested with massive leeches, deathfog, and misery-sprites.

Water is quite deep—easy to drown. Saltwater

#### Origin: The Drowning of the Emerald Coast

Swampdeep is not a natural swamp—it is a monument to catastrophe. Fifty million years ago, a Deluge Titan—a living tsunami the size of a mountain—emerged from a Pelus leyline intersection off the western coast in what became known as the largest Pelus breach in recorded history. The creature rolled inland for three hundred miles before dispersing, leaving the land beneath it permanently waterlogged. Where once a thriving civilization stood, only waterlogged ruin remains. The land will never dry. The waters will never recede.

The civilization that existed before the Drowning left no survivors and few traces. Most architectural remnants were obliterated by the deluge, scattered and sunken beyond recovery. What few structures survived remain buried under poisoned waters—monuments to a world that drowned.

#### Omegra's Hut: A Window into the Before

Omegra's Hut is the only known pre-Drowning structure still accessible. This mostly sunken dungeon contains architecture from the civilization the Deluge Titan erased—the only physical evidence of who lived here before the waters came. Its presence suggests a sophisticated society was lost to the Drowning, their knowledge and culture dissolved into saltwater and toxic gas.

#### Tide Walkers: The Eternal Guardians

The catastrophe that created Swampdeep did not end with the Drowning itself. Manifestations of Pelus water elementals—beings known as Tide Walkers—still patrol the swamp's depths. These confused guardians, born from the raw elemental chaos of the breached leyline, remain bound to the flooded lands. They defend depths of a nation that no longer exists, fulfilling purposes perhaps only they remember. Whether they serve as protectors, wardens, or prisoners of their own creation remains unknown.

### Bygone Hills

Just south of the eastern edge of Swampdeep lie the Bygone Hills, a region of rolling terrain marked by ancient ruins and forgotten city-states.

#### Eidlesandres

A city-state in the Bygone Hills, maintaining its independence through careful neutrality and strategic positioning.

At the center of the arena stands an ancient altar. Anyone who swears to tell the truth upon this altar becomes magically bound to speak only truth—lies become impossible, evasions fail, and the full truth spills forth regardless of consequence. The Shystani forest has grown around this place, but locals still use God's Court to settle disputes, verify oaths, and force confessions from the accused. Those who enter the arena feel the stone gods' eyes boring into their souls.

## Kharvorn Mountains

### Geography

The Kharvorn Mountains are a massive diagonal range that defines the heart of Clueanda, running from the center-north down to the southeast and spanning roughly half the map. Unlike the east-west Nysanna Range to the north, the Kharvorn cuts diagonally across the continent, creating the fundamental division between the frozen northern reaches and the temperate lands of the Middle Sea.

#### Position and Extent

- **Northwest terminus**: Meets the eastern tip of the Nysanna Range at approximately a 120-degree angle
- **Southeast terminus**: Ends near Adron, where the mountains give way to the coastal states of the Middle Sea
- **North**: The Celedrim Plains and their forests (Winterwood, Plutochranes) lie beyond the range
- **South**: The temperate Middle Sea region and its coastal kingdoms

#### Climate Barrier

The Kharvorn acts as a critical climate boundary. North of the range lies perpetual winter—the frozen steppes of the Celedrim Plains. South of the range, the climate warms dramatically, supporting the agricultural lands and trading cities of the Middle Sea coast. The peaks are white-capped with heavy snowfall, while the foothills transition into the brown and green of the lower lands.

#### Sub-Ranges

The Kharvorn comprises numerous distinct mountain ranges along its length, from northwest to southeast:

- **Pelmar Mountains**
- **The Knives**
- **Nirvanis Mountains**
- **Aquendrakons**
- **Gymelstik**
- **Argysis** (Winterwood Forest lies to its north)
- **Hephake**
- **Myorna** (Plutochranes Forest lies to its north)
- **Ngül**

### Notable Locations

#### Egül Mountains

A sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned north of the giant-infested basin that lies between Camaran (to the west) and Adron (to the south). This region is remote and treacherous, avoided by most travelers.

##### Nedgar's Castle

Deep within the Egül Mountains stands the ruins of Nedgar's Castle—a collapsed fortress of impossible architecture. Nedgar was a reclusive hermit mage, famous throughout the realm for his paragon attunement to stone. He built a castle that defied the laws of physics and geology, with towers that twisted in impossible angles and walls that seemed to float without support.

When Nedgar died, the castle collapsed—as if his will alone had held the structure together. Now the ruins are inhabited by animated stone beings: golems, statues, and fragments of architecture that aimlessly walk the halls, endlessly performing tasks for a master who no longer exists.

The animated stone guardians will not permit anyone who lacks stone attunement to enter the ruins. Those who try are crushed by falling masonry or torn apart by stone hands. However, for those rare geomancers with stone attunement, the ruins are accessible—and within lie multiple earth-stones, crystals of concentrated geomantic power that Nedgar collected during his lifetime.

#### Desert of One Million Shards

Northwest of Ta Minn lies the Desert of One Million Shards—a vast expanse of shattered glass stretching as far as the eye can see. The desert's surface glitters under the sun, beautiful and deadly in equal measure. Walking across it is treacherous, as the sharp glass edges can slice through boots and flesh alike.

At the center of the desert lies a massive crater containing a huge lake. In the middle of that lake rests Ulm—a colossal meteorite that struck in ancient times, creating both the crater and the lake. The impact also melted and scattered the surrounding rock into the endless field of glass shards that now defines the region.

##### Roclin Hills

In the foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains, northeast of the Desert of One Million Shards, lie the Roclin Hills. This region is named for the rocs—great, majestic birds that infest the area. The massive predators perch in the hills to roost after soaring over the desert and surrounding countryside all day hunting for prey. Travelers through the Roclin Hills risk attack from above, as the rocs are always hungry and unafraid of humanoid-sized meals.

#### Temple of Icefire

North of Gymelstik (a goblin-dominated state) and south of the Aquendrakons mountains, at the convergence of water and fire leylines, stands the Temple of Icefire. This unique institution is dedicated to the study of ice and fire magic and their interaction—a discipline that produces seemingly impossible results.

Mages who study at the Temple of Icefire learn to create ice that burns and flames that freeze, manipulating the fundamental properties of these opposing elements. The temple's location at the leyline intersection allows practitioners to channel both water and fire magic simultaneously, creating paradoxical effects that defy conventional magical understanding.

#### Pact of Barrik

The Pact of Barrik is a statue of two dwarven kings, standing back to back, one holding a battleax, the other holding a book. These corresponded to the Hephakean and Argysisean kings respectively.

The statues are said to imbue wisdom in those who spend time aroudn them. Children from both kingdoms would visit the statue, and princes would spend days in meditation around them. When Argysis was conquered by Rothogomos, this was no longer safe, and the tradition died out.

#### Blueshale Peaks

A mountain range northwest of Argysis proper, positioned on an earth leyline.

##### Stormfather

In the Blueshale Peaks dwells Stormfather, an earth-attuned cyclops of tremendous power. Before Argysis fell to the dragon Rothogomos, Stormfather served as a counselor to the Argysisean dwarves, offering wisdom and aid in times of need.

Stormfather remains in the peaks, a powerful ally to those who can earn his favor. He will trade his help for gems and stories of the world—the more compelling the tale, the more willing he is to assist. Alternatively, those brave (or foolish) enough can challenge him to an arm-wrestling match. Victory earns his respect and aid, though few possess the strength to best a cyclops of his might.

#### Wisdom Creek

Wisdom Creek flows from the spring at Othyndria (the ruined capital, now home to Rothogomos the cruel dragon) down into the valley between Argysis and Hephake. The river earned its name from the great wisdom that once flowed from the Kings of Argysis when the dwarven kingdom was at its height.

The water flows northeast, eventually reaching Enros Lake, a large lake just south of the Jotun Hills—a mountain range stretching east-west from Winterwood in the west to the southwest edge of Konai Mora.

### Blue Shale Peaks

Tags: mountains

Many warfaring giants live here. Massive skeletons litter the ground from their destroyed bodies. One of the more powerful giant lords recently died, resulting in a large power vacuum.

Ruins of a halfling civilization present. Nothing of the city, known as Tem Shyanna remains, but the fortress walls do. Trapped within are a small enclave of halfling explorers, taking care of an old, senile, fire attuned halfling, who keeps them warm during the winter and provides the warmth for their food. The man is too senile to move, and trying to force him out makes him go berserk.

The walls protect the halflings from the giants, but not the wyverns. Either way, they are trapped here. Have been living here for 5 years now.

A dwarven state in the southern Kharvorn Mountains, sharing a southeastern border with the state of Myorna. Hephake is known for its extensive silver mines and the pollution they produce.

#### Phorysia

The capital city of Hephake, a major dwarven mining settlement with massive silver extraction operations.

#### Derivlia Lake

Located in the southern part of Hephake, Derivlia Lake has become severely poisoned by runoff from the silver mines of Phorysia. The water is toxic, killing most life and leaving the shores barren. The lake serves as a stark reminder of the environmental cost of Hephake's mining wealth, and the dwarves have made no efforts to clean it—silver production continues unabated, and the poison flows into the lake year after year.

The mountains, do, in fact have evil spirits haunting them, which the statues protect against. These spirits are known as Kyth, and appear as white, spectral ghosts. They come out at night and will kill those who are not spiritually warded (such as by the statues).

## Westwilds

### Geography

The Westwilds occupy the southwestern corner of Clueanda, forming a transitional zone between the frozen Northlands and the maritime regions to the south. This is the southern coast of Clueanda, stretching from Tarkhon in the east to the waters overlooking the Western Isles in the west.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Transitions into the Northlands; the frozen tundra gradually gives way to arid scrubland
- **East**: Meets Tarkhon territory; some desert coastline marks this transition
- **South**: Faces the open ocean, with the Western Isles visible offshore
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking the Western Isles

#### Terrain

The Westwilds have a yellowish-green hue suggesting dry steppe or scrubland. The region is less fertile than the Middle Sea lands but more hospitable than the frozen north—a rugged zone of hardy grasses, wind-worn rock, and arid soil. While not a true desert, the land is parched and demanding.

#### Climate Transition

The Westwilds represent one of Clueanda's major climate transitions. The frozen winds from the Northlands lose much of their bite here, but the region receives little rainfall. The result is an austere landscape—neither frozen nor verdant, but something in between.

### Notable Locations

#### Shazuihn

An orc state in the interior Westwilds, notable for its extensive forests and proximity to dangerous geothermal features.

##### Shazuihn Forest

Dense woodlands covering much of the orc state's territory, providing shelter and resources for the orc clans.

##### The Plains Beyond

North of the Shazuihn Forest lie open plains marked by violent magical phenomena.

###### Dragon Spout

Located in the plains north of Shazuihn and southwest of the Scorches (a region of hotsprings and geysers), Dragon Spout is a site where the void and fire leylines intersect. Huge gouts of flame erupt unpredictably from the ground, shooting hundreds of feet into the air. The combination of void magic and fire creates flames that burn with unnatural heat and persistence—they cannot be extinguished by conventional means and sometimes burn in colors that shouldn't exist.

The area around Dragon Spout is a scorched wasteland, littered with the remains of those who underestimated the danger. The eruptions are impossible to predict, and the void-tainted fire can burn through magical protections. Despite the extreme hazard, some fire mages make pilgrimages here to study the raw elemental power.

###### The Scorches

Northeast of Dragon Spout lies the Scorches, a region of hotsprings and geysers where geothermal activity creates a landscape of bubbling mud pots, scalding pools, and steam vents. The heat here is natural rather than magical, but no less deadly.

At the heart of the Scorches is a massive boiling whirlpool where superheated water churns with such violence that it becomes super-aerated, causing anything that enters to lose buoyancy and sink immediately. Gouts of fire erupt from the whirlpool at irregular intervals, and the area is inhabited by steam elementals—creatures born from the intersection of water and fire. The Scorches are extremely dangerous, and few who venture too close to the central whirlpool survive.

###### Ruby Rock

West of the Deadwalk desert, within the Scorches, stands Ruby Rock—a massive stone outcropping that erupted from the ground in ancient times. The rock contains a vast cavern system filled with rubies and gemstones, created when mineral-rich water from the hotsprings deposited sediments over millennia before being uplifted by geological forces.

The gems are breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly valuable, but they carry a curse. Those who take rubies from the cavern find themselves plagued by misfortune—relationships crumble, fortunes are lost, and death stalks them. Some say the curse is tied to the volcanic forces that created the gems; others believe the rubies remember being torn from their home and seek revenge on those who stole them.

#### The Orc States

The southern and western portions of the Westwilds are divided among six major orcish states, each controlling territory in the vast forested region:

- **Glivornax**
- **Hedroscobb** (northeast of the Plains of Oblivion)
- **Grieb** (home to the Grieb Lakes and the Griebi people)
- **Shazuihn** (detailed above)
- **Tarn** (detailed below)
- **Uhionai**

These states maintain a loose confederation, cooperating for defense against external threats while fiercely competing for resources and territory within the Westwilds.

##### Tarn

One of the central orcish states in the Westwilds, positioned along the Grand Tolkarsus river system.

###### Plenjorn Swamp

A marshy region within Tarn, fed by the Grand Tolkarsus—a massive river that stretches from the Nirvanis Mountains (part of the Kharvorn range) in the northeast, flowing southwest through orcish territory, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and the Deadwalk desert, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake. This colossal lake connects to Symonair Lake, which empties into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

Within Plenjorn Swamp, the river's waters are said to possess miraculous healing properties. Bathing in the Grand Tolkarsus can cure even the most brutal wounds and life-threatening injuries. Few outside Tarn know of this power, and the Tarni orcs fiercely protect the swamp from outsiders, ensuring the healing waters remain a secret advantage for their people.

#### Plains of Oblivion

Northwest of the mountains of Murth (a state in Tarkhon), stretching from the Western Isles coast in the west to the orc state of Hedroscobb in the northeast, lie the Plains of Oblivion. These cursed grasslands cause all who enter to gradually forget everything except their oldest long-term memories and events from the past year. Recent memories, learned skills, and personal identity slip away like water through fingers.

The plains are home to Satyrn Gray—the palace of Queen Eranes, an extremely powerful half-titan who lost her love when the plains were cursed and split by ancient magic. In her grief, she sought to forget, enchanting her entire palace with powerful spells that hide memories. Though she has succeeded in forgetting her love, she still feels a deep, inexplicable sorrow. She knows she is connected to these plains and cannot bring herself to leave, but she no longer remembers why.

Queen Eranes will handsomely reward anyone who can explain to her what has happened—who she was, what she lost, and why she feels such endless mourning. But the palace's enchantments work against this goal: visitors forget their purpose, the queen forgets the conversations she has, and the truth remains perpetually out of reach. The memory-draining effect of the plains ceases once travelers leave, but the lost memories never return, and the queen remains trapped in her palace of forgotten sorrows.

#### Mountains Semaphois

West of the Grand Tolkarsus and south of the northern plains rise the Mountains Semaphois. To the mountains' west lies Ichneum, a large forest. North of the range are the mountains of Miphori, the Zhorheim Mountains (marking the northern edge of the forest), and the Hills of the White Terror, which stretch northeast into the Northlands.

##### Temple of the Wind

High in the Mountains Semaphois stands the wind-racked, abandoned Temple of the Wind. This remote structure was once home to monks and primeshapers who mastered both earth and air magic, using the mountain winds to fuel their practice. The temple was destroyed when a mechwurm attacked, killing the monks and leaving the temple empty.

Now the temple stands as a haunting reminder, its halls filled with the howling winds that once served the monks' magic. The structure itself remains intact, though battered by decades of relentless wind, and the knowledge the monks possessed has been lost with their deaths.

#### Zhorheim Mountains

Home to Pythlokravaleci, the dragon guardian of the Einwissel dwarves who traveled back from Celestia. The dragon can travel to Celestia easily as well. The dwarves know its true name, and vice versa—a foundation of enormous trust. Located in a mountain range forming part of the southwest side of the northlands, northeast of Ichneum (forest), marking the northern edge of the forest region.

A series of interconnected freshwater lakes in the Westwilds, home to the reclusive Griebi people.

#### The Griebi: The Lakemen

The Griebi are a unique subspecies of aquatic orcs with blueish-gray skin adapted for underwater life. They are accomplished hunters and fishers who rarely interact with surface-dwellers and communicate sparingly even among themselves.

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Blueish-gray skin
- Ability to breathe underwater
- Long, needle-like teeth adapted for swimming and catching fish

**Culture & Society:**
- Subsist primarily through hunting and fishing
- Rarely speak, preferring non-verbal communication
- Ruled by a hag queen

The Griebi's terrifying appearance - particularly their needle-like dentition - makes encounters with them unsettling for most surface dwellers, though they are primarily focused on survival rather than aggression.

On the western side of the Krenglelan Range, north of the Everwood and along a major trade route, stands Ipt—a formidable fortress built for Feriptus, an extremely powerful lich. The fortress serves as his primary research facility, where he conducts necromantic experiments in complete isolation.

Ipt is built into the mountainside with tall, iron-reinforced stone walls and heavy defensive wards that notify Feriptus of any approaching visitors. The fortress is supplied through a grim arrangement: a personal Enti trader makes bi-yearly trips south to acquire slaves, delivering fresh bodies for Feriptus's dark work. Despite its location along a trade route, travelers give Ipt a wide berth, knowing that those who approach uninvited rarely leave.

Beneath the desert are the ruins of the Postronamas Empire, an incredibly powerful civilization that used the powers of twyl to become incredibly powerful themselves. Large, crystal caves were used for meditation by their leaders, granting them fabulous powers. huge crystal caverns beneath the ground. Tons of crystals available, but can drive you mad from their music. Permeates mind unless you are literally deaf? Literally too dumb to think? 

The desert is dominated by giant insects, which flourish in the oxygen rich environment. Every 7 years, the locusts hatch and ravage the surface of anything edible. Large scorpions hunt the insects.

## Frostmarch Peninsula

### Geography

The Frostmarch Peninsula is a long landmass that juts eastward from the Celedrim Plains, forming the mainland anchor of the Northern Isles archipelago. It serves as a layered transition between the continental interior and the fragmented island chains of the Ocean of Azeros.

#### Position and Shape

- **West**: Connects to the Celedrim Plains; the two regions are layered, with the plains slanting down and the peninsula extending beneath and eastward
- **East**: Reaches across toward the Northern Isles, forming the "underneath" section of the archipelago
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros and the scattered islands of the Northern Isles
- **South**: Faces the open waters of the Azeros

The peninsula and Celedrim Plains create a stepped geography—the plains occupying the upper layer, with Frostmarch extending as a lower shelf beneath them, reaching eastward into the island chains.

#### Nearby Features

- **Plutochranes Forest**: Lies to the west of the peninsula, north of the Kharvorn sub-range Myorna
- **Northern Isles**: The peninsula transitions into this archipelago as the land fragments into islands

#### Climate

The Frostmarch represents the edge of the arctic world. The northern part remains white and snowy year-round, while the southern edges show signs of brown, thawing terrain in warmer seasons. Ice gives way to earth here, but only barely.

## Celedrim Plains

### Geography

The Celedrim Plains are a vast frozen steppe occupying the northeastern interior of Clueanda, positioned north of the Kharvorn Mountains and stretching eastward toward the Northern Isles. This is among the most desolate regions of the known world—an endless expanse of wind-scoured snow and ice.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Ocean of Azeros; mountains dot the coastline
- **South**: The Kharvorn Mountains form the southern boundary, their diagonal line running from northwest to southeast
- **West**: Transitions into the Northlands where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains meet
- **East**: Extends to the Ocean of Azeros and transitions into the Frostmarch Peninsula

#### Terrain

The plains are distinctly flat and open—frozen steppe rather than glaciated terrain. Endless white expanses stretch to every horizon, broken only by the occasional rocky outcrop or wind-carved snow drift. Nothing stands to break the howling winds that sweep across the expanse.

#### Notable Forests

Two significant forests cling to the southwestern margins of the plains, where they transition toward the Kharvorn Mountains:

- **Winterwood Forest**: Located in the southwestern portion of the plains, directly north of Argysis (one of the Kharvorn sub-ranges)
- **Plutochranes Forest**: Positioned north of Myorna (another Kharvorn sub-range), south of the main plains expanse, and west of the Frostmarch Peninsula

A city-state north of the Blistering Mountains, home to the valkyries. This remote settlement serves as the guardians of one of the most extraordinary structures in all of Alaria.

###### Starreach

A tower that extends all the way from the ground to the Astral plane itself. The valkyries of Solhalven have been cursed to guard Starreach from the angels Sarakiel and Xaphkiel, and they are bound to permit only certain chosen individuals to ascend the tower. The curse has transformed what might have been an honor into an eternal duty, and the valkyries stand watch over this bridge between worlds, never knowing rest.

Although not actually a wall, this mountain range is rife with giants, wyverns, snow spirits, and an eternal blizzard, making passing through so treacherous that it has almost never been done. Located on the east side of Konai Mora (basin plains surrounded by mountains in northeast all the way to southwest). Yukum's Wall is coastal mountains, separating Ceredrim Plains from the Northern Isles. To its north are the Blistering Mountains (contiguous with Yukum's Wall, volcanos).

## Northlands

### Geography

The Northlands occupy the frozen heart of northern Clueanda, filling the space south of the Nysanna Range. This vast arctic tundra stretches from the North Sea—a small body of water in the extreme north—down to where it meets the Westwilds in the southwest and transitions into the Celedrim Plains to the east.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Nysanna Range forms the northern boundary, an east-west mountain chain that marks the edge of habitable land
- **East**: Transitions into the Celedrim Plains; the two regions meet at approximately where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains join at their 120-degree angle
- **South/Southwest**: Grades into the Westwilds, a transitional zone of arid scrubland
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking distant waters

#### Terrain

The terrain consists primarily of frozen tundra: permafrost beneath shallow snow, occasional rocky outcrops, and rare patches of hardy lichen. Howling winds sweep across featureless white expanses for hundreds of miles. The coast is treacherous, with ice shelves that calve into the frigid sea and pack ice that shifts with the seasons.

#### Titanwurm Mountains

Scattered throughout the Northlands are several Titanwurm mountain ranges—isolated peaks and ridges that break the otherwise flat tundra. These are not traditional geological formations but the colossal remains of titanwurms, ancient creatures whose bones now form mountain ranges:

- Melrin Mountains
- Gwyndolsong Mountains
- Wurmspine Mountains
- Sotori Mountains (south of Wurmspine and Jemco, just north of the eastern Krenglelan Range)—composed of the colossal vertebrae of a titanwurm
- Jemco Mountains

### Notable Locations

#### The Northern Plains

The vast frozen grasslands that stretch between the Titanwurm mountain ranges, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and south of the Gwyndolsong Mountains. The Beathamuir River cuts horizontally through the entire Northern Plains, one of the few sources of unfrozen water in this frozen realm.

##### Circle of Stone

Like Stonehenge but far more imposing—colossal stones arranged in an ancient circle, each stone unbreakable and emanating massive magical power. The site sits at a convergence of Earth and Force leylines, allowing for extraordinarily powerful geomancy and force magic. The stones predate all known civilizations in the Northlands, and their creators remain a mystery.

The Circle has become a pilgrimage site for geomancers and force-attuned mages seeking to study or harness the immense power concentrated here.

#### Nysanna Range

The massive east-west mountain chain that forms the northern boundary of the Northlands, marking the edge of habitable territory before the polar wastes.

##### Inthikrilix Dungeon

On the northern side of the Nysanna Range, where water and force leylines intersect, lies the Inthikrilix Dungeon—a massive fortress carved into the mountainside. This network of ice-encrusted tunnels delves deep into the mountain, leading eventually to the crypt of Inthikrilix, an ancient mage who mastered both ice and force magic.

The dungeon is guarded by spirits of ice and force—ethereal beings created by the leyline convergence or bound by Inthikrilix himself. These spirits manifest as crystalline wraiths that can freeze flesh instantly or crush intruders with invisible force. The deeper one ventures into the mountain, the more powerful and numerous the guardians become, and the temperature drops to levels that can kill unprotected explorers within minutes.

##### Pyoa Noi

In the eastern region of the Nysanna Range stands one of the most bizarre landmarks in the Northlands: Pyoa Noi, a hundred-mile-long stone serpent that twists and turns through the mountains, its petrified body diving in and out of the peaks like a sea serpent frozen mid-leap.

The serpent was once a living creature of unimaginable size, turned to stone by an incredibly powerful gorgon in an ancient battle. Over the centuries, miners have hollowed out the serpent's interior, creating a network of tunnels and chambers within the stone body. These carved spaces are now inhabited by the Wydlings—a reclusive people who have made Pyoa Noi their home, living within the belly of the petrified beast and defending it from those who would mine it further.

#### Wurmspine Mountains

One of the Titanwurm mountain ranges scattered throughout the Northlands, the Wurmspine Mountains divide the frozen plains.

##### Temple of Zicadia

At the northern tip of the Wurmspine Mountains, where force and air leylines intersect, stands the Temple of Zicadia. This remote institution is dedicated to elemental protection magic—specifically, the art of turning air into solid structures that can deflect attacks.

The temple is run by Master Felwana, a reclusive woman who lost her husband in a distant war and came to the Northlands to learn. She became a master of the art and now teaches others, though the temple is brutal and miserable. Life here is harsh—the temple faces frequent threats from the creatures of the frozen snowplains, and students must be prepared to defend themselves while mastering the difficult discipline of solidifying air itself.

### Nysanna Range

Tags: mountains

The Nysanna Range is one of the most inhospitable places on Alaria. The entire range is plagued with constant blizzards, high winds, and freezing temperatures. It is rare for the temperature to climb above -20, and the high altitudes can cause people to make poor decisions.

Within the range lie a wide variety of wildlife, civilizations, and valuable resources.

#### Witvein

Small subsection of the eastern part of the Nysanna Range on the northerly side. Mountainous and tunnel-laden glaciers filled with Wydlings.

### Senaveer Mountains

Tags: mountains

They are home to a large population of northern rocs, which hunt the caribou in the east. The mountains are rich with the lichen that feeds the caribou, so the Atowatowa herders will journey there every spring.

#### Anderegnons

The Anderegnons are a miserable, cold, windy range of mountains, on the border of the Material Plane and Celestia. It is also a rich source of malstaric ash, which can be found throughout the mountains. The Bollinger Mining Company have discovered it, laid claim to it, and now mine and ship the ash south towards the sea. It is an incredibly expensive and dangerous operation, as food has to be shipped in, and ash shipped out. The journey is treacherous. They have so far managed to avoid the Atowtowa by skirting along the eastern edge of the Senaveer Mountains. However, stray too far west and get eaten by the Northern Rocs in the mountains, and stray too far east an get captured and killed by the Atowatowa.

### The Plumes

Tags: poi

The Plumes are a small region with frequent, intense geysers of fire and steam. Crabs live around the edge of the holes in the ground, feeding off the archea that grow in the hot vents. Docile Magma Snails are throughout.

## Northern Isles

### Geography

The Northern Isles are a broad, fragmented archipelago occupying the northeastern waters of Clueanda, scattered across the Ocean of Azeros. The island chain resembles the Canadian arctic archipelago—a wide, tall region of relatively large islands broken by narrow, icy straits and channels.

#### Position and Extent

- **West**: The Frostmarch Peninsula forms the mainland anchor, transitioning from continental land into the island chain
- **South**: The Ocean of Azeros separates the isles from the Celedrim Plains coastline
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros extends beyond the islands toward the polar ice
- **East**: Open ocean

The Ocean of Azeros surrounds and permeates the archipelago, stretching from north of the Celedrim Plains across the entire top of this region.

#### Climate

The islands are uniformly icy, though conditions worsen progressively toward the north. Even the southernmost islands remain frozen year-round, with ice floes clogging the channels between them. Navigation is treacherous—shifting pack ice, sudden storms, and the ever-present cold claim many ships.

#### Major Islands

- **Imnuttut**: The large white island in the most northeastern region—one of the largest landmasses in the archipelago
- **Pherezi**: A major island in the chain
- **Aknimchuk Island**: Located in the north, notable for its small range of active volcanoes—rare sources of heat in this frozen realm

### Notable Locations

#### Bzulakar's Keep

In the very center of the Northern Isles stands [Bzulakar's](../../dramatis_personae/Bzulakar.md) domain—a 2-mile-high tower of permanently frozen ice where the ancient lich resides. His power has frozen the surrounding thousand-mile area and stilled the nearby seas to whispers. The tower is visible from much of the archipelago, a landmark and a warning.

#### Foggy Isles

The most densely foggy islands in this half of the world. Home to an old Tuktuk named Gelnor who is paragon attuned to fog and water. Lives here eternally to atone for his sins (he's a lich, immortal).

On shore are giant hermit crabs that eat the algae off the rocks.

#### Amber Coast

Located in Pherezi Imnuttut, the Amber Coast is a beach where beautiful amber minerals frequently wash ashore. These minerals possess magical properties, making them highly prized by mages and collectors. The constant flow of enchanted amber from the frozen depths creates a dangerous attraction—both for treasure seekers and the predators that hunt them along the icy shoreline.

#### Blyzrynthine

A canyonland region in the north of Pherezi Imnuttut, bordered by the Hills of Insanity to the north and east, and the mountainous region of Giantfell to the south. A fire leyline passes through Blyzrynthine, superheating the canyons below.

##### Thermarift

Deep within the canyons of Crevakus in Blyzrynthine, huge fiery rifts tear through the ground. These Thermarifts are caused by the fire leyline running beneath the canyonlands, creating massive fissures that belch flame and superheated air. The ground far below in the canyon depths is covered with these fiery tears in the earth, making the deep canyons effectively impassable without magical protection from heat and flame.

#### Timeless Wastes

Southwest of Blyzrynthine and west of Giantfell lie the Timeless Wastes—a frozen desert where time itself behaves strangely. Travelers cannot keep track of time accurately here; hours feel like days, days feel like hours, and aging progresses at unpredictable rates. Some emerge having aged decades in what felt like a day, while others spend what seems like weeks only to find mere hours have passed in the outside world. Everything about the Wastes feels wrong and disorienting, as if time itself has come unmoored from reality.
