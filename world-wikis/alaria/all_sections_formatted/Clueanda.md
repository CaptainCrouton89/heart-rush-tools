# Clueanda

Clueanda forms the frozen crown of northwestern Alaria. Twin mountain ranges define it: the east-west Nysanna Range hugging the polar edge, and the diagonal Kharvorn Mountains that sweep down toward the temperate Middle Sea. Between them lie the polar Northlands, the windswept Celedrim Plains, and countless fjords and glacial valleys. South of the Kharvorn range the climate softens enough to support bustling Middle Sea trade cities and the arid Westwilds coastline that faces the Tarkhon Strait.

## Featured Regions

- **Northlands** – Arctic tundra beneath the Nysanna Range.
- **Celedrim Plains** – Frozen steppes north of the Kharvorn Mountains.
- **Kharvorn Mountains** – The diagonal range dividing polar wastes from civilized southlands.
- **Middle Sea** – Temperate coasts and inland waters dotted with city-states.
- **Westwilds** – Scrublands and cursed plains along the southern coast.
- **Frostmarch Peninsula** – The eastern land bridge toward the Northern Isles.
- **Northern Isles** – An archipelago of icebound islands in the Ocean of Azeros.

## Middle Sea

### Geography

The Middle Sea is a large body of water lying south of the Kharvorn Mountains, in the temperate heart of Clueanda. It occupies the space between Clueanda to the north and the great peninsula extending from Rimihuica to the south, forming a distinctive upside-down U shape of coastline that creates an enormous amount of valuable coastal real estate.

#### Shape and Position

The sea forms where land from both Clueanda and Rimihuica curves to create an enclosed basin:
- **Northern shore**: The Clueanda coast curves in a broad arc, hosting the major trading states
- **Southern shore**: A large peninsula or island extends northward from Rimihuica
- **Western passage**: The wide waters narrow to a much straighter, narrower strait that runs due-west, eventually connecting all the way to the Western Isles—this chokepoint is controlled by Tarkhon

#### Coastal States (Clueanda Shore)

Traveling counterclockwise from the eastern end of the Middle Sea, the northern shore hosts these states, forming a curved "roof" around the Rimihuican peninsula:

- **Adron** (easternmost, where the Kharvorn Mountains end)
- **Camaran**
- **Ubrik**
- **Bestacia**
- **Erasnus**
- **Watar**
- **Echea**
- **Ta'minn**
- **Thespia**
- **Stipen**
- **Zintacas**
- **Kazül** (near where Tarkhon begins)

#### Connection to Tarkhon

West of Kazül, the Middle Sea region transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. The broad upside-down U of the Middle Sea narrows dramatically into the Tarkhon Strait—a due-west passage that serves as the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the open ocean beyond the Western Isles.

#### Coastal States (Rimihuica Shore)

The southern shore of the Middle Sea belongs to Rimihuica, dominated by:

##### Ofrenia

A large island (technically separated from the mainland by Swampdeep) that extends northward into the Middle Sea, creating the distinctive upside-down U shape. Ofrenia is divided among three independent states ruled by warring siblings—a political powder keg at the heart of Middle Sea commerce. The island is absolutely central to the region's military and economic affairs.

##### Swampdeep

A saltwater swamp and bayou region that technically separates Ofrenia from the Rimihuican mainland. Located south of Ofrenia, appearing as a cloudy white band between the Gray Sea and the Oblivion storm to the east.

#### Surrounding Waters

- **Gray Sea**: The waters north of Swampdeep, between Ofrenia and the mainland
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm east of the Middle Sea proper and south of Adron—a hundred-mile-wide fog bank that causes complete memory loss. Those who enter forget everything and sail out in confusion, with no recollection of what lies within. At the center of Oblivion lies the Maw of Chao, a volcanic island that serves as the hatching ground for thousands of dragons. The memory fog protects this sacred place, where Damasaki Edara (daughter of the great dragon Nagatayora) raises dragon eggs before setting the young dragons free. In ancient times, the dragon riders of Adrus (now Adron) would brave the fog to reach the Maw of Chao and receive Damasaki Edara's blessing, earning the right to raise and ride with dragons

### Notable Locations

#### Fantasy Lakes

Home to many rusalka and dwarven skeletons. Lots of loot at the bottom of the lakes.

#### Ofrenia - Tornia

Tornia is the northernmost state within Ofrenia, one of the three kingdoms controlled by feuding siblings on the strategically vital island at the heart of the Middle Sea.

##### Catalina

The capital city of Tornia, located on a river delta.

###### Besnoumeru

Besnoumeru is an extremely wealthy city within Catalina, where merchants have made fortunes by predicting changes in supply and demand with uncanny accuracy. Rent is impossibly expensive—very few options exist for those on a budget. The gorgeous city architecture reflects centuries of wealth accumulation, and its position on the river delta makes it a crucial trade hub.

However, Besnoumeru's prosperity comes with a dark edge: the city is secretly controlled by time-gangs, criminal organizations that use temporal manipulation to maintain their iron grip on commerce and politics.

##### Glowbud Forest

A forest in Tornia, now overrun by feral jaguars that escaped captivity from the royal menagerie in Catalina. The king once kept these great cats as exotic pets, but they broke free and established themselves in Glowbud Forest. The jaguars have grown bold and dangerous, actively hunting people who enter the woods. What was once a peaceful woodland is now deadly hunting ground, and travelers avoid the forest whenever possible.

#### Lier - Erpeus Island

Lier is a coastal state within the Middle Sea region, home to the main port settlement of Hessam on Erpeus Island.

##### Bay of Whispers

Outside Hessam lies the Bay of Whispers, a place where secrets of long-lost time travel across the winds. Here, you can hear secrets you aren't supposed to know—everything spoken on the wind is captured forever, across all time. The bay acts as a temporal repository of whispered words, preserving conversations from the past, present, and even glimpses of the future. Those who listen carefully might learn things they were never meant to hear.

### Denrik Sea

The Denrik Sea lies east of Adron's coast and south of the Frostmarch Peninsula, forming the cold waters between the Middle Sea proper and the northern polar regions. These frigid waters are treacherous, with shifting ice and violent storms.

#### Kyorda

A small state on the southern coast of the Frostmarch Peninsula, clinging to the harsh shoreline where the peninsula meets the Denrik Sea.

#### Darkstone Caves

Located approximately one hundred miles south of Kyorda, deep beneath the Denrik Sea at the intersection of earth and dark leylines, lies an extensive underwater cave system known only as the Darkstone Caves. This is the sole known source of darkstone in all of Alaria—a rare mineral that emanates a natural aura of darkness and resists all geomantic manipulation unless the wielder is paragon-attuned to darkness itself.

The caves are perpetually shrouded in supernatural shadow that cannot be dispelled by normal light sources. The leyline convergence creates zones of absolute darkness where even magical sight fails. Currents within the underwater tunnels are unpredictable and deadly, formed by the interaction between earth magic stabilizing the cave structure and dark magic warping space within.

Mining darkstone requires specialized diving equipment, dark-attuned mages to navigate the lightless depths, and extraordinary courage. Most who attempt the descent never return—claimed by the crushing pressure, the disorienting darkness, or the strange creatures that have adapted to live in a realm of eternal shadow beneath the waves.

### Western Middle Sea

#### Kazül

A desert state in the western Middle Sea, positioned near where the sea transitions into Tarkhon-controlled territory. Kazül's arid climate and strategic position make it a crucial waypoint for trade.

##### Buffalo Islands

A small archipelago just south of Kazül, named for the massive sea buffalo that once migrated through these waters. The islands are remote and avoided by most sailors.

###### Pavik's Cave

On one of the Buffalo Islands lives Pavik, a flesh-eating cyclops with unmatched crafting abilities. Unlike most cyclopes who trade honestly, Pavik demands human flesh as payment for his work. He will craft weapons, armor, or tools of extraordinary quality, but only in exchange for a whole person—no less will suffice.

Pavik swallows his victims whole, alive, in a horrifying display that has traumatized those who witnessed it. Despite the grotesque nature of his business, desperate individuals still seek him out when they need craftsmanship that no one else can provide. The surrounding islands are littered with the bones of those who tried to negotiate or cheat him.

### Adron

Tags: state, nation

Adron is the easternmost state on the Middle Sea, a proud Naga kingdom nestled between dramatic mountain ranges. Once the land of dragon riders, it now trades on banking, shipbuilding, and the legendary red gold mined from its peaks. The climate is Mediterranean—warm coastlines, temperate forests in the valleys, and snow-capped mountains framing the horizon.

Three major ley lines cross Adron: water (through the capital), time (southwest to northeast across the north), and dark (through the center). The intersections produce an unusually high number of elementally attuned Naga.

#### Adrak

The capital city, seat of the monarchy, and home to the Royal Adrak Bank. Sits on or near the water ley line. The nobility here keep domesticated dragons as pets—impressive creatures, but shadows of the war-beasts their ancestors once rode. The city exudes old wealth and older pride.

#### Tenori River

The economic spine of Adron. Flows from the highlands northeast of Adrak, runs south along the Drakespine Mountains, and empties into the sea at Shipmarsh. Most internal trade moves along this river.

#### Shipmarsh

The largest city in Adron after Adrak, built where the Tenori River meets the sea. Massive shipyards produce vessels for the Middle Sea trade. A working city—less refined than Adrak, more prosperous than anywhere else.

#### Greyport

A southern port that suffers from the dragon Chavux's raids on nearby shipping. Merchants here would pay well to have the dragon problem "solved," though killing a dragon remains sacrilege in Adron.

#### The Blades

A collection of islands off the southwest coast. Chavux, a green dragon, lairs on one of the northern islands and terrorizes ships passing through the strait.

#### Ámas Kiori

The sacred basin north of Adrak, holy land to all dragonborn. The entire region is considered sacred ground.

#### Stillwater

Within Ámas Kiori, north of Adrak in the central basin. A sacred pool guarded by Naga priests where time bends—eddies where time races, and a still center where it stops entirely. Located near the intersection of the water and time ley lines.

#### The Salt Moors

Salt marshes in the lowlands, source of preserving salt for the fishing industry.

#### Mountain Ranges

**Gozwin Mountains**: Eastern coast along the Denrik Sea. Source of red gold and home to Waterdark.

**Majesty Mountains**: Northeastern range. Rich in red gold. The self-styled Dwarf King lurks here, claiming ancestral rights and robbing travelers.

**Shrieking Peaks**: Southern range, named for the wind that howls through the passes.

**Drakespine Mountains**: Central range running north-south, dividing eastern and western Adron. Named for the dragon riders who once patrolled its peaks.

#### Waterdark

Hidden within the Gozwin Mountains. The fortress of the secret order that severed the dragon-bonds four centuries ago. Masters of water and darkness magic. The fortress appears empty unless you know what to look for. The order continues its work in shadow, pursuing goals known only to themselves.

#### Western Lakes

Several towns dot the shores of lakes in western Adron. Beneath the waters lie drowned Triton ruins—remnants of the civilization that inhabited this land before fleeing to the Alrock Ocean eons ago.

#### Stillstone

A fortress in the mountains, exact purpose unclear.

#### Gemecas

A point of interest in eastern Adron, near the Gozwin Mountains.

### Alacayir

### Anarak

Tags: state, nation

A basin nation ruled by the black dragon Tepheranos, squeezed between the Crags of Geth to the south and Argysis in the Kharvorn Mountains to the north. The population has been brainwashed over a century to see their dragon overlord as a savior rather than a tyrant.

Anarak is militaristic, isolated, and hungry for expansion—but locked in a standoff with Argysis, where Tepheranos's treacherous brother Rothogomos rules.

#### Tephrakus

The capital city, built at the base of the Black Hills near Tepheranos's lair. A grim, orderly city where loyalty to the dragon is mandatory and dissent is dangerous. Heavy taxation funds the military while most citizens live in poverty.

#### Nidzhoni

The other major city, located in the center of the basin. More agricultural than Tephrakus, serving as the breadbasket that feeds the military machine.

#### The Black Hills

A range of dark hills in the northern part of the basin, where Tepheranos makes his lair. The hills are considered the heart of Anarak's power—and its oppression.

#### The Basin

The great basin that forms Anarak's territory—grassland and farmland stretching between the mountains. Good agricultural land, heavily taxed, worked by a population that believes their sacrifices serve a noble cause.

#### Borders

- **North**: Argysis (enemy) in the Kharvorn Mountains
- **South**: The Crags of Geth (Griselia) — source of goblin raids
- **West**: Erasnus (barely) — a potential target
- **East**: Other Kharvorn foothills

#### The Dragon Feud

Tepheranos and Rothogomos were brothers who came to conquer Argysis together. Rothogomos betrayed Tepheranos, taking the dwarven treasure for himself. Tepheranos retreated to Anarak, built it into a regional power, and now both dragons plot each other's destruction.

Neither can strike elsewhere while the other lives. Anarak is stronger but vulnerable; Argysis is weaker but fortified. The standoff has lasted generations.

### Azawahasi

Tags: state, nation

Azawahasi is Sharabha homeland—a vast expanse of savanna and grassland where the lion-folk have roamed since Shara Bolasi's blood transformed the land. There are no cities here, no permanent settlements, just the endless grass, the great herds, and the tribes that follow them. The landscape is beautiful in a harsh way: golden plains stretching to the horizon, scattered acacia trees, and skies so big they make you feel small.

The Sharabha live as their ancestors did—nomadic, proud, bound by honor codes older than most nations. Outsiders find Azawahasi difficult to navigate, not because of the terrain but because there are no roads, no inns, no markets. You either know a tribe or you're on your own.

#### Plains of Eregnar

The southern heartland of Azawahasi, named for a legendary Sharabha hero whose deeds are still sung around campfires. The Plains of Eregnar are prime hunting ground—open grassland that supports enormous herds of antelope, wildebeest, and the massive creatures the Sharabha prize as worthy prey.

Multiple tribes range across the Plains, following the seasonal movements of the herds. Territorial boundaries exist but are fluid, negotiated through gift exchange and ritual rather than fences or markers. A tribe that needs to cross another's territory asks permission; refusing without good reason is a serious breach of honor.

The land here still carries traces of Shara Bolasi's sacrifice. Sharabha report feeling stronger on the Plains, more connected to their ancestral heritage. Some claim the soil itself glows faintly on moonless nights, though outsiders have never confirmed this.

#### Forest of Esperanza

The northern reaches of Azawahasi give way to the Forest of Esperanza, a dense woodland that marks the transition between savanna and the more temperate regions beyond. The forest is old, its trees tall and closely spaced, providing shelter from the sun and wind that dominates the open plains.

Some Sharabha tribes range into Esperanza's edges, hunting the forest game that differs from their usual savanna prey. The forest offers different challenges—dense undergrowth, limited sightlines, prey that hides rather than runs. Tribes that specialize in forest hunting have adapted their techniques accordingly.

The deeper forest remains largely unexplored by the Sharabha. They're plains people at heart, uncomfortable in enclosed spaces where their lion forms lose their advantage. Whatever lives in Esperanza's interior has been left alone.

#### The Central Hills

Unnamed hills rise in Azawahasi's central region, breaking up the flat expanse of the surrounding grassland. The hills aren't dramatic—rolling terrain rather than peaks—but they provide valuable variety: sheltered camps during storms, vantage points for spotting game, and reliable springs that don't dry up in the hot season.

Several important seasonal camps cluster in the central hills. Tribes converge here during certain times of year, making the hills a natural meeting ground where news is exchanged, marriages are arranged, and inter-tribal disputes are settled.

#### The Eastern Coast

Azawahasi's eastern edge meets the Middle Sea along a stretch of coastal plains and rocky shores. The Sharabha aren't seafaring people—they have little interest in boats or fishing—but the coastal regions offer good hunting and reliable water sources.

A few tribes specialize in coastal living, hunting the seabirds and marine mammals that inhabit the shore. They're viewed as slightly eccentric by plains tribes but respected for adapting to different terrain while maintaining traditional values.

#### The Western Border

Azawahasi's western edge transitions into the goblin plains—first the Jinxz Plains, then the Shiverplains beyond. The border isn't a line on a map; it's where Sharabha territory ends and goblin chaos begins.

Relations with the Scalawag broods are tense but stable. The goblins raid occasionally; the Sharabha retaliate devastatingly. Neither side commits to full warfare because neither side would benefit. The goblins get occasional loot and entertainment; the Sharabha get practice and a reminder not to grow complacent.

#### Seasonal Camps

The Sharabha don't build permanent settlements, but they return to reliable locations seasonally—watering holes that don't dry up, sheltered valleys for the rainy season, high ground when floods threaten. These camps accumulate over generations: fire pits, storage caches, sacred sites where important ceremonies occurred.

A tribe's seasonal circuit is part of its identity. Young Sharabha learn the route before they can walk, memorizing water sources, hunting grounds, and the stories attached to each location. Changing the circuit requires serious justification—drought, territorial conflict, or the rare decision to seek new land.

#### Wildlife

Azawahasi teems with life. Herds of antelope and wildebeest number in the thousands, moving across the plains in patterns the Sharabha have studied for generations. Elephants roam in family groups, dangerous but respected. Lions—actual lions, not transformed Sharabha—hunt the same prey the tribes do, sometimes competing, sometimes coexisting.

The relationship between Sharabha and natural lions is complicated. The lion-folk feel kinship with their animal counterparts but don't romanticize them. Lions are predators, occasionally dangerous, to be treated with caution and respect. Some tribes believe natural lions are Shara Bolasi's untransformed children; others consider this sentimental nonsense.

#### Outsiders in Azawahasi

Visiting Azawahasi without tribal connections is difficult and potentially dangerous. There are no services for travelers—no inns, no guides, no supplies for purchase. The land is harsh for those who don't know its rhythms.

Outsiders who want to enter properly must find a tribe willing to host them, which means gifts, introductions, and patience. The Sharabha aren't hostile to strangers, but they don't trust easily. Prove yourself honorable and you'll be welcomed; prove yourself otherwise and you'll be asked to leave—or made to leave.

Merchants from the United Free Nations have established relationships with some coastal tribes, conducting careful gift-exchange trade for Sharabha leather and beadwork. These relationships took years to build and are guarded jealously by the merchants who maintain them.

### Azuros

Tags: state, nation

Azuros clings to the highest peaks of northern Erpeus, a collection of stone villages surrounding the ancient Shogi Monastery. The wind here never stops—it scours the rocks, howls through the passes, and shapes everything about life on the mountain. The monks who live here have learned to work with that wind, developing air magic techniques that produce results other practitioners consider impossible.

Reaching Azuros requires climbing through Lier's Murder Hills and then ascending paths that would challenge mountain goats. Most people never try. Those who do arrive in a place that feels untouched by time—the same stone buildings, the same rituals, the same silence that has defined the monastery for centuries.

#### The Shogi Monastery

The heart of Azuros, a complex of stone buildings that have grown organically over centuries. The architecture is simple, functional, and ancient—nothing decorative, nothing wasted. The monastery houses training halls, meditation chambers, libraries of wind-worn texts, and the quarters of the monks who've dedicated their lives to the order.

The Council of the Silent Elders governs from here, each member a head monk of one of the monastery's subsects. They meet rarely and speak less—most governance happens through tradition and mutual understanding rather than explicit decision.

Above even the Council is the Rhea monk, the mysterious figure who teaches the most advanced practitioners. The Rhea monk's quarters lie at the monastery's highest point, accessible only to those summoned. What happens there, no one discusses.

#### Azur

The largest village, positioned along the primary path to the monastery. Pilgrims and the rare traders stop here before the final ascent. The residents are laypeople—families who support the monastery through farming and crafts but haven't taken full vows. Life is simple, governed by the monastery's rhythms.

#### Pul

A smaller settlement higher up the mountain, home to monks in the middle stages of their training. The buildings here are even more austere than Azur's—stone boxes with minimal furnishings, designed to minimize distraction from practice.

#### The Peaks

Above the settlements, the mountains rise into regions where only the most advanced monks venture. The wind here is constant and violent, the air thin enough to challenge unprepared climbers. Monks who've mastered air attunement walk these heights as easily as lowlanders walk meadows—floating on currents, drawing breath from wind that would suffocate others.

The highest peaks are sacred spaces where the most powerful monks meditate, sometimes for weeks at a time. What they seek or find there, they don't share with outsiders.

#### The Path to Azuros

Reaching the monastery requires traversing Lier's Murder Hills—a journey dangerous enough that many pilgrims never arrive. The monks don't acknowledge this problem. Violence is forbidden, even in self-defense, and they won't escort travelers or clear the roads.

Some pilgrims hire guards in Hessam. Others travel in groups for safety. Many turn back. Those who make it through arrive at Azuros exhausted, robbed, sometimes wounded—and find no sympathy. The journey is considered the first test of devotion.

#### Air Magic Tradition

The Shogi Monastery has developed air magic techniques found nowhere else on Alaria. Students begin by learning to feel the wind—not just as weather but as a presence, a partner, eventually an extension of themselves.

Advanced practitioners achieve remarkable abilities:
- **Wind-walking**: Moving across air as if it were solid ground
- **Storm-speaking**: Communicating with or through weather phenomena
- **Lightning-calling**: Drawing electrical discharge from the clouds
- **Flight**: True flight, not just gliding or jumping—sustained movement through the air

The greatest monks are said to become one with the wind itself, their physical forms optional. Whether this is truth or legend, no outsider has confirmed.

#### Relations with the World

Azuros doesn't have relations with the world—it has an absence of them. The monastery trades nothing, fights no one, and participates in no politics. Lier's merchants have tried repeatedly to establish commerce; they always fail. The gnomes of Mkinti don't bother trying.

Occasionally, a trained monk leaves the monastery to serve elsewhere—as a teacher, advisor, or guardian. These departures are never purchased or requested. The monk simply knows they're called to go. Their abilities make them valuable, but they serve on their own terms and leave when they choose.

The outside world views Azuros with a mixture of awe and frustration. The monks possess powers that could change the course of wars, and they refuse to use them. They hold knowledge that scholars would kill for, and they share nothing. They're admired and resented in equal measure—and they don't seem to notice either.

### Bestacia

Tags: state, nation

A Goshwen gnome republic on the Middle Sea coast, known for scholarship, invention, and a complete lack of military ambition. Bestacia is one of the happiest places on Alaria—pleasant climate, good food, rewarding intellectual culture. The gnomes here would rather tinker than fight.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. Currently dealing with the Ubrik refugee crisis, silvertongue incursions, and escalating tensions with Watar over the Telphineas Strait.

#### Petra

The capital city. A charming, well-organized gnome city full of workshops, academies, and comfortable homes. The government operates through elected councils—debates are lively, decisions are slow, and everyone has opinions.

#### Kisoy

The second major city, located just north of the southern mountains. Kisoy is the gateway to the mountain passes and the closest Bestacia gets to the Telphineas Strait. More militarily minded than Petra (which isn't saying much), it houses what passes for Bestacia's border defenses.

#### Pastrova

A town famous for one of the best law schools in Alaria. Scholars come from across the Middle Sea to study here. Bestacian legal experts are in high demand—they've made careers out of finding loopholes and crafting airtight contracts.

#### The Southern Mountains

The mountain range separating Bestacia from the Telphineas Strait. These peaks are home to a remarkable variety of creatures—some native, some introduced by curious Goshwen naturalists over the centuries. The gnomes have a fondness for exotic fauna, and the mountains have become an informal preserve.

Crossing the mountains is difficult. Bestacia's lack of control over the strait stems partly from this geographic barrier.

#### The Forests

Temperate woodlands cover much of Bestacia's interior. They'd be lovely if not for the ghouls.

The forests are infested with these soulless undead—remnants of ancient wizard experiments, driven by eternal hunger. They hunt travelers, lurk in the deep woods, and occasionally raid isolated settlements. The gnomes can't exterminate them; their military is too weak, and killing ghouls requires elemental magic or overwhelming force.

Most Bestacians simply avoid the deep forests. Ghoul hunters visit occasionally. The problem persists.

#### Telphineas Strait

South of the mountains, this strait is a crucial trade chokepoint connecting different parts of the Middle Sea. Control means tariffs, influence, and economic leverage.

Bestacia wants it. Watar wants it. Bestacia has brains and intrigue; Watar has ships and soldiers. The situation is deteriorating.

### Cacklehills

Tags: hills, region

The Cacklehills rise east of the Elephant Groves, a stretch of broken, rocky terrain that got its name from the hyenas that infest the area. At night, their laughter echoes off the stones—a sound that carries for miles and makes sleep difficult for anyone not used to it.

#### The Hyena Problem

The hills are home to an unusually large hyena population—packs that have grown bold over generations, learning that the terrain favors them and that most travelers would rather flee than fight. They're not magical, not cursed, just extremely successful predators who've claimed this territory as their own.

The hyenas hunt in coordinated packs, using the rocky terrain to funnel prey into ambushes. They're smart enough to avoid the Elephant Groves (the spirit there doesn't tolerate them) and smart enough to recognize when a target is too dangerous. But anything that looks weak, slow, or alone is fair game.

#### Geography

The Cacklehills are rugged but not high—more broken ground than true mountains. Rocky outcroppings, steep gullies, scattered caves, and scrubby vegetation that provides just enough cover for predators. The terrain is difficult to traverse and easy to get lost in.

Water is scarce. The few springs and seasonal streams are fiercely contested by both wildlife and any travelers foolish enough to need them. Smart travelers carry their own water and cross the hills as quickly as possible.

#### Strategic Position

The Cacklehills sit between the Elephant Groves and the United Free Nations to the southeast. Anyone traveling overland between these regions must either cross the hills, circle around through goblin territory, or find another route entirely.

This has made the Cacklehills a natural barrier—not quite impassable, but dangerous enough that casual travel is discouraged. The United Free Nations uses this to their advantage; the hills provide a buffer against whatever might come from the west.

#### Who Uses the Hills

Aside from the hyenas, the Cacklehills see occasional use by:

**Smugglers**: The terrain is excellent for avoiding detection. Those who know the hidden paths can move goods between regions without passing through watched territories.

**Outlaws**: Anyone fleeing authority from any direction might hide in the Cacklehills. It's miserable living, but better than capture.

**Hunters**: Some specialized hunters track the hyenas for sport, bounty, or because someone paid them to reduce the population. This last category rarely succeeds; the hyenas breed faster than they can be killed.

#### The Laughter

The cackling that gives the hills their name is unsettling even when you know its source. The hyenas call to each other constantly—coordinating hunts, establishing territory, apparently just enjoying the sound of their own voices. At night, in unfamiliar terrain, surrounded by echoing laughter from every direction, even hardened travelers have been known to panic.

Local legend claims the hyenas are laughing at something specific—a cosmic joke, a shared memory, the foolishness of anyone who enters their territory. The hyenas, of course, aren't saying.

### Camaran

Tags: state, nation

A human republic south of the Kharvorn Mountains, known for its manufacturing economy, anti-magic laws, and rigid bureaucracy. Camaran produces non-magical goods for export across the Middle Sea—tools, textiles, clockwork, precision instruments. The population is industrious, educated, and deeply suspicious of Deoric magic.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though increasingly isolationist. Vetoed Echea's membership. The alliance is strained by Camaran's inward turn.

#### Rathscar

The capital city, seat of the High Camarik Council. A city of orderly streets, imposing civic buildings, and endless paperwork. This is where mages must register for licenses if they wish to practice elemental magic legally. The bureaucracy is legendary—inspectors, forms, annual renewals, restricted zones.

Manufacturing district produces goods shipped across the Middle Sea. The wealthy live in townhouses near the council halls; workers crowd tenements near the factories.

#### Breidlheiss Basin

The giant-inhabited basin east of Camaran, between Camaran and Adron. Camaran runs mining operations in the foothills, encroaching on giant territory while insisting the giants have no legitimate land claims. When giants retaliate, Camaran launches "defensive" expeditions and claims more land as security buffer.

The situation is morally grey: Camaran portrays giants as savage aggressors, but the aggression is largely retaliatory. Some Camarans who've dealt with the Ngül Mountain communities know giants can coexist peacefully with smaller folk—but admitting this would threaten mining interests.

#### Ngül Mountains

Northern mountains home to Güli mountain giants and thousands of Kimril who live peacefully alongside them. This community proves giants aren't inherently hostile—an inconvenient truth for Camaran's official position on the Breidlheiss situation.

#### Foothills and Farmland

Most of Camaran is temperate farmland and rolling hills, fed by rivers flowing down from the Kharvorn. Small towns dot the countryside, supplying food and raw materials to the manufacturing centers. The climate is continental—cold winters, warm summers, reliable rain.

### Desert of One Million Shards

Tags: desert, geography, Yolus breach, Scorching of Clueanda

The Desert of One Million Shards is the scarred remains of **The Scorching of Clueanda**, a catastrophic breach of the Yolus plane approximately 25,000 BSD. Three Infernals—building-sized entities of pure fire—emerged from the breach and walked the land for weeks, their passage incinerating everything in their wake. The oasis kingdoms that once flourished in this region were utterly obliterated.

In desperation, fire mages attempted to redirect the overwhelming heat to prevent further devastation. However, their efforts only spread the destruction wider across the landscape. The concentrated and dispersed heat fused vast stretches of sand into glass for hundreds of miles in every direction. Over the millennia, this glass has been sandblasted and fractured by winds and weathering, creating immense fields of jagged glass shards that give the desert its ominous name.

The deepest shards still harbor echoes of that ancient catastrophe—Cinder Swarms occasionally emerge from the fractured glass depths, drawn forth by heat and flame-magic, serving as a grim reminder of the Infernals' terrible passage.

Rocs in the nearby mountains now hunt large prey by lifting them up into the sky, and dropping them on the desert to break their bones before bringing them back to their enormous nests in the mountains.

### Echea

Tags: state, nation

A tiny gnomish magocracy on a mountainous peninsula at the tip of the Watar peninsula, jutting into the Middle Sea. Echea is essentially two enormous mountains—the Iri Mountains—covered in universities, research facilities, and the workshops that produce some of the finest magitech in Alaria.

Vetoed from the Aldriktch Trade Alliance by Camaran. The Echi don't seem to care much—they're too busy with scholarship to worry about trade politics.

#### Adi Assabehta

The capital city, built into and around the larger of the two Iri peaks. A vertical city of towers, bridges, and carved chambers, home to the greatest universities in Alaria. Paragon-attuned elementalists teach here in every discipline. Students come from across the world to study, and work on magical artifacts part-time to fund their education.

**The Secret:** A mad scholar opened a portal to Zylogmus Eternus, binding the entire city to the flipside of the Material Plane. People are mysteriously dying—slowly, inexplicably. The scholar was the first to die. No one knows about the portal. Most residents don't believe the deaths are connected, attributing them to various causes. Over the coming years, the capital will slowly empty as people flee what they don't understand.

#### Adal

The second city, on the smaller Iri peak. More focused on practical applications of magic—forges, workshops, and the production facilities where university artifacts are manufactured for export.

#### The Iri Mountains

The two massive peaks that make up almost all of Echea's territory. Once, the Echi gnomes and Coghead goblins worked these mountains together—gnomes providing magic, goblins providing machinery. That partnership ended in massacre two centuries ago, and another genocide fifty years ago finished what remained. The Echi don't talk about it.

The mountains are riddled with old tunnels, abandoned Coghead workshops, and sealed chambers that the universities prefer to forget exist.

#### The Universities

Echea's universities are its heart. They function as schools, research institutions, artifact factories, and military academies all at once. Every student learns elemental magic, combat tactics, and practical crafting. The result is a population of highly educated elemental war casters who rarely fight—but when they do, they're terrifying.

The universities compete fiercely for prestige, funding, and the best students. Academic politics in Echea can be as vicious as any court intrigue.

#### Coastal Settlements

Small fishing villages cling to the rocky coastline below the mountains. These communities exist mostly to feed the cities above and provide port access for visiting scholars and trade ships.

### Eidlsandres

Tags: city, state, nation

Eidlsandres doesn't exist. Ask the goblins of the plains, and they'll tell you the Bygone Hills are cursed—people who go in don't come out. Ask the Eloweir, and they'll shrug and say they've never had reason to explore those hills. Ask anyone else, and they've never heard of the place.

That's by design.

Hidden in the Bygone Hills, protected by generations of accumulated illusion magic, Eidlsandres is a gnomish city-state that has perfected the art of not being found. The air leyline running through the hills powers an intricate web of deceptions—false paths, phantom terrain, misleading landmarks—that keeps the outside world out and the gnomes safely invisible.

#### The Hidden City

Eidlsandres itself sits in a valley that doesn't appear on any map and can't be found by any conventional means. The architecture is distinctly gnomish—built into hillsides, under overhangs, blending with the landscape even without magical concealment. The gnomes could hide without illusions; the magic just makes it certain.

The city is larger than its isolation would suggest. Centuries of uninterrupted building have created a sophisticated settlement with libraries, workshops, homes, and public spaces. The gnomes want for nothing they can provide themselves, which turns out to be almost everything.

The council of master illusionists governs from a chamber at the leyline's strongest point, where the air magic pools and the most complex spells can be sustained indefinitely.

#### The Bygone Hills

The hills surrounding Eidlsandres are the first line of defense—and for most intruders, the last. Every path through the hills is false. Every landmark is positioned to mislead. The terrain itself has been altered over centuries to create natural dead ends, hidden drops, and circular routes that lead nowhere.

Travelers who enter the Bygone Hills experience a gradual disorientation. They think they're making progress, but they're walking in spirals. They think they see a pass through the hills, but it's a projected image over a cliff face. They think they remember the way they came, but they don't.

Most eventually wander out, confused and frustrated, certain they've been through haunted or cursed land. Some don't make it out—lost, starving, or falling into concealed hazards. The goblins of the plains have learned, through generations of loss, to simply avoid the hills entirely.

#### The Air Leyline

A major air leyline runs through the Bygone Hills, surfacing at several points within the protected zone. This leyline is Eidlsandres's power source—the reason the gnomes chose this location and the foundation of everything they've built.

Air magic has natural affinity with illusion, misdirection, and subtle influence. The gnomes have spent centuries learning to tap the leyline's power for their defensive works. The resulting illusions aren't crude phantasms but sophisticated reality alterations—light bent around obstacles, sounds redirected, even smells masked or fabricated.

The leyline's physical manifestation points are the most sacred and guarded locations in Eidlsandres. Damaging them would unravel centuries of work.

#### The Agricultural Valleys

Self-sufficiency requires food. The gnomes cultivate several hidden valleys within the hills, growing grains, vegetables, and fruit trees. Livestock graze in concealed meadows. Springs and streams provide fresh water.

These agricultural areas are protected by the same illusions as the city—invisible from outside, accessible only to those who know the real paths. Gnomish farmers tend their fields with one eye on their crops and one on the maintenance spells woven into the landscape.

#### What Outsiders Experience

A goblin approaching the Bygone Hills sees unremarkable terrain—rocky, sparse, not worth exploring. If they enter anyway, they find themselves on paths that seem clear but lead nowhere. Landmarks shift between glances. The sun seems to move wrong. After hours or days of fruitless wandering, they emerge back where they started, or somewhere else entirely, with no clear memory of what happened.

A more perceptive intruder—a mage, perhaps, or someone with unusual sensitivity—might notice the illusions. The edges shimmer if you look too hard. The paths feel wrong even when they look right. But noticing the deception doesn't help; the illusions are layered, and penetrating one just reveals another beneath it.

The gnomes monitor their borders through scrying and subtle magic. If someone gets too close to the truth, they take action—usually a targeted memory adjustment, a stronger misdirection, a compulsion to leave. Violence is a last resort, and in centuries of isolation, it's rarely been necessary.

#### Why They Hide

The gnomes of Eidlsandres have been hiding so long that the original reason has become almost mythological. They know their ancestors fled something—persecution, war, magical threat—but the specifics have faded. What remains is the conviction that the outside world is dangerous, that exposure means risk, and that safety lies in being forgotten.

Some younger gnomes wonder if the threat has passed, if isolation is still necessary. The elders respond with the same answer they've given for generations: the outside world hasn't earned trust, and Eidlsandres has everything it needs. Why take chances?

And so the illusions persist, the city remains hidden, and the Bygone Hills keep their secrets.

### Elephant Groves

Tags: forest, sacred, region

The Elephant Groves are the largest forest in the region—a vast, ancient woodland that serves as the birthplace and spiritual homeland of the loxodon race. The forest is sacred ground, protected by an ancient elephant spirit that does not welcome uninvited visitors.

#### Sacred to Loxodon

This is where the loxodon emerged as a people. The first of their kind awakened here, blessed by forces that predate recorded history, and the forest has been central to loxodon identity ever since. Every loxodon knows the Elephant Groves exist, even if they've never visited; it's woven into their cultural memory.

Loxodon pilgrims journey here to connect with their origins, to seek wisdom at the Pool of Knowledge, and to walk among the ancient trees where their ancestors first drew breath. For them, the forest is welcoming—paths open, the spirit watches benevolently, and the Groves feel like home.

#### The Guardian Spirit

An ancient elephant spirit protects the Groves. This isn't a metaphor or a legend—the spirit is real, present, and active. It manifests when needed, sometimes as a massive spectral elephant, sometimes as a pressure in the air, sometimes as the forest itself responding to threats.

The spirit actively repels intruders. Those who enter the Groves without welcome find themselves turned around, walking in circles, suddenly convinced they should leave. Those who persist face more direct intervention—fallen trees blocking paths, sudden floods, the ground itself becoming treacherous. Those who still don't take the hint encounter the spirit directly, and that rarely ends well.

The goblins of the Jinxz Plains have learned through generations of loss that the Elephant Groves are not to be entered. They raid the forest edges for resources—fallen wood, herbs growing at the boundary—but they never go deep. Something in there doesn't like them, and goblins who venture too far don't return.

#### The Pool of Knowledge

Deep within the Groves lies the Pool of Knowledge—a sacred body of water with remarkable properties. Those who drink from the Pool gain wisdom beyond their natural capacity. The transformation is permanent; a drinker's mind expands, their insight deepens, and they understand things they couldn't grasp before.

In game terms, the Pool grants Wisdom 20 to those who drink from it. If a drinker already has Wisdom 20, it increases to 22.

The Pool isn't easy to reach. The forest protects it, the spirit guards it, and only those deemed worthy can find the path. Loxodon pilgrims sometimes spend years proving themselves before the forest allows them through. Non-loxodon rarely even learn the Pool exists, let alone locate it.

#### The Forest Itself

The Elephant Groves are enormous—the largest continuous forest in the region by a significant margin. Ancient trees tower hundreds of feet, their canopy so thick that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight. The undergrowth is dense but traversable for those who know the way.

The wildlife is abundant and, within the forest, peaceful. Elephants roam freely—not the spirit, but ordinary elephants who've made the Groves their home. Other animals show unusual calm, as if the spirit's protection extends to everything within the forest boundaries.

The air smells of growing things, water, and something else—something old and patient that defies description. First-time visitors often report feeling watched, which they are.

#### Surrounding Regions

The Elephant Groves border the goblin plains to the north, the Cacklehills to the east, and wilder territories to the south. The forest serves as a stabilizing presence—the spirit's protection prevents the chaos of surrounding regions from spreading, and the Groves themselves are a constant in a landscape defined by conflict.

The United Free Nations to the southeast maintain respectful distance. They've learned that the forest doesn't want contact and that attempting to exploit its resources ends badly. Trade with the loxodon, when it happens, occurs outside the forest proper.

#### For Players

The Elephant Groves offer several potential hooks:

- **Loxodon pilgrimage**: A loxodon character seeking the Pool of Knowledge
- **The spirit's bargain**: Non-loxodon might be allowed in if the spirit needs something done
- **Border defense**: Helping the Eloweir or United Free Nations deal with something that emerged from the Groves
- **The goblin problem**: The spirit tolerated a goblin incursion for mysterious reasons—what are they after, and why did the Groves allow it?
- **Lost history**: Talarian ruins might exist somewhere in the Groves, predating even the loxodon—but finding them means convincing the spirit to cooperate

### Eloesi

Tags: state, nation

Eloesi occupies the northwestern coast where the landmass connecting Ofrenia to the southern interior meets the sea. It's Eloweir territory—sea elves who've lived here longer than anyone can remember, building curved cities that mirror the tides and harvesting the legendary pearls of Oyster Bay. The coast is rocky and dramatic, the interior rolls into forested hills, and the people are simultaneously laid-back and lethally competent.

#### Kair

The capital city, built around a natural harbor on Elessi Bay. Kair's architecture follows Eloweir tradition—curved lines, circular plazas, buildings that flow into each other like water. The city feels organic, grown rather than constructed, though the engineering behind that appearance is sophisticated.

The council chambers occupy a headland overlooking the harbor, a reminder that in Eloesi, political power answers to the sea. Markets sprawl along the waterfront, trading pearls, fish, poisons, and goods from across the Middle Sea.

#### Oyster Bay

The smaller bay just south of Kair, and the source of Eloesi's famous pearls. The waters here are shallow, warm, and perfect for oyster cultivation. Eloweir pearl divers have refined their techniques over generations, producing gems that command premium prices across Alaria.

The bay is carefully managed—harvesting quotas, seasonal restrictions, protected breeding areas. The councils take the pearl trade seriously, and poaching is punished severely.

#### Elessi Bay

The main bay on Eloesi's western coast, sheltering Kair and several smaller settlements. The waters are deep enough for ocean-going vessels, and the harbor never freezes. Most trade passes through here.

#### Urchin Bay

The large bay south of Oyster Bay, named for the giant urchins that make it treacherous. The waters are deeper, colder, and far more dangerous. Ships that venture in report seeing massive spined shapes in the murky depths—and those are the ships that come back.

Rumors persist of treasure in Urchin Bay—centuries of wrecked ships accumulated on the bottom. Expeditions occasionally form to recover it. Most fail expensively.

#### The Seawatch Mountains

A range of hills and low mountains in south-central Eloesi. "Mountains" is generous—they're more like tall hills—but they provide timber, grazing land, and a natural barrier between the coast and the interior plains. Watchtowers dot the heights, originally built to spot approaching threats from the south.

#### Coastal Settlements

##### Issasmir

A northern port town, smaller than Kair but prosperous. Shipyards here build the sturdy coastal vessels the Eloweir favor.

##### Brachly & Dematir

Twin towns on the eastern edge of Eloweir territory, near where the forest gives way to plains. They serve as trading posts with the goblin tribes—when the goblins feel like trading instead of raiding.

##### Oakdale

An interior town in the forested hills, known for timber and woodworking.

##### Trailsfor

A town at a crossroads in the southern hills, where paths from the coast meet routes heading south toward Old Talaria's ruins.

##### Zessos, Golun, Holckots

Smaller settlements scattered through the interior, mostly agricultural communities supporting the coastal cities.

##### Krakersport

A southern coastal town near the border with the Glass Forest. The people here have learned to live with strangeness drifting across from Old Talaria—trees that move when you're not watching, animals that speak in riddles, weather that doesn't match the sky. It's not safe, exactly, but it's home.

#### The Eastern Border

Eloesi's eastern edge fades into Glidwyn Forest and then the open plains beyond. The border is more ecological than political—where the Eloweir forests end and the goblin grasslands begin. Relations with the Scalawag broods are chaotic but manageable; the goblins raid occasionally, the Eloweir retaliate, and life continues.

#### The Southwestern Border

The Glass Forest marks where Eloesi ends and Old Talaria's ruins begin. The Eloweir maintain watchtowers along this border, keeping an eye on what emerges from the fae-touched wilderness. Most days, nothing happens. Some days, something does.

### Erasnus

Tags: state, nation

A Belenstrope halfling nation in the central Middle Sea region, defined by trade, diplomacy, and a complete inability to fight. Erasnus sits at the crossroads of everything—bordered by Camaran, Ubrik, Myorna, the Hephake mountains, Anarak, and Griselia. They've made fortunes by trading with everyone and fighting no one.

Member and key proponent of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance. The alliance is most profitable for Erasnus, and they are desperately trying to hold it together as tensions between member states escalate.

#### Erdene

The capital city, seat of both the House of Nobles and the House of Commerce. A sprawling trade hub where deals are struck in every tavern, market, and noble house. The architecture reflects centuries of accumulated wealth—ornate but practical, designed to impress clients.

#### Minoz

Major city in the east, near the Camaran border. Hub for overland trade routes heading toward the eastern Middle Sea states.

#### Adnar

Major city in the south, positioned for trade with Ubrik and the southeastern routes. Currently dealing with refugee overflow from the silvertongue crisis.

#### Traduci

Major city in the west, gateway to the Crags of Geth and trade with the Griselian goblin city-states. Site of the most theatrical diplomatic incidents with goblin delegations.

#### Simonsor

Major city in the north, near the Hephake mountain passes. Trade routes through the Kharvorn run through here.

#### Novglim Forest

Northeastern forest, just south of Myorna. Native gnome tribes once lived here; most have been displaced by logging and settlement expansion. The situation is an open wound that Erasnun society prefers not to discuss.

#### The Crags of Geth

Mountain range along the western border, separating Erasnus from Griselia and the goblin city-states beyond. The passes are well-traveled despite (or because of) the goblins' constant theatrical threats of invasion.

#### Trade Roads

Erasnus is crisscrossed with maintained trade roads connecting every major city to its neighbors. The roads are the nation's true infrastructure—better maintained than any military fortification, because trade is what matters.

### Erpeus

Tags: island, geography

Erpeus is a major island in the Middle Sea, positioned between Ofrenia to the east and the mainland to the west. Three distinct states share the island—the wind-monk theocracy of Azuros in the northern peaks, the merchant republic of Lier in the central hills, and the gem-gnome oligarchy of Mkinti in the southwestern mountains. They couldn't be more different, and they manage to coexist through a combination of geographic separation and mutual disinterest.

#### Geography

Erpeus is mountainous, with the highest peaks in the north (Azuros) and southwest (Mkinti's Gemstone Peaks). The central region (Lier) is lower, with rolling hills suitable for agriculture, though even here the terrain is rugged by mainland standards.

The island's shape is irregular, with a pronounced peninsula in the north where Azuros clings to the heights, and a bulge in the southwest where Mkinti's mountains dominate. The coastline is rocky and dramatic throughout, with few natural harbors—Hessam in Lier being the notable exception.

#### The Three States

##### Azuros

The northernmost territory, home to the Shogi Monastery and its air-attuned monks. Azuros occupies the island's highest peaks, accessible only through difficult mountain paths. The monks have lived here for centuries in deliberate isolation, developing wind magic to extraordinary levels while ignoring the outside world entirely.

##### Lier

The central territory, controlled by human merchant families operating out of Hessam. Lier serves as the commercial hub of Erpeus, handling trade between the reclusive gnomes of Mkinti and the broader Middle Sea. The Bay of Whispers, a supernatural phenomenon where words echo across time, draws seekers of forbidden knowledge.

##### Mkinti

The southwestern territory, domain of the Ohblex gem gnomes. Mkinti is defined by the Gemstone Peaks—mountains riddled with precious stones and honeycombed with trapped tunnels. The gnomes are the sole keepers of clockwork secrets on Alaria, and they guard those secrets with paranoid intensity. Recent political upheaval has thrown Mkinti into crisis, with four of five ruling houses suddenly headless.

#### Major Features

##### The Murder Hills

The highland region between Lier and Azuros, dangerous enough that the name stuck. Bandits, monsters, and worse shelter in the rocky terrain, preying on travelers attempting to reach the monastery. Neither Lier nor Azuros takes responsibility for clearing them out.

##### Devil's Crest

A dramatic volcanic formation on the border between Lier and Mkinti. The jagged peaks are largely uninhabited, and local legends suggest something ancient and dangerous lurks within. Travelers avoid the area when possible.

##### The Gemstone Peaks

Mkinti's mountain range, famous for the precious stones embedded throughout. The Ohblex have mined these peaks for generations, building underground cities that extend far beneath the surface.

##### The Bay of Whispers

The supernatural bay outside Hessam, where spoken words are captured forever and can be heard across time. The phenomenon draws scholars, mystics, and desperate seekers from across the Middle Sea.

##### The Bejeweled Palace

An abandoned palace in Mkinti, cursed and avoided. The treasury of an ancient gnome king lies within, along with whatever killed him and his entire court. No one has successfully plundered it; few who've tried have returned.

#### Surrounding Waters

##### Okesha's Passage

The strait northwest of Erpeus, connecting different portions of the Middle Sea. Ships traveling between the western Middle Sea and points east often pass through here.

##### Tiber's Passage

The strait south of Erpeus, between the island and Tykos to the south. The waters here are busy with traffic moving between Erpeus, Tykos, and Ofrenia.

##### Tykon Channel

The waters east of Erpeus and west of Ofrenia, separating Erpeus from the three kingdoms' ongoing civil war. Traffic through the Tykon Channel has declined since Alisandra's conquest disrupted regional trade.

#### Relations Between States

The three states of Erpeus exist in a state of mutual tolerance rather than cooperation. Mkinti needs Lier to reach the outside world. Lier profits from the gnomish trade. Azuros ignores both entirely.

There have been no wars between the three states in recorded history—the geography makes conquest impractical, and none of them wants what the others have. The gnomes wouldn't know what to do with farmland. The merchants can't reach the monastery. The monks don't want anything.

This arrangement has proven remarkably stable. Whether it will survive Mkinti's internal crisis remains to be seen.

### Glass Forest

Tags: forest, region, dangerous

The Glass Forest is the western edge of Old Talaria's ruins—the first place the wild magic touched and the most accessible part of that fallen empire. The trees here aren't actually glass, but they gleam wrong, refract light in ways that hurt to look at, and at night glow faintly with trapped starlight. This is where Faesong magic bleeds into the material world unchecked.

#### Why "Glass"

The name comes from the visual effect. Trees in the Glass Forest look normal from a distance—bark, leaves, branches. Up close, something is wrong. The bark has a sheen it shouldn't have. Light passes through leaves that should be opaque. At certain angles, you can see through the trunk to what's behind it.

The trees aren't actually transparent. They're something else—material that exists in more than one state simultaneously, matter that hasn't decided whether it's solid or not. Touch a Glass Forest tree and it feels like wood. Look at it too long and your eyes water.

At night, the forest glows. The trees absorbed sunlight during the day; now they release it slowly, casting everything in a pale, wavering luminescence. It's beautiful. It's deeply unnatural.

#### The Fae Population

The Glass Forest teems with fae creatures—sprites, pixies, dryads, and things without names. They emerged when Ezz flooded through Old Talaria, born from the collision of wild magic and Melera's imprisoned song.

Some fae are friendly, or at least not hostile. They'll bargain, play, share information that might or might not be true. Others are dangerous—hungry spirits, tricksters who find human suffering hilarious, predators who've learned that two-legged creatures are slow and soft.

Travelers who enter the Glass Forest learn quickly that every interaction is a negotiation. What does the fae want? What are you willing to give? Can you trust the answer? Usually no, but sometimes yes, and the uncertainty is part of the danger.

#### The Awakened Trees

Deep in the Glass Forest, the trees themselves are aware. They don't move constantly—most of the time they're indistinguishable from ordinary (if strange-looking) trees. But they think, in whatever slow way trees think. They remember who passes. Some of them communicate, after a fashion.

The oldest awakened trees have been conscious since the cataclysm. They witnessed the fall of Talaria, absorbed the wild magic, and became something new. What they want, if they want anything, is unclear. They seem content to grow, watch, and occasionally interact with the creatures that wander through their forest.

Occasionally, a tree decides to move. This is terrifying. A tree that was rooted in one spot for decades suddenly isn't—and it goes wherever it wants, root-walking across the forest floor. The goblins of the nearby plains have stories about walking trees; they're not exaggerations.

#### The Forest Edge

The Glass Forest's eastern edge borders the goblin plains. The Scalawag broods know better than to enter the forest—things come out that shouldn't exist, and goblins who go in rarely return unchanged, if they return at all.

The western edge approaches Eloesi. The Eloweir maintain watch stations along this border, monitoring for anything that wanders out. Most emergences are harmless—confused fae, awakened animals, the occasional talking plant. Some aren't.

#### Travel Through

Nobody travels through the Glass Forest by choice. The forest interior is dangerous, disorienting, and unpredictable. Paths shift. Landmarks move. The fae might help you or lead you deeper into the wilderness for their own amusement.

Those who must pass through—treasure hunters bound for Old Talaria's ruins, scholars seeking magical knowledge, fools seeking both—hire guides from Krakersport in Eloesi. These guides know the relatively safe routes and the signs that indicate danger. Their survival rate is better than going alone, though "better" is relative.

#### What Emerges

The Glass Forest regularly produces strange things. Fae creatures that decide to explore the outside world. Animals that ate magic-saturated food and became something else. Plants that learned to move. Occasionally, something from deeper in Old Talaria that wandered out through the forest.

The Eloweir deal with emergences pragmatically. If it's harmless, they let it go. If it's dangerous, they destroy it. If they can't destroy it, they contain it or chase it back into the forest. The system works well enough that Eloesi has survived centuries sharing a border with wild magic.

### Glidwyn Forest

Tags: forest, region

Glidwyn Forest fills the transition zone between Eloweir coastal territory and the interior plains, a dense temperate woodland that marks where Eloesi ends and wilder lands begin. The forest isn't claimed by any nation—it's simply there, a green buffer between the sea elves and the goblin chaos to the east.

#### The Forest Character

Glidwyn is old forest, though not as old or strange as the Glass Forest to the south. The trees are tall, the canopy thick, and the undergrowth dense enough to make travel difficult for anyone not on established paths. Game is plentiful—deer, boar, birds—and the streams run clear with fish.

The Eloweir of Eloesi use the forest's western edges for timber and hunting. They've never pushed deep into the interior; there's no need, and the further east you go, the closer you get to goblin territory.

#### The Eastern Edge

Where Glidwyn Forest thins into grassland, the Shiverplains begin. Goblin broods occasionally camp at the forest's edge, using the trees for shelter before raiding expeditions or retreating into cover when pursued. The Eloweir don't bother chasing them into the forest—the goblins know the terrain better and aren't worth the trouble.

#### The Bygone Hills Border

Glidwyn's northeastern edge approaches the Bygone Hills, where Eidlsandres hides behind its illusions. The gnomes don't use the forest, but their defensive magic sometimes affects travelers passing through—a wrong turn, a sense of being watched, a sudden conviction that continuing east would be a bad idea.

Goblins who wander through Glidwyn toward the Bygone Hills sometimes emerge weeks later on the forest's western edge, confused about where they were trying to go. Others don't emerge at all. The forest itself isn't dangerous—but the hills beyond certainly are.

#### Wildlife

Standard temperate forest fauna: deer, wolves, bears, boar, rabbits, and the full complement of smaller creatures. Nothing magical or unusual, which makes Glidwyn stand out in a region where Old Talaria's influence bleeds strangeness into everything nearby.

Some scholars believe the forest's mundanity is intentional—that the gnomes of Eidlsandres extend subtle protective magic to keep the Glass Forest's corruption from spreading north. Others think it's just luck. The forest doesn't care about scholarly theories; it simply grows.

#### Travel Routes

Paths through Glidwyn connect Eloesi's eastern settlements to the plains beyond. These routes are maintained by no one officially but persist through regular use—hunters, traders willing to deal with goblins, and travelers heading south. The paths are safe enough by day; by night, the usual forest hazards apply.

### Glorin

Tags: state, nation

A secretive Glorindian dwarf nation in the Whistle-Stone Mountains, between Thespia and Kazül. On the surface, a modest mining operation. Below ground, one of the richest gold deposits in Alaria and a civilization that prefers the world doesn't know about it.

The Glorindians can sense gold through solid stone. They've used this gift to carve vast underground chasms full of wealth—and they've learned to keep very, very quiet about it.

#### Gamgara

The capital, a surface settlement above the main mine complex. Modest buildings, unremarkable streets, nothing to suggest the staggering wealth below. The clan elders meet here to coordinate when necessary.

#### Matabono

A town in the eastern part of Glorin, with its own mine entrances and clan territory.

#### Zubaydah

A settlement in the west, closer to the coast and the main trade routes to Kazül.

#### Taufig

Southern town, near the border with Kazül. Handles most of the (deliberately modest) gold exports.

#### The Whistle-Stone Mountains

The mountain range that defines Glorin. Natural caverns and tunnels create an eerie whistling when wind passes through—unsettling to outsiders, sacred to the Glorindians who call it the voice of the mountains.

#### The Underground

The true Glorin lies below. Vast mine shafts, tunnel networks, and underground chasms where generations of Glorindians have extracted gold. Some chambers are enormous—large enough to have their own weather patterns. The deepest workings are clan secrets.

The wealth is staggering. The Glorindians have mined tons of gold over centuries, and their auric sight keeps finding more. They deliberately hide the scale of it.

#### The Dragon Threat

Morgnor, King of the Mountains to the northwest, has noticed Glorin. He knows about the gold. He hasn't acted yet, but dragons are patient. The Glorindians know he's watching and have no good answers for what happens when he decides to take what he wants.

A confederation of eight Scalawag goblin city-states occupying the Crags of Geth—a shallow bowl-shaped mountain range west of Erasnus, east of Ta Minn, and south of Anarak. Chaotic but functional, Griselia runs on brood loyalty, dramatic flair, and an endless appetite for theatrical conflict.

The goblins perpetually threaten to invade Erasnus. They never will. Everyone knows this. Trade continues regardless.

#### The Crags of Geth

A bowl-shaped mountain range forming natural walls around a sheltered interior. The rim provides defense; the valleys within provide livable space for goblin settlements. Eight major valleys house eight city-states, each ruled by a brood-father lineage.

North of the Crags lies Anarak. South are the Browthiel Hills and the plains approaching Ta Minn.

#### Pholiki

Easternmost city-state, closest to Erasnus. Primary point of contact for trade and theatrical diplomacy. Pholiki's brood-father typically leads the delegations that travel to Traduci to make grandiose invasion threats before signing trade agreements.

#### Dygon

Central of the three eastern city-states. Known for its philosophers—Scalawag goblins who devote years to elaborate metaphysical arguments that outsiders find incomprehensible but goblins consider profound.

#### Aster

Westernmost of the three eastern city-states. More militant reputation than its neighbors, though "militant" for Griselia still means more posturing than actual fighting.

#### Shinishini

Interior city-state known for its performers. Traveling Shinishini theater troupes occasionally venture into Erasnus and beyond, staging elaborate productions that blend comedy, tragedy, and chaos.

#### Codunp

Interior city-state with a reputation for craftsmanship—when the goblins can focus long enough to finish projects. Codunp goods are either brilliant or baffling, with little middle ground.

#### Gor

Interior city-state. Less is known about Gor than the others; they keep to themselves more than typical Griselian goblins. Some suspect Gor harbors ambitions beyond theater.

#### Grisel

The largest city-state, occupying the deepest valley in the bowl. Grisel's brood-father claims ceremonial precedence over the others, which the other seven city-states politely ignore.

#### Bu

The smallest city-state, tucked into a narrow valley near the northern rim. Bu trades more with Anarak than with Erasnus, and its goblins are quieter than their southern cousins. This is considered suspicious.

### Iylovia

Tags: state, nation, region

The forests of lies. That's what outsiders call Iylovia, and they're not wrong. Every tree casts shadows. Every shadow hides a Gyv. And every Gyv is working an angle you haven't figured out yet.

Iylovia is beautiful—dense woodland stretching from the contested western border to the eastern coastal ports, cut by silver rivers and dotted with settlements that range from fortress-towns to quiet trading villages. The forests are ancient, the timber valuable, the textiles exquisite. Travelers come for trade and leave with excellent goods and the nagging feeling that they've been cheated somehow.

They probably have. They just can't prove it.

But beneath the surface scheming, Iylovia is dying. The Silzar push from the west. The Gyv can't unite to stop them. The forests that once sheltered a sprawling civilization now shelter refugees, desperate fighters, and people who've started measuring their future in seasons rather than generations.

#### Geography & Borders

**West — Silwyn**: The war front. Gwyrdyr Forest runs along the border, a killing ground where Silzar raiders clash with Gyv ambushers. Every few miles, another burned village. Every few days, another skirmish. The border isn't a line—it's a wound.

**North — Eros**: The haunted forest. The Gyv avoid it as thoroughly as the Silzar do. The Nemo cannot be manipulated, and that terrifies the Gyv more than any physical threat. Some desperate voices whisper about reaching out to Eros, using the Nemo against the Silzar. Most think this is insane. Some are considering it anyway.

**East — The Coast**: Open water. The Gray Isles lie offshore. Trade ships come and go. This is Iylovia's lifeline—and increasingly, its escape route.

**South — Howlwood and Beyond**: The forests thin into the Graymist region, eventually giving way to other territories. Less contested than the west, but also less developed. Scattered settlements, ancient woods, things that prefer not to be disturbed.

#### The Rivers

**River Sorrow**: Flows through the northwestern war zone. Named for obvious reasons. Its banks are lined with settlements that have seen too much death.

**Gwyrdyr River**: The main waterway of western Iylovia, emerging at Malesi. Trade and troops move along this river—when the Silzar aren't raiding it.

**Skleidyon River**: Cuts through the heart of Iylovia, passing through the capital at Theochori. The safest trade route, the spine of what remains of Gyv civilization.

**Odrigi River**: Flows through the eastern regions toward the coast. Eastern Gyv control this water, and eastern Gyv control the trade it enables.

**Savarin River**: Southeastern waterway, connecting interior settlements to coastal ports. Growing in importance as the west collapses.

**Torpastros River**: Far southeastern river, at the edge of Gyv territory. Quiet. Removed from the war. Some Gyv are buying land here, just in case.

#### The Forests

Each of Iylovia's forests has its own character—shaped by geography, history, and the Gyv who've lived among them.

##### Gwyrdyr Forest

The war forest. This woodland has seen more blood than any other place in the region. Silzar raids push in from the plains; Gyv ambushes strike back from the trees. The villages here are fortified, their people hard-eyed and suspicious even by Gyv standards.

Gwyrdyr has become a killing ground. The Gyv have learned to use every advantage the terrain offers—dense undergrowth for hiding, narrow paths for ambush, acoustic tricks that make sounds echo from wrong directions. Silzar who push too deep tend not to return.

But the forest is shrinking. The Silzar burn what they can't hold. Every year, the treeline retreats a little further.

##### Leering Wood

Northern forest with an unsettling reputation. Travelers report feeling watched. Trees seem to lean inward. Sounds carry strangely—footsteps from the wrong direction, voices where no one stands.

Some say the forest is haunted. Others say it's just Gyv being Gyv, playing psychological games on visitors. The truth is probably both: the Gyv have cultivated Leering Wood's unsettling atmosphere, but something in these woods was strange long before the Gyv arrived.

##### Astrella Forest

The beautiful forest. Ancient trees with silver-gray bark. Clearings filled with flowers that bloom in moonlight. The Gyv consider Astrella sacred—or as sacred as a culture of manipulators can consider anything.

Important rituals happen here. Coming-of-age ceremonies. Marriages between powerful families. The creation of Tested Bonds between Gyv who want genuine relationships. Astrella is one of the few places where Gyv try to be honest with each other.

Try.

##### Bittermarsh

Swampland where the forest meets standing water. Difficult terrain, unpleasant conditions, and fiercely independent communities who've chosen isolation over involvement in Gyv politics.

The Bittermarsh Gyv are considered strange by their own people—more direct, less concerned with elaborate manipulation. Some say the swamp breeds honesty because there's no one worth manipulating. Others say they're playing a longer game than anyone realizes.

##### Spinefir Forest

The central forest, vast and ancient. Named for the distinctive spine-like ridges on the fir trees that dominate the region. Spinefir is the heart of what remains of Gyv civilization—far enough from the war to be safe, connected enough by river to matter.

Theochori sits on Spinefir's southern edge, where the Skleidyon River emerges from the trees. The forest provides the capital's security: any army marching on Theochori would have to pass through miles of ambush-ready woodland first.

##### Terror Grove

Something went wrong in Terror Grove.

The forest between Spinefir and Hagwood was once ordinary woodland. Now it's avoided. The trees grow twisted. Animals don't enter. Gyv who venture in report unease that escalates to panic, whispers they can't quite hear, the absolute certainty that something is watching.

The Gyv don't talk about what happened in Terror Grove. Whatever it was, it was recent—within living memory—and important enough to suppress. Some say an experiment in mass manipulation went wrong. Others say something was summoned. Others say it's simply where the Gyv disposed of problems they didn't want found.

No one goes to Terror Grove unless they have to. Those who do come back changed—or don't come back at all.

##### Hagwood

Working forest. This is where Iylovia's timber industry is centered—carefully managed logging that provides wood for construction, export, and the endless repair of war-damaged settlements.

Hagwood is practical, populated by practical Gyv. Less scheming here, more focus on getting work done. The lumber camps operate on written contracts, clear schedules, and as much honesty as Gyv ever manage. This is where you come to get things, not to play games.

##### Howlwood

Southern forest named for the sounds that echo through it at night. Not wolves—the Gyv claim there are no wolves in Howlwood. Then what howls? The Gyv don't answer directly.

Howlwood is remote, sparsely settled, and home to Gyv who want to be left alone. The communities here have little contact with the war in the west or the trade in the east. They watch their own borders and keep their own secrets.

Something lives in Howlwood. The Gyv have some arrangement with it. Outsiders are not invited to learn the details.

##### Graymist Forest

The southeastern forest, wrapped in fog more often than not. The mist rolls in from Graymist Lake and settles among the trees, creating an atmosphere of soft gray silence.

Graymist is where things go to be hidden. Exiles settle here. Treasures are buried here. Secrets that even the Gyv want forgotten end up in Graymist. The communities are small and keep to themselves, and they're very good at not seeing things that pass through.

#### Major Settlements

**Theochori**: The capital. A city of whispers built where the Skleidyon River emerges from Spinefir Forest. The Council of Silence meets here in a chamber where speaking is forbidden. Debates happen in writing, passed back and forth over days. It's agonizingly slow, but it's the only way the Gyv can govern without manipulating each other.

In theory.

**Krania**: Northern fortress-city anchoring the Gwyrdyr defense. Krania has held against Silzar pressure for decades, its walls thick and its garrison paranoid. The city is organized around written communication and strict protocols—more militarized than anywhere else in Iylovia, more willing to trust because they have to.

**Balastafika**: Central city on the edge of Astrella Forest. Administrative center, market town, and refuge for Gyv fleeing the western war. Balastafika is crowded, tense, and full of newcomers who've lost everything. Crime is high. Trust is low. Even by Gyv standards.

**Malesi**: Where the Gwyrdyr River reaches navigable water. Trading town, transit point, and target. Malesi has been raided multiple times but rebuilt each time—too valuable to abandon, too exposed to truly secure.

#### Notable Locations

##### Cheykiov

Fortress ruins in the hills southwest of Spinefir Forest.

Cheykiov was supposed to hold. Thick walls, strong garrison, excellent position. It fell anyway—not to Silzar assault but to betrayal. Someone opened the gates. Someone manipulated the defenders. The details are disputed; every faction blames every other faction.

Now it's ruins. The Silzar stripped what they wanted and moved on. The Gyv haven't rebuilt because no one can agree who should control it, and no one trusts anyone else's garrison.

Some say treasure lies buried in the collapse. Others say something worse than treasure was sealed away when the fortress fell. The ruins are avoided, but not forgotten.

##### Graymist Lake

Large lake in the southern forest, source of the fog that gives Graymist Forest its name. Beautiful and eerie. The water is dark, the shores muddy, the silence absolute.

Things live in Graymist Lake. The local Gyv know better than to fish certain depths or swim at certain times. They've made arrangements. Outsiders who ignore warnings occasionally vanish.

#### Traveling in Iylovia

The forests are safe in the sense that bandits rarely operate here—the Gyv have other ways of taking from travelers. The forests are dangerous in the sense that everyone you meet is probably manipulating you.

**Rules for outsiders**:

- Speak as little as possible. Writing is safer.
- Assume every deal has hidden terms.
- Never accept hospitality without understanding what you're agreeing to.
- The helpful stranger is working an angle. So is the unfriendly one.
- If a Gyv seems trustworthy, they're very good at their job.

The eastern trade routes are most accessible to outsiders. Merchants come and go; the Gyv need their goods too much to make trade impossible. The west is war zone—outsiders are suspected of being spies, and both sides might be right. The central forests are Gyv territory in the purest sense, where the games are played by Gyv rules and outsiders are pieces to be used.

Welcome to Iylovia. Watch your words.

### Jinxz Plains

Tags: plains, region

The Jinxz Plains occupy the southern stretch of the central grasslands, named (according to the goblins) for the bad luck that follows anyone who crosses them wrong. Like the Shiverplains to the north, this is Scalawag goblin territory—chaotic, dangerous, and perpetually at war with itself.

#### The Southern Broods

The Jinxz Plains broods consider themselves distinct from their Shiverplains cousins, though outsiders can't tell the difference. The same impulsive, mischievous Scalawag nature. The same brood-based social structure. The same constant low-grade warfare over territory, resources, and bragging rights.

The southern broods claim to be better at causing misfortune to their enemies—hence the name "Jinxz." Whether they're actually more cursed or just better at taking credit for coincidental disasters is debatable.

#### The Border Wars

The line between Jinxz Plains and Shiverplains isn't a border so much as a perpetual battlefield. Broods from both regions raid across it constantly, sometimes winning territory, sometimes losing it, never settling anything permanently. The fighting has been going on so long that it's less a conflict and more a tradition.

Neither side remembers what started it. Neither side cares. The fighting continues because fighting is what goblins do.

#### Surrounding Regions

To the west lies Old Talaria and the Glass Forest—even the goblins avoid that direction. Things come out of the forest sometimes, strange things that don't follow normal rules. The broods nearest the Glass Forest have learned to recognize the warning signs and flee rather than fight.

To the east is Azawahasi, the Sharabha homeland. The lion-folk tolerate goblin raids the way a lion tolerates flies—annoying but not worth serious attention. Occasionally a brood gets too ambitious and learns why Sharabha are apex predators.

To the south are the Elephant Groves, sacred to the loxodon. The goblins raid the forest edges for resources but never go deep. Something in there doesn't like them, and goblins who venture too far don't return.

#### Witchbreath Bay

The southern edge of the Jinxz Plains meets Witchbreath Bay, an unsettling body of water with a dire reputation. Strange fogs roll off the water without warning, thick and disorienting. Ships that anchor in the bay report disturbing dreams—visions of drowned things, voices from beneath the waves.

Even the goblins avoid Witchbreath Bay. That's saying something—Scalawags will raid nearly anything, go nearly anywhere. But the bay feels wrong in a way that penetrates even goblin recklessness. Broods that camp too close to the water's edge report members wandering off in the night, walking into the fog, never returning.

Elders in surrounding regions tell stories of something sleeping in the deep water, something that dreams, something that shouldn't be awakened. Whether this is truth or legend, the bay remains avoided by anyone with sense.

#### The Chaos Theory

Some scholars theorize that the goblin plains serve an ecological function—they're a buffer zone of chaos that prevents any single power from dominating the region. The Eloweir don't expand south because of the goblins. The Sharabha don't expand west. Old Talaria's strangeness doesn't spread freely. The United Free Nations stay contained.

The goblins, of course, don't think about it that way. They're just living their lives—raiding, fighting, celebrating, dying, and starting over the next generation. The chaos is the point.

### Joswik

Tags: state, nation

Joswik occupies southern Ofrenia, a land of mountains, fertile valleys, and windswept plateau. It's the largest of the three Ofrenian kingdoms by area, though much of that territory is difficult terrain—the Gnomestone Mountains in the south, the Oshkensi Plateau in the southwest, and the rugged interior hills that have always made centralized rule difficult.

Prince Edric governs from Padena, watching his sister's armies occupy the north and waiting for the inevitable. The landscape that makes Joswik hard to govern also makes it hard to conquer—but everyone knows Alisandra will try eventually.

#### Padena

The capital city, nestled in a river valley in the northern interior. Padena grew up around a natural ford—a crossing point that became a market, then a town, then a city. The architecture is practical rather than grand: stone buildings built to last, streets wide enough for cattle drives, and fortifications that show their age.

Prince Edric's palace is the largest structure in the city, but it's modest by royal standards. The old king built for function, not display, and his youngest son has maintained that tradition.

Since the Tornian occupation, Padena has swelled with refugees. Tent cities ring the walls. Markets are crowded and prices are climbing. The city that seemed sleepy a year ago now buzzes with desperate energy.

#### Valeria

The second city, a port on the southeastern coast overlooking the Gulf of Joswik. Valeria handles most of Joswik's maritime trade—what's left of it, now that routes through Tornia are disrupted. The harbor is deep and well-protected, and the city's merchants have profited from the chaos by offering alternative shipping.

The city has a rougher feel than Padena, more cosmopolitan and less concerned with tradition. Some of the wealthier Tornian refugees have settled here, bringing gold and connections that the locals view with mixed feelings.

#### The Gnomestone Mountains

The mountain range that defines Joswik's southern border, named for the gnome communities that supposedly dwelt here before humans arrived. Whether gnomes ever lived here is debatable; the stone formations that look like gnome-carved structures might just be unusual geology.

What's not debatable is the wealth. Iron and copper seams run through these mountains, and mining towns dot the valleys and passes. The mountain lords have always been semi-independent, paying taxes to whoever rules in Padena but governing their own affairs.

##### Mining Towns

Scattered through the mountains, connected by difficult roads that become impassable in winter. Each town clusters around its mine—iron from the deep veins, copper from the surface deposits, stone from quarries that have operated for generations. The miners are tough, insular, and suspicious of lowland politics.

#### The Oshkensi Plateau

A vast grassland plateau in the southwestern interior, rising above the surrounding valleys like a table set for giants. The herders who live here raise sheep and cattle in numbers that feed much of Ofrenia—or did, before the war disrupted everything.

##### Meadow of Laughing

A strange region in the Oshkensi Plateau where the grass grows in patterns that, viewed from the right angle, look like faces frozen in mirth. The herders avoid building here, though they graze their animals through. Local legend claims the meadow marks a mass grave from some ancient conflict, and the dead are laughing at the living.

##### Myrnol's Tower

A ruined wizard's tower on the edge of the plateau, overlooking the southwestern coast. Myrnol was supposedly a sage who withdrew from the world centuries ago to study the stars. The tower is crumbling now, picked over by treasure hunters, but locals claim lights still appear in the upper windows on moonless nights.

#### Northern Settlements

##### Trenton & Greymill

Market towns in the northern valleys, serving the agricultural heartland. Grain from these regions once flowed north to Tornia; now it feeds refugees and fills storehouses against uncertain times.

##### Sculpton

A town in the northern hills known for its stone carvers. Decorative stonework from Sculpton adorns buildings across Ofrenia—or did, when trade flowed freely.

#### Eastern Coast

##### Shardak

A fishing town on the eastern coast, named for the sharp rocks that make its harbor treacherous for unfamiliar sailors. The locals navigate by memory and childhood practice; outsiders hire pilots or risk their hulls.

#### Southern & Southwestern Regions

##### Canfaldo, Banksted, Clifton

A chain of towns along the southern foothills, connecting the mining regions to the coast. Each has its specialty—Canfaldo processes ore, Banksted handles banking and contracts for the mines, Clifton serves as the gateway to the mountain passes.

##### Ellismare

A town in the southwestern interior, at the base of the Oshkensi Plateau. Livestock markets here draw herders from across the plateau for seasonal sales.

##### Osperton & Dagmanton

Coastal towns in the far southwest, looking out toward the open Middle Sea. These are quiet places, more concerned with fishing and local affairs than the great conflicts to the north.

##### Welldale & Pasterton

Southern settlements near the coast, farming communities that have escaped the worst disruption of the war. For now.

#### The Gulf of Joswik

The waters south of Joswik's eastern coast, opening into the Middle Sea. The gulf provides sheltered waters for fishing and coastal trade, though the recent disruptions have reduced traffic. Valeria commands the best harbor, but smaller ports dot the coastline.

#### The Passage

The strait separating Joswik from Tornia to the north, and from Myastor's island to the east. The Passage has always been contested water—whoever controls it controls traffic between Ofrenia's kingdoms. With Alisandra holding Tornia, the Passage has become a flashpoint. Joswik's few naval vessels patrol nervously, waiting for Sylke's fleet to make a move.

### Kazül

Tags: state, nation

A desert kingdom on the southern Middle Sea coast, ruled by King Salomor and his legendary summoning ring. Famous for producing the finest glass in Alaria. A rigid caste system keeps the nobility wealthy and the laborers trapped.

South of Glorin, southwest of Zintacas. The interior is the Jahazai Desert—harsh, ancient, and full of buried ruins.

#### Urzahd

The capital, in the northwest where the river from Glorin provides life. Seat of King Salomor's court and home to the finest glass workshops in the world. The nobility live in elegant estates; laborers crowd the outer districts.

#### The River Settlements

Most of Kazül's population lives along the river that flows from Glorin. Settlements stretch up the river valley almost to Glorin's border: Sigiel, Duhkmayas, Shohas, Malki, and others. Without the river, the interior would be uninhabitable.

#### Gulf of Kazül

The western coastline, where fishing villages and small ports connect Kazül to sea trade.

#### Peecked Hills

Western hills between the coast and the desert interior.

#### Jahazai Desert

The vast interior desert. Harsh, beautiful, deadly. Ancient ruins lie buried beneath the sands—remnants of civilizations that existed before the desert claimed the land. Treasure hunters venture in; many don't return.

#### Towers of Ederhi

Ancient spires of fused glass rising from the Jahazai sands. No one knows who built them. The glass is unlike anything modern artisans can produce—harder, clearer, faintly luminescent at night. No entrance has ever been found. The towers remain a mystery.

#### Bhutag

A town in the eastern desert near the coast, built atop millennia-old catacombs. The locals avoid the deeper tunnels. Artifacts occasionally emerge from the depths, sold to collectors who don't ask questions about what else might be down there.

#### Boxwatch

A settlement in the western hills, overlooking the Gulf of Kazül.

#### Dygalva & Seneka

Northern settlements along the river, closer to Glorin.

#### Buffalo Islands

An archipelago offshore to the south, in the waters between Kazül and Okesha's Passage.

#### Okesha's Passage

The waterway on the northwest side of Erpeus Island, connecting different parts of the Middle Sea.

#### Pavik's Cave

A coastal cave system on the western shore, near the Gulf of Kazül. Local legends speak of something living in the depths.

#### Porizzon Island

An island offshore to the southwest.

### Lier

Tags: state, nation

Lier occupies the central portion of Erpeus Island, sandwiched between the gnomish mountains of Mkinti to the south and the monastic peaks of Azuros to the north. It's the human heartland of Erpeus—rolling hills, fertile valleys, and a pragmatic population that's learned to profit from its position as middleman between the secretive gnomes and the outside world.

#### Hessam

The capital and only true city, built around the best natural harbor on Erpeus's eastern coast. Hessam is where everything happens—trade, politics, the occasional assassination, and the steady flow of seekers heading to the Bay of Whispers.

The city has the practical architecture of a place built for commerce rather than beauty. Warehouses crowd the waterfront. Merchant houses rise behind them, each family's compound trying to outdo the neighbors without appearing ostentatious. The council chambers occupy a central position, deliberately positioned to remind everyone that money governs here.

The population is cosmopolitan by Erpeus standards—humans mostly, but with enough visitors from across the Middle Sea to make diversity unremarkable. The docks especially attract a mixed crowd: sailors, traders, mercenaries, scholars bound for the Bay of Whispers, and occasionally Ohblex gnomes who've ventured out of their mountains for reasons they don't explain.

#### The Bay of Whispers

The supernatural bay outside Hessam, where the wind carries secrets across time. Everything spoken within the bay is captured forever—words from the past drift across the water, and listeners can hear things they weren't meant to know.

The phenomenon is real and terrifying. A visitor might hear their own voice speaking words they haven't said yet. They might catch fragments of conversations from centuries ago. They might learn secrets that powerful people have killed to protect.

The bay attracts seekers—scholars researching lost knowledge, mystics pursuing temporal communion, the desperate hoping to learn something that might save them or damn their enemies. Hessam's merchants have built an industry around them: lodging, supplies, guides who know the safe approaches (if any approach is truly safe), and discrete disposal services for those who learn things they shouldn't.

The council regulates access but doesn't restrict it. The revenue is too valuable, and besides—trying to control the Bay of Whispers seems like the kind of hubris that ends badly.

#### Hills of Soromun

Gentle hills in central Lier, the agricultural heartland. Grain, olives, and vineyards cover the slopes, feeding Lier and providing surplus for export. The villages here are quiet, prosperous places where nothing much happens—which suits the residents fine.

#### Murder Hills

The highlands in northern Lier, along the border with Azuros. The name is earned. Bandits shelter in the rocky terrain, preying on travelers heading to or from the monastery. Worse things than bandits lurk in the deeper valleys—creatures that avoid sunlight, fugitives who've gone feral, and occasionally something that wanders down from Azuros's heights.

The council sends military expeditions every few years to clean out the Murder Hills. They kill some bandits, declare victory, and return home. Within months, the hills are dangerous again. Some council members have suggested more permanent solutions; others point out that as long as the hills are lawless, they're also a convenient place to dispose of problems.

#### Devil's Crest

A dramatic mountain formation in western Lier, marking the transition toward Mkinti territory. The peaks here are jagged, volcanic in origin, and largely uninhabited. Local legend claims something lives in Devil's Crest—something old, something that the gnomes know about and won't discuss.

Whether the legends are true or just stories to keep children away from dangerous cliffs, most travelers avoid Devil's Crest. The passes around it add days to any journey, but days are cheaper than whatever might be waiting in those peaks.

#### Interior Settlements

##### Lucsha

A market town in the Hills of Soromun, the largest inland settlement after Hessam. Agricultural products flow through here on their way to the coast, and Lucsha's weekly market draws farmers from across the region.

##### Dozna

A town on the road toward Mkinti, positioned at the last comfortable stopping point before the gnomish mountains. Traders preparing for the difficult journey into Ohblex territory stock up here, hire guides, and make final arrangements.

##### Coyzevan

A settlement in the southern hills, known for its vineyards and the distinctive wine they produce. Coyzevan red fetches premium prices in Hessam's taverns.

##### Tothpa & Oychka

Towns in northern Lier, in the shadow of the Murder Hills. The residents here are hardy, suspicious of strangers, and well-armed. They've learned that help from Hessam arrives slowly if at all.

##### Gam

A small town on the coast south of Hessam, primarily a fishing community. The waters off Gam are good for certain catches that don't school near Hessam's busy harbor.

#### Relations with Neighbors

Lier's relationship with Mkinti is symbiotic and tense. The gnomes need Lier's merchants to reach the outside world; Lier's economy depends on the gnomish trade. Neither trusts the other, and both know they're stuck together.

Azuros to the north is mostly ignored. The monks don't trade, don't fight, don't participate in the world in ways Lier understands. Occasionally a merchant tries to establish commerce with the monastery; they always return frustrated and empty-handed.

### Majesty Mountains

Tags: mountains

Home to numerous Kimril, copious quantities of red gold, and the an infamous dwarf bandit. 

Used to be homeland of stone dwarves, but it was destroyed by dragonriders from Adron. All of the underground cities and ruins of the stone dwarves are now infested with goblins and other nasties that the Adron government has given up trying to eradicate.

They removed the dwarves by just flaming the tunnels with their dragons, but now they don't really have the same dragon population they used to, and they can't ever quite get the last of the goblins, which is all it takes for them all to immediately repopulate the mountains.

### Mkinti

Tags: state, nation

Mkinti occupies the southwestern portion of Erpeus Island, a land of glittering mountains and labyrinthine underground cities. This is Ohblex territory—gem gnomes who were born from the precious stones themselves and who guard the secret of clockwork jealously. The surface is all jagged peaks and treacherous passes; the real civilization lies beneath, in tunnels that sparkle with embedded gems and hum with mechanical precision.

#### The Gemstone Peaks

The mountain range that defines Mkinti, named for the gems that riddle its stone. Every color of precious stone can be found here—rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and stranger things without names. The Ohblex have mined these peaks for generations, not just for trade but for sustenance—they consume gems instead of food.

The surface settlements cling to the mountainsides, but they're mostly facades. The real cities lie underground, connected by tunnels that twist, branch, and trap. Outsiders who enter without guides don't come back.

#### Wizzik

The current capital, seat of House Wizzik and now the center of Mkinti's government. Before the succession crisis, Wizzik was just one of five house seats; now it's everything.

The city descends through multiple underground levels, each more elaborate than the last. The deepest levels house the most sensitive workshops—where clockwork secrets are kept, where the finest gems are processed, where House Wizzik's inner circle schemes and plots.

The city is trapped. Every corridor, every doorway, every staircase has mechanisms that can seal, collapse, or kill. The gnomes navigate by memory and subtle markers; visitors navigate by luck and gnomish patience.

#### Zunuki

The second city, traditionally controlled by one of the now-headless houses. Zunuki specialized in jewelry—combining Ohblex gem expertise with artistic design that fetched premium prices across the Middle Sea.

The city is in turmoil. House Wizzik has claimed control, but the local craftsmen are loyal to their dead masters. Production has slowed, quality has suffered, and everyone is waiting to see what happens next.

#### Other Settlements

##### Uzikni

A mountain town at one of the few reliable passes through the Gemstone Peaks. Most trade enters Mkinti through Uzikni, which means the town has more contact with outsiders than most Ohblex settlements. The gnomes here are marginally more tolerant of non-gnomish company—emphasis on marginally.

##### Elfekin

A mining settlement deep in the peaks, named for a vein of pale green gems that the original settlers thought looked like elf eyes. The comparison was not meant as a compliment.

##### Tiknurtir

A southern town near the Bejeweled Palace, positioned to watch the cursed structure without getting too close. The residents have accumulated generations of lore about the palace's dangers—and occasionally sell that information to treasure hunters foolish enough to try their luck.

#### The Bejeweled Palace

The cursed palace of an ancient Mkinti king, abandoned for centuries. The structure is visible from Tiknurtir on clear days—a gleaming edifice that catches sunlight in ways that hurt to look at.

The palace treasury is legendary. The old king accumulated wealth beyond counting, gems of sizes that shouldn't exist, clockwork marvels that no modern gnome can replicate. He died there, along with his entire court, in circumstances the Ohblex don't discuss. The palace has been avoided ever since.

Something lives in the palace now. Or something remains. Or something waits. The gnomes have stories, each more terrifying than the last, and none of them agree. What everyone agrees on: those who enter don't return. Those who camp too close have nightmares. Those who take souvenirs from the outer grounds regret it.

#### Underground Mkinti

The surface settlements are the visible fraction of Mkinti. Below ground, the gnome cities spread through natural caverns and carved tunnels, lit by phosphorescent fungi and gem-light, connected by passages that only residents can navigate.

The underground cities contain:
- **Workshops**: Where clockwork is crafted, in secrecy that borders on paranoid
- **Gem halls**: Where the Ohblex consume their sustenance and assess new finds
- **Trap galleries**: Where the mechanisms that protect each city are maintained
- **House vaults**: Where each family stores its wealth, guarded by devices that would make siege engineers weep

The tunnels between cities are even more dangerous than the cities themselves. Wrong turns lead to dead ends—or just dead.

#### Relations with Neighbors

Mkinti shares Erpeus with Lier to the north and Azuros to the far north. The Ohblex view both with condescension. Lier's humans are too direct, too honest, too easy to manipulate. Azuros's monks are fascinating in their alien simplicity but ultimately irrelevant.

Trade flows through Lier—Mkinti's clockwork and gems for Lier's agricultural products and access to broader markets. The relationship is profitable and mutually suspicious, as the Ohblex prefer.

### Morgnor's Cradle

Tags: state, nation

The domain of Morgnor, an ancient earth-attuned dragon who rules over Etherweaver goblins in the Wurmspine Mountains northwest of Thespia. The goblins mine precious metals and enchant them for the dragon's ever-growing hoard.

Very rich. Very greedy. Very dangerous.

#### Morgnor

The dragon's lair and the central settlement that shares his name. Built into the mountainside, the lair contains Morgnor's legendary hoard—generations of mined gold and enchanted items. The goblins live in warrens surrounding the lair, always within call of their master.

#### Morgnor's Cradle

The central mountain region where the dragon makes his home. The peaks here are rich with precious metals, and Morgnor can sense every grain of gold in his domain.

#### Hills of Red Gold

The southern slopes, where most mining occurs. Rich veins of gold give the hills their name—and their value. Etherweaver goblins work the mines constantly, extracting wealth for the dragon's hoard.

#### Mt. Kazlos

A major peak in the eastern part of the domain.

#### Mt. Thryke

A peak in the southwestern part of the domain.

#### Goblin Settlements

Mining and crafting towns scattered through the mountains: Lagunas, Shegaat, Dir, Addis, Norwun, Scuilli, Telleni, Goldir. Each serves the dragon, mining or enchanting as their skills dictate.

#### The Etherweaver Crafters

The goblins here are Etherweavers—born with attunements to time, void, force, light, or dark. They use these abilities to enchant the metals they mine, creating items of considerable power. All of it goes to Morgnor's hoard.

#### Borders

- **East**: Thespia (formerly paid tribute; Queen Akta has stopped)
- **Southeast**: Glorin (hiding massive gold wealth; Morgnor has noticed)
- **Northwest**: Deadwalk (wasteland)
- **North**: Mountains continuing toward the coast

### Myastor

Tags: state, nation

Myastor occupies Paluva Amati, a scrubby island in the Ofrenia Passage between Ofrenia proper and the Middle Sea beyond. The landscape is uninspiring—rocky coasts, thinning forests, and scrubland that never quite becomes grassland. The island exists because ships need somewhere to stop, and Myastor has grudgingly filled that role for generations.

Under Queen Alisandra's rule, Myastor has become Sylke's dumping ground. Political prisoners, failed courtiers, and anyone the queen wants forgotten end up here. The population has made the best of it, building a grim economy around human misery and passing trade.

#### Shipton

The capital—if a town of a few thousand can claim that title. Shipton clusters around the best natural harbor on the island, a sheltered bay on the western coast facing Ofrenia. The waterfront is busy with transient ships; the inland streets are quiet and suspicious.

The governor's residence is the largest building in town, a weathered stone structure that once served as a warehouse. Governors come and go—Alisandra rotates them frequently, ensuring no one builds a power base—but the bureaucracy grinds on regardless.

The prison complex sprawls along the northern edge of town, repurposed warehouses surrounded by walls that look impressive but wouldn't stop a determined escape. The prisoners don't try because there's nowhere to go. Swimming to Ofrenia is suicide; stowing away on a ship requires bribing sailors who'd rather collect the reward for turning you in.

#### Telara

A secondary port on the eastern coast, smaller and rougher than Shipton. Ships that want to avoid attention—smugglers, pirates looking to fence goods, merchants carrying questionable cargo—often prefer Telara's lack of oversight. The town's unofficial motto is "we don't ask."

#### Partsmouth

An interior settlement surrounded by what remains of the island's forests. Logging operations here supply timber for ships and construction, though the trees are thinning and no one invests in replanting. The workers are mostly transported criminals serving out sentences; the overseers are mostly locals who've concluded that guarding lumberjacks beats guarding prisoners.

#### Pasterton

A fishing village on the southern coast, as far from Shipton as you can get without swimming. The residents here are the closest thing Myastor has to old families—people whose ancestors settled the island before it became a penal colony. They keep to themselves, sell fish to whoever's buying, and pretend the rest of the island doesn't exist.

#### The Singing Trees

A grove in the island's interior where the wind produces an eerie, almost musical sound as it passes through the branches. The trees here are an unusual species—their bark is pocked with natural holes that create the resonance. On quiet nights, the sound carries for miles.

Local legend claims the trees sing the names of the dead—prisoners who died on Myastor and were buried without proper rites. The more pragmatic explanation is simply unusual acoustics, but new arrivals often find the sound unsettling. Long-term residents barely notice anymore.

Some prisoners who've escaped into the interior report that the Singing Trees helped them—or hindered them. The stories contradict each other. The trees don't comment.

#### The Interior

Scrubland and second-growth forest, crisscrossed by rough paths connecting the settlements. Nothing of value grows here naturally; nothing planted survives the poor soil and irregular rainfall. The interior is used for grazing goats, hiding from authority, and burying things that shouldn't be found.

Escaped prisoners occasionally flee into the interior. They're rarely pursued—the island is small enough that they'll emerge eventually, hungry and desperate. The locals have learned to report sightings rather than risk confrontation.

#### The Ofrenia Passage

The strait between Paluva Amati and Ofrenia, connecting the Gulf of Joswik to the open Middle Sea. Control of the Passage has always been contested—now that Alisandra holds both Sylke and Tornia, she effectively controls both ends. Joswik's few ships and the island's fishing boats are the only traffic she doesn't command.

The Passage is dangerous in storms; ships shelter in Shipton's harbor until weather clears. This forced hospitality is Myastor's primary source of legitimate income—provisioning, repairs, and entertainment for bored sailors waiting out bad seas.

### Myorna

Tags: state, nation

A Sivakr (Silver Elf) kingdom in the Grey Mountains, a sub-range of the southern Kharvorn. The Sivakr spent thousands of years underground before emerging fifty years ago to trade with the surface world. It's going poorly.

Borders Camaran (southeast), Erasnus (southwest), and barely touches Hephake (northwest). Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though neighbors are turning hostile as they discover the truth about Sivakr memory manipulation.

#### Vad Ilghak

The capital city, built into the Grey Mountains. A vertical city of stone, carved chambers, and passages leading deep underground to the old warrens. Home to the royal palace, the great memory libraries, and the massive Deoric library—one of the largest collections of sacrifice-based magical texts in existence.

#### Urkhuk

The second major city, positioned closer to the Erasnun border. More surface-oriented than Vad Ilghak, with Sivakr who've begun assimilating into surface culture. A point of tension between those who want to stay and those who want to return underground.

#### The Forbidden Valley

A massive, impossibly deep valley north of Vad Ilghak. At its bottom, the Sivakr keep a chained giant in perpetual captivity, extracting blood sacrifices to power all Sivakr mind magic. A colossal statue of Tiira overlooks the valley—their patron goddess, cultivated (some say brainwashed) to serve Myornan interests.

Access is forbidden to all but the highest-ranking Sivakr. Outsiders who learn of it rarely live long enough to spread the knowledge.

#### The Stone Slums

Foggy districts of flat, slate-built, short buildings where the poor of Myorna make their homes. Without paper records, the inhabitants slip through the system of control. This is where golems were first discovered and built—and where unsavory characters find refuge from Sivakr society.

#### The Grey Mountains

The sub-range of the Kharvorn where Myorna is situated. The mountains contain extensive underground complexes—remnants of thousands of years of subterranean civilization. Many passages remain unexplored or sealed.

#### The Underground

Most Sivakr still live partially underground, in warrens and complexes connected to the surface cities. The old ways persist. Some want to seal the surface entrances and return to isolation; others see the underground as backwards and want full integration with the surface world.

### Old Talaria

Tags: region, ruins, dangerous

Old Talaria is what remains after the greatest magical catastrophe in recorded history—a land where wizards reached too far and shattered the boundary between the material world and Ezz itself. The empire that once stood here was the magical heart of Alaria, home to the most powerful practitioners of every arcane tradition. Now it's a haunted wilderness where Faesong bleeds into reality unchecked, and nothing is quite what it seems.

The cataclysm happened centuries ago. The details vary by who tells the story, but the outcome is consistent: the wizards attempted something impossible—some say they tried to permanently merge Ezz with the material plane, others claim they sought to free Melera from her prison, still others insist they were trying to become gods themselves. Whatever they intended, they succeeded enough to kill everything that lived here and failed enough that the result was chaos rather than power.

Ezz poured through the breach. Melera's imprisoned song, always present as a whisper in Faesong magic, became a scream. The magic didn't just kill the wizards—it transformed everything. Trees woke up. Animals gained cunning they shouldn't have. Fae creatures materialized from nothing, born from the intersection of wild magic and Melera's eternal music. The land itself became strange.

#### The Glass Forest

The western edge of Old Talaria, where the first wave of wild magic washed over living forest and transformed it. The trees here aren't glass—they're something worse. They look normal from a distance, but up close you see the light doesn't reflect right, the bark feels wrong, and at night they glow faintly with trapped starlight.

The Glass Forest is where Faesong magic is strongest. Fae creatures of every kind wander its depths—some curious, some playful, some hungry. The trees themselves are semi-aware, capable of moving their branches to block paths or reveal them, growing new roots overnight to trip travelers. Deeper in, where the magic pools thickest, trees walk.

Animals that drink from the forest's streams gain intelligence they weren't meant to have. Deer that speak in riddles. Wolves that bargain. Squirrels that lie.

The Eloweir of Eloesi maintain a cautious border watch along the Glass Forest's edge. Things wander out occasionally—usually confused, sometimes dangerous. The elves have learned when to fight, when to run, and when to simply let the strange thing pass.

#### The Interior Ruins

Beyond the Glass Forest, the ruins of Old Talaria proper stretch across a landscape that defies normal geography. Cities stand where cities shouldn't—some intact but empty, others half-swallowed by vegetation that grows nowhere else, still others frozen in the moment of destruction, eternally burning or collapsing or transforming.

No reliable maps exist of the interior. The land shifts. Not constantly—sometimes paths remain stable for years—but no one can predict when a road that existed yesterday will lead somewhere entirely different tomorrow. Expeditions that enter with careful records return (if they return) with maps that contradict each other.

The magic here isn't just Faesong—it's everything. Leylines that once powered Talarian spellwork still pulse with energy, but they're corrupted, wild, unpredictable. Elemental magic discharges randomly. Time flows strangely in some areas. The Psywinds carry thoughts that aren't human and never were.

#### The Talarian Legacy

Before its fall, Talaria was the center of magical learning in Alaria. Every tradition was studied here—Kethic elementalism, Deoric binding, Psy manipulation, Faesong harmonics. The greatest libraries, the most powerful artifacts, the deepest secrets—all were collected in Talarian vaults.

Those vaults still exist, somewhere in the ruins. Treasure hunters and scholars have sought them for centuries. A few have found fragments—spellbooks, enchanted items, records of rituals that should never be attempted. Most find only death, or worse, transformation.

The Talarian wizards themselves are gone—or at least, the people they were are gone. Some say echoes of their consciousness persist, trapped in the wild magic they unleashed. Others claim the most powerful became something else entirely, merged with the Faesong and the fae. Occasionally, travelers report meeting beings that speak of the old days with firsthand knowledge, but whether these are wizards-transformed or fae wearing stolen memories, none can say.

#### The Breach

Somewhere in the heart of Old Talaria, the original breach persists—the wound in reality where Ezz first flooded through. No one who's found it has returned to report its location, but its effects radiate outward. The closer you get to the center, the stranger things become.

Near the breach, the rules break down entirely. Gravity forgets which way is down. Objects remember being other things and shift between forms. Thoughts manifest physically. The boundary between self and world dissolves.

This is where Melera's song is loudest—not her distant, muted presence felt in normal Faesong, but something close to her actual voice, filtered through whatever the breach has become. Those who hear it too long stop being entirely themselves.

#### What Lives Here Now

The fae population of Old Talaria defies census. Creatures of every type have emerged from the wild magic—sprites, pixies, dryads, beings with no names in any language. Some are recognizable from folklore; others are new, born from the specific combination of energies that created this place.

The awakened trees are their own category. They range from barely-conscious (responding to stimuli but not truly thinking) to fully sapient (capable of conversation, memory, goals). The oldest have been aware since the cataclysm and have their own agendas.

Other things live here too—not fae, not awakened, just changed. Animals that ate magic-saturated food and became something else. Plants that learned to hunt. Stones that watch.

And then there are the things that came through from Ezz itself, drawn by the breach like moths to flame. No one knows what these truly are, and those who've encountered them describe them in contradictory ways. Perhaps they look different to each observer. Perhaps they don't have fixed forms at all.

#### Approaching Old Talaria

The borders are semi-porous. The Glass Forest can be entered, carefully, and some do—herbalists seeking magical plants, scholars gathering fragments of knowledge, fools seeking treasure. The key is knowing when to leave and having the will to do it.

The interior is another matter. Every generation produces adventurers confident they can navigate the chaos, recover Talarian secrets, maybe even close the breach. They enter prepared, armed, warded against every danger they can imagine.

Most don't come back. Those who do are often changed—sometimes visibly, sometimes in ways that only emerge later. And their stories never quite match up, even when they traveled together.

Old Talaria remains, after all these centuries, a wound in the world that refuses to heal.

### Pii

Tags: island, geography

Pii is a volcanic island in the Forgotten Sea, east of the Ofrenia Passage and well away from the political chaos of the three kingdoms. The island is dominated by Mount Kajiit, an active volcano whose caldera houses the Verucan capital of Mereiki. Smoke rises perpetually from the peak, and at night the glow of lava reflects off the clouds—a beacon visible for miles.

The Verucan fire dwarves have made Pii their home, building a civilization within and around the volcano. They're famous for their weapons, their tempers, and their determination to stay out of other people's wars while profiting from them.

#### Phiora

The Verucan nation that occupies Pii. See the full state entry for political details.

#### Mount Kajiit

The dominant volcano that defines Pii's geography and Verucan culture. Mount Kajiit is active—lava flows regularly, geothermal vents steam constantly, and the mountain occasionally reminds everyone that it could destroy the island whenever it chooses.

The Verucan have built their forges into the volcano's flanks, using the geothermal heat to achieve temperatures impossible elsewhere. The deepest forges, where the finest weapons are made, tap directly into magma chambers. Working there is dangerous—and produces results that justify the risk.

Mount Kajiit's history includes a catastrophic eruption in ancient times, triggered deliberately by a follower of Dyos to end the daemon wars. The resulting volcanic winter lasted millennia and killed millions across Alaria. The Verucan arrived long after, but they live with the knowledge that their home is built on the site of one of history's greatest disasters.

#### Mereiki

The capital city, built within Mount Kajiit's caldera. Mereiki is unlike any other city in Alaria—structures carved from volcanic rock, streets lit by lava channels, and a permanent sulfurous smell that visitors find overwhelming but residents barely notice.

The city is organized around the great forges, which form the economic and cultural heart of Verucan society. The ruling siblings maintain their courts here, competing for influence in the shadow of the volcano that could bury them all.

Access to Mereiki requires climbing the mountain's flanks through switchback paths carved into the rock. The journey is arduous, deliberately so—the Verucan don't make it easy for visitors to reach their home.

#### Kedari Emnath

A region on Mount Kajiit's slopes where obsidian flows have created fields of volcanic glass. The Verucan harvest this obsidian for blades, ritual objects, and trade goods. Walking through Kedari Emnath is treacherous—the glass is sharp, the footing uncertain, and new flows can appear without warning.

The name translates roughly to "the black tears" in the Verucan tongue, referring to legends about the volcano weeping for those who died in the ancient eruption.

#### Doga

The only coastal settlement of any size, positioned on Pii's western shore. Doga handles what little maritime trade Phiora conducts—the Verucan dislike the sea, but someone has to receive the food shipments and dispatch the weapon crates.

The village has a mixed population: Verucan who've overcome their aversion to water (or who lost the argument about who had to live at sea level), and a scattering of other races who serve as intermediaries between Phiora and the outside world.

#### Eir

A small rocky island north of Pii, uninhabited except for seabirds and the occasional hermit. Eir has no fresh water, no harbor, and no value except as a navigation landmark.

Local legend claims Eir was once part of Pii, blown off during the ancient Kajiit eruption. Whether true or not, the island's basalt composition matches the volcano's output. The Verucan consider Eir ill-omened—a reminder of what the mountain can do—and avoid it.

Shipwrecked sailors occasionally wash up on Eir's shores. Most don't survive long enough for rescue. The few who do report hearing strange sounds from the rocks at night, though this is usually attributed to wind, waves, and dehydration.

#### The Forgotten Sea

The waters surrounding Pii are called the Forgotten Sea, though no one quite remembers why. The name appears on charts dating back centuries, and various explanations have been proposed—none convincing.

The sea is calm most of the year, with predictable currents that make navigation relatively easy. Storms are rare but violent when they come, often accompanied by increased volcanic activity from Mount Kajiit. Whether the volcano responds to weather or causes it, the Verucan aren't sure.

Trade routes connect Pii to the Ofrenia Passage, the Middle Sea proper, and points south. Most merchants stop at Doga, conduct their business quickly, and leave. The Verucan prefer it that way.

### Shiverplains

Tags: plains, region

The Shiverplains stretch across the central interior, a vast grassland that gets its name from the way the wind makes the tall grass ripple in waves that look like shivering. It's Scalawag goblin territory—dozens of broods spread across the plains, fighting each other, raiding neighbors, and generally creating chaos.

#### The Scalawag Broods

The goblins of the Shiverplains are classic Scalawags—mischievous, impulsive, and up-to-no-good in ways that can be either amusing or deadly depending on your perspective. Each brood follows a single lineage, with hundreds of half-siblings living together under their brood-father's guidance.

The broods compete constantly. Territory, resources, pride—any excuse for a fight will do. These conflicts rarely produce lasting victories; a brood that loses ground one season will raid it back the next. The plains have been in perpetual low-grade warfare for as long as anyone can remember.

#### Relations with Neighbors

The Shiverplains goblins raid in every direction. Eloweir settlements to the northwest get hit occasionally—the elves retaliate efficiently, but the goblins don't learn or don't care. The Bygone Hills to the northeast are avoided; too many goblins have walked in and never returned.

The Jinxz Plains to the south are enemy territory—different broods, different rivalries, same chaos. The border between Shiverplains and Jinxz is a constant low-grade war zone, though "border" implies more organization than actually exists.

The Sharabha of Azawahasi to the east are occasionally targets, but the lion-folk are dangerous enough that most broods think twice. Raids happen, but they're less frequent than the inter-goblin fighting.

#### The Sachi Plains

The northern section of the Shiverplains, sometimes called the Sachi Plains, lies closest to Eloweir territory. The broods here have the most contact with outsiders—sometimes trading, sometimes raiding, rarely peaceful for long.

#### Life on the Shiverplains

Goblin settlements on the plains are semi-permanent camps rather than fixed towns. A brood might stay in one location for a season or a generation, then move when resources thin out or a bigger brood pushes them away.

The goblins hunt the plains animals, gather what grows, and supplement with whatever they can steal from neighbors. Their culture values cleverness, audacity, and loyalty to brood-mates—in that order. A goblin who can steal a rival brood's best weapon and escape laughing is celebrated; one who dies trying is commemorated briefly and then replaced.

Life expectancy is short. The goblins don't seem to mind.

An Ezuri (Tree Gnome) gerontocracy in the forests along the Chedwin Strait. The entire country is ancient woodland where gnomes live in tree-settlements and can survive for 500 years—so long as they never leave.

East of Thespia, north of Zintacas, with coastline along the Chedwin Strait.

#### Atra

The capital, such as it is—the largest tree-settlement in Stipen. Home to the council of elders who govern the forest realm. Built into and around massive ancient trees, with bridges and platforms connecting homes high above the forest floor.

#### Teleriwood

The western forest, bordering Thespia. Older, denser, with the most ancient trees. This is where the deepest parts of Stipen lie—and where the controversial psychedelic flora grows.

#### Schousterwood

The eastern forest, closer to the coast. Slightly younger growth, more connected to the outside world through coastal trade (what little exists).

### Swampdeep

Tags: swamp

Home to swamp goblins—adapted to the poisons and venoms a d toxic swamp gasses of the swamp.

Also has witches, which prey upon the goblins. Entire swamp fills with toxic gas, totally poisonous, causes your lungs to begin to bleed and you drown in your own blood in a minute.

Infested with massive leeches, deathfog, and misery-sprites.

Water is quite deep—easy to drown. Saltwater

#### Origin: The Drowning of the Emerald Coast

Swampdeep is not a natural swamp—it is a monument to catastrophe. Fifty million years ago, a Deluge Titan—a living tsunami the size of a mountain—emerged from a Pelus leyline intersection off the western coast in what became known as the largest Pelus breach in recorded history. The creature rolled inland for three hundred miles before dispersing, leaving the land beneath it permanently waterlogged. Where once a thriving civilization stood, only waterlogged ruin remains. The land will never dry. The waters will never recede.

The civilization that existed before the Drowning left no survivors and few traces. Most architectural remnants were obliterated by the deluge, scattered and sunken beyond recovery. What few structures survived remain buried under poisoned waters—monuments to a world that drowned.

#### Omegra's Hut: A Window into the Before

Omegra's Hut is the only known pre-Drowning structure still accessible. This mostly sunken dungeon contains architecture from the civilization the Deluge Titan erased—the only physical evidence of who lived here before the waters came. Its presence suggests a sophisticated society was lost to the Drowning, their knowledge and culture dissolved into saltwater and toxic gas.

#### Tide Walkers: The Eternal Guardians

The catastrophe that created Swampdeep did not end with the Drowning itself. Manifestations of Pelus water elementals—beings known as Tide Walkers—still patrol the swamp's depths. These confused guardians, born from the raw elemental chaos of the breached leyline, remain bound to the flooded lands. They defend depths of a nation that no longer exists, fulfilling purposes perhaps only they remember. Whether they serve as protectors, wardens, or prisoners of their own creation remains unknown.

### Bygone Hills

Just south of the eastern edge of Swampdeep lie the Bygone Hills, a region of rolling terrain marked by ancient ruins and forgotten city-states.

#### Eidlesandres

A city-state in the Bygone Hills, maintaining its independence through careful neutrality and strategic positioning.

#### Shystani Forest

A small forest east of Eidlesandres, notable for its sacred sites and ancient power.

##### God's Court

A massive open-air arena encircled by towering stone statues—the pantheon of a vanished people, each deity frozen in stone, staring in eternal judgment at those who stand at the center. The weight of those divine gazes creates a powerful zone of truth magic.

At the center of the arena stands an ancient altar. Anyone who swears to tell the truth upon this altar becomes magically bound to speak only truth—lies become impossible, evasions fail, and the full truth spills forth regardless of consequence. The Shystani forest has grown around this place, but locals still use God's Court to settle disputes, verify oaths, and force confessions from the accused. Those who enter the arena feel the stone gods' eyes boring into their souls.

### Sylke

Tags: state, nation

Sylke occupies western Ofrenia, a land of dense forests, swift rivers, and a population that has learned to keep its head down. The Gilded Pass ley line runs through the territory—ironic, given how little gilding reaches the common folk. The landscape is beautiful in a dark, brooding way: ancient trees blocking the sun, mist rising from river valleys, and roads that are well-maintained but rarely traveled by choice.

Queen Alisandra rules from Helmsbridge with absolute authority. The forests that once made Sylke the poorest of Ofrenia's three kingdoms now fuel an economy of lumber, ships, and darker exports. Since conquering Tornia, Alisandra controls two-thirds of the island—and the remaining third watches in terror.

#### Helmsbridge

The capital city, built where a major river crosses from the interior to the western coast. The bridge that gives the city its name is ancient—pre-dating the current kingdom by centuries—and wide enough for four wagons abreast. The royal palace sits on a bluff overlooking the bridge, positioned to watch everything that crosses.

The city is orderly, clean, and oppressively quiet. Citizens go about their business efficiently and speak to strangers only when necessary. The informant network that keeps Alisandra in power is headquartered here, though no building bears that label.

#### Scarnett

The second city, a logging hub in the southern forests near the Joswik border. Massive timber operations feed sawmills that run day and night. The workers here are rough, practical folk—they care about getting the job done and avoiding the queen's attention.

Since the conquest of Tornia, Scarnett has also become a staging ground for military operations. Troops rotate through on their way to occupation duty in the east.

#### Northern Settlements

##### Shimmercreek Falls

A town built around a dramatic waterfall where a river tumbles off the northern highlands. The falls are genuinely beautiful—one of the few places in Sylke where people might visit for pleasure rather than business. Mills powered by the falls produce flour and lumber.

##### Seavault

A northern coastal town with a natural harbor protected by rocky headlands. The name comes from sea caves in the cliffs where, according to legend, pirates once hid treasure. Whether any treasure remains is anyone's guess.

##### Cat Fell

A highland settlement in the northwestern hills, named for the wildcats that roam the surrounding moors. The population is small and insular, more concerned with their sheep than with politics in distant Helmsbridge.

#### Western Coast

##### Fool's Keep

A crumbling fortress on the western coast, now serving as a minor garrison and watchtower. The name supposedly comes from a lord who tried to hold it against the old king generations ago—a fool's errand that ended predictably.

##### Exralhorn

A coastal town where fishing and shipping combine. Small vessels carry lumber down the coast to larger ports; fishing boats bring in catches that feed the interior towns.

#### Interior & Southern Regions

##### Mapleburg

An interior town surrounded by managed forests, particularly maple groves tapped for syrup. The town has a sweetness to it—literally—that feels incongruous with Sylke's general grimness. The locals take quiet pride in their product.

##### Bridgeton

A town at the junction of Sylke, Tornia, and Joswik—strategically vital and heavily garrisoned even before the current war. Now it serves as the command post for occupation forces moving into Tornia. The civilian population has largely fled or been conscripted into support roles.

#### The Forests

Sylke's interior is dominated by ancient forest—dense canopy, limited undergrowth, and trees that have grown for centuries under careful management. The lumber is Sylke's primary export, and the forestry operations are ruthlessly efficient.

Deeper in the woods, things get stranger. The Gilded Pass ley line creates pockets where reality behaves oddly—time moves differently, directions shift, and travelers find themselves somewhere they didn't intend. The foresters know which areas to avoid. Outsiders learn the hard way.

#### The Tykon Channel

The waters west of Sylke, separating Ofrenia from the mainland. Sylke's growing navy patrols these waters, and Alisandra has ambitions to control all shipping through the channel. For now, she lacks the vessels—but with Tornia's captured fleet, that's changing.

### Ta Minn

Tags: state, nation

An Oznak horse theocracy on the western Middle Sea coast—vast grassy steppes ruled by the Kazigh, the chief horse shaman. The Ta Minn are proud cavalry warriors who once expanded freely across the plains before running into neighboring civilizations.

West of the Crags of Geth (Griselia), south of the Browthiel Hills, with a jagged coastline along the Middle Sea to the south.

#### Büüli Umén

The capital, located in the central plains. Site of the great temple where the Kazigh rules, attended by servants selected through horse ritual and killed at age 30. The spiritual and political heart of Ta Minn.

#### Ta Akikis

Western city, closer to the coast and the border with Thespia.

#### Toh Hural

Northern city, positioned near the contested border with Anarak. A military staging ground for the ongoing skirmishes over the northern plains.

#### Avar Sonnon

Eastern city, near the Crags of Geth and Griselia. Deals with occasional goblin incursions (theatrical or otherwise).

#### Limoste

Southwestern coastal city on the Chedwin Strait. Ta Minn's main port and connection to sea trade.

#### Kanüli Daha Plains

The northern plains—flat, fertile, windswept, and contested. A river flows from Anarak through a gap between the Kharvorn and Griselia mountains, providing a route for Anarak forces. This is where the two nations fight.

#### Cercesa Plains

The southeastern plains, between Büüli Umén and the coast. Less contested than the north, more pastoral.

#### The Chedwin Strait

The strait along Ta Minn's southwestern coast, separating the mainland from islands and connecting to the broader Middle Sea.

#### The Wind-Touched Plains

The entire steppe is slightly magical. Wind attunement seeps into the land, the horses, and the people. Products made here carry faint enchantments of speed and air. The Ta Minn cavalry seem to ride faster than physics should allow.

A human agricultural kingdom in chaos. Recently seized by Queen Akta, a mad mercenary sorceress from the south. The kingdom lives in the shadow of Morgnor, King of the Mountains, whose dragon territory lies to the northwest.

East of Morgnor's mountains, north of Glorin, west of Stipen, southwest of Ta Minn.

#### Geordon

The capital, in the center of Thespia. Currently under Akta's erratic rule. The royal palace has become her seat of power—and reportedly a site of strange magical experiments.

#### The Salty Hills

A range of hills running north-south through the center of Thespia, dividing the western farmlands from the eastern settlements closer to Stipen.

#### Western Settlements

Waterrun, Amerstad, Telford, Yunbery, and Cricklade lie in the western part of Thespia, closer to the dragon mountains. These towns live in Morgnor's shadow and have historically been the most cautious about provoking him.

#### Northern Settlements

Dadleigh and Syozlus in the north, near the border with Ta Minn.

#### Eastern Settlements

Tutton and Embrulton in the east, closer to Stipen and the coast. More connected to outside trade.

#### Southern Settlements

Ronnymede, Wediton, Everdein, Camerdon, Lewes, and Fellsay in the south, bordering Glorin.

#### The Dragon Shadow

Northwest of Thespia lies Morgnor's Cradle—the mountain territory of Morgnor, King of the Mountains. The Hills of Red Gold and Mt. Kazlos mark the edge of his domain. Thespia has always paid tribute and kept a small army to avoid his wrath.

Queen Akta has not continued the tribute. The dragon has not yet responded.

### Tornia

Tags: state, nation

Tornia occupies the northern portion of Ofrenia, the strategic island at the heart of the Middle Sea. Once the seat of a united island kingdom, it's now occupied territory—conquered by Queen Alisandra of Sylke in a swift, humiliating war. The landscape is gentle—temperate forests, rolling farmland, and a dramatically broken coastline of peninsulas, bays, and sheltered harbors. Time and darkness ley lines cross the territory, and their influence bleeds into everything from the architecture to the local crime.

King Aldric, the former ruler, either fled or was captured when Sylke's armies swept through. The countryside now seethes with resistance against the occupation.

#### Catalina

The capital city, built on a river delta where it empties into Gem Crest Bay. Catalina sprawls across multiple islands and riverbanks connected by bridges—some ancient stone, others newer wood that sags and creaks. The old city shows its age in towering spires and weathered temples; the new city is all gambling houses and racing pavilions.

The Gem Crest Races continue under occupation—Alisandra recognizes their value as distraction. On race days, the bay fills with spectator boats, and the city's population doubles with visitors. Sylke soldiers patrol the waterfront, and the atmosphere is carnival, rot, and simmering resentment in equal measure.

##### Besnoumeru

The merchant district of Catalina, technically a city-within-a-city. The architecture here is gorgeous—centuries of accumulated wealth expressed in carved facades, gilded domes, and private gardens visible through wrought-iron gates. Rent is impossibly expensive. The traders who operate here predict market shifts with uncanny accuracy.

Beneath the beauty, time-gangs rule. These criminal organizations use temporal manipulation to maintain iron control over commerce and politics. They emerged from the pre-human ruins beneath the district—tunnels and chambers that predate any known civilization, where temporal magic pools in strange eddies. The gangs have barely scratched the surface of what those ruins contain.

The occupation has barely touched Besnoumeru. The time-gangs play both sides—selling intelligence to Sylke authorities while quietly supporting rebels who can pay. They're positioning themselves to emerge from the chaos as the real power in Tornia, whoever nominally rules.

#### Gem Crest Bay

The bay south of Catalina, site of the famous (and infamous) Gem Crest Races. The water is deep, the currents complex, and the racing course winds through natural obstacles and artificial markers. On race days, water-attuned mages secretly propel favored vessels while betting houses collect fortunes from rigged outcomes.

The bay earned its name from the way sunlight catches mineral deposits in the cliffs—a glittering display at dawn and dusk that looks almost magical.

#### Mithras

A secondary city on the southern peninsula, overlooking the Passage. More honest than Catalina—Mithras still functions as a working port rather than a gambling den. Shipwrights here build vessels for merchants who'd rather avoid the capital's corruption.

The occupation presence is lighter here, and resistance networks operate more openly. Refugees heading to Joswik often depart from Mithras rather than risk Catalina's checkpoints.

#### Northern Coast

The northern reaches of Tornia are wilder and less developed than the south. Occupation forces are thin on the ground here, and the locals largely ignore their nominal rulers—old habit, whether the ruler is Aldric or Alisandra.

##### Northpoint

The northernmost settlement, a fishing town on a rocky promontory. Cold winds off the Middle Sea make winters harsh. The locals are practical folk who viewed King Aldric's southern decadence with contempt and view Alisandra's occupation with the same.

##### Highwater & Lowwater

Twin towns on opposite banks of a tidal estuary. Highwater sits on the bluffs; Lowwater floods at king tides and has adapted accordingly—buildings on stilts, boats tied to second-floor balconies. The rivalry between them is generations old and mostly friendly.

##### Port Edott

A western harbor town, primary departure point for ships heading to the mainland. More traffic passes through here than the town's size would suggest. Sylke maintains a garrison to monitor shipping; the locals resent it but comply.

##### Gerstown Rapids

An inland town where a river tumbles through rocky narrows. Mills and workshops cluster along the rapids, using the water power.

#### Central Settlements

##### Ryerton & Bexley

Market towns in the agricultural heart of Tornia. The farmland here is rich, and these towns serve as collection points for grain and produce—now requisitioned by occupation authorities at "fair" prices that aren't.

##### Ylidor

An eastern town near the broken coastline. Known for its smoked fish and quiet contempt for whoever rules in Catalina.

#### Southern Region

##### Oakheart

A town near Blue Lake, surrounded by old-growth forest. Timber from here once built Ofrenia's united fleet.

##### Blue Lake

A large freshwater lake in southern Tornia, fed by streams from the interior. The water is startlingly clear—you can see the bottom even at considerable depth. Old stories claim things move in the deep water that shouldn't be there.

##### Meadowlea, Goodlawn, Tall Woods

A cluster of towns that were on the Sylke border—now in the interior of occupied territory. These communities saw the invasion firsthand and harbor deep resentments. Resistance cells are active here, drawing on local knowledge of the terrain.

##### Blank Point, Thenbury, Minos

Southern settlements near the Passage. Refugees fleeing to Joswik often pass through here, and the locals have developed a quiet trade in smuggling people past occupation checkpoints.

#### Forests

##### Glowbud Forest

Once a peaceful woodland north of Catalina, now a death trap. Jaguars from the royal menagerie escaped captivity years ago and established themselves here. The great cats have grown bold and dangerous, actively hunting humans who enter. The forest earned its name from bioluminescent fungi that glow faintly at night—a beautiful sight, if you survive long enough to see it.

Occupation forces avoid Glowbud Forest. Rebels sometimes use its edges as refuge, accepting the risk of jaguars over the certainty of Sylke patrols.

##### Shadewood Forest

A darker, older forest in the interior. The tree canopy is dense enough to block most sunlight, leaving the forest floor in perpetual twilight. Local legend claims the darkness ley line surfaces here, and shadow-touched creatures roam the deeper woods.

#### The Western Border

What was once the border with Sylke is now just territory. Stannac Gate and Watertown, formerly fortified crossing points, now serve as administrative centers for the occupation. Sylke troops move freely between the kingdoms, and the border exists only in memory and resentment.

### Tykos

Tags: state, nation, island, geography

Tykos is an island chain south of Erpeus, home to minotaur clans who've practiced slavery for longer than most civilizations have existed. The islands are rocky, resource-poor, and strategically positioned at a crossroads of Middle Sea trade routes. The minotaurs turned these disadvantages into a brutal economy: what they can't grow, they take; what they can't use, they sell.

The slave markets of Tykos are famous—or infamous—across Alaria. Buyers come from nations that publicly condemn the practice, purchasing trained workers, household servants, and worse. The minotaurs don't pretend to be anything other than what they are. They find the hypocrisy of their critics amusing.

#### Slavos

The capital and largest settlement, built around the primary slave market. Slavos sits on the largest island's best harbor, positioned to receive raiding ships returning with captives and merchant vessels arriving to buy.

The market operates daily, with major auctions weekly. The facility is well-organized, almost clinical—holding pens, inspection areas, auction blocks, and processing centers for new arrivals. The minotaurs treat their merchandise as valuable property, which means adequate food, basic medical care, and protection from damage. It's not kindness; it's business.

The ruling clan of Slavos holds outsized influence in Tykos politics by controlling the market. Other clans raid and capture; Slavos processes and sells. The arrangement creates dependencies that keep the peace.

#### The Major Islands

##### Toros

The second-largest settlement, controlled by a clan known for military prowess. Toros produces most of Tykos's mercenary companies—minotaur warriors hired out to foreign conflicts. The training facilities here are brutal and effective; Toros mercenaries command premium prices.

##### Skoldar

A quarry town on a rocky island whose stone has been extracted for generations. Slave labor works the quarries under minotaur overseers, cutting blocks that are shipped across the Middle Sea. The work is hard and dangerous; life expectancy in Skoldar's quarries is not long.

##### Fynol

A fishing and raiding settlement on Tykos's southern edge. The clans here specialize in coastal raids—fast ships, quick strikes, captured populations. They supply raw material to Slavos's markets and take a percentage of the sale price.

##### Alyzon

A smaller island settlement that's developed a reputation for training household slaves. Alyzon's graduates are prized for their obedience, skills, and presentation. Wealthy buyers specifically request Alyzon-trained servants.

##### Pyndar

A port town that handles legitimate trade—the non-slave commerce that Tykos needs to survive. Grain imports, luxury goods, weapons, and other necessities flow through Pyndar. The merchants here maintain relationships with traders who won't deal in Slavos's markets.

##### Stonebreach

A coastal fortress town on Tykos's eastern edge, positioned to watch the Tykon Channel and the ongoing chaos in Ofrenia. Stonebreach serves as early warning for any naval threat and as a base for raids into disrupted Ofrenian waters.

#### Smaller Settlements

##### Scarr

A harsh settlement on a small, rocky island. The name refers to the landscape—scarred by quarrying, stripped of vegetation, barely habitable. Scarr's residents are the toughest of Tykos's minotaurs, and they're proud of it.

##### Seaview

A settlement on Tykos's southeastern edge, overlooking open water. Seaview maintains the lighthouse network that guides ships through the island chain's treacherous passages—a service that earns goodwill even from nations that despise Tykos's primary trade.

#### The Slave Trade

Tykos's economy runs on human suffering. The process is systematic:

**Acquisition**: Raids on coastal settlements, purchases from pirates and criminals, children of existing slaves, and convicted criminals sold by foreign courts seeking revenue.

**Processing**: New arrivals are assessed, classified, and prepared for sale. Skilled workers are identified; potential troublemakers are noted. Medical issues are addressed to maximize sale value.

**Training**: Depending on intended use, slaves receive training in Slavos or specialized facilities like Alyzon. Household servants learn etiquette; laborers learn obedience; pleasure slaves learn to perform.

**Sale**: The markets of Slavos operate continuously. Buyers arrive from across the Middle Sea, often through intermediaries who provide deniability. Prices vary by age, health, skills, and appearance.

**Distribution**: Purchased slaves are shipped to their new owners. Tykos maintains no responsibility after sale; what happens next is the buyer's business.

#### The Minotaurs

Tykos's minotaurs are massive—seven to eight feet tall, heavily muscled, with the distinctive bull heads that give them their name. They're not mindless brutes; their society has laws, traditions, and complex politics. They simply believe that strength justifies dominance, and they're very strong.

The clan system organizes everything. Each minotaur belongs to a clan through birth or adoption. Clans control territories, compete for status, and sometimes war—though the rules of conflict limit damage to valuable infrastructure and slave populations.

Minotaur culture values martial prowess, clan loyalty, and practical results. Philosophy and abstract morality are for weaker races. The minotaurs know what they are and don't apologize for it.

#### Relations with Neighbors

Most nations maintain complicated relationships with Tykos. They condemn slavery publicly while purchasing slaves privately. They refuse diplomatic recognition while sending merchants to Pyndar. They threaten intervention while calculating that the cost isn't worth it.

Lier trades with Tykos despite moral discomfort—the minotaurs have gold, and gold spends regardless of source. The United Free Nations officially boycotts Tykos but can't prevent all commerce. Ofrenia's ongoing civil war has disrupted trade routes, creating both problems and opportunities for Tykos's raiders.

The minotaurs understand their position perfectly. They're too useful to destroy, too profitable to ignore, too strong to conquer cheaply. As long as that calculation holds, Tykos will continue exactly as it always has.

### Ubrik

Tags: state, nation

A Uline dwarf nation in the mountains of the Middle Sea coast, between Camaran and Bestacia. Once a prosperous mining state, now a nightmare. The silvertongue outbreak has turned half the population into mercury-mouthed cannibals, and the infection is spreading.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though the alliance is buckling under the crisis. Refugees flood neighboring states. Silvertongues raid across borders. No cure exists.

#### Grothak

The capital, built into a mountainside. Partially evacuated—the wealthy fled south with their gold, leaving the poor to fend for themselves. The lower districts are dangerous; silvertongue incursions happen weekly. What remains of the government operates from fortified upper levels.

#### The Northern Mines

Where the outbreak began. Dozens of mining settlements, now silent or overrun. This is where Slick Silver was first discovered—a shimmering, mercury-like mineral in the deepest tunnels. The mines are considered lost. Anyone who enters doesn't come back.

The silvertongues nest here in growing numbers, emerging to raid the surface when hungry.

#### The Southern Mines

Still operational, barely. Refugees and remaining miners have fortified these settlements, hoping the infection hasn't spread this far. Paranoia is extreme—anyone showing signs of silver in their mouth is killed immediately. Some innocent dwarves have been murdered over dental fillings.

#### Slick Silver

A corrupted mineral, liquid-metallic and shimmering. Those who see it feel compelled to touch it. Those who touch it feel compelled to taste it. Those who taste it transform.

The silver coats the mouth first—teeth and tongue gleaming metallic. Then it spreads through the blood. Veins turn silver beneath the skin. The eyes go mirror-bright. Reason dissolves into hunger.

Silvertongues are cunning hunters. They ambush, overwhelm, and force Slick Silver down their victims' throats to spread the infection. They retain enough intelligence to use tools and set traps.

No cure is known. The infected cannot be reasoned with. Fire works, but silvertongues are fast and travel in packs.

#### The Refugee Camps

Along Ubrik's southern and western borders, desperate camps have formed. Thousands of dwarves with nothing, waiting to be allowed into Bestacia or Camaran. Conditions are terrible. Disease (normal disease, not silvertongue) spreads easily. Some refugees have been stuck in camps for months.

Host countries are hostile. Rumors that any Ubrik dwarf might be secretly infected have led to violence and discrimination.

#### The Border Crisis

Silvertongues don't respect borders. Raiding parties have struck into Bestacia and eastern Camaran. Both countries are fortifying their borders and demanding Ubrik "contain" the problem—but Ubrik's government barely exists anymore. The alliance is fracturing over who bears responsibility and who should commit troops.

### Watar

Tags: state, nation

A Dwarblin merchant state on a peninsula in the western Middle Sea. Northwest of the Telphineas Strait, south of Erasnus, with Echea at the peninsula's tip beyond them. Ruled by an oligarchy of trading families, Watar is scrappy, entrepreneurial, and hungry for more.

Member of the Aldriktch Trade Alliance, though increasingly straining against it. Relations with Bestacia are worsening over control of the Telphineas Strait.

#### Solera

The capital, seat of the Soleri family. A bustling port city where deals are made in every tavern and warehouse. The harbor is crowded with merchant vessels; the streets are crowded with traders, sailors, and opportunists. Wealth is displayed openly—the Dwarblin have nothing to prove to anyone but themselves.

#### Gravo

Major city controlled by the Gravo family, on the eastern coast. More industrial than Solera—shipyards, workshops, and craftsmen producing the practical, unbreakable goods Dwarblin are known for. The Gravo family made their fortune in manufacturing and shipping.

#### Madero

Major city controlled by the Madero family, in the south near the strait. The most strategically positioned of the three cities, and the Madero know it. They've invested heavily in naval power and are the loudest voices pushing for strait control.

#### The Coinspine Mountains

The mountain range along Watar's western border. Named by Dwarblin merchants who saw the peaks as a spine of silver waiting to be mined—and mined it they did. The mountains yield iron, copper, and enough precious metals to fund the trading families' ambitions.

#### Gleiwood Forest

Forest in the east, inland from the coast. Managed for timber—Dwarblin shipyards have an endless appetite for wood.

#### Forest of Durnos

Southeastern forest, wilder than Gleiwood. Less economically developed; the Dwarblin haven't found a good reason to exploit it yet.

#### Seabreach Forest

Southern coastal forest, along the approach to the Telphineas Strait. Strategically important—whoever controls this coastline controls access to the strait from the north.

#### Telphineas Strait

The prize. This narrow passage connects the eastern and western Middle Sea. Watar is positioned northwest of it, Bestacia northeast (but blocked by mountains). Whoever controls the strait controls tariffs on half the sea trade.

Watar has ships. Bestacia has lawyers. The situation is escalating.

### Zintacas

Tags: state, nation

A tribal Gozi (Goshwen) nation in the canyon country south of Stipen. Red rock gorges, towering stone spires, mesas, and endless sky. Utah/Arizona vibes—harsh, beautiful, and deadly to outsiders who don't know the terrain.

The Gozi fly on great raptors that hunt the canyons. Tribal society, no central government, deeply isolated, and they like it that way.

#### The Sighing Canyons

The central canyon system that gives Zintacas its character. Deep gorges carved by ancient rivers, now home to raptor nests and Gozi villages built into cliff faces. The wind through the canyons creates an eerie sighing sound—hence the name.

#### The Lizard's Back

A ridge formation along the northern border with Stipen, marking the transition from forest to canyon country.

#### Clay Hills

Rolling hills in the eastern part of Zintacas, less dramatic than the canyons but still harsh terrain.

#### Tootby Hills

Northwestern hills near the border with Thespia.

#### Dzobi Lands

#### Rompur Liko

#### Villages

Scattered through the canyons: Nod, Tilik, Pil, Kilam, Shraz, Fimli, Hechaw, Shyat, and others. Most are built into cliff faces or perched on mesa tops—accessible primarily by raptor.

#### The Raptors

Great hunting birds, large enough to carry a gnome rider. Sacred to the Gozi, who breed and train them as partners rather than mounts. The raptors hunt the gorges for prey, and the Gozi hunt with them. To harm a raptor is to declare war on all tribes.

#### The Canyon Defense

Outsiders who enter Zintacas without invitation rarely survive. The terrain is lethal without local knowledge, and the Gozi on their raptors can strike from anywhere. No army has ever successfully invaded the canyon country. Most don't try.

## Kharvorn Mountains

### Geography

The Kharvorn Mountains are a massive diagonal range that defines the heart of Clueanda, running from the center-north down to the southeast and spanning roughly half the map. Unlike the east-west Nysanna Range to the north, the Kharvorn cuts diagonally across the continent, creating the fundamental division between the frozen northern reaches and the temperate lands of the Middle Sea.

#### Position and Extent

- **Northwest terminus**: Meets the eastern tip of the Nysanna Range at approximately a 120-degree angle
- **Southeast terminus**: Ends near Adron, where the mountains give way to the coastal states of the Middle Sea
- **North**: The Celedrim Plains and their forests (Winterwood, Plutochranes) lie beyond the range
- **South**: The temperate Middle Sea region and its coastal kingdoms

#### Climate Barrier

The Kharvorn acts as a critical climate boundary. North of the range lies perpetual winter—the frozen steppes of the Celedrim Plains. South of the range, the climate warms dramatically, supporting the agricultural lands and trading cities of the Middle Sea coast. The peaks are white-capped with heavy snowfall, while the foothills transition into the brown and green of the lower lands.

#### Sub-Ranges

The Kharvorn comprises numerous distinct mountain ranges along its length, from northwest to southeast:

- **Pelmar Mountains**
- **The Knives**
- **Nirvanis Mountains**
- **Aquendrakons**
- **Gymelstik**
- **Argysis** (Winterwood Forest lies to its north)
- **Hephake**
- **Myorna** (Plutochranes Forest lies to its north)
- **Ngül**

### Notable Locations

#### Egül Mountains

A sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned north of the giant-infested basin that lies between Camaran (to the west) and Adron (to the south). This region is remote and treacherous, avoided by most travelers.

##### Nedgar's Castle

Deep within the Egül Mountains stands the ruins of Nedgar's Castle—a collapsed fortress of impossible architecture. Nedgar was a reclusive hermit mage, famous throughout the realm for his paragon attunement to stone. He built a castle that defied the laws of physics and geology, with towers that twisted in impossible angles and walls that seemed to float without support.

When Nedgar died, the castle collapsed—as if his will alone had held the structure together. Now the ruins are inhabited by animated stone beings: golems, statues, and fragments of architecture that aimlessly walk the halls, endlessly performing tasks for a master who no longer exists.

The animated stone guardians will not permit anyone who lacks stone attunement to enter the ruins. Those who try are crushed by falling masonry or torn apart by stone hands. However, for those rare geomancers with stone attunement, the ruins are accessible—and within lie multiple earth-stones, crystals of concentrated geomantic power that Nedgar collected during his lifetime.

#### Desert of One Million Shards

Northwest of Ta Minn lies the Desert of One Million Shards—a vast expanse of shattered glass stretching as far as the eye can see. The desert's surface glitters under the sun, beautiful and deadly in equal measure. Walking across it is treacherous, as the sharp glass edges can slice through boots and flesh alike.

At the center of the desert lies a massive crater containing a huge lake. In the middle of that lake rests Ulm—a colossal meteorite that struck in ancient times, creating both the crater and the lake. The impact also melted and scattered the surrounding rock into the endless field of glass shards that now defines the region.

##### Roclin Hills

In the foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains, northeast of the Desert of One Million Shards, lie the Roclin Hills. This region is named for the rocs—great, majestic birds that infest the area. The massive predators perch in the hills to roost after soaring over the desert and surrounding countryside all day hunting for prey. Travelers through the Roclin Hills risk attack from above, as the rocs are always hungry and unafraid of humanoid-sized meals.

#### Temple of Icefire

North of Gymelstik (a goblin-dominated state) and south of the Aquendrakons mountains, at the convergence of water and fire leylines, stands the Temple of Icefire. This unique institution is dedicated to the study of ice and fire magic and their interaction—a discipline that produces seemingly impossible results.

Mages who study at the Temple of Icefire learn to create ice that burns and flames that freeze, manipulating the fundamental properties of these opposing elements. The temple's location at the leyline intersection allows practitioners to channel both water and fire magic simultaneously, creating paradoxical effects that defy conventional magical understanding.

### Aqueandrekons

Tags: mountains

The Aqueandrekons are a sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned south of the Temple of Icefire and north of Gymlstik. The range is known for its sharp, dramatic peaks and the ancient ruins scattered throughout its valleys.

#### Character

The Aqueandrekons are less heavily glaciated than the ranges to the north but remain treacherous. The peaks here are younger geologically, their edges still sharp rather than rounded by millennia of erosion. Rockslides are common, and the narrow valleys channel wind into cutting gales.

Few settlements exist in the Aqueandrekons proper. The goblin-dominated state of Gymlstik lies to the south, and its tunnel networks extend beneath parts of the range, but the surface remains largely wild. Travelers passing between the Temple of Icefire and the lands to the south must navigate the Aqueandrekons carefully—both for natural hazards and for things that hunt among the peaks.

#### Caves of Nykthos

Deep in the eastern Aqueandrekons, carved into a mountainside that catches no direct sunlight, lie the Caves of Nykthos. These ancient ruins predate any known civilization in the region—their architecture suggests builders who found darkness comfortable and light painful.

The caves extend far into the mountain, their passages carved with geometric precision. The walls bear inscriptions in a language no living scholar has deciphered, and the deeper chambers contain what appear to be altars or focusing points for rituals long forgotten.

Something still dwells in the deepest reaches of Nykthos. Expeditions that venture too far report sounds of movement in the darkness, glimpses of shapes that don't match any known creature, and the unsettling sensation of being watched. Several expeditions have failed to return entirely. Those that do emerge often speak of dreams—vivid, recurring dreams of darkness and cold and something vast that waits.

The caves sit at no known leyline convergence, which makes their evident magical nature all the more disturbing. Whatever power lingers here, it predates the leyline system—or operates outside it entirely.

#### Merrow's Keep

On the western slopes of the Aqueandrekons, overlooking Sorrow Lake, stand the ruins of Merrow's Keep. The fortress was built centuries ago by a lord whose name has been deliberately erased from all records—a punishment reserved for crimes so severe that even remembrance is forbidden.

The keep itself is intact but abandoned. Local legend claims that something the nameless lord summoned or created still inhabits the fortress, though no one has verified this for generations. Sorrow Lake below the keep is unnaturally still and deep, its waters dark enough that the bottom has never been seen.

Fishermen from the valleys to the west avoid Sorrow Lake entirely. They say the fish there taste wrong, and that things sometimes surface at night that shouldn't exist in freshwater.

### Argysis

Tags: mountains, dwarven, dragon territory

Argysis is a sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains that once housed one of the great dwarven kingdoms. It has been conquered by the black dragon Rothogomos, who now rules from the ruined capital of Othyndria. The population—mostly Shyka dwarves—have been brainwashed over generations to worship their conqueror as a savior.

#### The Dragon's Domain

Rothogomos seized Argysis roughly two centuries ago, betraying his brother Tepheranos (who now rules Anarak to the south) to claim both the kingdom and its treasury. The dragon has transformed what was once a prosperous dwarven civilization into a militarized cult dedicated to his glory and focused on eventual revenge against his brother.

The surface of Argysis is dotted with abandoned holds, collapsed tunnels, and the ruins of what was once a thriving civilization. The dwarves who remain live in the functional portions of their ancestors' works, emerging only to serve Rothogomos's will.

#### The Ruined Cities

Several major dwarven cities fell during Rothogomos's conquest and have never been reclaimed:

##### Othyndria

The former capital, now Rothogomos's lair. Othyndria was built around a natural spring—the source of Wisdom Creek—and its great halls once housed the treasures and archives of the Argysisean kings. Now it is a dragon's hoard, jealously guarded and rarely seen by any living creature except those summoned to serve.

The city's upper levels are destroyed, collapsed by dragon-fire during the conquest. The lower levels remain intact, filled with Rothogomos's accumulated wealth and whatever dark things have taken root in the centuries since.

##### Morphi

The second city of Argysis, Morphi was a center of learning and craft. Its great forges produced weapons and tools traded throughout the Kharvorn region. During the conquest, the city's defenders held out for nearly a year before Rothogomos simply buried them—collapsing the mountain passages and sealing the city with everyone inside.

Morphi is considered haunted. Those few who have found ways into the sealed city report that the forges still glow, that hammers still ring in the deep, and that the defenders never stopped defending—they simply stopped being alive.

##### Encaspius

The northern gatehouse of Argysis, Encaspius controlled access from the Celedrim Plains and the frozen north. It fell first during the conquest, caught unprepared by Rothogomos's sudden assault. The city is now truly abandoned—Rothogomos uses it only as a watchtower, stationing a small garrison to observe the northern approaches.

Of the three ruined cities, Encaspius is the most accessible and the least dangerous. Adventurers sometimes explore its empty halls, searching for treasures the dragon overlooked.

#### Dryenthia Valley

The Dryenthia Valley cuts through the heart of Argysis, running roughly east-west between the mountain peaks. Before the conquest, this valley housed farms, orchards, and the small settlements that fed the great cities. Now it is largely abandoned—the population consolidated into defensible positions closer to Othyndria.

The valley floor is still fertile, but few dare work it. Rothogomos patrols his domain from above, and anything that catches his attention tends to be eaten.

#### Wisewatch

At the headwaters of Wisdom Creek, overlooking the ruins of Othyndria from a safe distance, stands Wisewatch—a small fortification that predates even the Argysisean kingdom. The watchtower was built by an unknown people to observe the spring that would later become Othyndria's heart.

Now Wisewatch serves as a gathering point for those who oppose Rothogomos—scholars studying the old kingdom, Hephakean agents, dwarven resistance fighters, and mercenaries seeking to loot the ruins. The dragon knows of their presence but seems to find them amusing rather than threatening. So far.

#### Pact of Barrik

The Pact of Barrik is a statue of two dwarven kings, standing back to back, one holding a battleax, the other holding a book. These corresponded to the Hephakean and Argysisean kings respectively.

The statues are said to imbue wisdom in those who spend time aroudn them. Children from both kingdoms would visit the statue, and princes would spend days in meditation around them. When Argysis was conquered by Rothogomos, this was no longer safe, and the tradition died out.

#### Blueshale Peaks

A mountain range northwest of Argysis proper, positioned on an earth leyline.

##### Stormfather

In the Blueshale Peaks dwells Stormfather, an earth-attuned cyclops of tremendous power. Before Argysis fell to the dragon Rothogomos, Stormfather served as a counselor to the Argysisean dwarves, offering wisdom and aid in times of need.

Stormfather remains in the peaks, a powerful ally to those who can earn his favor. He will trade his help for gems and stories of the world—the more compelling the tale, the more willing he is to assist. Alternatively, those brave (or foolish) enough can challenge him to an arm-wrestling match. Victory earns his respect and aid, though few possess the strength to best a cyclops of his might.

#### Winter Lake

A frozen lake in the northwestern reaches of Argysis, nestled in a high cirque near the sealed city of Morphi. Before the conquest, Winter Lake hosted the Argysisean ice-fishing festival—clans would gather each deep winter, drill through the ice, and compete for the largest catch. The winner received a blessing from the king and bragging rights until the next year.

Now the lake serves darker purposes. Rothogomos uses Winter Lake as a disposal site. Those who displease him—traitors, failed servants, anyone who catches his attention on a bad day—are dropped through holes in the ice. The dwarves have a phrase for it: *going to Winter Lake*. They say it quietly, like a prayer for the dead.

The lake never fully thaws, even in the brief mountain summer. Local whispers suggest the bodies have accumulated for so long that something has begun to coalesce in the cold water—not undead exactly, but a collective presence, a weight of frozen grievance pressing against the ice from below. The dragon finds this amusing. He sometimes flies low over the lake just to feel whatever is down there flinch.

#### Mordon Basin

A wide, flat basin in the western reaches of Argysis, once home to the famed Mordon vineyards. The dwarves of Argysis adapted traditional winemaking to alpine conditions, producing a pale, sharp vintage called *frostbite wine* that was prized throughout the Kharvorn region and beyond.

Rothogomos burned the vineyards during the conquest. The terraced hillsides remain, overgrown with wild grapes that no one harvests. A few desperate souls occasionally try to reclaim a patch—make wine, sell it to smugglers, buy passage out of Argysis. Most are caught and made examples of. Some aren't.

The basin's strategic importance outweighs its agricultural value. Mordon is the widest flat ground in Argysis, the only place where a large army could muster or a dragon could land without folding his wings awkwardly. Rothogomos keeps it deliberately empty for this reason. If war comes with Anarak, Mordon Basin will be the staging ground.

#### South Passage

The primary route connecting Argysis to Hephake and the lowlands beyond, a narrow defile cutting between towering peaks. A series of toll-gates and checkpoints line the passage, their stonework predating the dragon conquest by centuries.

Under Rothogomos, the passage is technically open but heavily surveilled. Everyone entering or leaving Argysis passes through checkpoints manned by brainwashed dwarven soldiers who report directly to the dragon. Tariffs are high, searches are invasive, and certain goods (weapons, maps, written materials) are forbidden entirely.

Smugglers use alternate routes: the goblin-controlled tunnels through Gymlstik (expensive but reliable) or the treacherous high passes where weather kills more travelers than bandits. Hephakean merchants grudgingly accept the official route's costs as the price of maintaining trade with their lost cousins.

The passage is also the most likely invasion corridor if Hephake ever decides to "liberate" Argysis—or if Rothogomos decides to expand south. Both possibilities keep the checkpoint garrisons alert and the fortifications maintained.

#### Wisdom Creek

Wisdom Creek flows from the spring at Othyndria (the ruined capital, now home to Rothogomos the cruel dragon) down into the valley between Argysis and Hephake. The river earned its name from the great wisdom that once flowed from the Kings of Argysis when the dwarven kingdom was at its height.

The water flows northeast, eventually reaching Enros Lake, a large lake just south of the Jotun Hills—a mountain range stretching east-west from Winterwood in the west to the southwest edge of Konai Mora.

### Blue Shale Peaks

Tags: mountains

Many warfaring giants live here. Massive skeletons litter the ground from their destroyed bodies. One of the more powerful giant lords recently died, resulting in a large power vacuum.

Ruins of a halfling civilization present. Nothing of the city, known as Tem Shyanna remains, but the fortress walls do. Trapped within are a small enclave of halfling explorers, taking care of an old, senile, fire attuned halfling, who keeps them warm during the winter and provides the warmth for their food. The man is too senile to move, and trying to force him out makes him go berserk.

The walls protect the halflings from the giants, but not the wyverns. Either way, they are trapped here. Have been living here for 5 years now.

### Breidleheis

Tags: region, giants

A high mountain basin ringed by the Gül Mountains—Ngül to the north, Egül to the east, Sorgül to the southeast—forming the heartland of the Güli giants. The name means "Broad Pasture" in the giants' tongue, and for millennia this sheltered valley has been their home.

#### The Basin

Breidleheis sits at elevation, protected from the worst lowland weather by the surrounding peaks. The basin floor is alpine meadow—tough grasses, hardy wildflowers, and scattered copses of wind-twisted pine. In summer, the meadows explode with color; in winter, they lie buried under snow that the giants consider merely inconvenient.

The basin supports enormous herds of aurochs and mountain sheep, tended by giant shepherds who have followed the same seasonal patterns for longer than human civilization has existed. The giants don't farm—they consider agriculture beneath them—but they've shaped the basin's ecology through selective hunting and herd management for so many generations that the distinction is academic.

#### Giant Society

The Güli are mountain giants—fifteen to twenty feet tall, gray-skinned, patient, and proud. They live in extended clan groups of twenty to fifty individuals, each claiming traditional grazing territories within the basin. Disputes between clans are settled through ritualized contests: wrestling, stone-throwing, and the recitation of lineage (a giant who can trace their ancestry further back wins significant prestige).

**Filgerran II** rules as king from Gülheim, but his authority is more ceremonial than absolute. The clans govern themselves; Filgerran settles inter-clan disputes, leads in times of war, and represents the Güli to outsiders. He has held the throne for over two centuries and shows no sign of dying soon.

The giants worship mountain spirits and their own ancestors. Standing stones mark territorial boundaries and sacred sites throughout the basin. The largest concentration is at **Gülheim**, where the stones form a processional avenue leading to Filgerran's fortress.

#### The Lowlanders

Humans and other small folk exist in Breidleheis on giant sufferance. A few mining operations (notably Stonetop Mines in the Egül Mountains) operate with explicit permission, paying tribute in refined metal. Traders occasionally visit the basin's edge, though venturing deeper requires a giant escort.

The giants view lowlanders with bemused condescension—useful insects, occasionally amusing, not worth the effort of exterminating. This attitude can shift quickly if a lowlander gives offense. The giants have long memories and longer arms.

#### Threats

Breidleheis is remarkably peaceful by Alarian standards. The giants have no serious external enemies—Camaran and Adron both know better than to provoke them, and the mountains themselves deter casual invasion. Internal conflicts are ritualized and rarely lethal.

The greatest threat is complacency. Filgerran II has begun looking west toward Camaran, wondering if his people have grown soft in their isolation. Some younger giants share his restlessness. If the king decides to march, the lowlands will burn—but so far, he has not decided.

#### Notable Locations

- **Gülheim**: Filgerran II's magical fortress, built to his scale alone
- **Stonetop Mines**: Human-giant joint mining operation in the Egül Mountains
- **Swinehead Forest**: Sacred hunting grounds in the southern basin
- **Lost Lake**: Forbidden waters in the Sorgül Mountains—the giants refuse to speak of what lies beneath

### Egül Mountains

Tags: mountains, giants

The eastern arm of the Gül Mountains, separating the Breidleheis basin from the broader Kharvorn range. The Egül peaks are the tallest and most rugged of the Gül ranges, forming an imposing wall that has long protected the giants from eastern incursions.

#### Geography

The Egül rise sharply from the basin floor, their eastern faces dropping in sheer cliffs toward the foothills below. Several passes cut through the range, but all are difficult—narrow, steep, and prone to rockslides. The giants prefer it this way.

#### Nedgar's Castle

Deep within the Egül Mountains lie the ruins of **Nedgar's Castle**, an impossible structure built by a stone-attuned hermit mage whose name has been lost to time. The architecture defies normal construction—walls that curve inward, stairs that spiral through solid rock, chambers with no apparent entrance.

The mage is long dead, but his creations remain. Animated stone beings patrol the halls, neither hostile nor friendly, simply *present*. They respond to those with earth attunement, sometimes offering guidance, sometimes blocking passages, their logic inscrutable.

The castle contains **earth-stones**—concentrated geomantic crystals of significant value to those who practice stone magic. Reaching them requires navigating both the animated guardians and the structure's disorienting geometry. Few succeed.

#### Stonetop Mines

On the western slopes of the Egül, where the mountains meet the Breidleheis basin, lies **Stonetop Mines**—a rare example of human-giant cooperation.

The operation began centuries ago, its origins now lost to time. The current arrangement is simple: human miners dig, extracting iron, copper, and occasional silver from the mountain's depths. Giants take first pick of the refined ore, leaving the remainder for the humans to trade or keep. Neither side remembers who proposed the deal or why the other agreed.

The human settlement at the mine entrance is cramped and rough—a few hundred souls living in buildings sized for humans but designed to withstand occasional giant visitors. **Filgerran II** considers the miners "useful insects" and extends nominal protection, meaning other giants generally leave them alone.

The arrangement's weakness is religious. The miners worship lowland gods; the giants expect acknowledgment of mountain spirits. So far, both sides pretend not to notice the tension. A zealous priest or an offended giant patriarch could shatter the peace overnight.

### Grey Mountains

Tags: mountains, Mnurvlyon

A sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains positioned between Hephake and Myorna, named for the perpetual overcast that shrouds their peaks. The Grey Mountains are sparsely populated, heavily forested at lower elevations, and home to things that prefer to avoid the attention of their more powerful neighbors.

#### Geography

The Grey Mountains are mid-sized by Kharvorn standards—not as dramatic as the central ranges, but substantial enough to form a barrier between the dwarven and Sivakr territories. Dense pine forests climb the lower slopes, thinning to alpine meadows and bare rock above. The peaks rarely see direct sunlight; heavy cloud cover is the norm year-round, giving the range its name.

#### The Mnurvlyon

The Grey Mountains' most notable inhabitants are the **Mnurvlyon**—a people born of ancient unions between mountain giants and Kharvorn dwarves. They stand eight to ten feet tall, broader and more heavily built than either parent race, with the durability of both.

The Mnurvlyon live in scattered steadings throughout the Grey Mountains, neither fully accepted by giants nor dwarves. They are taciturn, isolationist, and deeply suspicious of outsiders. Their settlements are built into mountainsides, part giant hall and part dwarven hold, sized for their unusual frames.

They mine, they forge, they keep to themselves. Trade with lowlanders is minimal and conducted at arm's length—literally, through window-slots in their steading walls. They have no interest in Hephakean politics, Myornan intrigues, or the broader conflicts of the world. They want only to be left alone.

This wish is not always granted. Both Hephake and Myorna have attempted to bring the Mnurvlyon into their spheres of influence. Both have failed. The half-giant-dwarves are too few to be worth conquering and too stubborn to be worth negotiating with.

#### The Bears

The Grey Mountains are home to enormous cave bears—fourteen feet at the shoulder, territorial, and utterly unafraid of anything. The Mnurvlyon have reached an understanding with the bears over generations: certain valleys belong to the bears, certain valleys to the Mnurvlyon, and the boundaries are respected by both sides.

Outsiders who wander into bear territory rarely survive long enough to understand their mistake. The bears are not malicious—they are simply apex predators who do not distinguish between a lost traveler and a meal.

#### The Howling

At night, especially during full moons, strange howls echo through the Grey Mountains. The Mnurvlyon bar their doors and refuse to discuss the matter. The few outsiders who have investigated report finding wolf tracks of unusual size, claw marks on trees at heights no natural wolf could reach, and occasionally, human belongings abandoned in the forest.

Whether the Grey Mountains harbor true werewolves, some other lycanthropic curse, or simply very large and very cunning wolves, the Mnurvlyon are not saying. They have clearly reached some accommodation with whatever hunts their mountains at night. Outsiders are not included in this arrangement.

#### Relations

The Grey Mountains form a buffer zone between Hephake and Myorna—two powers that deeply distrust each other. Neither wishes to see the other control the passes through the Grey range, so both tacitly accept Mnurvlyon autonomy as preferable to the alternative.

The Mnurvlyon exploit this dynamic with quiet skill. They trade with both sides, favor neither, and ensure that any attempt at annexation would be more trouble than it's worth. Their isolation is a political choice as much as a cultural one.

### Gymlstik

Tags: mountains, goblin territory

Gymlstik is a sub-range of the Kharvorn Mountains, positioned between the Blueshale Peaks to the northwest and the Aqueandrekons to the southeast. Once a dwarven stronghold, it has been conquered by goblins and Cirthikin—large, burrowing, praying-mantis-like creatures—who have transformed the mountains into a vast underground domain.

#### Geography

The surface of Gymlstik appears relatively normal—rugged mountain terrain with sparse vegetation, rocky slopes, and the occasional abandoned dwarven outpost. The true nature of the region lies beneath. The goblin and Cirthikin inhabitants have carved an enormous tunnel network that extends for hundreds of miles underground, connecting mines, hidden lairs, and underground fortresses in a labyrinthine system that no outsider has fully mapped.

The primary surface feature is the North Passage—a treacherous but navigable route through the mountains that connects the lands north of the Kharvorn to those in the south. Travelers using the North Passage must contend with goblin toll-collectors, rockslides, and the ever-present risk of Cirthikin ambush.

#### The Surry Dwarves

When the goblins and Cirthikin conquered Gymlstik, the dwarven inhabitants were driven deeper underground rather than slaughtered outright. Over generations, these refugees have become the Surry dwarves—pale, twisted creatures barely recognizable as their ancestors. They survive in the deepest tunnels, scavenging what they can and avoiding their conquerors. Some say they've developed new abilities suited to absolute darkness; others claim they've simply gone mad.

The relationship between the surface goblins and the deep Surry is unclear. Some goblin tribes hunt them for sport; others trade with them for resources only the deep places provide.

#### Gruthnik's Rest

At the northern edge of Gymlstik, where the mountains begin their descent toward the Temple of Icefire, lies Gruthnik's Rest—a flat-topped peak that serves as a waystation for those traveling the North Passage.

The "rest" was named for Gruthnik, a legendary goblin chieftain who supposedly achieved something no other goblin had: peaceful old age. According to goblin legend, Gruthnik was so cunning and so feared that no rival dared challenge him, and he died in his sleep at an age goblins consider impossibly ancient. His burial mound sits atop the peak, and goblins consider the location sacred—one of the few places in Gymlstik where travelers can camp without fear of attack.

The tradition holds, mostly. Goblin guides who lead travelers through the North Passage often camp at Gruthnik's Rest, and violence there is considered extremely bad luck. However, the Cirthikin recognize no such taboo, and their hunting parties sometimes ignore the sanctuary.

#### Blueshale Approaches

The northwestern edge of Gymlstik borders the Blueshale Peaks, where the Stormfather—an earth-attuned cyclops of tremendous power—makes his home. The goblins give this border a wide berth. Whatever ancient understanding exists between the Stormfather and the mountain's other inhabitants, the goblins have learned not to test it.

### Gülheim

Tags: poi

Massive fortress built for Filgerran II, king of the Güli giants. The fortress is only really big enough for him, and is magically enabled to provide for his needs. It is his throne from which he looks out upon his mountains. One day, he may decide to look to the West and take Camaran, though that day has not yet arrived.

### Hephake

A dwarven state in the southern Kharvorn Mountains, sharing a southeastern border with the state of Myorna. Hephake is known for its extensive silver mines and the pollution they produce.

#### Phorysia

The capital city of Hephake, a major dwarven mining settlement with massive silver extraction operations. The city sprawls across multiple mountain levels, its architecture dictated by the seams of silver that honeycomb the surrounding rock. Smoke from refineries hangs perpetually over the lower districts.

#### Agora

The third great city of Hephake, positioned in the western reaches of the kingdom along the trade routes to Camaran and Adron. Where Phorysia mines and Erebinthias guards, Agora trades. The city's markets handle goods flowing between the mountain kingdoms and the lowlands—dwarven metalwork heading down, grain and textiles heading up.

Agora's governor holds equal rank with Phorysia's, appointed directly by the king for acts of exceptional service. The current governor, Thorndin Silvervein, earned his position through a century of diplomatic work establishing trade agreements with the lowland nations. He is old, shrewd, and far more interested in profit than politics.

#### Easthelm

A fortified town in the eastern passes, controlling the approaches from the Grey Mountains and Myorna beyond. Easthelm exists primarily to watch the Sivakr—Hephake does not trust their silver-skinned neighbors and their memory magic.

The town maintains a standing garrison and a network of watchtowers extending into the Grey Mountains. Relations with the Mnurvlyon are cautiously cordial; both peoples share a distrust of Myorna that occasionally translates into cooperation.

#### Abaddan

A mining settlement in the central mountains, smaller than Phorysia but significant for its iron deposits. The Abaddan mines produce the base metal that Hephakean smiths transform into tools, weapons, and the infrastructure of the kingdom.

The town is rough, practical, and perpetually covered in ore dust. Workers cycle through on multi-year contracts, earn their pay, and leave. Few stay longer than they must—Abaddan lacks Phorysia's amenities or Agora's opportunities. It is a place for work, not life.

#### Erebinthias

The second city of Hephake, positioned in the northern reaches of the kingdom near the border with Argysis. Unlike Phorysia's industrial character, Erebinthias is a military stronghold—the forward position from which Hephake watches its dragon-occupied neighbor.

The city sits in a defensible mountain valley, its walls thick and its garrison large. Before Argysis fell, Erebinthias was primarily a trade hub, managing commerce between the two dwarven kingdoms. Now it is a fortress, its merchants replaced by soldiers, its inns converted to barracks.

Erebinthias is also the staging point for expeditions to Wisewatch and beyond. Anyone seeking to approach Argysis—whether scholar, mercenary, or resistance sympathizer—passes through here first. The city's intelligence apparatus is extensive; the authorities know far more about events in Argysis than they officially admit.

#### Two Brothers

A distinctive pair of peaks north of Erebinthias, visible for miles along the approaches to Argysis. The Two Brothers mark the traditional boundary between Hephake and Argysis—or what was Argysis before the dragon came.

According to legend, the peaks were once a single mountain split in two during a duel between dwarven princes. The losing prince fell into the chasm between them; his bones lie there still. Whether this is history or myth, the Two Brothers have become a pilgrimage site for those mourning Argysis's fall. Dwarves climb to the col between the peaks to leave offerings and pray for their cousins' liberation.

The dragon Rothogomos knows of this tradition and finds it amusing. He occasionally sends his agents to observe the pilgrims, ensuring none attempt anything more active than prayer.

#### Traitor's Watch

A fortified watchtower northwest of Erebinthias, overlooking the approaches to Wisdom Creek and the ruins of Argysis beyond. The name dates to the conquest—supposedly, this is where Hephakean scouts first spotted smoke rising from Argysis and realized something was terribly wrong.

The original watchers failed to raise the alarm in time. Whether this was treachery, incompetence, or simply the chaos of disaster has never been determined. The survivors were executed regardless, and the tower was renamed as a permanent reminder of the cost of failure.

Today, Traitor's Watch is the forward observation post for Hephake's intelligence operations against Argysis. The garrison is small but highly trained, tasked with monitoring dragon movements, tracking refugees, and intercepting Rothogomos's agents before they reach Hephakean territory. Duty at Traitor's Watch is considered either a punishment or an honor, depending on who assigns it.

#### Derivlia Lake

Located in the southern part of Hephake, Derivlia Lake has become severely poisoned by runoff from the silver mines of Phorysia. The water is toxic, killing most life and leaving the shores barren. The lake serves as a stark reminder of the environmental cost of Hephake's mining wealth, and the dwarves have made no efforts to clean it—silver production continues unabated, and the poison flows into the lake year after year.

#### The Mountain Churches

Three ancient churches stand in the high passes of Hephake, built in the early days of the kingdom to sanctify the mountain roads and protect travelers. Each is dedicated to a different aspect of dwarven faith, and each has developed its own character over the centuries.

##### Church of Margia

The westernmost of the three, built at a crossroads where routes diverge toward Argysis and the Blueshale Peaks. The Church of Margia honors the forge-mother aspect of the dwarven faith—creation, craft, and the transformation of raw ore into works of beauty.

The church maintains a working forge, tended by priest-smiths who create sacred implements for temples throughout Hephake. Travelers can commission minor repairs or blessings for their equipment, and the smoke rising from the church's chimney is visible for miles on clear days.

Since the fall of Argysis, the Church of Margia has taken on a secondary role as a waystation for those traveling to Wisewatch. The priests ask no questions and offer no opinions on the dragon situation, but their doors are open to anyone with coin for the offering box.

##### Church of Nocci

Positioned in the central passes, the Church of Nocci serves the warrior aspect—honor in battle, protection of the weak, and the righteous fury of the defender. The church is part temple, part fortification, its walls thick enough to withstand siege.

A small garrison of temple knights maintains the church, sworn to protect travelers through the passes. Their mandate is defensive only—they will not pursue bandits or monsters beyond the church's immediate vicinity—but within their territory, they are formidable.

The Church of Nocci has grown increasingly militant since Argysis fell. Many of the knights believe they should march to liberate their cousins from dragon rule. The high priest counsels patience. The tension is visible.

##### Church of Agril

The easternmost church, closest to the Myorna border, honors the stone-father aspect—endurance, patience, and the slow wisdom that comes from centuries of contemplation. The Church of Agril is quiet where the others are active, its priests devoted to prayer, meditation, and the maintenance of genealogical records stretching back millennia.

The church houses the most complete archive of Hephakean lineages outside the capital. Families send representatives to update their entries, verify ancestry, and record births and deaths. The priests are meticulous, impartial, and utterly disinterested in politics—which makes them invaluable arbiters in inheritance disputes.

The Church of Agril also watches the Myorna border with quiet concern. The Sivakr's memory magic troubles the stone-father priests deeply. They have begun maintaining duplicate records in secret locations, just in case.

### Myorna

A state in the Kharvorn Mountains.

TODO

### Ngül Mountains

Tags: mountains, giants

The northern arm of the Gül Mountains, forming the upper boundary of the Breidleheis basin. The Ngül range is the most heavily settled of the three Gül ranges, with the majority of Güli giant clans claiming traditional territories among its peaks and valleys.

#### Geography

The Ngül are lower and more weathered than the central Kharvorn peaks, their slopes gentled by millennia of wind and ice. Deep valleys cut between the mountains, providing sheltered grazing land for the giant herds. The northern faces drop steeply toward the lowlands of Camaran and Adron.

#### Giant Holdings

Most Güli clans maintain permanent winter lodges in the Ngül valleys—massive stone structures sized for giants, often built into cliff faces or around natural hot springs. Summer sees the clans disperse across the basin to follow their herds, but winter draws them back to ancestral territories passed down through generations.

The largest concentration of giants lives in the eastern Ngül, near Gülheim. Proximity to the king brings prestige (and obligations), making these territories the most contested in inter-clan politics.

#### Tanim Oscurus

The western reaches of the Ngül overlook a region the giants call **Tanim Oscurus**—the Dark Grazing. This area, sloping down toward the lowlands, was once giant territory. Three centuries ago, something drove the clans out. The giants do not speak of what happened, but they no longer graze their herds there, and young giants are forbidden from descending the western slopes alone.

Lowlanders who have explored Tanim Oscurus report finding it unremarkable—empty grassland, a few ruins, nothing obviously wrong. But they also report feeling watched, and a persistent sense that they should leave before nightfall.

### Nirvanis Mountains

Tags: mountains

The Nirvanis Mountains were once home to an ancient civilization of people who died out hundreds of years ago to overhunting. All the remains are the massive stone statues dotted throughout the land, under which the dead were buried. These statues were believed to protect the mountains from evil spirits.

The mountains, do, in fact have evil spirits haunting them, which the statues protect against. These spirits are known as Kyth, and appear as white, spectral ghosts. They come out at night and will kill those who are not spiritually warded (such as by the statues).

### Nyinsylys's Domain

Tags: dragon territory

The glacial highlands between the Nirvanis Mountains and the Knives are claimed by the white dragon Nyinsylys. This desolate region of ice fields, frozen peaks, and howling wind serves as her hunting ground and lair.

See [Nyinsylys](../../bestiary/dragons/Nyinsylys.md) for details on the dragon herself.

#### Character

Nyinsylys's domain is arguably the most inhospitable stretch of the northern Kharvorn. The glaciers here are ancient, the crevasses deep, and the weather lethal. Even the hardened Zwaeron avoid this region, preferring to route their caravans through the marginally less deadly Pelmar passes to the northeast.

The dragon has shaped her territory over centuries. Bones of enormous creatures litter the ice—some her kills, others ancient things that died here long before she arrived. Her lair is said to be deep within a glacier, accessible only through tunnels of ice that she can collapse at will.

#### The Boundary

The southern edge of Nyinsylys's domain borders the Nirvanis Mountains with their Kyth spirits and protective statues. The two territories seem to acknowledge each other—the dragon does not hunt in the statue-fields, and the Kyth do not venture onto the glaciers. Whether this represents some ancient pact, mutual respect, or simply pragmatic avoidance remains unknown.

### Skywatch

Tags: ruins, poi

Skywatch is an ancient observatory perched near the summit of one of the tallest peaks in the Kharvorn Mountains, on the northern edge of the Blueshale range. The peak itself—unnamed on most maps, simply "the great mountain"—rises so high that its summit is perpetually shrouded in cloud, and the air at its heights is too thin for most creatures to breathe.

#### The Observatory

The ruins of Skywatch cling to a shelf of rock just below the cloud line, positioned to have an unobstructed view of the sky in all directions. The builders—their identity lost to history—constructed the observatory from a pale stone that seems to glow faintly at night, and they carved channels and apertures into the structure that align with celestial bodies at specific times of year.

Whatever instruments once filled Skywatch are long gone, looted or destroyed or simply crumbled to dust. But the structure itself remains, its angles and proportions suggesting a sophisticated understanding of astronomy and mathematics. Scholars who have made the dangerous climb report that the ruins still function in some capacity—that on certain nights, when the moons and stars align, the channels fill with light and the walls seem to hum with dormant power.

#### The Climb

Reaching Skywatch requires ascending through wyvern territory, navigating unstable scree slopes, and enduring the brutal cold and thin air of extreme altitude. Most expeditions fail before reaching the observatory. Those that succeed must contend with whatever has taken up residence in the ruins—the place is rarely empty, though what occupies it seems to change with the seasons.

#### Purpose

The original purpose of Skywatch remains debated. Some believe it was purely astronomical—a place to study the movements of the celestial bodies. Others note its position on an air leyline and suggest it may have been built to harness or observe aerial magical phenomena. A third theory holds that Skywatch was a watchtower in the most literal sense—built to monitor something approaching from the sky, something the builders expected and feared.

The last theory gains support from certain inscriptions within the ruins, which speak of "the eye that never closes" and "vigilance against the falling dark." What this darkness might be, and whether it ever came, the inscriptions do not say.

### Sorgül Mountains

Tags: mountains, giants, mystery

The southeastern arm of the Gül Mountains, curving down toward the broader Kharvorn range. The Sorgül are the wildest of the three Gül ranges—less settled, more dangerous, and home to things the giants prefer not to discuss.

#### Geography

The Sorgül rise in jagged peaks, younger and sharper than their northern cousins. Deep glacial cirques bite into the mountainsides, some holding small lakes, others filled with permanent ice. The terrain is treacherous even by giant standards—loose scree, hidden crevasses, and sudden storms that sweep up from the lowlands.

#### Swinehead Forest

At the southern edge of the Sorgül, where the mountains descend toward the Breidleheis basin, lies **Swinehead Forest**—a dense, ancient woodland named for the enormous boars that roam beneath its canopy.

The boars of Swinehead are massive—the smallest are pony-sized, the largest rival oxen. They are aggressive, territorial, and extraordinarily dangerous. For the Güli giants, they are sacred prey.

A young giant's first solo boar kill marks their passage to adulthood. The hunt is undertaken alone, with traditional weapons only—no magic, no assistance, no retreat. Success earns the tusks, which are carved into ritual objects worn for life. Failure means death or shame that never fades.

Lowlanders occasionally poach in Swinehead. The giants usually ignore this—humans hunting pigs is beneath notice. But anyone who kills a giant's marked prey, or worse, a breeding sow protected by clan law, faces summary execution. No trial, no appeal. Just a giant's boot.

#### Lost Lake

High in the Sorgül cirques, hidden from casual view, lies **Lost Lake**—a dark, still body of water that the giants refuse to approach.

The lake has no outlet and no apparent source. Its surface is perfectly calm even in high winds. The water is cold beyond reason—lowlanders who have tested it report numbness within seconds, frostbite within minutes. Nothing lives in it. Nothing grows on its shores.

The giants will not speak of Lost Lake directly. Pressed, they say only that something sleeps beneath the water—something that was old when their ancestors first entered the basin. The giants' arrival disturbed it. Their songs drove it down. But songs are forgotten, and the sleeper is patient.

Those who camp near Lost Lake report dreams of drowning—of sinking through black water toward something vast and aware at the bottom. The dreams intensify each night. By the third night, most flee. Those who stay longer are never seen again. Search parties occasionally find their camps, gear undisturbed, no sign of struggle. The dreamers simply... aren't there anymore.

The giants have a saying: *The lake remembers everyone who forgets it.* They do not explain what this means.

### The Knives

A mountain range in the Kharvorn Mountains region.


The Knives, as they are commonly called, are in a constant state of very high winds, which have blown the peaks into sharp points, giving the mountains their name.

## Westwilds

### Geography

The Westwilds occupy the southwestern corner of Clueanda, forming a transitional zone between the frozen Northlands and the maritime regions to the south. This is the southern coast of Clueanda, stretching from Tarkhon in the east to the waters overlooking the Western Isles in the west.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Transitions into the Northlands; the frozen tundra gradually gives way to arid scrubland
- **East**: Meets Tarkhon territory; some desert coastline marks this transition
- **South**: Faces the open ocean, with the Western Isles visible offshore
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking the Western Isles

#### Terrain

The Westwilds have a yellowish-green hue suggesting dry steppe or scrubland. The region is less fertile than the Middle Sea lands but more hospitable than the frozen north—a rugged zone of hardy grasses, wind-worn rock, and arid soil. While not a true desert, the land is parched and demanding.

#### Climate Transition

The Westwilds represent one of Clueanda's major climate transitions. The frozen winds from the Northlands lose much of their bite here, but the region receives little rainfall. The result is an austere landscape—neither frozen nor verdant, but something in between.

### Notable Locations

#### Shazuihn

An orc state in the interior Westwilds, notable for its extensive forests and proximity to dangerous geothermal features.

##### Shazuihn Forest

Dense woodlands covering much of the orc state's territory, providing shelter and resources for the orc clans.

##### The Plains Beyond

North of the Shazuihn Forest lie open plains marked by violent magical phenomena.

###### Dragon Spout

Located in the plains north of Shazuihn and southwest of the Scorches (a region of hotsprings and geysers), Dragon Spout is a site where the void and fire leylines intersect. Huge gouts of flame erupt unpredictably from the ground, shooting hundreds of feet into the air. The combination of void magic and fire creates flames that burn with unnatural heat and persistence—they cannot be extinguished by conventional means and sometimes burn in colors that shouldn't exist.

The area around Dragon Spout is a scorched wasteland, littered with the remains of those who underestimated the danger. The eruptions are impossible to predict, and the void-tainted fire can burn through magical protections. Despite the extreme hazard, some fire mages make pilgrimages here to study the raw elemental power.

###### The Scorches

Northeast of Dragon Spout lies the Scorches, a region of hotsprings and geysers where geothermal activity creates a landscape of bubbling mud pots, scalding pools, and steam vents. The heat here is natural rather than magical, but no less deadly.

At the heart of the Scorches is a massive boiling whirlpool where superheated water churns with such violence that it becomes super-aerated, causing anything that enters to lose buoyancy and sink immediately. Gouts of fire erupt from the whirlpool at irregular intervals, and the area is inhabited by steam elementals—creatures born from the intersection of water and fire. The Scorches are extremely dangerous, and few who venture too close to the central whirlpool survive.

###### Ruby Rock

West of the Deadwalk desert, within the Scorches, stands Ruby Rock—a massive stone outcropping that erupted from the ground in ancient times. The rock contains a vast cavern system filled with rubies and gemstones, created when mineral-rich water from the hotsprings deposited sediments over millennia before being uplifted by geological forces.

The gems are breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly valuable, but they carry a curse. Those who take rubies from the cavern find themselves plagued by misfortune—relationships crumble, fortunes are lost, and death stalks them. Some say the curse is tied to the volcanic forces that created the gems; others believe the rubies remember being torn from their home and seek revenge on those who stole them.

#### The Orc States

The southern and western portions of the Westwilds are divided among six major orcish states, each controlling territory in the vast forested region:

- **Glivornax**
- **Hedroscobb** (northeast of the Plains of Oblivion)
- **Grieb** (home to the Grieb Lakes and the Griebi people)
- **Shazuihn** (detailed above)
- **Tarn** (detailed below)
- **Uhionai**

These states maintain a loose confederation, cooperating for defense against external threats while fiercely competing for resources and territory within the Westwilds.

##### Tarn

One of the central orcish states in the Westwilds, positioned along the Grand Tolkarsus river system.

###### Plenjorn Swamp

A marshy region within Tarn, fed by the Grand Tolkarsus—a massive river that stretches from the Nirvanis Mountains (part of the Kharvorn range) in the northeast, flowing southwest through orcish territory, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and the Deadwalk desert, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake. This colossal lake connects to Symonair Lake, which empties into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

Within Plenjorn Swamp, the river's waters are said to possess miraculous healing properties. Bathing in the Grand Tolkarsus can cure even the most brutal wounds and life-threatening injuries. Few outside Tarn know of this power, and the Tarni orcs fiercely protect the swamp from outsiders, ensuring the healing waters remain a secret advantage for their people.

#### Plains of Oblivion

Northwest of the mountains of Murth (a state in Tarkhon), stretching from the Western Isles coast in the west to the orc state of Hedroscobb in the northeast, lie the Plains of Oblivion. These cursed grasslands cause all who enter to gradually forget everything except their oldest long-term memories and events from the past year. Recent memories, learned skills, and personal identity slip away like water through fingers.

The plains are home to Satyrn Gray—the palace of Queen Eranes, an extremely powerful half-titan who lost her love when the plains were cursed and split by ancient magic. In her grief, she sought to forget, enchanting her entire palace with powerful spells that hide memories. Though she has succeeded in forgetting her love, she still feels a deep, inexplicable sorrow. She knows she is connected to these plains and cannot bring herself to leave, but she no longer remembers why.

Queen Eranes will handsomely reward anyone who can explain to her what has happened—who she was, what she lost, and why she feels such endless mourning. But the palace's enchantments work against this goal: visitors forget their purpose, the queen forgets the conversations she has, and the truth remains perpetually out of reach. The memory-draining effect of the plains ceases once travelers leave, but the lost memories never return, and the queen remains trapped in her palace of forgotten sorrows.

#### Mountains Semaphois

West of the Grand Tolkarsus and south of the northern plains rise the Mountains Semaphois. To the mountains' west lies Ichneum, a large forest. North of the range are the mountains of Miphori, the Zhorheim Mountains (marking the northern edge of the forest), and the Hills of the White Terror, which stretch northeast into the Northlands.

##### Temple of the Wind

High in the Mountains Semaphois stands the wind-racked, abandoned Temple of the Wind. This remote structure was once home to monks and primeshapers who mastered both earth and air magic, using the mountain winds to fuel their practice. The temple was destroyed when a mechwurm attacked, killing the monks and leaving the temple empty.

Now the temple stands as a haunting reminder, its halls filled with the howling winds that once served the monks' magic. The structure itself remains intact, though battered by decades of relentless wind, and the knowledge the monks possessed has been lost with their deaths.

#### Zhorheim Mountains

Home to Zorheim, the dragon guardian of the Einwissel dwarves who traveled back from Celestia. The dragon can travel to Celestia easily as well. The dwarves know its true name, and vice versa—a foundation of enormous trust. Located in a mountain range forming part of the southwest side of the northlands, northeast of Ichneum, marking the northern edge of the forest region.

### Chakatann

Tags: region, geography, desert

A region of the western Piktiniti Desert defined by the Postronamas pillars—massive stone columns hundreds of feet tall, spaced roughly ten miles apart in a grid that once covered most of the western desert. The pillars are impossible to miss; they dominate the skyline for miles in every direction, ancient monuments to an empire that rose and fell millennia ago.

#### The Pillars

Each pillar is a monolithic column of fused stone and crystal, between two hundred and four hundred feet tall, smooth-sided and weathered by centuries of desert wind. They are clearly artificial—too regular, too uniform, made of a composite material that doesn't match local geology. The Postronamas Empire built them, though how remains unclear. Modern engineers cannot replicate the construction.

The pillars were designed as a resonance network. Each contains (or contained) a core of twyl crystal—the same magical mineral that produces oxygen in the Piktiniti's soil. When the network was active, the crystals sang to each other across the desert: a subsonic hum felt in the bones rather than heard with ears. The network amplified magical power to continental scales, enabling feats of weather control, long-distance communication, and perhaps stranger things.

Now the network is broken. Many pillars have fallen or shattered; their crystals cracked, depleted, or stolen. But some still function—faintly, sporadically, enough to make the region strange.

#### The Resonance

Standing exactly between two pillars creates unusual acoustic effects. Whispers carry impossibly far. Sounds echo from directions that don't make sense. Some travelers report hearing voices—fragments of ancient Postronamas speech, conversations from thousands of years ago somehow preserved in the resonance.

The pillars that still hum are called "blessed" by the Seyiki gnomes who live among them. Those that hum *wrong*—discordant, arrhythmic, unsettling—are avoided. Whatever damage broke the network didn't destroy it uniformly; different pillars remember different pieces of what they were.

At night, some pillars glow faintly from within. The crystal cores aren't entirely dead.

#### The Spacing

The ten-mile spacing isn't random—it's the precise distance for resonance between twyl crystals of a specific frequency. The Postronamas engineers understood harmonics at a level modern mages don't. The grid pattern means that anywhere in Chakatann, you can see multiple pillars on the horizon, their tops often lost in heat-haze or dust.

Navigating by pillar is the only reliable way to cross Chakatann. The pillars don't move. Everything else might.

#### The Seyiki

The pillars are home to the Seyiki—dragonfly-riding gnomes who have adapted to life among the impossible monuments. They live on pillar-tops, in carved chambers within the pillars themselves, and in settlements around the pillar bases. See separate entry for their culture and way of life.

#### Dangers

Beyond the Seyiki, Chakatann shares the Piktiniti Desert's hazards: giant insects (thriving in the oxygen-rich air), sand dragons, scorpions the size of horses, and the seven-year locust swarms that devastate everything at ground level.

The pillars themselves can be dangerous. Climbing them without permission risks Seyiki response—they're territorial about their homes. Some pillars are unstable, their bases eroded or their structures compromised. And the resonance effects near certain pillars can cause disorientation, headaches, or worse.

Treasure hunters come to Chakatann seeking intact crystal cores, which are worth fortunes to the right buyers. The Seyiki don't appreciate claim-jumpers. Neither do the pillars—something about removing a core seems to wake defenses that shouldn't still function.

### Desendrum Mountains

Tags: hills, mountains, geography

A rugged north-south ridge in the central Westwilds, the Desendrum range marks the transition between the forested west and the open plains to the east. Despite the name "mountains," the Desendrum are modest by Alarian standards—more accurately described as a highland spine of worn peaks and steep-sided valleys. Locals call them the Desendrum Hills with equal frequency.

#### Geography

The Desendrum stretch roughly 120 miles from the Grelli Hills in the north to the approaches of Grieb territory in the south. The range averages 20-30 miles wide, with peaks reaching 3,000-4,000 feet—high enough to catch weather and channel winds, but low enough that determined travelers can cross at many points.

**The Spine**: The central ridge is rocky and exposed, a weathered backbone of ancient stone that has resisted the erosion that smoothed the surrounding terrain. Local legend claims the Spine is the skeleton of a dead titan, which accounts for its unnatural straightness.

**The West Face**: The slopes facing the Walking Forest are heavily forested—overflow from the migrating woods. These forests are technically part of the Walking Forest's peripheral movement, though they shift more slowly than the core territory.

**The East Face**: The eastern slopes are dryer, transitioning to the grasslands that eventually become the Steppe of Aziirn. Scrub brush and hardy grasses predominate.

#### Passages

Several routes cross the Desendrum, though none are easy:

**The Shepherd's Gap**: The widest and most-traveled passage, roughly midway along the range. Traders moving between Grieb and the western territories use this route, though it adds days to any journey.

**The High Trail**: A narrow path along the Spine itself, passable only in summer. Faster than circumnavigation but dangerous—exposure and rockfall claim several travelers each year.

**The Runoff Cuts**: Seasonal streams have carved several narrow valleys through the range. These are passable when dry but become deadly torrents during spring melt or heavy rains.

#### Inhabitants

**The Ridge Clans**: Small human communities who've lived in the Desendrum for generations, subsisting on hunting, herding, and guiding travelers through the passes. They maintain a strict neutrality between the orc states to the south and the human settlements to the north.

**Harpy Colonies**: The exposed peaks of the Spine host several harpy nesting sites. The harpies are territorial but not inherently hostile—they'll tolerate travelers who keep moving but attack anyone who lingers near their roosts.

#### Climate

The Desendrum create their own weather patterns, forcing moisture from westerly winds to fall as rain on the western slopes while the east stays dry. Winters are harsh at elevation, with snow blocking the passes from late autumn to mid-spring.

#### Why It Matters

The Desendrum are a natural barrier that shapes trade, migration, and politics throughout the central Westwilds. They separate the Walking Forest's influence from the eastern plains, channel travel through predictable routes, and provide refuge for those who want to avoid the orc states' attention.

### Everwood

Tags: forest, geography

A vast forest stretching across the southern Krenglelan Range and into the lowlands beyond, the Everwood is not a forest in any normal sense—it is a single, continent-spanning organism that has been growing for millennia.

#### The Living Forest

Nothing can rot in the Everwood. The trees cannot die. When a branch falls, it doesn't decay—it simply lies there, slowly being absorbed back into the greater whole. The entire forest is one organism, its root systems interconnected beneath the soil in a web that extends for hundreds of miles.

The canopy is so dense with interlocking branches that no light reaches the forest floor. Below the green ceiling lies a twilight world—and in that darkness, the understory has become entirely fungal. Vast carpets of mushrooms, shelf fungi the size of tables, and bioluminescent growths that provide the only illumination. The air is thick with spores.

#### The Myushli Villages

Scattered through this fungal understory, the Myushli have built something between villages and hive-colonies. Their settlements glow faintly in the darkness—bioluminescent fungi cultivated to mark paths and buildings, structures grown from living mushroom-flesh rather than constructed.

The Myushli are genuinely kind. They believe the "beautiful transformation" they offer—infection by their spores, gradual absorption into the collective—is a gift. Their villages are populated not just by Myushli but by "converts": travelers who wandered too close, breathed too deeply, and now serve with glassy-eyed devotion. The converts do manual labor, tend spore-gardens, and seem content. The Myushli don't understand why outsiders fear them. When they say "join us," they mean it as an invitation to paradise.

Travelers who must pass through the Everwood learn to wrap cloth over their mouths and noses, to never stop moving, and to never, ever accept hospitality.

#### The Fire Cycle

Because nothing rots, deadfall accumulates. Fallen branches pile atop fallen branches; dead leaves carpet the ground in drifts yards deep. The Everwood becomes a tinderbox.

Every few decades, catastrophic fire sweeps through. Lightning strikes, careless travelers, or sometimes the Myushli themselves set the blazes deliberately—they survive underground and benefit from the nutrient release. The fires burn hot enough to consume even the seemingly immortal wood, turning vast swaths of forest to ash.

But the Everwood regenerates with terrifying speed. Within weeks of a fire, new growth erupts from the roots. Within a year, a burned section is dense forest again. The cycle continues.

#### Dangers

**The Roots:** Sleeping on the forest floor in any season but winter will cause the roots to find you. They grow fast in the Everwood—fast enough to envelope a sleeping body overnight. By morning, you're wrapped in a cocoon of living wood. By the following week, you're gone. Only the cold of winter slows them enough to make ground-sleep survivable.

**The Spores:** Myushli aren't the only things releasing spores. The fungal understory is alive with them—most harmless, some hallucinogenic, a few deadly. Symptoms of spore-sickness include vivid waking dreams, loss of direction, and an overwhelming desire to sit down and rest.

**The Sameness:** The Everwood looks the same in every direction. No landmarks, no variation, just endless trees and fungal twilight. Getting lost is almost inevitable; many who enter never find their way out.

#### The Water Drain

The Everwood's root network extends far beyond the visible forest, reaching deep into the water table and drinking greedily. South of the Everwood, the land becomes the Piktiniti Desert—and the desert exists largely because the Everwood has drained it dry. Every drop of water that would flow southward is instead pulled north, feeding the immortal forest's endless growth.

#### Autumn

For a few weeks each year, the leaves fall. The canopy thins, and for the first time, the sky becomes visible from the forest floor. Light reaches the understory, and the fungal growths retreat into dormancy.

This is the safest time to travel the Everwood—the spores are less active, the Myushli more sluggish, the roots slower to grasp. But it's also the driest time, and the accumulated deadfall is at its most dangerous. Many fires begin in autumn.

### Ezra's Temptation

Tags: river, geography

A winding river that flows through the eastern portion of Milrar Forest before emerging onto the Steppe of Aziirn, named for a legendary explorer whose story serves as both cautionary tale and local joke.

#### The Legend

Ezra was a cartographer and explorer—possibly the same era as Oregeg Tolkarsus, though the stories conflict—who became obsessed with mapping Milrar Forest's interior. Other cartographers gave up after getting lost; Ezra refused. He followed this particular river upstream, reasoning that rivers lead somewhere and would at least keep him from walking in circles.

The river did lead somewhere: deeper and deeper into Milrar, past the old growth, past the familiar, past anything previously mapped. Ezra kept following it, convinced the source would reveal something important—the forest's heart, a hidden civilization, ancient ruins, something.

He was never seen again.

Local tradition holds that the river was Ezra's "temptation"—the false promise of discovery that led him to his doom. Some say he still follows the river somewhere in Milrar's depths, endlessly walking upstream. Others say the river has no source at all, just spirals inward forever, and Ezra realized this too late.

#### Geography

Ezra's Temptation rises somewhere in Milrar Forest's interior—the exact source is unknown, for obvious reasons. The river flows generally southeast, emerging from the forest roughly 20 miles north of where Milrar borders Telwood, then continuing onto the Steppe of Aziirn where it eventually loses itself in the dry grassland.

**The Forest Course**: Within Milrar, the river is surprisingly clear and cold—deeper than expected, flowing between banks of moss-covered stone. The forest canopy closes over it in places, creating tunnel-like passages. Following the river upstream is easy for the first few miles. Then the forest closes in.

**The Emergence**: Where the river leaves Milrar, it passes through a distinctive gap in the forest—a narrow canyon where the trees can't grow. This is one of the few places where the forest has a definite edge rather than a gradual transition.

**The Steppe Course**: Once on the steppe, Ezra's Temptation slows and spreads, its water absorbed by the thirsty grassland. During dry seasons, the river disappears entirely within a few miles of leaving the forest; in wet years, it might reach as far as the Grand Tolkarsus watershed.

#### Use

**The Safe Way**: For those who must enter Milrar, Ezra's Temptation offers a navigation aid—follow the river in, follow it out. As long as you don't follow it too far in, this works. The problem is knowing when "too far" begins.

**Water Source**: The river provides reliable water along the forest-steppe border, making it a gathering point for travelers, herders, and wildlife. A small trading camp has grown up near the Emergence.

**The Warning**: Local guides use Ezra's story to warn overconfident travelers. "Don't follow it past the third fork," they say, or "turn back at the black rock." Whether these landmarks exist or are just invented to make the warning memorable is unclear.

#### Why It Matters

Ezra's Temptation is a minor river with an outsized reputation. Its story embodies the Westwilds' character: here, curiosity can kill, and the land doesn't care about your maps or your ambitions. The river is useful—water, navigation, trade point—but the name reminds everyone that usefulness has limits.

### Glivornax

### Grand Tolkarsus

Tags: river, geography

The longest river in the Westwilds, the Grand Tolkarsus stretches from the Nirvanis Mountains (part of the Kharvorn range) in the northeast, flowing southwest through orcish territory, west of the Wurmspine Mountains and the Deadwalk desert, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake. The lake connects to Symonair Lake, which empties into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

Named after the famed cartographer and explorer Oregeg Tolkarsus, who traveled its entire length and recorded his journey in meticulous detail.

#### Course

**The Upper Tolkarsus**: The river begins as snowmelt streams in the Nirvanis Mountains, gathering strength as it descends toward the Westwilds. The upper river is cold, fast, and largely inaccessible—only mountain goats and the most determined travelers navigate these reaches.

**The West Tolkarsus**: A major northern tributary that joins the main river in the central Westwilds. The West Tolkarsus flows from highlands north of the Grelli Hills, through the Homdrum Hills, and past the eastern forests before merging with the Grand Tolkarsus. See separate entry.

**The Middle Tolkarsus**: The river's middle section flows through the orc states—passing through Tarn territory, skirting Glivornax, and defining the eastern edge of Grieb's influence. This is where the river is most used: for fishing, for transportation, for the miraculous healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp.

**The Steppe Crossing**: The Grand Tolkarsus crosses the southern Steppe of Aziirn, its valley the only green corridor through the dry grassland. Travel across the steppe follows the river; there is no other practical route.

**The Lower Tolkarsus**: The final stretch flows through increasingly marshy terrain before reaching Cykravikus Lake. The river slows here, spreading into multiple channels through wetland and floodplain.

#### Significance

**The Lifeline**: The Grand Tolkarsus makes the central Westwilds habitable. Its water sustains the orc states, enables agriculture where the climate otherwise wouldn't allow it, and supports the ecosystems that provide food and resources. Without the river, the region would be desert.

**The Trade Route**: While not navigable for large vessels through its entire length, the Grand Tolkarsus serves as a transport corridor. Goods move along its banks; ferries cross at strategic points; and the river's course determines where settlements develop.

**The Healing Waters**: Within Plenjorn Swamp, the river's waters possess miraculous healing properties—able to cure even life-threatening injuries. Tarn controls this stretch fiercely, making the healing waters one of the most valuable resources in the Westwilds.

#### Oregeg Tolkarsus

The cartographer who gave the river its name was a human explorer of the late imperial period who devoted decades to mapping the Westwilds. His survey of the Grand Tolkarsus—from mountain source to final outlet—took three years and nearly killed him twice. The resulting maps remained the most accurate available for centuries.

Tolkarsus's journals describe encounters with orc clans, negotiations for passage, and near-disasters in the rapids. He also named the West Tolkarsus tributary for its position relative to his route. The explorer disappeared during a later expedition into the Northlands; his final fate is unknown.

#### Why It Matters

The Grand Tolkarsus defines the Westwilds' geography. It determines where settlements can exist, where armies can march, where trade can flow. Control of the river—or access to its waters—drives much of the region's politics. Tarn's power comes from controlling the healing waters; Grieb's isolation comes from being upstream of them; the steppe remains crossable because the river provides water and direction.

For travelers, the Grand Tolkarsus is both guide and goal: follow it and you'll reach civilization; need healing and you'll seek Plenjorn; want to cross the region and you'll use the river as your road.

### Grelli Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A sprawling highland region in the northwestern Westwilds, the Grelli Hills form a natural boundary between the Walking Forest to the south and the open plains to the north. The hills are notable for their unusual stability—despite being adjacent to the constantly migrating Walking Forest, the Grelli Hills have remained largely unchanged for centuries.

#### Geography

The Grelli Hills stretch roughly 80 miles east to west and 40 miles north to south, a region of rolling terrain scattered with copses of ancient oak and pine. The hills themselves are modest—rarely exceeding a few hundred feet—but their cumulative effect creates a distinctive landscape of hidden valleys, sheltered hollows, and unexpected vistas.

**The Rootline**: The southern edge of the Grelli Hills marks where the Walking Forest's migration stops. Trees that drift north from the forest encounter the hills and go no further. Some scholars believe the bedrock beneath the hills contains minerals that the forest finds inhospitable; others think the hills sit on a ley line intersection that anchors land in place. The Grayls have no explanation, only observation: trees stop here.

**The Torzein Valley**: A river valley running northwest through the hills, carved by the Torzein River before it joins larger waterways to the south. The valley provides the main passage through the hills for traders and travelers.

#### Inhabitants

The Grelli Hills are sparsely populated but not empty:

**Shepherds and Herders**: Small communities raise goats and sheep in the hills, moving between seasonal pastures. They trade wool and cheese with the settlements to the south and maintain a careful distance from the Walking Forest.

**Hermits and Exiles**: The hills' many hidden valleys make excellent places to disappear. Wanted criminals, disgraced nobles, and those simply tired of civilization have all found refuge here over the centuries.

**The Rootwatchers**: A small order of scholars who study the boundary between the Grelli Hills and the Walking Forest, trying to understand why the forest's migration halts at this particular location. They maintain a lodge near the Rootline and have documented decades of observations.

#### Climate

Continental temperate with harsh winters. The hills catch weather systems moving across the northern plains, resulting in heavy snowfall in winter and unpredictable storms year-round. Summers are pleasant but brief.

#### Why It Matters

The Grelli Hills are valuable precisely because they're stable. In a region dominated by the Walking Forest's unpredictable movements, the hills offer reliable terrain—roads stay where you put them, landmarks don't shift, and settlements can last more than a generation. For merchants traveling between the eastern orc states and the western territories, the Torzein Valley through the Grelli Hills is the safest route.

### Grieb Lakes

Tags: lake, geography

A series of freshwater lakes in the hills of the northeastern Wildwood, home to the Griebi people. The largest is Cykravikus Lake; smaller lakes dot the surrounding hills.

#### Geography

The Grieb Lakes occupy a region of forested hills north of Tarn territory. The terrain is rocky and hilly, with cold, deep lakes filling the valleys between ridges. The land isn't good for farming or logging, and no valuable minerals have been found—which is why no one else bothers with it.

Cykravikus Lake is the largest, with multiple inlets extending into the hills. It connects southward to Symonair Lake (claimed by the dragon of the same name) and eventually to Phyndarr Sound.

#### The Griebi

The Griebi are aquatic orcs—they can breathe underwater, which makes them excellent fishers and divers. They have blueish-gray skin and rows of needle-like teeth adapted for catching fish.

**Settlements:** The Griebi build along the lakeshores, with structures extending partially into the shallows. They fish, gather lake plants, and keep largely to themselves.

**Communication:** The Griebi rarely speak above water, preferring gestures and expressions. Underwater, they communicate through clicks and tones. Surface dwellers find them unnervingly quiet.

**The Hag Queen:** An ancient figure who rules the Griebi from Cykravikus Lake. She's been there longer than anyone remembers. The Griebi serve her without question.

#### Why Nobody Bothers Them

The Grieb Lakes offer nothing the other orc states want. No algae beds. No healing waters. No strategic passes. Just cold lakes in rocky hills.

The Griebi themselves are unsettling to fight—needle teeth, ability to retreat into water, patience to wait out any siege—but the main reason for peace is simpler: there's nothing here worth fighting over.

### Hedroscobb

Tags: state, nation, orc

The largest orc state in the Wildwood, controlling the southern forest from Vogenfeld's mountain passes to the Yugurbas Dyos marshes. When outsiders speak of "the orc threat," they usually mean Hedroscobb.

#### Geography

Hedroscobb occupies the southern third of the Wildwood—roughly 150 miles north to south and 100 miles east to west of dense temperate forest. The terrain is rugged: steep ravines, hidden valleys, ironwood groves, and rocky outcroppings where the Hedroscobbi have established their forge-complexes.

**The Ironwood Groves:** Ancient stands of iron-hard trees that provide fuel for the forges and material for weapon handles. The groves are considered sacred to the Hedroscobbi—their wood burns hot enough to work algae-iron properly.

**The Slag Halls:** Underground forge complexes beneath the central forest. The great forges never cool. Smoke rises through hidden vents throughout the territory.

**The Acid Gate:** The fortified southern approach, overlooking the passes to Vogenfeld. The dwarves watch from one side; the Hedroscobbi watch from the other.

#### Borders

- **South:** Vogenfeld (the dwarven shield-state)
- **North:** Glivornax (hostile; the War of the Marshes over Yugurbas Dyos)
- **Northeast:** Tarn (neutral)
- **East:** Shazuihn (hostile; constant raiding)
- **West:** Plains of Oblivion (no one goes there)

#### Climate

Continental temperate—cold winters with heavy snow, warm summers with occasional flooding in the lowlands. The underground forge-complexes maintain comfortable temperatures year-round.

#### Why It Matters

Hedroscobb controls the passes between the Wildwood and Tarkhon. If the orcs ever decided to invade the empire, they would come through Hedroscobb. The Vogenfeld dwarves exist specifically to prevent this.

The Hedroscobbi's algae-iron armor makes them the most formidable conventional military force in the Wildwood. Their weakness is their dependence on swamp algae—which is why the War of the Marshes never ends.

### Hellion Hills

Tags: hills, wurmspine, ley lines, fire, geography

The Hellion Hills mark the northwestern terminus of the Wurmspine range, where the great mountain chain fragments into a chaotic jumble of volcanic peaks, smoking vents, and treacherous ravines. The fire ley line cuts directly through this region, and the land shows it—the hills run hot, the air tastes of sulfur, and the ground itself seems to simmer.

The name isn't metaphorical. These hills are hell to cross.

#### Geography

The Hellion Hills stretch roughly twenty miles east to west, forming a natural barrier between the Westwilds proper and the more hospitable Wurmspine territories to the south. To the east lies the Guiles, a dense forest that provides the only significant shade in the region. To the south, the hills descend into Kobuk, where the Coghead goblins have made their refuge.

The terrain is brutal: sharp volcanic rock, unstable slopes, sudden fissures that vent superheated steam without warning. The fire ley line keeps the ground temperature elevated year-round—snow never settles here, even in the deepest winter. In summer, the hills become genuinely dangerous; heatstroke claims unprepared travelers before the terrain does.

Scattered throughout are remnants of old volcanic activity: obsidian flows, collapsed lava tubes, and hot springs that range from pleasantly warm to instantly fatal. The hills don't actively erupt—the fire ley line keeps the energy diffuse rather than explosive—but they smolder constantly, and new vents open without warning.

#### Hermelia's Lair

Near the center of the Hellion Hills, built into the side of a collapsed volcanic cone, lies the ruin known as Hermelia's Lair. This is where the infamous fire-and-air mage met her end, and the site still bears the marks of her power.

##### The Mage

Hermelia grew up in Shtaneres, a city in Breia, where she developed tremendous skill in fire and air magic. Something happened—the records are unclear, possibly deliberately destroyed—and she burned Shtaneres to the ground before fleeing. She made her way to the Hellion Hills, presumably drawn by the fire ley line, and constructed her lair in the volcanic landscape that suited her nature.

How she died remains uncertain. The lair shows signs of violence, but whether she was killed by hunters, betrayed by allies, or consumed by her own magic, no one knows. Her body was never found. The fire ley line may have taken it.

##### The Ruins

The lair itself is a series of chambers carved into volcanic rock, reinforced with fire-resistant materials and warded with magic that still partially functions decades later. The outer chambers have collapsed or been picked clean by scavengers. The inner chambers remain sealed—not by rubble, but by magical barriers that burn anyone who touches them.

What Hermelia kept in those chambers is unknown. Spellbooks, certainly. Research notes on fire magic. Possibly artifacts she stole from Shtaneres before burning it. The barriers suggest she intended to return, or that something inside is too dangerous to let out.

Treasure hunters occasionally attempt the lair. Most turn back at the barriers. The few who've found ways through haven't returned to report what they found.

##### Fire Echoes

The area immediately around the lair exhibits strange phenomena: flames that burn in patterns matching old conversations, heat mirages that show events from the past, and air currents that carry whispered words in Hermelia's voice. These "fire echoes" are probably magical residue from her decades of work here, imprinted on the ley line itself.

Some scholars believe the echoes contain fragments of her knowledge—that watching them carefully could teach fire magic techniques she developed. Others think they're traps, designed to lure the curious into dangerous areas. Both may be true.

#### Inhabitants

Few things live in the Hellion Hills by choice.

**Fire Drakes**: Small, aggressive, and territorial. They hunt in the cooler hours of dawn and dusk, preying on anything they can catch. The ley line energy keeps their populations high despite the harsh conditions.

**Ash Crawlers**: Insectoid creatures that burrow through volcanic soil, emerging to feed on anything organic that dies in the heat. They're not dangerous individually, but they swarm corpses within hours.

**Fugitives**: The hills' reputation keeps most people away, which makes them attractive to those who don't want to be found. Criminals, exiles, and the occasional hermit scratch out existences in the few habitable spots, trading the dangers of the terrain for the danger of civilization.

#### Travel

Crossing the Hellion Hills is possible but inadvisable. The terrain is treacherous, the heat is punishing, and the only reliable water sources are the hot springs (which require careful testing—some are drinkable, some will dissolve flesh).

Those who must cross typically hire guides from Kobuk's Coghead goblins, who know the hills well enough to avoid the worst hazards. The goblins charge steeply for this service and accept no responsibility if clients ignore their advice.

The fire ley line can be traced through the hills by following the hottest ground—useful for mages seeking to tap its power, dangerous for everyone else. Walking the ley line means walking through the most geothermally active areas, where the ground may give way without warning.

### Hills to Nowhere

Tags: hills, wurmspine, geography, wasteland

The Hills to Nowhere occupy the southern reaches of the Wurmspine range, a desolate highland region stretching from Kobuk in the north to the arid wastes beyond. The name is accurate: the hills lead nowhere anyone wants to go. No valuable passes, no important settlements, no strategic advantage. Just empty terrain that serves primarily to be crossed—or avoided entirely.

#### Geography

The Hills to Nowhere span roughly forty miles north to south, gradually descending from the rugged peaks of the central Wurmspine to the dry plains below. The terrain is characterized by rolling highlands, shallow valleys, and sparse vegetation—mostly scrub grass, thornbush, and the occasional stunted tree clinging to a sheltered slope.

Water is scarce. A few seasonal streams cut through the hills during spring snowmelt, but they dry to bare rock by summer. The few reliable springs are jealously guarded by whatever happens to control the immediate area, which changes regularly.

The climate is harsh—hot in summer, bitterly cold in winter, windy year-round. The hills catch weather systems moving off the Wurmspine and funnel them into unpredictable patterns. Snow can fall in autumn; heat waves can strike in spring. Travelers who don't prepare for everything often don't arrive.

#### Why "Nowhere"

The name reflects both geography and reputation.

**No Passes**: Unlike other sections of the Wurmspine, the Hills to Nowhere contain no meaningful routes through the mountains. Anyone wanting to cross the range goes around them—through Kobuk and the Hellion Hills to the north, or through Tarkhon-controlled territory to the east. The hills themselves lead only to more hills, and eventually to empty wasteland.

**No Resources**: The hills are mineral-poor, agriculturally useless, and strategically irrelevant. No nation claims them because no nation wants them. Occasional prospectors search for ore deposits; they don't find much.

**No Population**: Almost no one lives here permanently. The few inhabitants are outcasts, hermits, and fugitives—people who specifically want to be in a place no one cares about. They don't form communities. They avoid each other.

#### Who Goes There

**Fugitives**: The hills' emptiness and irrelevance make them attractive to people fleeing justice, debts, or enemies. The lack of any organized authority means no one is looking for you. The tradeoff is surviving alone in harsh terrain with limited resources.

**Exile Communities**: Occasionally, groups too large to simply disappear but too troublesome to keep find themselves "encouraged" to relocate to the Hills to Nowhere. These communities rarely last. The lucky ones eventually migrate elsewhere; the unlucky ones don't.

**Smugglers**: The hills provide alternative routes around Tarkhon-controlled passes, if you're willing to accept longer travel times and worse conditions. Some smuggling operations maintain way-stations in the hills, though these change location frequently to avoid being found.

**The Lost**: Some travelers end up in the Hills to Nowhere by accident—taking wrong turns, fleeing danger, or being abandoned. Many of these wander until they find their way out or die. A few stay.

#### The Cairn Fields

Scattered throughout the central hills are fields of stone cairns—thousands of stacked rock piles, some ancient, some recent. No one knows who started building them or why. The oldest are weathered nearly flat; the newest look freshly made.

Different theories circulate:

- **Grave markers**: Some believe each cairn marks a burial, making the fields an enormous cemetery for the unknown dead. Excavations have occasionally found bones beneath the older cairns.

- **Navigation aids**: Others think the cairns were meant to help travelers navigate, though if so, whatever system they used has been lost. The cairns don't correspond to modern trails.

- **Ritual purpose**: A few scholars suggest the cairns served some religious or magical function, perhaps related to the nearby ley lines. No evidence supports this beyond the fields' inexplicable existence.

Travelers who pass through sometimes add their own cairns, continuing a tradition whose origin no one remembers. It's considered bad luck to knock down a standing cairn.

#### The Bleached Garden

At the southern edge of the hills, where the terrain transitions to desert, lies an area called the Bleached Garden. Here, thousands of bones litter the ground—animal bones, mostly, though human remains appear occasionally. The bones are old, sun-bleached white, and cover perhaps a square mile of open ground.

The origin is unknown. No battle is recorded here. No mass die-off is documented. The bones simply accumulated over time, from sources no one has identified. Local speculation ranges from the mundane (a natural trap where animals become disoriented and die) to the supernatural (something that lures creatures here to feed).

The Cogheads of Kobuk warn travelers away from the Bleached Garden. They don't explain why, and they won't discuss what they know about it.

#### Travel

Crossing the Hills to Nowhere is possible but unpleasant. No maintained roads exist. No services are available. Water must be carried or found through careful navigation to the few reliable springs.

The safest approach is to skirt the hills entirely—the eastern edge, where they meet Tarkhon-aligned territory, offers slightly better conditions. The western edge, bordering Westwilds territory, is drier and more exposed.

Those who must cross directly should carry sufficient supplies for the entire journey, travel in groups, and accept that no help is coming if something goes wrong.

### Homdrum Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A low, rolling highland region east of the Desendrum range, the Homdrum Hills (sometimes rendered "Humdrum Hills" on older maps) earned their name from their unremarkable character. They're not particularly high, not particularly scenic, not particularly anything—just miles of grass-covered rises and shallow valleys that travelers cross without remembering.

#### Geography

The Homdrum Hills occupy roughly 60 miles east to west and 50 miles north to south, forming a transitional zone between the Desendrum range and the eastern forests. The hills are low—rarely exceeding 500 feet above the surrounding plains—and uniformly grassy, with few trees and fewer landmarks.

**The West Tolkarsus Passage**: The West Tolkarsus river curves through the northeastern portion of the hills, carving a modest valley that provides the easiest route through the region. Most travelers follow the river rather than striking across the trackless hills.

**The Drift**: A broad, shallow depression in the center of the hills where rainwater collects in spring, creating seasonal marshes that dry to cracked mud by late summer. Animals gather here during the wet season, making it a traditional hunting ground.

#### Character

The Homdrum Hills are aggressively ordinary. The terrain doesn't challenge; the weather doesn't surprise; the wildlife doesn't threaten. For travelers accustomed to the Walking Forest's strangeness or the orc states' dangers, the hills feel almost surreal in their normalcy.

This unremarkability has consequences:

**Lost Travelers**: Without landmarks, navigation is difficult. Travelers who leave the established paths often wander in circles, unable to distinguish one grassy rise from another. More than a few have died of exposure in terrain that posed no other threat.

**Unmarked Graves**: The hills have been crossed by armies, refugees, and migrations for centuries. Countless unmarked burials dot the landscape—bones emerging from eroded hillsides, old weapons rusting in the grass. The hills remember nothing and record nothing.

#### Inhabitants

Almost no one lives in the Homdrum Hills permanently. The land supports grazing but offers no shelter, no water sources (except seasonal), and no defensible positions. Nomadic herders pass through; trading caravans cross; no one stays.

**The Lost Shepherd**: Local legend speaks of a shepherd who entered the hills with his flock and never found his way out. Some say he still wanders, eternally searching for the edge of the hills, his sheep long dead but still following. Herders sometimes report seeing a distant figure on the hillsides who disappears when approached.

#### Why It Matters

The Homdrum Hills matter primarily as an obstacle—not a dangerous one, but a tedious one. Crossing them adds days to any journey and offers nothing in return. Traders calculate whether to go around (longer but with reliable waystations) or through (shorter but with no support if something goes wrong). Most choose around.

### Ichneum

Tags: forest, geography

A forest in the Westwilds.

TODO

### Jüt

Tags: city, state, port, geography

A port city of roughly twenty thousand people positioned on Kettle Bay, where the Westwilds coast meets the sea. Jüt is the region's window to the outside world—the only significant harbor on this stretch of coastline, and the place where the Westwilds' strange goods reach the broader markets.

#### Role

Jüt survives by being useful to everyone.

The city sits at a crossroads: Seyiki merchants bring pillar-crystals and dragonfly chitin down from the desert. Melodian traders arrive with resonant wood and rare botanicals. Lacirean caravans—making the long, careful journey through the Walking Forest and Tenekee Woods—carry spring water and Grayl-amber worth fortunes. Ships from the Western Isles bring metal, textiles, luxury goods, and everything else the land-locked interior can't produce.

Jüt doesn't produce much itself. It's a city of warehouses, trading houses, hostels, and middlemen. The locals joke that Jüt's main export is convenience.

#### Character

Rough, pragmatic, polyglot.

The streets of Jüt echo with half a dozen languages. Gnomes bargain with orcs bargain with human sailors bargain with whoever else has washed up this week. The architecture is functional—stone and timber, built to withstand salt air and the occasional storm, not to impress. The wealthy merchants live in fortified compounds; everyone else makes do.

Crime is present but managed. The Jüt Council—a rotating body of the city's most successful trading houses—maintains order through a combination of paid militia, negotiated truces, and pragmatic tolerance. Violence is bad for business; everyone knows this. But theft, smuggling, and sharp dealing are facts of life.

The city has a reputation for accepting anyone. Criminals fleeing justice elsewhere find Jüt willing to overlook their pasts, as long as they behave locally and have something to offer. This makes Jüt cosmopolitan in ways that more "civilized" cities aren't—and dangerous in ways they aren't either.

#### The Cliffs

Jüt is built into the base of the Cliffs of Shondromos—a dramatic wall of pale limestone rising from the sea to the east. The cliffs provide shelter from storms and a natural barrier against landward attack. The harbor itself is carved from a natural inlet where the cliffs recede.

The cliff face is riddled with caves at waterline. Officially, these belong to the city. Unofficially, smugglers have used them for generations, and the militia engages in endless cat-and-mouse with operators who know the cave systems better than any guard.

#### Defenses

Being the only port means Jüt is everyone's target.

Pirates from the Western Isles raid when they think the city is weak. Orc warbands from the interior occasionally decide that raiding is easier than trading. Desperate communities—pillar-settlements that had a bad locust season, forest villages displaced by the Walking Forest's movement—sometimes arrive not as traders but as threats.

Jüt's response is layered:

**The Militia:** Well-funded, well-equipped, and experienced. Service in the militia is prestigious—it's one of the few paths to citizenship for outsiders.

**The Walls:** Landward, Jüt is fortified. The walls aren't massive, but they're solid, and the cliff at the city's back means attackers can only approach from limited directions.

**Protection Payments:** Jüt pays tribute in multiple directions. To the orc states that could overwhelm them if united. To certain Western Isles captains who guarantee safe passage for Jüt-flagged ships. To whoever else needs paying this year. It's expensive, but cheaper than war.

**Naval Power:** Jüt maintains a small but capable fleet—enough to discourage casual piracy and escort valuable shipments through dangerous waters.

#### Trade Goods

What flows through Jüt:

**From Seyiki:** Twyl crystal fragments, dragonfly chitin, locust products (flour, oil, dried insects), Postronamas artifacts (rare and valuable)

**From Melodia:** Pipe-willow wood, unique botanicals, Melodian crafts

**From Lacire:** Waters of Vyowehr, Grayl-amber, Walking Forest herbs, guidance services

**From the Western Isles:** Metal (especially iron and steel), textiles, spices, luxury goods, weapons, slaves (technically illegal but widely practiced)

**From the Orc States:** Furs, worked leather, gemstones from Ruby Rock (cursed, buyer beware), mercenary contracts

#### The Kettle

Kettle Bay itself is a broad, sheltered inlet—natural harbor formed where the coastline curves inward. The "kettle" name comes from the bay's shape and the way storms can trap ships inside, churning the water.

The bay's waters are productive fishing grounds, and Jüt's fishing fleet is substantial. Salted fish is one of the few goods Jüt actually produces rather than just trading.

#### Governance

The Jüt Council consists of representatives from the twelve most powerful trading houses, rotating through leadership positions on an annual basis. Decisions require majority agreement; controversial matters require supermajority.

The system is corrupt, factional, and inefficient—but it works. The trading houses have too much to lose from instability to let disputes escalate into violence. Deadlocks are resolved through negotiation, bribery, or occasionally strategic assassination (though the last is considered gauche).

Citizenship in Jüt is tied to property ownership or guild membership. Non-citizens can live and work in the city but have no political voice—which suits most traders fine, since they're not staying anyway.

### Kobuk

Tags: mountains, wurmspine, goblins, cogheads, geography

Kobuk is a rugged mountain territory in the central Wurmspine range, bounded by the Hellion Hills to the north and the Hills to Nowhere to the south. It is home to the surviving Coghead goblins—refugees from two genocides who have built something remarkable in their exile.

The mountains here are steep and defensible, riddled with natural caves and old mining tunnels. The Cogheads have expanded these into a vast underground complex, combining their legendary engineering with desperate necessity. Kobuk is fortress, factory, and hidden city all at once.

#### The Cogheads

The Coghead goblins were once partners with the Echi gnomes of Echea, working the Iri Mountains together in a collaboration that lasted generations. Gnomes provided elemental magic; goblins provided mechanical genius. Together they built wonders.

Then came the first massacre, two centuries ago. The partnership ended in blood. The Cogheads were driven from Echea, scattered across the continent. Some found refuge in Kobuk.

Fifty years ago came the second genocide. Echea decided to finish what they'd started. Every Coghead within reach was hunted down and killed. The Echi don't talk about it. The sealed chambers and abandoned workshops in the Iri Mountains tell the story they'd prefer to forget.

The survivors in Kobuk are what remains. Perhaps three thousand goblins, maybe fewer—they don't share population figures with outsiders. They've had fifty years to dig in, build up, and prepare for the day Echea decides to try again.

#### Geography

Kobuk occupies a stretch of the Wurmspine roughly thirty miles north to south, characterized by steep-sided valleys, narrow passes, and peaks that reach above the treeline. The surface appears inhospitable—bare rock, thin soil, little vegetation—but this is by design. The Cogheads have made the surface deliberately uninviting, concentrating their civilization underground.

The northern border with the Hellion Hills is marked by increasing volcanic activity and rising temperatures. The Cogheads maintain watch-posts there, monitoring both the natural hazards and any approach from the north.

To the east lies more Wurmspine territory, eventually leading to Tarkhon-aligned lands. To the west, the mountains give way to the Westwilds and Twaan Forest territory. The southern border descends into the Hills to Nowhere—remote highlands that provide buffer space but little else.

#### The Warrens

Beneath Kobuk's surface lies the Coghead civilization: a network of tunnels, chambers, and underground halls collectively called the Warrens. This is where the goblins live, work, and build.

The Warrens are divided into functional districts:

**The Forges**: Where Coghead engineers continue their ancestors' work, building machinery, weapons, and devices. The forges run constantly, powered by geothermal vents tapped from the Wurmspine's volcanic roots. The heat from the Hellion Hills to the north provides additional energy.

**The Sanctums**: Living quarters, organized by extended family groups. Space is tight but efficiently used—the Cogheads have had generations to optimize underground living.

**The Vaults**: Storage for food, water, materials, and the machines the Cogheads consider too dangerous or valuable to keep in active use. Access is tightly controlled.

**The Deeps**: Tunnels that extend far below the main Warrens, into rock that predates the Wurmspine. The Cogheads mine here, extracting metals and minerals for their forges. They've found other things in the Deeps as well—old ruins, strange crystals, sealed chambers they've chosen not to open.

#### Griznak's Heart

At the center of the Warrens lies Griznak's Heart—the Cogheads' capital and their most heavily defended position. Named for the chieftain who led the first refugees to Kobuk, the Heart is a vast natural cavern expanded over generations into a functioning city.

##### The Machinery

Unlike the dispersed workshops throughout the Warrens, Griznak's Heart houses the Cogheads' most ambitious projects: massive machines too large to build elsewhere, experimental devices too dangerous to keep near living quarters, and the accumulated archives of Coghead engineering knowledge saved from the genocides.

The centerpiece is the Perpetual Engine—a device of unclear purpose that the Cogheads have kept running since their arrival. Some say it powers the Warrens' ventilation systems. Others claim it's a weapon, primed and waiting. The Cogheads don't explain, and outsiders don't get close enough to examine it.

##### Governance

The Heart serves as the seat of Kobuk's Council of Gears—the governing body of master engineers who make decisions for the community. Meetings are contentious, technical, and conducted in a dialect of Goblin so thick with engineering jargon that even fluent speakers struggle to follow.

The Council doesn't rule so much as coordinate. Coghead society runs on expertise and reputation; the Council's authority extends only as far as their collective competence justifies. Bad decisions get overturned. Good engineers get listened to. It's messy, but it's kept them alive.

##### Defenses

If Kobuk ever falls, Griznak's Heart will be the last holdout. The approaches are trapped, fortified, and designed to collapse on command. The Cogheads have spent fifty years preparing for a siege they expect will eventually come. Every tunnel can become a chokepoint. Every machine can become a weapon. The Heart will not fall easily, and taking it will cost more than it's worth.

#### Relations

**With Echea**: Pure, cold hatred. The Cogheads remember both genocides in detail, preserved in their archives and taught to every child. They expect a third attempt and have spent fifty years preparing for it.

**With Tarkhon**: Cautious trade. The empire values Coghead engineering and star-metal goods; the Cogheads value imperial gold and the buffer of Tarkhon-aligned territories between themselves and Echea. Neither side trusts the other, but both benefit.

**With the Twaan**: Practical cooperation. The Twaan Forests border Kobuk to the west, and both peoples share a suspicion of outsiders. They trade occasionally—fire-wood for star-metal tools—and respect each other's boundaries.

**With the Hellion Hills**: The Cogheads monitor the hills carefully. They hire out as guides when the price is right, but they don't claim the territory. The fire ley line makes it too unstable, and Hermelia's Lair still radiates danger. Better to watch from a distance.

#### What Travelers Should Know

- The surface of Kobuk is unwelcoming by design. The Cogheads want visitors to feel uncomfortable.
- Entry to the Warrens requires permission from the watch-posts. Attempting to find your own way in is treated as hostile action.
- Trade happens at designated surface markets, not in the Warrens themselves. The Cogheads bring goods up; buyers don't go down.
- Don't mention Echea. Don't ask about the genocides. Don't suggest the Cogheads should "move on" or "forgive." The wounds are fresh, and the Cogheads have long memories.
- Star-metal goods are available but expensive. The Cogheads set prices; negotiation is limited. Take it or leave it.

### Koshasyn

Tags: settlement, geography

A small trading settlement in the clearing between Pystinwood and Milrar Forest, Koshasyn (sometimes spelled "Koshasya" on older maps) serves as the primary meeting point between the orc states, the steppe nomads, and the scattered communities of the northern Westwilds. It's not quite a town, not quite a camp—something in between that has persisted for generations without ever quite becoming permanent.

#### Geography

Koshasyn occupies a natural clearing roughly three miles across, bounded by Pystinwood to the north, Milrar Forest to the south, and open grassland transitioning to the Steppe of Aziirn to the east. The clearing exists because of soil conditions—the ground here is rockier and less fertile than the surrounding terrain, unable to support the dense forest growth on either side.

**The Market Ground**: The center of the clearing, where traders set up temporary stalls and permanent residents maintain a few modest buildings. Nothing is elaborate; everything is built for function over form.

**The Northern Camp**: A semi-permanent encampment where pystin sap traders from the north gather. During harvest season, dozens of sap-tappers congregate here to sell their product.

**The Steppe Gate**: The eastern edge of the clearing, where the grassland begins and steppe nomads make camp when visiting to trade. A few carved posts mark the traditional boundary.

#### Function

Koshasyn exists because everyone needs it and no one wants to control it:

**Neutral Ground**: Like Telwood to the south, Koshasyn is recognized as neutral territory. The orc states don't claim it; the northern communities don't fortify it; the steppe nomads don't raid it. Violence here is punished by exclusion—anyone who causes trouble is banned from trading.

**Trade Hub**: The settlement handles exchange between wildly different economies. Pystin sap goes east; steppe horses go west; orcish metalwork goes everywhere; information flows in all directions. The clearing sees more cultural exchange in a week than most regions see in a year.

**Information Market**: Beyond physical goods, Koshasyn trades in knowledge. News from the orc states, rumors from the steppe, reports from the northern forests—travelers share information here, and those who pay attention can learn the state of the entire region.

#### Population

Perhaps two hundred people live in Koshasyn year-round, maintaining the market ground, running the few permanent establishments, and facilitating trade. During peak seasons—spring and autumn—the population can swell to over a thousand as traders arrive from all directions.

**The Permanent Residents**: A mix of outcasts, entrepreneurs, and people who simply prefer neutrality to belonging. They maintain the settlement's infrastructure and enforce its rules.

**The Seasonal Visitors**: Traders, herders, diplomats, and the simply curious who pass through regularly but don't stay. Some families have visited Koshasyn every year for generations.

#### Why It Matters

Koshasyn is a node in the regional network—a place where connections are made, deals are struck, and news travels. Its neutrality makes it valuable; its persistence makes it reliable. For players traversing the eastern Westwilds, Koshasyn offers supplies, information, guides, and a temporary respite from the wilderness's challenges.

### Krenglelan Range

Tags: mountains, geography

A vast mountain range spanning the northern Westwilds from coast to interior, the Krenglelan forms a natural barrier between the frozen Northlands and the temperate regions to the south. Its peaks are weathered granite and dark basalt, its valleys choked with ancient forest. The range is both a border and a world unto itself—home to things that predate human settlement and prefer to remain undisturbed.

#### Geography

The Krenglelan stretches roughly east-west across the Westwilds, with the massive Everwood forest blanketing its southern slopes and valleys. North of the range lies scrubland transitioning to tundra; south lies the forest belt that eventually gives way to the Piktiniti Desert. Several passes allow travel through the mountains, though all are arduous and some are actively dangerous.

The western peaks are the highest and most remote, fading into coastal cliffs that overlook the sea toward the Western Isles. The eastern end descends gradually into the Tenekee Woods and the vast Walking Forest beyond.

#### Mitasslus

In the western peaks, in a valley that appears on no reliable map, lairs Mitasslus—an earth dragon of immense age. His scales are the color of weathered sandstone; his eyes hold the patient darkness of deep caves. He has been here since before the Postronamas built their pillars, since before humans came to Clueanda, and he will be here long after.

Mitasslus guards a passage to the Underrealms—one of the deep gates connecting the surface to the vast cavern systems below. He doesn't guard it because he was asked to. He guards it because things come *up* through that gate, and he has decided they will not get past him.

The dragon is neither good nor evil by mortal reckoning—simply territorial beyond any negotiation. He won't attack travelers who keep their distance, but anyone who enters his valley uninvited will be buried under half a mountain. He hasn't spoken to a mortal in centuries; most believe he's incapable of speech. He is not. He simply doesn't see the point.

Occasionally, Mitasslus emerges to sun himself on the high cliff faces. When his silhouette appears against the sky, caravans on the northern trade routes know to detour. Locals leave offerings at the valley's mouth—not worship, exactly, but acknowledgment. The dragon ignores them, but the offerings are never disturbed.

#### Quiet Mountain

The central peak of the Krenglelan Range, and the one travelers learn to avoid. Quiet Mountain is unnaturally, hungrily silent.

Sound doesn't simply fail to carry on the upper slopes—it is *consumed*. Speak above a certain elevation and your voice vanishes mid-word. Avalanches fall in eerie muteness. Birds don't sing there; they've learned not to waste the effort.

The silence is not natural. Something beneath or within Quiet Mountain absorbs vibration—a fragment of primordial Void that fell during the world's creation, some scholars believe. The Void hungers for the energy of sound, and the mountain is where it feeds. Those who stay too long report feeling "thinned," as if their own vitality is being consumed along with their words.

The Postronamas knew about Quiet Mountain. Their pillar-network forms an arc that carefully avoids pointing toward it, and some scholars believe this was deliberate—either to avoid the Void-shard's interference or to prevent their resonance magic from feeding it further. The mountain's relationship to the maddening crystal-music of the Piktiniti remains a subject of debate among those few who study such things.

Pilgrims occasionally climb seeking enlightenment through perfect silence. Most descend changed, hollowed, speaking in whispers for the rest of their lives. Some don't descend at all.

#### The Everwood

A vast forest stretching across the Krenglelan's southern slopes and into the lowlands beyond, detailed in its own entry. The Everwood is a single massive organism that cannot die or decay, creating unique and dangerous conditions within its bounds.

#### Ipt

On the western side of the Krenglelan Range, north of the Everwood and along a major trade route, stands Ipt—a formidable fortress built for Feriptus, an extremely powerful lich. The fortress serves as his primary research facility, where he conducts necromantic experiments in complete isolation.

Ipt is built into the mountainside with tall, iron-reinforced stone walls and heavy defensive wards that notify Feriptus of any approaching visitors. The fortress is supplied through a grim arrangement: a personal Enti trader makes bi-yearly trips south to acquire slaves, delivering fresh bodies for Feriptus's dark work. Despite its location along a trade route, travelers give Ipt a wide berth, knowing that those who approach uninvited rarely leave.

### Lacire

Tags: city, state, geography

A city of perhaps fifteen thousand people built on and around the Springs of Vyowehr, deep within Ierya at the heart of the Walking Forest. Lacire is the only significant permanent settlement in the entire Walking Forest—and it exists because its people have learned to live in silence.

#### The City of Silence

Lacireans do not speak.

This is not metaphor or exaggeration. Within city limits, verbal communication is forbidden. Lacireans communicate through an elaborate sign language called Stillspeech, through written notes, through gesture and expression and the subtle vocabulary of a culture that has abandoned voice entirely.

The prohibition isn't religious or arbitrary—it's survival. The Grayls who dwell in Ierya find humanoid speech physically painful. The pitch, the speed, the sheer volume of mortal voices causes them genuine distress. When Lacire's founders first settled at the springs, the Grayls' response to their voices drove them to the edge of extinction.

The survivors learned. Over generations, Lacire evolved into something unique: an entire city-state built around the absence of speech.

#### Life in Lacire

**Communication:** Stillspeech is taught from infancy. Children learn to sign before they learn to walk. The language is sophisticated—capable of poetry, philosophy, insults, and dirty jokes—and Lacireans are proud of its expressiveness. Written communication supplements Stillspeech for complex or permanent matters.

**Sound Discipline:** Lacireans don't just avoid speech—they minimize all sound. They walk softly, handle objects carefully, build with sound-dampening materials. Music exists but is percussion-only—drums, which the Grayls tolerate, perhaps because the sounds are low and rhythmic rather than sharp and chaotic.

**Visitors:** Outsiders are allowed in Lacire, but they must observe the silence. Those who cannot or will not are confined to a visitors' quarter at the city's edge, where low voices are permitted but carefully monitored. Repeat offenders are expelled. Those who shout—whether in anger, fear, or ignorance—find themselves facing not the city guard but the forest itself.

**Architecture:** Buildings in Lacire are organic, flowing things. They curve around massive roots, integrate fallen branches, use stone from the springs' pools. No sharp angles, no hard edges. The aesthetic isn't just cultural—it minimizes echo and sound reflection.

#### The Compact

Lacire exists because of an ancient bargain with the Grayls—what the Lacireans call "the Compact."

The details have been lost to time, known only in fragments and children's stories. What's remembered: the founders were refugees (from where is disputed—some say the Postronamas collapse, others say wars further east). They stumbled into Ierya, dying of thirst, and drank from the springs. The dreams they received showed them how to live: what to do, what never to do, how to exist alongside beings who experience time and sound so differently.

The Compact's requirements, as understood today:
- No fire larger than a candle within Ierya (cooking uses geothermal vents near the springs)
- No cutting of living wood (construction uses only deadfall and stone)
- The springs must remain open to all who come in peace
- Once per generation, a delegation travels deep into Ierya to commune with the eldest Grayls, reaffirming the agreement

In exchange, Ierya doesn't shift around Lacire. The city exists in a pocket of stability, a fixed point in a moving forest.

#### Economy

Lacire survives on trade in three precious commodities:

**Spring Water:** The Waters of Vyowehr have genuine healing properties and are valuable across the Westwilds and beyond. Lacire carefully controls export, never taking more than the springs can renew.

**Grayl-Amber:** Hardened sap from the Walking Forest's trees, sometimes found on the forest floor, occasionally purchased directly from Grayls who are willing to sell. The amber has magical properties useful for enchanting and alchemy.

**Guidance:** Anyone who needs to cross the Walking Forest needs a Lacirean guide. They know which paths are passable this season, which groves to avoid, how to navigate a forest that doesn't stay still. This service is expensive and essential.

#### Defense

Lacire has walls but barely staffs them. The city's defense is the forest itself.

Hostile forces entering the Walking Forest find paths closing behind them, landmarks shifting, the trees themselves seeming to lean in watchfully. Those who come with violence in their hearts rarely find Lacire at all—they wander until they starve, or until they attract the attention of something in the deep forest that deals with threats in its own way.

The few armies that have reached Lacire's walls found the Grayls waiting. The wooden beings don't fight like mortals—they're slow, patient, implacable. A Grayl can stand motionless for hours, then move with terrifying sudden force. Generals who thought they could overwhelm the city discovered that the forest contained more defenders than any scout had reported.

#### The Grayl Market

Outside Lacire's walls, at the forest's edge, stands the Grayl Market—a silent trading post where Grayls occasionally come to exchange goods with mortals.

The Grayls trade their own body-material: wood shavings, bark, sap, and occasionally larger pieces harvested from themselves (a painful process they undertake for reasons mortals don't fully understand). In exchange, they accept... strange things. Seeds from distant lands. Memories written down. Songs performed in absolute silence (signed descriptions of music, which they seem to find meaningful). Stories about places that don't move.

Transactions take days. The Grayls don't negotiate in any timeframe mortals find comfortable. But the results are worth fortunes to those with patience.

### Lev's Salvation

Tags: landmark, geography

A prominent rock formation in the northeastern Westwilds where the open grassland meets the foothills approaching the Kharvorn range. The formation is named for Lev—a merchant, a refugee, or possibly a saint, depending on who tells the story—who found shelter here during a deadly storm and survived against all odds.

#### Geography

Lev's Salvation rises from the grassland roughly 50 miles east of Pystinwood, where the Steppe of Aziirn begins its gradual climb toward the eastern mountains. The formation is a weathered granite tor—a cluster of massive boulders stacked and balanced in ways that seem impossible, creating natural shelters, overhangs, and wind-breaks.

**The Main Tor**: The largest boulder stack, rising perhaps 80 feet above the surrounding plain. Visible for miles in any direction, it serves as a landmark for travelers crossing the steppe.

**The Shelter Caves**: Natural gaps between the boulders create cave-like spaces large enough to shelter small groups. These are well-known to steppe travelers and frequently used as camping sites.

**The Spring**: A small but reliable spring emerges at the tor's base, providing fresh water year-round. This is what makes Lev's Salvation important rather than merely interesting—reliable water in a region where water is scarce.

#### The Legend

The story of Lev varies depending on the teller:

**The Merchant's Version**: Lev was a trader caught in a killing winter storm while crossing the steppe. He found the rocks, sheltered in the caves, and survived on melted snow until the storm passed. He marked the location on his maps and told everyone he met, and the name stuck.

**The Refugee's Version**: Lev was fleeing persecution (the nature varies—religious, political, or simply personal). Pursuers chased them across the steppe until Lev reached the rocks, hid in the caves, and watched the pursuers pass by. They lived in the caves for weeks, eventually emerging to build a new life elsewhere.

**The Saint's Version**: Lev was a holy figure who wandered the steppe teaching and healing. When a great storm came, Lev led a group of travelers to these rocks and prayed for their safety. The caves appeared miraculously to shelter them, and the spring began flowing to give them water. The formation stands as proof of divine intervention.

All versions agree on the essentials: someone named Lev, a desperate situation, and survival that shouldn't have been possible.

#### Significance

**Waypoint**: For anyone crossing the Steppe of Aziirn, Lev's Salvation is a critical landmark and supply point. The spring provides water; the caves provide shelter; the tor provides orientation. Trade routes and travel paths reference it as a waypoint.

**Gathering Point**: Steppe nomads use Lev's Salvation as a meeting place—neutral territory where different groups can negotiate, trade, or simply exchange news. The spring supports temporary camps, and the caves can shelter significant numbers during storms.

**Sanctuary Tradition**: By custom, violence is forbidden at Lev's Salvation. The legend implies divine protection, and pragmatism reinforces the taboo—damaging the only reliable shelter for hundreds of miles would be catastrophically stupid. Even sworn enemies observe truce while within sight of the tor.

#### Why It Matters

Lev's Salvation makes travel across the Steppe of Aziirn possible. Without it, the steppe would be a death trap—no water, no shelter, no landmarks. With it, the steppe becomes merely dangerous. The formation is one of those geographic features that shapes everything around it, determining routes, enabling trade, and making regions accessible that would otherwise be impassable.

### Magma Pits

Tags: ley lines, fire, earth, volcanic, geography, dangerous

The Magma Pits mark the convergence of Alaria's fire and earth ley lines at the eastern edge of Zlyverth Korn, where the Twaan Forests meet the foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains. This is one of the most powerful elemental convergences on the continent—a place where raw magical force has reshaped the land itself.

#### The Convergence

Where fire meets earth, the ground bleeds.

The Magma Pits are exactly what the name suggests: open pools of molten rock, exposed to the sky, burning endlessly. Some pools are small, no larger than a cooking pot. Others stretch dozens of yards across, their surfaces roiling with heat that can be felt a hundred paces away. The largest pit—called the Throat by those who've seen it and survived—is said to descend beyond sight, a vertical shaft of liquid fire that pulses like a heartbeat.

The ley line convergence keeps the magma fluid and active. Normal volcanic features would crust over, cool, solidify. These don't. The fire ley line ensures the heat never fades; the earth ley line ensures the stone keeps flowing. The result is a landscape frozen in a moment of volcanic fury, perpetually erupting, perpetually dangerous.

#### Geography

The Pits occupy a rough bowl in the terrain, perhaps two miles across, where the forest abruptly ends and bare stone begins. The Burning Corridor feeds into this area from the northwest—fire-trees growing right up to the edge of the scorched zone before the heat becomes too intense even for them.

The ground is a maze of cooled lava flows, razor-sharp obsidian ridges, and treacherous crusts that look solid but collapse into molten pools below. Steam vents hiss and shriek. The air shimmers with heat distortion, making distance and direction impossible to judge. Navigation requires either intimate knowledge of the terrain or a death wish.

The Kharvorn foothills rise to the east, and somewhere in those slopes lies the transition to Gymlstik goblin territory. The goblins don't come here. Whatever understanding they have with the Twaan, the Magma Pits aren't part of it—this place belongs to no one.

#### What Lives Here

Not much. The heat alone is lethal to most creatures.

But the elemental convergence draws certain beings:

**Fire Elementals**: Wild, unbound elementals spawn in the larger pits, drawn into existence by the concentrated fire ley energy. They're mindless and aggressive, attacking anything that moves. The Twaan consider them pests.

**Salamanders**: The serpentine fire-creatures hunt in the cooled lava flows, ambushing anything foolish enough to approach the pools. They're not sapient, but they're cunning, and they've learned that two-legged creatures often carry metal (which conducts heat nicely).

**The Ashborn**: Rumors speak of something else in the deepest pits—humanoid figures seen walking through the magma itself, apparently unharmed. The Twaan call them the Ashborn and refuse to discuss them further. Whether they're elementals, cursed mortals, or something else entirely, no one living knows.

#### Alchemical Significance

Beyond the fire-trees of the Burning Corridor, the Magma Pits themselves are an alchemist's dream. The elemental convergence produces materials found nowhere else:

**Convergence Stone**: Obsidian formed at the exact point where fire and earth magic meet. It holds enchantments related to both elements far better than normal materials.

**Living Magma**: Molten rock that stays liquid even when removed from the Pits, for a time. Extraordinarily dangerous to transport, extraordinarily valuable for forging.

**Ley Ash**: The powdery residue that collects around the pit edges, created when fire ley energy burns earth ley energy. Used in rituals, enchantments, and very expensive fireworks.

Harvesting any of these requires getting into the Pits and getting out alive. The Twaan control access to the area, and they don't allow unsupervised expeditions. Those few alchemists who've negotiated harvesting rights pay dearly—in gold, in favors, and in the knowledge that the Twaan are watching.

#### The Throat

The largest pit. The heart of the convergence.

The Throat is a vertical shaft of magma roughly thirty yards across, its edges perfectly circular—too perfect, some say, to be natural. The molten rock within doesn't simply sit; it pulses, rising and falling in a slow rhythm that takes about a minute to complete. At its peak, the magma nearly breaches the rim. At its nadir, the shaft seems to descend forever.

The Twaan won't go near it. They've placed warnings—stone markers carved with their pictographic script—in a wide circle around the Throat, and they've made it clear that anyone who crosses that boundary is on their own.

What lies at the bottom of the Throat? The theories range from mundane (just more magma) to apocalyptic (a sealed passage to the elemental planes, held closed only by the balanced pressure of the convergence). The Twaan don't speculate. They just stay away.

#### Reaching the Pits

There are three approaches:

**Through Twaan Territory**: The most common route, requiring negotiation with the Twaan of Zlyverth Korn. They'll assign guides, set strict limits on where you can go, and charge accordingly. Safest, if you can afford it.

**From Gymlstik**: Theoretically possible to approach from the east through goblin territory, but this means dealing with goblins, Cirthikin, and the treacherous mountain paths before reaching the Pits themselves. No one recommends this.

**From the South**: A longer route through the southern Westwilds, avoiding both Twaan and goblin territory. Requires crossing significant open ground and approaching the Pits from an angle the Twaan don't monitor as closely. Occasionally used by those who don't want the Twaan knowing what they're doing. Usually ends badly.

### Melodia

Tags: forest, geography

A forest on the southern edge of the Piktiniti Desert, spilling down toward the coast where the land becomes less arid. Melodia is named for its most distinctive quality: the trees sing.

#### The Music

Melodia is dominated by pipe-willows—a species found nowhere else in Alaria. Their trunks are hollow and resonant, riddled with natural apertures that catch the wind. When air moves through the forest, the trees produce tones: low drones, high whistles, harmonics that shift with wind strength and direction.

On calm days, the forest is silent. On gentle-breeze days, something like music drifts through the trees—melodies that seem almost intentional, chords that resolve in satisfying ways. On stormy days, the forest becomes a cacophony audible for miles: a roaring, discordant symphony that can disorient travelers and even cause physical pain.

The trees aren't conscious. They don't compose. But something about their structure, their spacing, the way their apertures have evolved, creates patterns that the ear interprets as music.

#### Origins

The pipe-willows contain trace deposits of twyl crystal in their wood—the same mineral that defines the Piktiniti Desert. This isn't natural. The forest grows along the paths of ancient Postronamas irrigation channels, now dry and buried. Whatever the Postronamas were doing here—whether deliberately creating a living instrument or simply allowing twyl-enriched water to feed these trees—Melodia is their legacy.

Some scholars believe Melodia was intentional: a Postronamas project to create music through natural resonance, a counterpart to their crystal-powered network. Others think it's an accident—twyl contamination that happened to create something beautiful rather than maddening.

#### The Melodians

A small population of forest-dwellers has made Melodia their home—people who've learned to read the forest's music for weather, danger, and mood.

The Melodians are musicians by culture. Singing is sacred; their religious ceremonies are entirely vocal. Silence is spiritually dangerous—a Melodian who cannot sing is considered cursed or dying. They believe the forest's songs carry messages from ancestors, from spirits, from the land itself. Learning to interpret those messages is a lifetime's work.

Many Melodians are Postronamas descendants who fled the crystal-madness and found, in this naturally musical forest, a healthier relationship with resonance. Their culture has fragments of old Postronamas knowledge—techniques for working with twyl, understanding of harmonics—but transformed into something gentler.

#### The Sound

For visitors, Melodia is disorienting. The constant music (when there's wind) makes conversation difficult. The tones can trigger emotional responses—melancholy on minor-key days, elation when the harmonics align into major progressions. Some travelers report vivid dreams or recovered memories after spending time in Melodia.

The Melodians say the forest responds to those within it. Whether this is literally true or simply projection, travelers often feel that Melodia's music reflects their own emotional states.

#### Resources

Pipe-willow wood is valuable for musical instruments—its resonance properties are unmatched. But harvesting it requires Melodian permission (they consider the trees semi-sacred) and careful technique (cutting a pipe-willow wrong produces a shriek that can deafen).

The forest also contains unique herbs and fungi that grow nowhere else, possibly influenced by twyl in the soil. Alchemists pay well for Melodian botanicals.

### Milrar Forest

Tags: forest, geography

The central forest of the eastern woodland belt, Milrar sits between Pystinwood to the north and Telwood to the south. Where Pystinwood has its narcotic trees and Telwood its storied history, Milrar is simply old—ancient, dense, and deep in a way that the other forests aren't.

#### Geography

Milrar Forest covers roughly 50 miles east to west and 35 miles north to south, making it the largest of the three eastern forests. It lies west of the Steppe of Aziirn, south of Koshasya and Pystinwood, and north of Telwood.

**The Old Growth**: The forest's core is true old growth—trees that have stood for centuries, their canopy so thick that the forest floor exists in perpetual twilight. The understory is a tangle of fallen logs, bracket fungi, and shade-loving plants. Navigation is difficult; getting lost is easy.

**The Koshasya Edge**: The northern boundary, where Milrar thins into the clearing around Koshasya settlement. This transitional zone shows evidence of past logging and clearing, though the forest has long since reclaimed abandoned fields.

**Ezra's Temptation**: A river that flows through the forest's eastern portion, named for a legendary explorer who followed it seeking the forest's heart and was never seen again. The river eventually flows southeast toward the steppe.

#### Character

Milrar Forest has a reputation for swallowing people. Not through any specific danger—no monsters lurk here, no curses operate—but through sheer disorientation. The forest is so uniform, so densely layered, that travelers lose their sense of direction within hours of entering. They wander in circles. They think they're heading east when they're heading west. They emerge weeks later, miles from where they intended, if they emerge at all.

**The Silence**: Milrar is unnaturally quiet. Sound doesn't carry far through the dense growth, and the usual forest noises—birdsong, animal calls, wind in leaves—seem muted, absorbed by the trees themselves. Travelers report feeling watched by something that never reveals itself.

**Time Distortion**: Some who spend extended periods in Milrar report that time passes strangely. Days feel longer or shorter than they should. Travelers emerge after what felt like two days to find a week has passed, or vice versa. The effect isn't magical in any detectable way—just unsettling.

#### Inhabitants

Milrar has no permanent settlements. The forest doesn't permit them. Attempts to establish camps or outposts have all failed—supplies rot faster than expected, buildings collapse without apparent cause, and residents develop an overwhelming urge to leave.

**The Foresters**: Hunters and gatherers who work Milrar's edges, harvesting game and forest products without ever penetrating the old growth. They know better.

**Passage-Seekers**: Occasional travelers who attempt to cross Milrar rather than go around. Some succeed. Most don't try twice.

#### Milreun Palace

Deep in the old growth, where the trees grow thickest and the silence is absolute, stands Milreun Palace—or what remains of it. The palace predates recorded history; no chronicle names its builders or explains its purpose. It simply exists, half-consumed by the forest, its towers wrapped in ancient vines and its halls open to the sky where roofs have collapsed.

**The Structure**: What survives suggests a palace built for giants, or at least for beings with no regard for human scale. Doorways stand twenty feet tall. Staircases rise at angles too steep for comfortable climbing. The architecture follows no known tradition—the proportions are wrong, the decorative motifs abstract and unsettling.

**The Time Effect**: Milreun Palace is the heart of Milrar's time distortion. The forest's strange temporal effects grow stronger the closer one approaches. Those who enter the palace itself report hours that stretch into apparent days, or entire days that compress into moments. Some have emerged from the palace aged years despite spending only a night within its walls. Others emerged younger, though these cases are rare and never by more than a few months.

**What Remains**: The palace's interior is largely empty—picked clean by centuries of treasure hunters who braved the forest. What couldn't be removed remains: massive stone furniture too heavy to carry, faded murals on crumbling walls, and in the deepest chamber, a throne of black stone facing an empty dais. Something once sat on that dais. Whatever it was, it's long gone.

**The Guardians**: The palace isn't undefended. Those who spend too long in its halls—and "too long" varies unpredictably—attract the attention of shapes that move at the edge of vision, figures that might be shadows or might be something else. They don't attack directly, but those who see them consistently find themselves hopelessly lost when they try to leave, wandering the forest for weeks before emerging.

#### Why It Matters

Milrar Forest is an obstacle that shapes regional geography. Traffic between the northern Westwilds and the orc states to the south routes around the forest, not through it—adding days to journeys but avoiding the very real risk of never arriving at all. The forest's reputation for swallowing people keeps the eastern forest belt largely depopulated despite its proximity to multiple settlements.

The existence of Milreun Palace adds another dimension to Milrar's danger. Some believe the palace is the source of the forest's strangeness—that whatever power once resided there infected the land around it. Others believe the palace was built to contain something that still lurks in the forest's depths. Both groups agree on one thing: Milrar Forest is not natural, and Milreun Palace is why.

### Piktiniti Desert

Tags: desert, geography

A vast arid expanse south of the Everwood, the Piktiniti is less a sea of sand dunes than a harsh shrubland—cracked earth, scrub vegetation, and stony barrens stretching to the horizon. The desert exists because the Everwood to the north has drained the water table dry, pulling every drop of moisture northward to feed its immortal growth.

#### The Twyl

The sandy soil contains trace amounts of twyl—a crystalline mineral that magically produces oxygen. This seemingly minor detail has shaped everything about the Piktiniti.

The oxygen-rich air allows insects to grow to enormous sizes. Beetles the size of dogs. Scorpions the size of horses. Dragonflies with fifteen-foot wingspans. The Piktiniti teems with giant arthropods that would suffocate anywhere else.

Beneath the desert, the twyl deposits are far more concentrated. Vast crystal caverns extend deep underground, remnants of an ancient civilization that built its power on twyl's potential.

#### The Postronamas Empire

Beneath the Piktiniti lie the ruins of the Postronamas—an ancient civilization that rose to greatness through mastery of twyl crystals.

The Postronamas discovered that concentrated twyl doesn't just produce oxygen—it resonates. The crystals hum at frequencies below conscious hearing, and those who meditate in their presence can achieve extraordinary mental states. Postronamas leaders used massive crystal caves as meditation chambers, granting themselves enhanced perception, magical sensitivity, and according to some accounts, genuine psychic abilities.

They built an empire spanning the western Westwilds, constructing the Chakatann pillars as a resonance network that amplified their crystal-magic to continental scales. For centuries, they dominated the region.

Then they pushed too deep.

The crystal caverns extend far underground, and the deeper crystals sing differently. The music becomes maddening—a resonance that permeates the mind, overwhelming thought, erasing identity. The Postronamas leaders who sought the deepest power found it, and it broke them. The madness spread through the resonance network, cascading from pillar to pillar. Within a generation, the empire collapsed into psychosis, civil war, and abandonment.

#### Enimogos

At the desert's heart stands Enimogos—the shattered capital of the Postronamas Empire.

Visible for miles: a cluster of massive crystalline spires erupting from the sand, half-collapsed, surrounded by buried ruins. These were the largest crystals, the most powerful amplifiers in the network. When the empire fell, Enimogos was ground zero.

The spires still resonate. Approaching within a mile, you feel it in your bones: a hum below hearing. Within a hundred yards, the hallucinations start—dreams while awake, voices in languages you've never heard, memories that aren't yours. Stay a day, you'll struggle to remember your name. Stay a week, you won't leave.

The Seyiki call Enimogos "the Broken Song" and refuse to approach. Treasure hunters occasionally try for the artifacts buried in the ruins. Some return wealthy; more return mad; most don't return at all.

#### The Fauna

**Giant Insects:** The dominant lifeforms. Massive beetles (including the dung beetles the Postronamas used to harvest twyl), enormous scorpions, centipedes as long as carts, and the locusts.

**The Locusts:** Every seven years, they hatch. Billions of insects rising from underground chambers where they've spent seven years maturing. For weeks, the swarms devastate everything edible—stripping plants, killing animals, darkening the sky. Civilizations across the Piktiniti have built their calendars around the locust cycle.

**Sand Dragons:** Not true dragons, but dragon-like lizards reaching forty feet in length. Brown and gold scaled, four-legged, with breath weapons that blast sand hard enough to destroy structures and strip armor from bodies. Apex predators that hunt the giant insects.

**Wasp Tumbleweeds:** Massive wasp nests that break free and roll across the desert. Disturbing one releases clouds of aggressive, giant wasps. Experienced travelers give them wide berth.

#### The Flora

Most plants in the Piktiniti are dangerous.

**Parasitic species:** The majority of surface vegetation hosts parasites that transfer to animals on contact—burrowing larvae, blood-drinking vines, spores that colonize the lungs.

**Trap plants:** Large, sub-sand predators that emit the smell of clean water and even fool magical water attunement. Travelers who dig toward the "spring" discover a venus-flytrap structure large enough to consume a horse.

**The thornbush:** One of the few safe plants—its spines make it unpleasant, but it provides edible seeds and doesn't try to kill you.

#### Other Hazards

**Sidewinders:** Venomous snakes that strike from concealment. Their venom causes paralysis and hallucinations.

**Heat:** The Piktiniti is searingly hot during the day and surprisingly cold at night. Temperature swings kill the unprepared.

**Dehydration:** Water is scarce. The Everwood has stolen it all. Wells must be dug deep, and many water sources are actually trap plants in disguise.

#### The Chakatann Pillars

The western Piktiniti is defined by the Chakatann region—the grid of Postronamas pillars that once formed the empire's resonance network. See separate entry.

### Pystinwood

Tags: forest, geography

The northernmost of the three eastern forests, Pystinwood marks where the Westwilds' woodlands finally give way to the Steppe of Aziirn. The forest is named for the pystin tree—a pale-barked species unique to this region whose sap has mild narcotic properties.

#### Geography

Pystinwood stretches roughly 40 miles east to west and 30 miles north to south, bounded by the West Tolkarsus river to the north, the Homdrum Hills to the west, the Steppe of Aziirn to the east, and the clearing containing the settlement of Koshasya to the south. Together with Milrar Forest and Telwood to the south, it forms a woodland belt along the steppe's western edge.

**The Pale Groves**: Dense stands of pystin trees, their white bark giving the forest an eerie, luminous quality even on overcast days. The undergrowth is thin—the pystins produce chemicals that inhibit competing plants—making travel through the groves surprisingly easy.

**The Tolkarsus Fringe**: The forest's northern edge, where it meets the West Tolkarsus river. The soil here is richer, supporting a more diverse woodland of oak, ash, and alder alongside the pystins.

**The Steppe Margin**: The eastern edge gradually thins, trees growing sparser and shorter as the steppe's dry conditions assert themselves. The boundary is fluid, shifting west in dry years and east in wet ones.

#### The Pystin Trees

The pystin is a medium-sized deciduous tree with distinctive white bark that peels in papery strips. Its sap, when properly processed, produces a mild intoxicant—not addictive, but pleasant enough that demand exists.

**Sap Harvesting**: Local traditions allow tapping pystins only during specific seasons and only from mature trees. Violating these rules is said to cause the trees to "turn sour"—producing sap that induces nightmares rather than pleasant dreams.

**Trade**: Pystin sap finds its way to markets throughout the Westwilds and occasionally beyond. It's not valuable enough to attract serious commercial interest, but it provides income for the forest's few inhabitants.

#### Inhabitants

**The Sap-Tappers**: Small, semi-nomadic communities who move through the forest following traditional harvesting routes. They're not hostile to outsiders but not particularly welcoming either—the forest provides enough for them, and more people would mean less.

**Dreaming Pilgrims**: Occasional visitors seeking visions or insight come to drink fresh pystin sap in the Pale Groves. The practice has no formal structure—no temples, no priests—just individual seekers hoping the forest will show them something useful.

#### Climate

Continental temperate, moderated slightly by the forest cover. The Pale Groves maintain their own microclimate—slightly cooler and more humid than the surrounding terrain—which contributes to the pystins' dominance.

#### Why It Matters

Pystinwood is a transition zone—between the Westwilds and the steppe, between forest and grassland, between the orc states to the south and the unclaimed territories to the north. Control of the forest isn't disputed because no one particularly wants to control it, but the sap trade creates connections across the region.

### Seyiki

Tags: state, nation, gnome

The Seyiki are dragonfly-riding gnomes who have made their home among the Chakatann pillars—the vast stone monuments left behind by the fallen Postronamas Empire. Theirs is an aerial culture, a distributed nation of pillar-top communities connected by dragonfly-back travel and a shared heritage of adaptation to one of Alaria's strangest landscapes.

#### Origins

After the Postronamas collapse, survivors scattered across the desert. Most died in the chaos—the infrastructure that had supported their civilization was gone, and the Piktiniti is merciless. But some found refuge on the pillars, climbing the stone monuments to escape ground-level dangers.

These early refugees weren't gnomes—they were human and mixed-heritage Postronamas remnants. The gnomes came later, perhaps a century after the collapse, drawn by the strange resonance of the functioning pillars. Over generations, the two populations merged, and the gnome heritage came to dominate through simple demographics: gnomes breed faster and live longer.

The modern Seyiki remember their Postronamas heritage only in fragments—myths about the "time before the spires," respect for the crystal cores, and an intuitive understanding of the pillars' moods that seems to come from somewhere deeper than learning.

#### The Dragonflies

Giant dragonflies grow enormous in the Piktiniti's oxygen-rich air, their wingspan reaching fifteen feet or more. The Seyiki have domesticated several species, breeding them for different purposes:

**Skimmers:** Light, fast mounts for scouts, messengers, and racing. A skimmer can cross the ten miles between pillars in under an hour.

**Haulers:** Larger, slower dragonflies bred to carry cargo slung beneath them. The backbone of Seyiki trade.

**War-dancers:** Aggressive breeds trained for combat, capable of precision maneuvers that let their riders strike from unexpected angles.

Dragonfly husbandry is the foundation of Seyiki culture. Children learn to ride before they can run properly. The bond between gnome and mount is intimate—a Seyiki who loses their dragonfly often takes months to bond with another.

Dragonfly-racing is the primary sport, cultural event, and status marker. The great races draw spectators from across the pillar-network, and champion riders are celebrities.

#### Society

**Pillar Communities:** Each major pillar hosts a community of 200 to 2,000 gnomes. They've carved homes into the stone—little holes and chambers in the pillar sides, connected by internal passages and external platforms. Below many pillars lie saltwater lakes, remnants of ancient seas now trapped in desert basins. The dragonflies have adapted to tolerate saltwater, and the lakes serve as breeding grounds, water sources, and sacred sites.

**Vertical Status:** The higher your dwelling, the more prestigious. Pillar-tops are for nobles, priests, and successful merchants. Mid-pillar residence is respectable working-class. The base-dwellers—those who must live at ground level—are the lowest caste, constantly at risk from desert predators.

**The Resonance-Touched:** Generations of living near active crystals have made the Seyiki slightly attuned to the old magic. They're not mages in any traditional sense, but they have an instinctive sense for the pillars' states. They can feel storms coming through changes in the crystal-hum, predict locust swarms days in advance, and sometimes receive fragmentary visions when sleeping atop a "blessed" pillar.

**The Robes:** All Seyiki wear flowing robes—practical garments that serve a dual purpose. In the pillar-homes, the robes provide warmth against the desert's cold nights and protection against the hot days. But the robes are specially constructed with panels that catch air; a falling Seyiki can spread their arms and convert the garment into a wingsuit, gliding safely to the ground or a lower platform. Children learn to fall before they learn to climb.

**Warriors:** Despite their small size, Seyiki are fantastic fighters. Their combat style emphasizes three-dimensional movement—dropping from above, striking from unexpected angles, retreating upward. A Seyiki warrior on their home pillar is nearly impossible to pin down. Combined with their dragonfly mounts, they can harry enemies indefinitely, never committing to a fight they can't win.

**Insularity:** The Seyiki are not hostile, but they're deeply suspicious of outsiders. The desert is deadly; strangers usually want something—typically crystal cores or pillar access. And they remember, in a mythological way, that their ancestors' hubris destroyed an empire. They're wary of anyone who seems too interested in the old magic.

#### The Reaping

Every seven years, the locusts hatch.

The swarms are devastating at ground level—billions of insects consuming everything organic, stripping the desert bare. Most Piktiniti cultures hide and pray. The Seyiki hunt.

Dragonflies are natural locust predators. When the swarms rise, Seyiki riders launch en masse, diving into the locust clouds on war-dancers and haulers alike. They harvest locusts by the ton—the insects are dried, ground, and stored as protein-rich flour that will feed the pillar-communities for years.

The Reaping is the most important cultural event in Seyiki life. It's dangerous—riders are lost every cycle, overwhelmed by swarms or brought down by collisions—but successful hunters return as heroes. A gnome's worth is often measured by how many Reapings they've survived.

#### Enimogos

The Seyiki call it "the Broken Song," and they do not go there.

Enimogos is the ruined heart of the Postronamas Empire, visible on clear days from the eastern pillars—a cluster of shattered crystal spires that still resonate with maddening intensity. The Seyiki's oral traditions are explicit: Enimogos is death. The crystals there sing a song that breaks minds. Even flying over it is said to leave riders disoriented for days.

Whether this prohibition is wisdom or superstition, no Seyiki violates it. The pillars near Enimogos are abandoned, ceded to whatever haunts the ruins.

#### Trade

The Seyiki trade with the outside world through Jüt, the port city on Kettle Bay. They export:

**Crystal fragments:** Small pieces of twyl from depleted or damaged pillars. Valuable for enchanting and alchemy.

**Dragonfly chitin:** The shed carapaces of giant dragonflies, useful for lightweight armor and magical components.

**Locust products:** Dried locusts, locust flour, and refined locust oil. Not glamorous, but there's always demand.

In exchange, they import metal (scarce in the desert), textiles, and luxury goods. Seyiki merchants are known as hard bargainers—they know the value of what they have and don't negotiate from weakness.

### Shazuihn

Tags: state, nation, orc

The easternmost orc state, occupying the borderlands where the Wildwood thins into the Steppe of Aziirn. The Shazuihni are boar-riding raiders who attack constantly and build nothing permanent. They're the most feared and least understood of the six orc nations.

#### Geography

Shazuihn isn't truly a territory in the conventional sense—it's wherever the boar-riders happen to be. Their "land" consists of the forest margins, scattered woodland patches, and the western edge of the steppe where their herds graze.

**The Rooting Grounds:** Semi-permanent camps where the boar herds graze and breed. These shift seasonally but remain sacred to the Shazuihni. Attacking the Rooting Grounds is the surest way to provoke unified Shazuihni retaliation.

**The Blood Road:** The main raiding path west into Hedroscobb territory. Generations of raids have worn it into the land—a route any Shazuihni child could follow blindfolded.

**The Scorches:** Geothermal region to the north with hotsprings, geysers, and unpredictable fire eruptions. Too dangerous for regular habitation but used as a retreat when enemies pursue—the Shazuihni know the safe paths, and invaders don't.

**Dragon Spout:** Where void and fire leylines intersect, creating eruptions of unnatural flame. The Shazuihni avoid it but use it as a boundary marker.

#### Borders

- **West:** Hedroscobb (primary raiding target)
- **Northwest:** Tarn (secondary raiding target)
- **North:** The Scorches
- **East:** Steppe of Aziirn
- **South:** Wurmspine Mountains region

#### Climate

Continental, transitioning from forest to steppe. Cold winters, hot summers. The boar herds follow the grazing, and the Shazuihni follow the herds.

#### Why It Matters

The Shazuihni are a constant drain on the other orc states. Their raids bleed Hedroscobb and Tarn year after year, preventing either from ever fully concentrating their forces elsewhere. In a strange way, the eternal raids help maintain the Wildwood's balance—no one can grow too strong while the boar-riders keep attacking.

If anyone ever united or eliminated the Shazuihni, the entire regional dynamic would shift.

### Steppe of Aziirn

Tags: steppe, plains, geography

A vast expanse of dry grassland stretching east from the three eastern forests (Pystinwood, Milrar, and Telwood) toward the distant Kharvorn Mountains and the territories beyond. The steppe is named for Aziirn, a legendary figure—variously described as a giant, a hero, or a god—who is said to have walked these plains in ages past, his footsteps so heavy they flattened the land.

#### Geography

The Steppe of Aziirn covers an enormous area—several hundred miles east to west and north to south—though its exact boundaries are disputed. For practical purposes, the steppe begins where the eastern forests end and continues until the terrain changes: mountains to the east, more fertile land to the south, frozen tundra to the north.

**The West Edge**: Where the steppe meets the eastern forests. This transitional zone shifts with climate—the forests advance during wet periods, the steppe during dry ones. The boundary has moved miles in either direction within living memory.

**The Grand Tolkarsus Valley**: The river cuts across the southern portion of the steppe, its valley a ribbon of green through otherwise endless grass. Most travel across the steppe follows the river.

**The Central Plains**: The heart of the steppe—flat, dry, and featureless. The grass grows waist-high in spring and dies to brown stubble by late summer. Navigation depends on sun position and stars; there are no landmarks.

**The Eastern Rise**: The steppe gradually gains elevation toward the east, eventually becoming the foothills of the Kharvorn range. This eastern portion receives slightly more rainfall, supporting scattered trees and richer grass.

#### Climate

The steppe is defined by its climate: hot summers, bitter winters, little rainfall, and constant wind. The soil is fertile enough, but the lack of water limits what can grow. Grasses dominate; trees survive only along watercourses.

**The Wind**: The steppe is never still. Wind blows from the east in summer, from the north in winter, varying in intensity but never stopping. Travelers learn to turn their backs to it or go mad.

**Seasonal Extremes**: Summer temperatures can kill; winter temperatures can kill faster. The steppe offers no shelter—no forests, no hills, no caves. Survival depends on preparation.

#### Inhabitants

**Nomadic Herders**: The steppe's primary inhabitants are nomadic peoples who follow grazing animals—horses, cattle, sheep—across the grasslands according to seasonal patterns. These groups are diverse, speaking different languages and following different customs, but sharing an understanding of steppe survival.

**The Empty Quarter**: The central steppe is genuinely uninhabited for much of the year. Even the nomads avoid the deepest interior during the harsh seasons. Anyone encountered there is either lost, desperate, or extremely dangerous.

**Border Communities**: Where the steppe meets other terrain—along rivers, at forest edges, in foothills—small settled communities survive. These serve as trade points between the nomads and the wider world.

#### Why It Matters

The Steppe of Aziirn is primarily an obstacle. It separates the Westwilds from the Kharvorn region, the orc states from the eastern territories, the known from the unknown. Crossing it is possible but difficult; avoiding it is usually easier. The steppe's emptiness creates a buffer zone that has shaped politics for centuries—invasions bog down, trade routes detour, and populations stay separated.

The Grand Tolkarsus provides the only practical route across the steppe's southern portion, making Tarn's control of the river strategically important far beyond the immediate region.

### Symonair Lake

Tags: lake, geography, dragon

A deep, cold lake in the Wildwood's lake system, connected to Cykravikus Lake to the north. The lake is named for its inhabitant—the ancient blue dragon Symonair, who has claimed these waters for longer than any orc state has existed.

#### Geography

Symonair Lake is smaller than Cykravikus but significantly deeper. Its waters are dark, cold, and still—unusually so. Even on windy days, the surface barely ripples. The lake connects to Cykravikus through a series of channels and eventually drains into Phyndarr Sound at the northeastern edge of the Shattered Sea.

The shores are forested but largely uninhabited. The orc states avoid building here. Travelers pass through quickly. Fishermen do not fish these waters.

#### The Dragon

Symonair is a blue dragon—patient, water-attuned, and inscrutably deceptive. He dwells in underwater caverns beneath the lake, in chambers no surface dweller has ever seen. His presence is rarely visible, but everyone in the region knows he is there. Occasionally, travelers report a massive shadow moving beneath the surface, too large to be any natural creature.

Those who enter the lake without permission do not return. This is not legend—it is consistent fact across centuries of recorded history. Fishing boats, adventurers, war-parties pursuing enemies into the waters—all have vanished.

#### The Balance

Symonair Lake and Cykravikus Lake form a connected system. The Hag Queen rules Cykravikus and the Griebi; Symonair rules his waters alone. The relationship between the dragon and the hag is unknown, but neither has attacked the other in all recorded history.

Some believe they have divided the waters between them—an arrangement of ancient powers that keeps the entire region stable. Others believe they are bound by something deeper, some pact or shared secret from before the orc states existed.

Whatever the truth, the balance holds. Neither the orc states nor any outside power has been willing to test it.

#### What Lies Beneath

Rumors persist of Symonair's hoard—treasure accumulated over millennia, resting in underwater caverns beneath the lake. Dragon treasure is always tempting, but the logistics of reaching an underwater lair guarded by an ancient blue dragon who knows every inch of his domain have deterred all but the most foolish.

No expedition has ever returned with treasure. No expedition has ever returned at all.

#### Adventure Hooks

- Recover something from the lake bottom (requires surviving Symonair's attention)
- Discover the truth of the dragon-hag relationship
- Negotiate passage across the lake for an urgent mission
- Investigate why the lake's water level has been rising

### Tarn

Tags: state, nation, orc

An orc state in the north-central Wildwood, controlling a strategic stretch of the Grand Tolkarsus river where it passes through the Plenjorn Swamp. The Tarni are spirit warriors—orcs whose souls are so firmly anchored to their bodies that death struggles to claim them.

#### Geography

Tarn occupies river valley territory along the middle Tolkarsus—roughly 60 miles of river and the surrounding flood plains. The terrain is wet: marshes, seasonally flooded meadows, and the edges of Plenjorn Swamp.

**Tarns-Hollow:** The capital, built where the Tolkarsus widens into a series of lakes. The boundary between the living world and the spirit realm is thin here; the Tarni consider these waters sacred.

**The Spirit Gates:** Stone pillars along the river where ancestors are said to enter the mortal world. Major ritual sites where the spirit-seers commune with the dead.

**The Contested Shore:** The stretch of Plenjorn Swamp that Tarn and Glivornax both claim. Fighting happens here regularly.

#### Borders

- **North:** Grieb (the lakemen; minimal contact)
- **Northwest:** Uhionai (occasional friction)
- **West:** Glivornax (hostile; the Water War)
- **South:** Hedroscobb (neutral)
- **East:** Shazuihn (hostile; raids)

#### Climate

Continental temperate with significant flooding during spring melt. The river valley is humid and misty—local legend says the mist is spirits moving between worlds.

#### Why It Matters

Tarn controls the river and the healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp. River passage, river trade, and most importantly, access to the miraculous waters all flow through Tarni territory. Their spirit warriors are individually formidable, and their spirit-seers can detect lies and see things conventional scouts cannot.

### Telwood

Tags: forest, geography

The southernmost of the three eastern forests, Telwood lies between Milrar Forest to the north and the Grieb Lakes region to the southwest. Unlike its mysterious northern neighbor, Telwood is thoroughly mapped, frequently traveled, and historically significant—it was the site of the first diplomatic contact between the expanding orc states and the human settlements of the northern Westwilds.

#### Geography

Telwood covers roughly 40 miles east to west and 25 miles north to south, making it the smallest of the three eastern forests. It is bounded by Milrar Forest to the north, the Steppe of Aziirn to the east, Grieb territory to the southwest, and open plains transitioning toward Tarn territory to the south.

**The Council Clearing**: A large natural meadow near the forest's center where, centuries ago, representatives of seven different peoples met to establish trade agreements and territorial boundaries. The clearing is maintained by periodic burning and is still used for important negotiations.

**The Old Road**: An ancient path running roughly east-west through the forest, marked by stone cairns placed so long ago that no one remembers who built them. The road predates the orc states, predates most human settlement in the region, and shows signs of maintenance by hands unknown.

**The South Margin**: Where Telwood transitions into the wetlands approaching Grieb. The trees here are water-tolerant species—willow, alder, water oak—and the ground is frequently soggy.

#### History

Telwood's historical significance stems from its position. When the orc states were consolidating centuries ago and expanding human settlements were pushing into the Westwilds, this forest sat at the intersection. Rather than fight over it, the various powers chose to meet here.

**The Telwood Compact**: The agreement reached at the Council Clearing, still nominally in force, established Telwood as neutral territory—no faction claims it, all may pass through peacefully, and disputes are supposed to be resolved through negotiation rather than violence. The compact has been violated numerous times but never officially abandoned.

**The Stone Markers**: Carved stones placed at Telwood's boundaries marking it as neutral ground. Most are weathered beyond reading, but locals know what they represent.

#### Inhabitants

**The Wardens**: A loose organization of rangers who maintain Telwood's neutrality. They don't serve any particular power; they serve the forest and the compact. Membership is voluntary, training is informal, and authority derives purely from reputation. The Wardens escort travelers, mediate disputes, and occasionally remove those who violate the peace.

**The Forest Inns**: Several permanent inns have been established along the Old Road, serving traders, diplomats, and travelers. These are genuinely neutral establishments—violence against guests is met with permanent expulsion, and the Wardens enforce this strictly.

#### Climate

Continental temperate, similar to the surrounding region. Telwood's relatively small size and open structure means it doesn't create its own microclimate the way Milrar does.

#### Why It Matters

Telwood is a rare thing in the Westwilds: safe, neutral territory where different factions can meet without risking ambush. The Telwood Compact may be old and fraying, but it still provides a framework for diplomacy in a region where diplomacy is otherwise dangerous. Trade routes pass through Telwood specifically because it's safer than alternatives, making the forest economically important despite its modest size.

### Tenekee Woods

Tags: forest, geography

The transitional forest between the Krenglelan foothills and the Walking Forest proper, the Tenekee Woods are what hunters call "honest woods"—dangerous, yes, but predictable. The rules here are the rules.

#### Character

Unlike the Everwood to the west (a single immortal organism) or the Walking Forest to the south (which moves), the Tenekee is simply a forest. Individual trees grow, age, and die. Leaves fall and rot. Predators hunt prey according to comprehensible logic. For travelers exhausted by the supernatural forests that dominate the Westwilds, the Tenekee offers something rare: normalcy.

The woods are old-growth, dense with massive oaks and beeches whose canopies block most sunlight. Game is plentiful—deer, boar, rabbits—and the hunting is good. Lacirean hunters work the Tenekee for meat and timber, grateful for a forest that doesn't try to kill them in strange ways.

#### The Watched Feeling

Despite being "normal," the Tenekee has an unsettling quality: the persistent sensation of being observed. This is the Walking Forest's influence bleeding northward.

The Grayls don't often come this far into the Tenekee—the sounds of hunters and woodcutters pain them—but they *watch* from the southern treeline. Their patient wooden attention extends further than their bodies do. Tenekee hunters learn not to make eye contact with the forest edge at dusk, when the light plays tricks and the trees seem to have faces.

Occasionally, a Grayl does wander north, following a beloved tree that has seeded in the Tenekee. When this happens, the local hunters simply leave the area for a season. There's no fighting a Grayl; there's barely any communicating with one. You just wait until it leaves or until its tree dies.

#### Dangers

The Tenekee's dangers are mundane but real: wolves in winter, bears year-round, the occasional bandit gang using the woods as cover. The northern edge brushes against the Krenglelan Range, and things come down from the mountains sometimes—cave cats, displaced wyverns, once reportedly a young lindworm.

The forest also serves as a buffer between civilized lands and the Walking Forest. Travelers heading south are advised to stock up on supplies in Lacire and move quickly through the Tenekee. Lingering too long risks an encounter with something from deeper in.

#### The Everwood's Edge

Where the Tenekee meets the Everwood to the northwest, the forest changes abruptly. One step you're in normal woods; the next, the ground is spongy with undecaying leaves, the air thick with spores, and the trees have that unsettling sameness of a single organism. Locals have marked the boundary with old stone cairns—warnings, not borders. Nothing stops the Everwood from spreading except the patient work of fire and the forest's own strange preferences.

### Terü

Tags: forest, geography

A forest in the Westwilds.

TODO

### The Guiles

Tags: forest, geography, illusion

The Guiles is a dense forest wedged between the Hellion Hills to the west and the Twaan Forests to the north, stretching south toward Kobuk. It takes its name from the experience of traveling through it: the forest lies, and those who trust their senses here find themselves hopelessly lost.

No one is entirely certain why. The leading theories involve residual magic from the nearby ley lines, some property of the local flora, or the influence of creatures that prefer confused prey. The Guiles isn't actively malicious—people who stay calm and patient usually find their way out eventually—but it makes navigation nearly impossible through conventional means.

#### The Forest

The Guiles covers perhaps fifteen miles east to west and twenty north to south, though measurements vary wildly depending on who's doing the measuring and when. The trees are primarily old-growth hardwoods—oak, ash, and maple—with dense understory growth that blocks sightlines and muffles sound.

The terrain appears uniform but isn't. Gentle slopes steepen without warning. Streams seem to flow uphill. Clearings that look a hundred yards away turn out to be adjacent, while nearby trees can take hours to reach. The sun is visible through the canopy, but it doesn't help—it seems to rise in different directions depending on where you stand.

Wildlife is abundant but difficult to track. Animals appear and vanish with disturbing regularity. Hunters who follow game trails find themselves circling back to their starting points.

#### The Lies

The Guiles doesn't create illusions—at least, not obvious ones. Nothing looks wrong. The problem is that nothing is where it should be.

**Distance Distortion**: Distances in the Guiles bear no reliable relationship to travel time. A visible landmark might take minutes or hours to reach. Travelers who walk in straight lines end up somewhere other than where the line pointed.

**Directional Drift**: Compasses work, but the directions they indicate don't correspond to actual geography. The sun rises in the east, but "east" as measured inside the Guiles doesn't match "east" anywhere else.

**Memory Erosion**: Extended time in the Guiles makes it difficult to remember why you entered or where you were going. Not dangerous memory loss—travelers retain their identities and important information—but purpose and direction slip away. Many who get lost report forgetting they were lost, wandering contentedly until stumbling out days later.

**Sound Displacement**: Voices carry strangely. Conversations seem to come from the wrong direction. Echoes precede sounds. Silence falls suddenly and completely, then lifts just as suddenly.

#### Surviving the Guiles

Those who must cross the Guiles have developed several techniques:

**Marking**: Physical marks on trees remain reliable. Blazing a trail creates a path that can be followed back, even when nothing else makes sense. The Cogheads of Kobuk use distinctive metal markers; the Twaan use claw-scored symbols.

**Tethering**: Groups sometimes use ropes to maintain physical connection. If you can touch someone, you know where they are, regardless of what your eyes and ears tell you.

**Night Travel**: Some travelers report that the distortion weakens after dark. This may be because there's less visual information to mislead, or because whatever causes the effect is less active at night. The tradeoff is navigating dense forest in darkness.

**Local Guides**: Both the Cogheads and the Twaan know paths through the Guiles that remain relatively stable. These guides are expensive and reluctant—neither group enjoys spending time in the forest—but they're the most reliable option.

#### Inhabitants

**The Misled**: The local name for people who've been lost in the Guiles so long they've stopped trying to leave. Not a formal community—they rarely find each other—but individual hermits scattered through the forest, living off the land and occasionally helping (or further confusing) travelers they encounter. Most seem content. A few seem to have forgotten there's anywhere else to be.

**Displacers**: Predators native to the Guiles that have adapted to (or perhaps cause) the distortion. They appear where they shouldn't be, attack from unexpected angles, and vanish before retaliation. Whether they're magical creatures, mundane animals that have learned to exploit the terrain, or something else entirely is unclear.

**The Wardens**: Rumors persist of something intelligent in the deep Guiles—entities that maintain the distortion or benefit from it. No one has confirmed contact. The Twaan claim it's forest spirits. The Cogheads think it's a colony of creatures with natural illusion abilities. Both groups recommend not looking too hard for answers.

#### Borders

**North**: The Guiles gradually merge with the southern reaches of the Twaan Forests. The transition is marked by the distortion weakening—the Twaan claim their territory "knows itself" and resists the Guiles' influence.

**West**: The Hellion Hills. The distortion ends abruptly at the treeline where volcanic terrain begins. Heat and sulfur replace confusion.

**South/Southeast**: Kobuk territory. The Cogheads have fortified their border with the Guiles, clearing trees and maintaining watch-posts. They've lost too many people to the forest to trust it.

**East**: Eventually opens into the broader Wurmspine foothills, though "eventually" is the operative word—the eastern edge is the deepest part of the distortion.

### Twaan Forests

Tags: forest, twaan, ley lines, fire, geography

The Twaan Forests are a sprawling woodland complex in the northeastern Westwilds, bounded by the Kharvorn Mountains to the east and the arid scrublands to the west and south. Three distinct forests make up this region—Turxis Golathi in the north, Sorix Melar in the west, and Zlyverth Korn in the center—though locals and the Twaan themselves treat them as one continuous territory.

This is Twaan land. The large, bitter skaag-relatives have claimed these forests as their own, and they do not welcome outsiders. Their sprawling burrow-settlements honeycomb the ground beneath the trees, housing extended families in warrens that can stretch for miles. Above ground, the forest appears wild and trackless. Below, it's a civilization.

#### Why They Came Here

The Twaan speak of a betrayal. The details vary by clan, but the shape of the story remains: they once lived elsewhere, among other peoples, and were driven out. Some say humans broke treaties. Others blame elves, or orcs, or simply "the world." Whatever the truth, the Twaan retreated to these forests generations ago because no one else wanted them.

The Westwilds are harsh—arid scrubland with little water and less mercy. But the Earth ley line that runs through this region creates an anomaly: soil rich enough to support dense forest where none should grow. The Twaan found sanctuary in this improbable woodland, and they've defended it ever since.

Their bitterness runs deep. They trade reluctantly, speak to outsiders rarely, and trust no one who isn't Twaan. Visitors who stumble into their territory are watched, guided out if they're lucky, and simply vanish if they're not. The Twaan remember what happened last time they trusted outsiders.

#### Turxis Golathi

The northern section of the Twaan Forests, Turxis Golathi is the oldest and densest part of the woodland. Ancient trees tower here, their canopy so thick that the forest floor lies in permanent twilight. This is where the most established Twaan clans make their homes, their burrow-networks extending deep into the earth.

Turxis Golathi is relatively peaceful by Twaan standards—the clans here have sorted out their territorial disputes generations ago, and a rough hierarchy keeps the endless bickering from erupting into open conflict. Outsiders are rare this deep in the forest, and the Twaan prefer it that way.

The Earth ley line runs through the southern edge of Turxis Golathi before curving southeast toward the Magma Pits. The soil here is unnaturally fertile, and the trees grow to enormous size. Some Twaan claim the oldest trees are aware in some fashion, though they won't elaborate to outsiders.

#### Sorix Melar

The western forest, Sorix Melar marks the boundary between Twaan territory and the open Westwilds. The trees here are younger, the canopy thinner, and the Twaan clans more aggressive. This is the front line—where raiders, traders, and the merely curious first encounter Twaan hospitality.

Which is to say, they encounter arrows and warnings.

The Twaan of Sorix Melar have developed a reputation for shooting first. They maintain watch-posts in the larger trees, and they've learned to identify the difference between a lost traveler (escort out), a merchant (tolerate briefly), and a scout (kill immediately). Their paranoia is earned; they've repelled orc war-parties, human settlers, and at least one organized attempt to harvest timber from "unclaimed" forest.

The clans here are poorer than their cousins in Turxis Golathi, more fractious, and more desperate. They control the western trade routes into Twaan territory, which means they also bear the brunt of outside contact. It's made them hard.

#### Zlyverth Korn

The central forest is where the fire ley line enters Twaan territory, running north-south along the eastern edge of the woodland before converging with the Earth ley line at the Magma Pits. This convergence has created something extraordinary: the Burning Corridor.

##### The Burning Corridor

Along the fire ley line, the trees have become something else entirely.

Generations of exposure to raw elemental fire have transformed the forest. The trees here don't burn—they ARE fire made into wood. Their bark glows with internal heat, radiating warmth that can be felt from yards away. Their sap runs like liquid flame, bright orange and searingly hot. Their leaves flicker and dance like candle flames frozen in place. At night, the Burning Corridor is visible for miles—a wall of soft red-orange light cutting through the darkness.

The trees are alive. They grow, they reproduce (their seeds are small embers that drift on hot updrafts), and they die (collapsing into piles of ash that quickly sprout new growth). But they don't burn in the conventional sense. You cannot set them more on fire than they already are.

This makes the wood extraordinarily valuable. Fire-immune timber has a thousand uses: ships that can't burn, structures proof against arson, wands and staves that channel flame without consuming themselves, alchemical components for fire resistance, charcoal that burns eternally. A single fire-tree log is worth more than most Twaan clans see in a year.

The Twaan know this. So does everyone else.

##### The Twaan and the Fire

The Burning Corridor is both the Twaan's greatest asset and their greatest vulnerability. They've learned to harvest the fire-trees carefully—never taking too much, never allowing the corridor to thin. They trade small quantities of the wood at enormous markup, maintaining a near-monopoly on the supply.

But the corridor also draws attention. Merchants, thieves, armies—everyone wants fire-wood. The Twaan have repelled dozens of attempts to take the corridor by force, and they've grown expert at making the forest itself into a weapon. The Burning Corridor is impassable to anyone who doesn't know the safe paths, and the Twaan aren't sharing.

Their underground warrens extend beneath the corridor, insulated by stone and earth from the heat above. Some clans have learned to tend the fire-trees from below, feeding their roots with alchemically-treated water that somehow doesn't extinguish them. The relationship between the Twaan and the Burning Corridor has become almost symbiotic—they protect the trees, and the trees protect them.

#### Relations with Neighbors

**Gymlstik Goblins**: The goblin-controlled mountains to the east are a constant low-grade threat. Goblin raiders probe Twaan territory regularly, and Cirthikin hunting parties sometimes venture into the forest edges. The Twaan and goblins have fought skirmishes for generations, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Burning Corridor helps—goblins don't handle fire well.

**Orc States**: The orcish nations to the south and west view the Twaan Forests with a mixture of frustration and grudging respect. Several orc states have tried to claim the fire-wood trade; all have failed. An uneasy understanding exists: the Twaan don't expand, the orcs don't invade, and both sides pretend the other doesn't exist.

**Everyone Else**: The Twaan don't distinguish much between humans, elves, dwarves, or anyone else. They're all outsiders. They all betrayed the Twaan (or would, given the chance). Trade happens at the forest's edge, briefly, with weapons visible. That's as friendly as it gets.

#### What Travelers Should Know

- Don't enter the forest without permission. The Twaan will know you're there.
- Don't cut any trees. Not even dead ones. Not even branches.
- Don't approach burrow entrances. You won't see them until you're standing on one, and then you'll have a dozen angry Twaan explaining your mistake.
- If you're escorted out, go. The alternative is not being escorted out.
- Fire-wood can be purchased at the western edge of Sorix Melar, if you have enough gold and enough patience. The Twaan will make you wait. It's a test.

### Uhionai

Tags: state, nation, orc

The far northwestern orc state, occupying the ancient Ryunimir Forest. The Uihonaii are the tree-bound orcs—they become trees when they die and can be reborn from their wooden forms. Their territory is less a nation and more a living graveyard of ancestors.

#### Geography

Uhionai occupies the Ryunimir Forest—a dense, ancient woodland in the far northwest of the Wildwood. The forest is old, the trees massive, and the canopy so thick that little sunlight reaches the floor. Throughout the forest, clearings mark the sacred groves where the Reborn sleep.

**The First Grove:** The oldest sacred site, where the earliest Reborn took root centuries ago. Forbidden to outsiders.

**Waking Hollow:** Where trees on the verge of reawakening are tended. Strange whispers and half-heard voices fill the air.

**The Boundary Oaks:** Ancient trees along the southern border marking where Uhionai territory begins. Crossing them without permission is considered an act of war.

**The Speaking Glade:** Where the Grove Council meets and where outsiders may petition for audience.

#### Borders

- **South/Southeast:** Tarn (occasional friction)
- **East:** Grieb (minimal contact)
- **North:** Unclaimed wilderness, eventually the Northlands
- **West:** More forest, eventually the Walking Forest

#### Climate

Continental temperate, moderated by the forest. Winters are cold but the ancient trees break the wind; summers are cool beneath the canopy. The sacred groves maintain unusual warmth year-round—something about the Reborn's presence.

#### Why It Matters

The Uihonaii are the oldest orc presence in the Wildwood. Their Reborn carry memories across centuries—First Root Yorunax remembers events from before the other orc states existed. Weapons carved from their sacred wood are sentient and extraordinarily powerful.

They take the long view on everything. They've watched empires rise and fall. They're patient because they have to be.

### Walking Forest

Tags: forest, geography

A vast woodland south of the Tenekee Woods and east of the Everwood, the Walking Forest is named for its most unsettling quality: it moves. Not quickly—not in ways visible to the eye—but over seasons and years, the forest migrates. Entire groves relocate. Landmarks shift. Paths that existed last decade are now dense woodland, and clearings appear where none existed before.

Cartographers have learned not to bother mapping it.

#### The Movement

No one knows why the Walking Forest moves. Some scholars believe it follows underground water sources. Others think it tracks ley lines, or responds to seasonal changes in ways too complex to model. A few suggest the forest is semi-sentient, migrating according to preferences no mortal can fathom.

The movement is slow—perhaps a mile per year in the most active sections—but relentless. A village built in a clearing might find itself surrounded by encroaching trees within a generation. Roads laid through the forest become impassable as the woods close behind travelers. The forest doesn't seem malicious, exactly. It simply doesn't acknowledge that anything should stay in one place.

#### The Grayls

The Walking Forest is home to the largest population of Grayls in the world—wooden humanoids born from sacred groves, melancholic and ancient, who find the sounds of civilization physically painful.

The Grayls gather here because the Walking Forest solves their deepest sorrow. A Grayl bonds with trees—specific trees, individual trees—over decades or centuries of patient communion. In a normal forest, those trees eventually die, or the Grayl is forced to move and abandon them. The loss is devastating, repeated across immortal lifetimes.

But in the Walking Forest, the trees come with them. A Grayl can bond with an oak and know that oak will never be left behind. When the forest moves, their companions move too. The Walking Forest is not the Grayls' creation, but it has become their sanctuary.

When the Grayls mobilize—when many of them move at once, for whatever slow reasons drive them—the forest seems to move faster. Whether this is cause or correlation, no one knows.

#### Ierya

At the heart of the Walking Forest lies Ierya, the oldest grove, where the largest and most ancient Grayls stand. While the outer forest shifts and migrates, Ierya barely moves—it is the anchor point, the heartwood, the still center around which everything else slowly rotates.

The trees in Ierya are impossibly vast. Their trunks are wider than houses; their canopy is so high it creates its own weather—mist and light rain fall beneath the leaves even on clear days. The understory is a twilight world of massive roots, bioluminescent moss, and absolute stillness.

The oldest Grayls dwell here, some who haven't moved in centuries. They stand among their bonded trees, dreaming slow green dreams, aware of the forest in ways that younger beings cannot comprehend. Entering Ierya means entering their attention. They may not act, may not even acknowledge visitors. But they *notice*.

#### The Springs of Vyowehr

Sacred springs bubble up in Ierya's heart—cold, clear water emerging from deep beneath the Walking Forest. The springs have subtle magical properties: wounds heal faster for those who bathe in them, poisons are neutralized, and those who drink from the source sometimes experience prophetic dreams.

The water comes from deep underground, filtered through root-networks that span miles. It carries something of the Grayls' slow vitality—a connection to their dreaming awareness. The Grayls are protective of the springs. This is the one place in the Walking Forest where they actively respond to threats.

#### Sound and Silence

The Walking Forest is quiet in ways other forests aren't—not supernaturally silent like Quiet Mountain, but naturally hushed. No roads bring wagons. No villages echo with voices. No axes ring against wood. The only sounds are wind, rain, the creak of slow movement, and the occasional low groan of trees adjusting their positions.

This silence is why the Grayls can tolerate it here. They find mortal voices painful—something about the pitch, the speed, the sheer *volume* of humanoid speech causes them distress. In the Walking Forest, they can exist without suffering.

Visitors who wish to pass through peacefully learn to communicate in whispers, gestures, and writing. Those who shout or sing will find the forest suddenly more difficult to navigate, paths closing, landmarks shifting, the Grayls' patient attention turning unfriendly.

#### Lacire

On the Springs of Vyowehr, within Ierya, stands Lacire—a city-state of perhaps fifteen thousand people, the only significant permanent settlement in the Walking Forest. See separate entry.

### West Tolkarsus

Tags: river, geography

The northern tributary of the Grand Tolkarsus river system, the West Tolkarsus flows from the highlands north of the Westwilds, passing through the Homdrum Hills before joining with other waterways to form the larger river that eventually reaches the Grieb Lakes and Plenjorn Swamp.

#### Course

The West Tolkarsus originates in the unnamed hills north of the Grelli Hills, flowing generally southeast through progressively lower terrain:

**The Upper Reaches**: The river begins as multiple streams gathering in the northern highlands, cold and clear from snowmelt. This section is largely inaccessible—no settlements, few travelers, and terrain too rough for easy passage.

**The Homdrum Passage**: The river curves through the northeastern Homdrum Hills, carving a shallow valley that provides the main route through this otherwise trackless region. The water here is slower, warmer, and muddier—it's picking up sediment from the surrounding hills.

**The Pystinwood Fork**: Near the northern edge of Pystinwood, the West Tolkarsus receives several smaller streams from the forest. The water here takes on a faintly sweet taste from pystin sap leaching into the tributary streams.

**The Confluence**: The West Tolkarsus eventually joins with streams flowing from the Desendrum range and the eastern watershed, forming the upper Grand Tolkarsus that flows southwest toward Tarn territory.

#### Character

The West Tolkarsus is not a major river by Alarian standards—perhaps 50-100 feet wide through most of its course, shallow enough to ford in many places during dry season. What makes it significant is its role as a navigation aid and travel route through otherwise difficult terrain.

**Seasonal Variation**: Spring snowmelt turns the West Tolkarsus into a dangerous torrent; late summer reduces it to a series of connected pools. The best travel season is early autumn, when water levels are low but consistent.

**Naming**: The river was named by the cartographer Oregeg Tolkarsus, who traced the entire Grand Tolkarsus system from source to outlet. He named the western tributary for its position relative to his route, though locals had called it by other names for generations.

#### Use

**Travel Route**: Traders and travelers use the West Tolkarsus valley as a path through the Homdrum Hills and toward the northern Westwilds. The riverbank provides landmarks, water, and a general sense of direction that the featureless hills otherwise lack.

**Fishing**: The river supports populations of various fish species, providing food for the sparse communities along its banks. The pystin-flavored water near the Pystinwood Fork produces fish with an unusual taste—prized by some, avoided by others.

**Water Access**: In a region where reliable water sources are precious, the West Tolkarsus is important simply for existing. Settlements cluster near it; travelers plan routes around it; conflicts sometimes arise over access to it.

#### Why It Matters

The West Tolkarsus connects the northern Westwilds to the orc states in the south—not through traffic (the river isn't navigable for any significant distance) but through the route it enables. Following the river takes travelers through the Homdrum Hills without getting lost, past the eastern forests without entering them, and eventually toward the trade routes along the Grand Tolkarsus proper.

### Wildwood

Tags: forest, geography, orc

The Wildwood is the vast forested region that dominates the eastern Westwilds, stretching from the mountain passes of Vogenfeld in the south to the great lakes in the north. Outsiders call the entire region "Hedroscobb" after the orc state that controls its southern reaches, but the orcs themselves know it as a land of six nations, endless war, and waters that can heal the dying.

#### Geography

The Wildwood covers roughly 400 miles north to south and 300 miles east to west—an ocean of ancient forest broken by rivers, lakes, swamps, and occasional clearings. The Grand Tolkarsus river system is its lifeblood, flowing from the Nirvanis Mountains in the northeast, southwest through the heart of orc territory, eventually reaching Cykravikus Lake and beyond.

**Southern Wildwood:** Dense temperate forest with ironwood groves. This is Hedroscobb proper—the largest and most aggressive of the orc states. The terrain is rugged, with steep ravines and hidden valleys where the Hedroscobbi forge their terrible armor.

**Central Wildwood:** The forest transitions to wetter ground as the Tolkarsus spreads into marshes and flood plains. Tarn controls the river and the Plenjorn Swamp—the source of the healing waters that every power in the region covets. Glivornax, to the west, fights Tarn for access. The Yugurbas Dyos—a contested swamp-meadow transitional zone—lies between Hedroscobb and Glivornax to the south, and blood has been spilled over it for generations.

**Northern Wildwood:** The Ryunimir Forest in the northwest is the domain of the Uhionai—older, stranger, with trees that were once orcs and orcs that will become trees. To the northeast, the lake-dotted hills of Grieb territory stretch toward Cykravikus Lake, where the aquatic Griebi fish their cold waters and answer to their hag queen.

**Eastern Edge:** Where the forest thins into the Steppe of Aziirn, the Shazuihni boar riders make their camps. They're not truly a forest people—they're raiders who use the forest as cover for their endless attacks on everyone else.

#### The Six States

The Wildwood is divided among six major orc nations:

| State | Territory | Character |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Hedroscobb** | Southern Wildwood | Largest, most aggressive; master smiths who forge corrosive algae-iron armor |
| **Glivornax** | Northwestern Wildwood | Most diplomatically sophisticated; fights for healing water access |
| **Tarn** | North-central, on the Tolkarsus | Spirit warriors; controls Plenjorn Swamp and the healing waters |
| **Uhionai** | Far northwest, Ryunimir Forest | Tree-bonded orcs who become trees when they die and can be reborn |
| **Grieb** | Northeastern lakes | Aquatic orcs ruled by a hag queen; universally avoided |
| **Shazuihn** | Eastern forest edge | Boar-riding raiders who attack everything that moves |

#### The Conflict Web

The six states have warred among themselves for as long as anyone remembers. The current conflicts:

**Hedroscobb vs. Glivornax:** The War of the Marshes. The Hedroscobbi need specific swamp algae to forge their signature armor—and the richest beds lie in Yugurbas Dyos, on the border with Glivornax. The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of all the Tolkarsus watershed. This isn't a border skirmish; it's existential for both sides.

**Hedroscobb vs. Shazuihn:** The Eternal Raid. The Shazuihni attack from the east constantly—not for territory, but for plunder, slaves, and glory. The Hedroscobbi bleed for it year after year.

**Shazuihn vs. Tarn:** The boar riders also raid Tarn's river territory. The Tarni spirit warriors are hard to kill quickly, which makes raids costly, but the Shazuihni keep coming.

**Glivornax vs. Tarn:** The Water War. Tarn controls Plenjorn Swamp and its miraculous healing waters; Glivornax fights for access. The Tarni attack with spirit weapons that damage the soul itself; the Glivornaxi use terrain knowledge and defensive formations. Neither can defeat the other outright.

**Uhionai vs. Tarn:** Occasional border conflicts where the Ryunimir Forest meets Tarni territory. Neither side truly wants this war—the Uhionai need their sacred groves, and Tarn's focus is on the river—but young warriors prove themselves and sometimes it escalates.

**Grieb vs. Nobody:** The Griebi's lake territory is valuable, but fighting aquatic orcs is a nightmare—needle teeth, underwater ambushes, enemies who vanish into the depths and wait for days. The casualties aren't worth it. Everyone learned that lesson generations ago.

#### The Orc Moot

Despite constant warfare, the six states maintain a loose confederation through the Orc Moot—irregular gatherings where grievances are aired, truces negotiated, and occasionally, collective threats addressed. The Moot has no binding authority; attendance is voluntary and agreements last only as long as they're convenient.

Still, the Moot represents the possibility of unity. If the orcs ever stopped fighting each other—if someone ever united the six states—their combined strength would overwhelm Tarkhon's northern defenses. The Vogenfeld dwarves watch for any sign of this nightmare scenario.

#### Why It Matters

The Wildwood is a powder keg. The constant orc warfare has protected Tarkhon for centuries, but:

- The healing waters of Plenjorn Swamp are becoming known. Outsiders will come seeking them.
- Something is stirring in the north. Vogenfeld patrols report unusual gatherings, paused conflicts, signs that someone may be attempting to unite the tribes.
- The hag queen of Grieb has ruled for centuries. What does she want? What is she waiting for?
- The dragon Symonair has claimed his lake for millennia. His relationship with the orcs is unclear, but he's watching.

For now, the Wildwood remains a land of perpetual war—brutal, isolated, and dangerous to outsiders. But the balance could shift at any time.

### Woods of Systoril

Tags: forest, geography

A dense, dark coastal forest east of Melodia and south of the Piktiniti Desert. The Woods of Systoril have a reputation for strangeness that keeps most travelers away—and those who enter often report experiences they struggle to explain.

#### The Name

Systoril was a Postronamas scholar-queen who, according to fragmentary records, refused to participate in the deep-crystal experiments that ultimately destroyed her civilization. When the madness began spreading through the resonance network, she gathered her followers—scholars, dissidents, those who had warned against pushing too deep—and led them into exile.

They entered this forest and were never seen again.

Whether Systoril died here, founded a hidden civilization, or became something else entirely is unknown. But the forest bears her name, and has for millennia.

#### The Watchfulness

The Woods of Systoril feel *aware*.

Not hostile—travelers who enter with benign intentions report no direct threats. But watched. Observed. The sensation of attention following you through the trees is constant and unmistakable. The forest seems to notice you, to consider you, to make decisions about whether you belong.

Paths through the woods shift—not dramatically, not while you're watching, but a trail that led east yesterday may curve south today. Landmarks relocate. Travelers find themselves guided: toward the coast if they're heading that direction, away from certain clearings, toward or away from the forest's heart depending on something no outsider has identified.

Some say the forest is testing visitors. Others say it's protecting something. A few claim Systoril herself—or what she became—is the intelligence behind the watchfulness.

#### What's Inside

No one knows for certain.

The forest's heart has never been mapped. Expeditions that go too deep either turn back (finding themselves inexplicably returned to the forest's edge) or don't return at all. The few who claim to have reached the interior describe impossible things: towers made of living wood, clearings lit by no visible source, figures in the distance who vanish when approached.

Perhaps there is a hidden civilization here—Systoril's descendants, masters of subtle forest magic who simply don't want to be found. Perhaps Systoril herself remains in some form, her consciousness distributed through the trees like the Postronamas crystal-network but organic, gentle, protective. Perhaps the forest has simply become strange through isolation and time, and the "watchfulness" is travelers' imaginations filling in patterns.

The truth remains a mystery—and the Woods of Systoril seem content to keep it that way.

#### The Edges

At its borders, the Woods of Systoril are ordinary enough. The trees are dense, the undergrowth thick, the wildlife abundant. Hunters and foragers from coastal communities work the edges, careful not to go too deep. They've learned the signs that suggest the forest wants them to leave: paths that loop back on themselves, the feeling of being observed intensifying, animals going silent.

Those who heed the warnings find the forest cooperative. Those who don't... usually emerge eventually, days later, miles from where they expected, with gaps in their memory and no desire to return.

#### Rumors

The coastal villages near the Woods of Systoril trade in stories:

- That on certain nights, lights can be seen deep within the forest, moving in patterns too regular to be natural.
- That the forest has never been successfully burned—fires set at its edge simply go out.
- That travelers who enter with violent intentions are found days later, alive but mind-blank, unable to remember their own names.
- That occasionally, someone emerges from the deep woods carrying gifts—rare herbs, worked artifacts of unknown make, books in no known language—with no memory of who gave them these things.

Whether any of these stories are true, the locals believe them. And they treat the Woods of Systoril with careful respect.

### Yugurbas Dyos

Tags: geography, swamp, contested

The bloody ground between Hedroscobb and Glivornax—a transitional marsh where the southern Wildwood gives way to the Tolkarsus watershed. The Hedroscobbi call it the Algae Fields. The Glivornaxi call it Sacred Waters. Both call it theirs, and both have been dying over it for a century.

#### Geography

Yugurbas Dyos occupies roughly fifty miles of borderland between the two orc states. It's not quite swamp, not quite forest—a soggy transitional zone where streams from the higher ground spread into marshes, meadows flood seasonally, and thick beds of the distinctive blue-green algae that the Hedroscobbi prize grow in the still waters.

**The Algae Beds:** The real prize. These shallow pools and slow streams host the specific algae species that, when properly treated and combined with iron, creates the Hedroscobbi's signature corrosive armor. The algae grows elsewhere in the Tolkarsus watershed, but nowhere as abundantly as here.

**The Wet Meadows:** Seasonal flooding creates grasslands that are sometimes passable, sometimes waist-deep in water. Armies have bogged down here; raiders have vanished without trace. Knowing when and where to move is everything.

**The Drowned Forest:** Ancient trees killed by rising water levels stand skeletal and gray throughout the region. They provide cover, landmarks, and firewood—but they also create a haunting, maze-like terrain where it's easy to get lost.

#### Why It Matters

The War of the Marshes has been fought over Yugurbas Dyos for over a century. The stakes:

**For Hedroscobb:** The algae is essential. Without it, they can't produce their armor. Without their armor, they're just another orc state—large, but not unstoppable. The forges need a constant supply, and Yugurbas Dyos has the richest beds outside Glivornax proper.

**For Glivornax:** The Glivornaxi see themselves as guardians of the entire Tolkarsus watershed. Yugurbas Dyos is part of that system—its waters feed into the greater network, and what happens here affects everything downstream. Beyond that, allowing Hedroscobb to strip-mine the algae would be a betrayal of everything they stand for.

**For Everyone Else:** The war keeps both states focused on each other instead of expanding. Tarn appreciates this. Vogenfeld appreciates this more. If either side won decisively, the balance of power in the Wildwood would shift dramatically.

#### The Seasonal Conflict

Fighting in Yugurbas Dyos follows the algae bloom cycle:

**Dry Season (Summer):** The marshes recede, the algae beds are exposed, and this is when the Hedroscobbi send their Gatherer expeditions. Armed parties move in to harvest as much algae as they can before the Glivornaxi respond.

**Patrol Season (Spring/Fall):** Both sides maintain patrols. Skirmishes are common. Small parties clash, retreat, and clash again. Neither side commits fully because the terrain is too dangerous for major operations.

**Flood Season (Winter):** The marshes become impassable. Fighting stops. Both sides regroup and prepare for the next year's harvest.

**The Harvest War:** Every summer, the same pattern repeats. Hedroscobbi Gatherers enter the marshes. Glivornaxi patrols intercept them. People die. The Hedroscobbi take what algae they can; the Glivornaxi prevent what harvesting they can. Neither side ever wins completely.

#### The Terrain

Moving through Yugurbas Dyos requires:
- Knowledge of the water levels (which change constantly)
- Understanding of the solid paths (which aren't always obvious)
- Ability to navigate by the drowned trees (which all look similar)
- Acceptance that you will get wet, cold, and lost

**The Glivornaxi Advantage:** They know this terrain. They've mapped the paths, memorized the water patterns, and trained to fight in waist-deep muck. On their ground, they're nearly unbeatable.

**The Hedroscobbi Adaptation:** The Gatherers are lighter-armored than regular Hedroscobbi forces—they have to be. They move fast, hit specific algae beds, and try to extract before the patrols arrive. It's more like raiding than conventional warfare.

#### Notable Features

**The Stone Markers:** Ancient boundary stones from before the current conflict, placed by someone—no one remembers who. Both sides claim they mark the "true" border in their favor. The stones are worn, weathered, and covered in moss.

**The Bleeding Pool:** A large algae bed that turns red during certain seasons. The Glivornaxi say this is sacred—the waters remember those who died defending them. The Hedroscobbi say it's just a different algae species that happens to be useless for smithing.

**The Ghost Village:** Ruins of a settlement that existed before the war. Both sides claim it was theirs originally. No one lives there now—it's too dangerous.

**The Watcher Trees:** Several massive drowned oaks that serve as observation posts. Whoever holds them can see movement across miles of marsh. Control shifts constantly.

#### What Players Might Find

Yugurbas Dyos is dangerous but offers opportunities:

- **Algae samples** worth a fortune to the right buyers (or to Hedroscobb directly)
- **Lost equipment** from decades of fighting—weapons, armor, supplies
- **The truth** about the ancient boundary stones and who placed them
- **Neutral ground** where negotiations might happen (theoretically)
- **Passage** between Hedroscobb and Glivornax territory (if you're willing to risk it)

#### Adventure Hooks

- Guide a Hedroscobbi Gatherer expedition through Glivornaxi patrols
- Help Glivornaxi defenders stop an unusually large Hedroscobbi incursion
- Investigate why the algae yields are declining—is someone poisoning the beds?
- Find and recover the body of a diplomat who disappeared in the marshes
- Discover what the ancient stone markers actually mean
- Broker a ceasefire (probably impossible, but someone's paying you to try)

## Frostmarch Peninsula

### Geography

The Frostmarch Peninsula is a long landmass that juts eastward from the Celedrim Plains, forming the mainland anchor of the Northern Isles archipelago. It serves as a layered transition between the continental interior and the fragmented island chains of the Ocean of Azeros.

#### Position and Shape

- **West**: Connects to the Celedrim Plains; the two regions are layered, with the plains slanting down and the peninsula extending beneath and eastward
- **East**: Reaches across toward the Northern Isles, forming the "underneath" section of the archipelago
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros and the scattered islands of the Northern Isles
- **South**: Faces the open waters of the Azeros

The peninsula and Celedrim Plains create a stepped geography—the plains occupying the upper layer, with Frostmarch extending as a lower shelf beneath them, reaching eastward into the island chains.

#### Nearby Features

- **Plutochranes Forest**: Lies to the west of the peninsula, north of the Kharvorn sub-range Myorna
- **Northern Isles**: The peninsula transitions into this archipelago as the land fragments into islands

#### Notable Subregions

The Frostmarch Peninsula contains a remarkable diversity of terrain given its northern latitude—from dense ancient forests to open tundra to volcanic anomalies.

##### Western Forests

The western half of the peninsula is dominated by massive forests that provide some shelter from the arctic winds:

- **Plutachranes**: The largest forest on the peninsula, covering much of the northwest. Ancient conifers and hardy deciduous trees, crossed by the Mirethion River. Home to scattered Tikhaya settlements and Wytrolape communities.
- **Buleeri T'han**: A dense forest south of Plutachranes, known for its unusual blue-tinged bark on the dominant tree species.
- **Gysheyani**: Eastern forest region, transitioning toward the more open terrain of central Frostmarch.

##### Central Regions

- **Knulak**: A forest-and-lake region in the heart of the peninsula, centered on the Knulak Lakes—a cluster of interconnected bodies of water fed by glacial melt.
- **Nevadi**: A smaller forest south of Knulak, bordering the Qynxlis Mountains.

##### Eastern Regions

- **Danak**: The northwestern reaches, home to scattered Danaki minotaur villages. A region of rolling highlands and sparse forest, perpetually at war with Atyeska to the east.
- **Atyeska**: The northeastern tip, dominated by Enti orc tribes. Dozens of villages along Wolfhawk Bay and the Geshwin Passage.
- **Sunglint**: Northern coastal forest overlooking Startip Bay and the approaches to the Northern Isles.

##### Southern Regions

- **Pyceuri Tuni**: Open tundra plains in the south-central peninsula.
- **Twilight Forest**: The supernaturally darkened forest in the southeast, home to the Spindral (Quill Elves) and the dragon Ural of the Third Moon.
- **Moyginder Forest**: Northern edge of the southern forests, transitioning toward the darkness of the Twilight Forest.

#### Bodies of Water

The peninsula is ringed by significant bodies of water:

- **Bay of Teeth**: Northwestern bay, named for the jagged rocks that line its shores
- **Barlomew Inlet**: Eastern inlet separating the main peninsula from the northeastern extension
- **Geshwin Passage**: The strait between Frostmarch and the Northern Isles, rich fishing waters for the Enti
- **Bay of Serpents**: Southern bay near the Twilight Forest
- **Denrik Sea**: Southern waters, beneath which lie the Darkstone Caves
- **Wavecrash Sound**: Southeastern waters off Kyorda

#### Climate

The Frostmarch represents the edge of the arctic world. The northern part remains white and snowy year-round, while the southern edges show signs of brown, thawing terrain in warmer seasons. Ice gives way to earth here, but only barely.

### Political Climate

The Frostmarch is not a unified political entity but rather a collection of independent states, tribal territories, and lawless wilderness:

- **Kyorda**: The most organized state, home to Tikhaya humans and Wytrolape giant apes, centered on the capital Xandur.
- **Atyeska**: Enti orc tribal confederation along the eastern coast.
- **Danak**: Danaki minotaur territories in the northwest, perpetually at war with Atyeska.
- **Shykasas**: The anomalous Alekroin kingdom in the south, a jungle somehow thriving in arctic conditions.
- **Spindral Warrens**: The underground realm of the quill elves beneath the Twilight Forest, not a surface nation but a power nonetheless.

### What Makes It Interesting

The Frostmarch is a land of contrasts and ancient conflicts. The Enti-Danaki war has raged for generations with no end in sight. The Twilight Forest's supernatural darkness hides both the secretive Spindral and the terrifying dragon Ural. The Wytrolape's moon-curse creates periodic chaos during Hollownight. And in the south, the Alekroin maintain a jungle kingdom that defies all natural law.

### What Will Go Wrong

- The Enti-Danaki war escalates to the point where one side is annihilated—and the victor looks for new targets
- Ural of the Third Moon stirs from its long quiescence
- The Wytrolape suffer a particularly bad Hollownight, with casualties among their Tikhaya neighbors
- Something emerges from the Darkstone Caves beneath the Denrik Sea
- The Shykasas jungle anomaly begins expanding—or collapsing

### Knulak

Tags: forest, lakes

Knulak is a forest-and-lake region in the north-central Frostmarch Peninsula, named for the cluster of interconnected lakes at its center. Bordered by Barlomew Inlet to the east and the vast Plutachranes forest to the west, Knulak occupies a relatively peaceful stretch of the peninsula—far from the conflicts that plague other regions.

#### The Knulak Lakes

The Knulak Lakes are a cluster of interconnected bodies of water fed by glacial melt from the Qynxis Mountains to the south. The lakes remain unfrozen for much of the year, warmed by geothermal springs that bubble up from below. This creates a microclimate around the lakes where the forest grows thicker and the winters are marginally more survivable.

The lakes are rich with fish—a crucial food source for the scattered communities of the region. Fishing rights are loosely respected among the various families and small clans who live here.

#### The Forest

The Knulak forest is primarily coniferous—hardy pines and firs that can survive the long winters. The trees here are younger than those in Plutachranes to the west, suggesting the region was cleared at some point in the past and has since regrown. What cleared it, and when, is not recorded in any surviving history.

Wildlife is abundant: deer, elk, wolves, and bears make their homes here. The forest supports small, self-sufficient communities who have little contact with the larger powers of the peninsula.

#### Settlements

Knulak has no major cities or organized government—just scattered communities:

- Fishing villages clustered around the lakes
- Hunting camps used seasonally
- Isolated homesteads of families who prefer solitude

The people here are largely independent, owing allegiance to no state. They trade occasionally with travelers passing through, but mostly keep to themselves.

#### The Xixes River

The Xixes River flows south from the Knulak Lakes toward the Qynxis Mountains. It provides a natural highway through the forest, and small boats can navigate much of its length during the warmer months. The river freezes solid in deep winter, becoming a different kind of highway—a path for sleds and travelers on foot.

### Twilight Forest

Tags: forest, spindral, elves, darkness

A vast forest shrouded in supernatural darkness in the southeastern reaches of the Frostmarch Peninsula. The Twilight Forest is one of the most dangerous and forbidding places in all of Clueanda—a realm where light itself has been cursed.

#### Geography

The Twilight Forest occupies the southern portion of the Frostmarch Peninsula, stretching across the southeastern end where the land begins its final descent toward the frigid waters. Unlike the snow-blanketed terrain of northern Frostmarch, the forest floor here is carpeted in black moss and fungal growth that thrives in the perpetual gloom.

The trees themselves are ancient—gnarled pines and twisted oaks that have adapted to the darkness over millennia. Their bark is nearly black, and they grow in dense, suffocating thickets that block what little light manages to penetrate the magical shroud above.

#### The Eternal Twilight

The entire forest is enchanted with an oppressive darkness that defies natural law:

- **Light Suppression**: Regular light sources produce only one-quarter their normal illumination. A torch that should light a 40-foot radius barely reaches 10 feet.
- **Void-Deep Dark**: The darkness is too profound for darkvision to penetrate—creatures relying on it see nothing but impenetrable black.
- **Starless Sky**: No stars are visible above the forest, even on the clearest nights. The sky appears as a featureless void.
- **Perpetual Dusk**: At its brightest—high noon on a cloudless day—the forest reaches only dim-light conditions.

The source of this curse is unknown, though some scholars believe it may be connected to Ural of the Third Moon's presence, while others claim the dragon was drawn here *because* of the existing darkness.

#### The Spindral

The Twilight Forest is home to the Spindral—the Quill Elves who fled underground generations ago to escape the dragon Ural of the Third Moon. Their ancestors sought refuge in the deep cavern systems beneath the forest floor, and over time they became creatures of shadow themselves.

The Spindral have fully adapted to life in perpetual darkness. Their midnight-black quills absorb what little light exists, and they have developed echolocation and Void-touched senses that function where eyes cannot. They venture to the surface only to hunt the forest's monstrous denizens and to maintain watch for signs of their ancient draconic enemy.

Spindral settlements exist entirely underground in carved warrens that honeycomb the bedrock beneath the forest. These communities are fiercely territorial—other underground races have learned that trespassing into Spindral territory is suicide.

#### Monsters of the Dark

The Twilight Forest teems with creatures that have evolved—or been twisted—to thrive in magical darkness:

- Shadow-stalkers that move unseen even by those with supernatural sight
- Eyeless predators that hunt by sound and tremor
- Void-touched beasts bleeding darkness from open wounds
- Things that were once other creatures before the dark changed them

The Spindral are among the few beings capable of surviving here, and even they travel in groups and maintain constant vigilance.

#### Ural of the Third Moon

The dragon Ural of the Third Moon dwells somewhere in or near the Twilight Forest, though its exact lair remains unknown. This creature of darkness drove the Spindral ancestors underground and continues to cast its shadow over the region. The Spindral believe Ural will one day return in force, and they prepare endlessly for that reckoning.

See [Ural of the Third Moon](Ural%20of%20the%20Third%20Moon.md) for more information.

### Ural of the Third Moon

Tags: dragon, frostmarch, twilight forest

A dragon of legendary menace that haunts the Twilight Forest in southeastern Frostmarch Peninsula. Ural is a creature of darkness and shadow, and its presence has shaped the history of this region for centuries.

#### The Spindral Exodus

Generations ago, when the ancestors of the Spindral still lived above ground in the Twilight Forest, Ural descended upon them with devastating fury. Unable to face the dragon's power in open battle, the elves fled underground, abandoning their surface settlements and carving out a new existence in the caverns beneath the forest floor.

The Spindral have never forgiven this displacement. They maintain an eternal vigil, watching for signs of Ural's movements, preparing for the day when they might have a chance at vengeance—or when the dragon might seek to finish what it started.

#### Nature and Appearance

Little is confirmed about Ural's true form. The darkness of the Twilight Forest and the dragon's apparent mastery of shadow make reliable accounts scarce. What survivors describe:

- Scales that seem to drink in light rather than reflect it
- Eyes that glow with a cold, moonlike luminescence
- An ability to move through the darkness as if it were water

The epithet "of the Third Moon" remains unexplained. Some scholars theorize it refers to an ancient calendar, a cosmic alignment, or perhaps something the dragon consumed or destroyed long ago.

#### Current Status

Ural's exact lair and current activities are unknown. The dragon has not been seen in force for decades, though the Spindral report periodic signs of its presence—strange darkness even by Twilight Forest standards, the distant sound of massive wings, prey animals found drained of something more than blood.

Whether Ural sleeps, schemes, or simply waits is a question that keeps the Spindral ever-watchful.

## Celedrim Plains

### Geography

The Celedrim Plains are a vast frozen steppe occupying the northeastern interior of Clueanda, positioned north of the Kharvorn Mountains and stretching eastward toward the Northern Isles. This is among the most desolate regions of the known world—an endless expanse of wind-scoured snow and ice.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Ocean of Azeros; mountains dot the coastline
- **South**: The Kharvorn Mountains form the southern boundary, their diagonal line running from northwest to southeast
- **West**: Transitions into the Northlands where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains meet
- **East**: Extends to the Ocean of Azeros and transitions into the Frostmarch Peninsula

#### Terrain

The plains are distinctly flat and open—frozen steppe rather than glaciated terrain. Endless white expanses stretch to every horizon, broken only by the occasional rocky outcrop or wind-carved snow drift. Nothing stands to break the howling winds that sweep across the expanse.

#### Notable Forests

Two significant forests cling to the southwestern margins of the plains, where they transition toward the Kharvorn Mountains:

- **Winterwood Forest**: Located in the southwestern portion of the plains, directly north of Argysis (one of the Kharvorn sub-ranges)
- **Plutochranes Forest**: Positioned north of Myorna (another Kharvorn sub-range), south of the main plains expanse, and west of the Frostmarch Peninsula

### Dreamplains

Tags: plains, tundra

The Dreamplains occupy the northwestern reaches of the Celedrim Plains, a vast expanse of frozen steppe notable for its strange atmosphere and the cluster of impact craters that scar its surface. The name comes from the unsettling quality of travel here—distances seem wrong, the horizon plays tricks, and travelers report dreams of vivid intensity during any sleep taken on the plains.

#### Character

The Dreamplains are flatter and more featureless than the rest of the Celedrim Plains, which is saying something. The snow here has a peculiar blue-white quality, and sounds carry strangely—sometimes voices from miles away arrive as whispers, while nearby speech vanishes into silence. The Neth who pass through this region say the boundary between the Material Plane and Celestia grows thin here, though not as dramatically as at Top of the World. The spirits of the dead sometimes wander the Dreamplains, visible as faint shapes at the edge of vision, before completing their journey to the other side.

#### The Impact Craters

Three massive craters punctuate the Dreamplains, remnants of an ancient cataclysm when objects fell from the sky in the distant past. Whether these were meteors, fragments of the Astral Plane, or something else entirely remains debated by scholars.

##### Predatak

The largest of the three craters, Predatak holds a deep lake of startlingly blue water that never freezes despite the temperatures. The crater walls rise steeply around the lake, creating a natural amphitheater. Something lives in the depths—the Zwaeron refuse to camp within sight of Predatak, and their stories speak of shapes moving beneath the surface on moonless nights.

The lake water has unusual properties. Those who drink it report their dreams becoming prophetic for several nights afterward—though the visions are often symbolic and difficult to interpret. Mages who study divination sometimes make pilgrimages here, though the journey is perilous.

##### Nisk

The smallest crater, Nisk, is dry—its bowl filled with frost-shattered stone rather than water. The crater floor is littered with fragments of a dark metalite that doesn't match any known ore. Some of these fragments are warm to the touch regardless of temperature, and a few have been recovered and traded south where artificers pay handsomely for them.

The Neth say Nisk is where a star fell and died. They leave offerings at the crater's rim—small carvings, braided grass, tokens of remembrance—though they won't explain who or what they're honoring.

##### Emtus

Emtus is the strangest of the three. The crater exists, unmistakably, but something about it resists perception. Travelers who approach find themselves walking past it, around it, their attention sliding away. Mapping expeditions have tried to chart its interior and returned with contradictory results—some claiming it's shallow and empty, others insisting it contains ruins, still others unable to remember reaching it at all.

Whatever fell at Emtus didn't just impact the ground. It may have impacted reality itself.

#### Hills of the Lost

South of the craters, where the Dreamplains begin transitioning toward the Winterwood, a range of low hills breaks the flatness. The Hills of the Lost earned their name honestly—travelers who enter them often emerge days later, miles from where they expected, with hazy memories of the intervening time.

The hills are not inherently malevolent, but something about their geography defies normal navigation. Compasses spin, the sun seems to move wrong, and familiar landmarks rearrange themselves. The Zwaeron have mapped safe paths through, but these paths change with the seasons, and even experienced guides sometimes lose their way.

Those who spend too long lost in the hills sometimes return... changed. Quieter. Seeing things others can't. The Neth call them "touched by the between" and treat them with a mixture of reverence and wariness.

#### Wolfspine

At the southern edge of the Dreamplains, the Wolfspine rises—a small mountain range that marks the boundary between the open steppe and the forested regions to the south. The peaks are jagged and bare, resembling (as the name suggests) the spine of some enormous creature. The Zwaeron use the Wolfspine as a landmark and waystation, and several semi-permanent camps exist in the sheltered valleys between peaks.

Dire wolves den in the Wolfspine in unusual numbers, which is why the Zwaeron favor it—this is where they find and bond with new companions when their current mounts die. The wolves here are larger and fiercer than those elsewhere, and some Zwaeron believe the strange energies of the Dreamplains have affected them over generations.

### Ennros Lake

Tags: lake

Filled with Rusalka. Also home to the Sennites.

#### Promise of Mythras

A massive stone object, permanently trapping the Sennites within Ennros Lake. Named after Mythras, the great dwarven family and king of Argysis before it fell to the dragon. When they got revenge, they placed a powerful enchantment on lake, barring the Sennites from ever leaving the lake. The Sennites would pay very handsomely for its removal.

On it is engraved, "A promise, once broken, can be no better reforged than a sword of diamond".

If a sword of diamond is brought to the site and broken, the enchantment is lifted.

Diamonds necessary to make an entire sword can only be found deep underground (verrrry deep) where it would be quite sketchy to go.

### Jotunhills

Tags: mountains, highlands

The Jotunhills are a range of rolling highlands southwest of Konai Mora, home to the Jotun—smaller frost giants with cold attunement and remarkable regenerative abilities. The Jotun are cunning, carnivorous, and view frozen humans as both food and status symbols.

#### The Giants

Jotun stand roughly twelve to fourteen feet tall—smaller than their cousins elsewhere in Alaria but no less dangerous. Their cold attunement allows them to survive and even thrive in temperatures that would kill most creatures, and they regenerate from wounds with disturbing speed as long as they remain in freezing conditions. Only fire or removal from cold slows their healing.

The Jotun love the taste of flesh, particularly human flesh. They will hoard frozen humans as proof of their wealth, displaying their larders to rivals as a show of status. A Jotun patriarch's prestige is measured partly in the quality and quantity of his frozen collection—older specimens, particularly those with fine clothing or obvious signs of former status, are valued more highly than common travelers.

Despite their brutish appearance, Jotun are highly cunning. They set ambushes, coordinate hunting parties, and understand enough about human behavior to predict trade routes and migration patterns. However, they are terrible communicators with outsiders—their language is guttural and complex, and they have little patience for negotiation. Similar to trolls in this regard, though far more intelligent.

#### Clan Structure

The Jotunhills are not a unified territory but rather a collection of clan holdings, each dominated by a patriarch or matriarch who maintains their position through strength, cunning, and accumulated wealth (measured in frozen corpses). The clans raid each other as readily as they raid outsiders, and Jotun politics revolves around blood feuds, marriage alliances, and the endless competition for prestige.

Clan boundaries shift constantly as patriarchs rise and fall. A successful raid that captures several valuable humans can elevate a minor clan to prominence overnight; a disastrous defeat can see a once-powerful clan reduced to scavengers on the margins.

#### Relations with Neighbors

The Winterwood's northern edge provides some barrier between the Jotunhills and the lands to the south—the giants do not enter the deep forest, fearing whatever ancient things dwell beneath the canopy. But Jotun hunting parties still sweep around the forest's edges, and the Zwaeron have learned which routes are safer than others.

Those taken alive are kept frozen in Jotun larders until needed—a fate the Neth consider worse than death. The giants prefer their meat preserved; a human might be kept frozen for years before finally being thawed and consumed. Some captives have been rescued after months of frozen storage, their minds shattered by the experience of conscious preservation.

#### Shamayok Hills

The eastern reaches of the Jotunhills, overlooking Ennros Lake and the approaches to Sennos, are called the Shamayok Hills. This region is claimed by a particularly aggressive clan whose hunting parties regularly descend toward the lake settlements, making the eastern trade routes treacherous. The Sennosi have fortified their northern approaches specifically because of Shamayok raids, and caravans traveling to or from the lake city hire guards who know the giants' patterns.

Some Shamayok Jotun have developed a taste for the lake dwarves' preserved fish—a dietary quirk that other clans find distasteful but that has made Shamayok raiders marginally more interested in cargo than captives. Marginally.

### Konai Mora

#### Kona Morai

A massive, white expanse—freezing cold, miserable, and incredibly dangerous.

Home to Mythandrulve, similar to the chulpe, but all white, and similar to wolves. No heirarchy of control like with chulpe—just a pack. All of them are roughly same size—smaller than Terragones, but bigger than chulpe. Huge paws, can run on top of the snow.

Think "vampire wolf gnolls" for vibe.

#### Blistering Mountains

A mountain range north of Konai Mora, marking the northern boundary of the icy tundra.

##### Solhalven

A city-state north of the Blistering Mountains, home to the valkyries. This remote settlement serves as the guardians of one of the most extraordinary structures in all of Alaria.

###### Starreach

A tower that extends all the way from the ground to the Astral plane itself. The valkyries of Solhalven have been cursed to guard Starreach from the angels Sarakiel and Xaphkiel, and they are bound to permit only certain chosen individuals to ascend the tower. The curse has transformed what might have been an honor into an eternal duty, and the valkyries stand watch over this bridge between worlds, never knowing rest.

#### Yukum's Wall

Although not actually a wall, this mountain range is rife with giants, wyverns, snow spirits, and an eternal blizzard, making passing through so treacherous that it has almost never been done. Located on the east side of Konai Mora (basin plains surrounded by mountains in northeast all the way to southwest). Yukum's Wall is coastal mountains, separating Celedrim Plains from the Northern Isles. To its north are the Blistering Mountains (contiguous with Yukum's Wall, volcanoes).

##### Forbidden Coast

The eastern shore of Konai Mora, where Yukum's Wall meets the Ocean of Azuros, is known as the Forbidden Coast. The name is not metaphorical—the Valkyries of Solhalven have declared this stretch of coastline off-limits to all travelers, and they enforce the prohibition with lethal force.

The reasons for this restriction are not publicly discussed. Some believe the coast hides an entrance to something the Valkyries guard besides Starreach. Others suggest that things emerge from the water here—things connected to whatever dwells in the depths of the frozen ocean. The Mythandrulve avoid the Forbidden Coast as well, which suggests the prohibition predates the Valkyries' arrival.

#### Gümloskos

The northwestern peninsula of Konai Mora, jutting into the Ocean of Azuros north of Solhalven. Gümloskos is mountainous and wind-scoured, its peaks lower than the Blistering Mountains to the south but no less treacherous. This is the domain of Zosuun, the albino ice-fire dragon who has claimed the region since before recorded history.

The Valkyries maintain a careful neutrality with Zosuun. The dragon's hunting grounds overlap with their patrol routes, but neither party seems interested in conflict. Travelers seeking passage through Gümloskos are advised to move quickly and avoid camping in the open—Zosuun has been known to steal memories from those who linger in his territory.

#### Shargon

The southern reaches of Konai Mora, where the frozen basin begins climbing toward the mountain ranges that ring the region. Shargon is marginally more hospitable than the central expanse—rocky outcrops provide some shelter from the wind, and the Mythandrulve rarely hunt this far from their preferred terrain.

Small bands of Neth make seasonal camps in Shargon, fishing the ice-locked lakes and hunting the hardier game that survives on the fringes. These camps are temporary—the Neth know better than to claim permanent territory in Konai Mora—but they've used the same sites for generations, leaving behind stone circles and cairns that mark safe camping spots.

#### Bitterlands

South of Shargon, the terrain rises into a desolate expanse of rocky highlands, ice fields, and howling wind—the Bitterlands. This wasteland stretches between the frozen Konai Mora basin to the north and the Plutachranes forest to the south, with the Gorthe Hills marking its eastern edge.

The name is earned. Nothing grows here; nothing shelters here; nothing survives here for long except things adapted to the absolute worst conditions Alaria can offer. The Mythandrulve rarely venture this far south—their hunting grounds are the frozen basin proper—and the Jotun of the western hills have no reason to cross this barren stretch. The Bitterlands are dangerous not because of what hunts here, but because of the absolute emptiness. Travelers caught in the open have nothing: no shelter, no fuel, no landmarks, just wind and exposure.

Neth traders occasionally cross the Bitterlands when traveling between the western settlements near Sennos and the eastern coast at Soya Grei, but they do so quickly and in groups, following cairn-marked routes their ancestors established generations ago.

#### Soya Grei

East of the Bitterlands, where the mountains curve toward the coast, lies Soya Grei—a peninsula of rocky highlands overlooking Soothesong Sound. The name means "grey fortress" in an old Neth dialect, though no fortress stands there now. If one ever did, it has been scoured away by the elements.

Soya Grei is notable for the unusual acoustic properties of its cliffs. The wind through the rock formations produces sounds that the Neth say are the voices of the dead singing to each other across the water. Soothesong Sound earned its name from these cliff-songs, which can be heard for miles on quiet nights.

#### Jotunhills

Southwest of Konai Mora, the mountains give way to a range of rolling highlands home to the Jotun—smaller frost giants with cold attunement and remarkable regenerative abilities. The Jotun are cunning, carnivorous, and view frozen humans as both food and status symbols.

The Jotunhills are not a unified territory but rather a collection of clan holdings, each dominated by a patriarch or matriarch who maintains their position through a combination of strength, cunning, and accumulated wealth (measured in frozen corpses). The clans raid each other as readily as they raid outsiders, and the politics of Jotun society—such as it is—revolves around blood feuds, marriage alliances, and the endless competition for prestige.

Human settlements give the Jotunhills a wide berth. The Winterwood's northern edge provides some barrier, and the Zwaeron have learned which routes are safer than others, but Jotun raiding parties still occasionally sweep south to carry off prisoners. Those taken alive are kept frozen in the Jotun larders until needed—a fate the Neth consider worse than death.

### Pelmar Mountains

Tags: mountains

The Pelmar Mountains form the northeastern spur of the greater Kharvorn range, rising where the Celedrim Plains give way to the frozen approaches of the Nysanna Range. They serve as a transitional zone between the windswept grasslands to the south and the true arctic to the north—still bitterly cold, but not yet the killing ground of the higher peaks.

#### Character

The Pelmars are lower and more weathered than either the Kharvorn proper or the Nysanna Range, their peaks rounded by millennia of wind and ice. Snow covers them year-round, but the passes remain navigable for most of the year—making them one of the few routes between the Celedrim Plains and the Northlands proper.

The mountains are honeycombed with caves, some natural and some carved by unknown hands in ages past. The Zwaeron use these caves as winter shelters during their migrations, and several of the larger cave systems have become semi-permanent waystation camps where dire wolf riders can rest, trade, and share news from across the frozen north.

#### The Wind Gap

The primary pass through the Pelmar Mountains is known simply as the Wind Gap—a brutal corridor where the winds from the Northlands funnel through with enough force to knock a rider from their mount. Crossing the Gap requires timing; the Zwaeron know the wind patterns well enough to predict the brief lulls when passage is possible. Outsiders who attempt the crossing without local guidance often die, their bodies found frozen in the snow days or weeks later.

#### Strategic Position

The Pelmars mark the boundary between the civilized reaches of the Celedrim Plains and the lawless frozen north. No nation claims them, though several have tried. The mountains are too harsh to hold, too remote to garrison, and anyone foolish enough to build a fortress there would find themselves fighting the weather more than any enemy.

This makes the Pelmars a natural refuge for those who don't want to be found—exiles, criminals, hermits, and those fleeing wars or debts in the south. Small communities of outcasts eke out a living in the caves, trading with the Zwaeron when they pass through and otherwise keeping to themselves.

### The Watchtower

Tags: settlement, penal colony, mystery

A grim settlement clinging to a sheltered valley at the western edge of the Pelmar Mountains, visible from the approaches to Wind Gap. The Watchtower is not a place people choose to live—it is where the unwanted are sent to serve a sentence that never ends.

#### Origins

Centuries ago, the lowland kingdoms faced a problem: criminals too dangerous to imprison, too politically inconvenient to execute, and too useful to simply kill. The solution was the Pelmar Sentence—exile to the frozen edge of the world, where escape meant death by exposure and survival meant a lifetime of suffering.

The first prisoners arrived in chains, dumped at the foot of the mountains with minimal supplies and a single instruction: *Watch the caves. Report anything that moves.*

No one told them what they were watching for. The wardens who knew died without passing on their knowledge. But the prisoners watched anyway, because watching was all they had.

#### The Condemned

Over generations, the prisoners had children. The children had children. Now the Watchtower holds several thousand souls—the descendants of murderers, traitors, heretics, and political enemies—who have never known anywhere else. They call themselves the **Condemned**, and they have transformed their prison into something between a monastery and a fortress.

The Condemned do not consider themselves criminals. They are **Watchers**. Their ancestors' sins have been washed away by centuries of vigil. They are the guardians of something they do not understand, performing rituals they cannot explain, maintaining seals they cannot read.

#### What They Guard

The deep caves beneath the Watchtower are sealed. Opening them is the one absolute law—the only crime still punishable by death (exposure in the wastes, technically, but the result is the same).

The elders speak of fragments:

- **The Breach**: Something opened here, long ago. Not a door exactly—more like a wound in the world. The first wardens sealed it, but seals weaken.
- **The Sleeper**: Something came through before the seal closed. It did not die. It is not alive. It waits.
- **The Anchor**: The Watchtower sits on a point where the barrier between planes grows thin—a secondary stress point related to the weakness at Top of the World. If the Watchtower falls, the membrane tears further.
- **The Sky Going Wrong**: The oldest texts speak of a night when the aurora descended to the ground and *walked*. The Condemned still watch the sky during strong auroras, ready to sound the bells.

Whether any of this is true, whether the vigil serves any purpose, whether the Condemned are heroes or fools—no one knows. The caves remain sealed. The Watchers remain at their posts. And something in the deep has not moved for a very long time.

#### Daily Life

Life in the Watchtower is brutal, austere, and rigidly structured. Every adult takes shifts on the watch—four hours staring into the dark of the sealed cave entrances, four hours on the walls scanning the wastes, four hours of labor, four hours of rest. Children are raised communally and assigned to roles based on aptitude: Watchers, Keepers (who maintain the settlement), Seekers (who venture out for supplies), and Speakers (who preserve the fragmentary lore).

The Condemned trade with Zwaeron caravans for necessities they cannot produce—metal tools, certain medicines, news of the outside world. The Zwaeron find them unsettling but reliable. Payment is always exact. Promises are always kept. The Condemned have nothing else.

#### The Bells

Seven great bells hang in the central tower, each with a different tone and meaning. Most have not been rung in living memory. The Condemned still know the codes:

- One bell: Caravan approaching
- Two bells: Storm warning
- Three bells: Outsiders at the gate
- Four bells: Breach in the walls
- Five bells: Movement in the caves
- Six bells: The sky is wrong
- Seven bells: *Run*

No one knows what would warrant seven bells. The elders say that if seven bells ring, there is nowhere to run to.

#### Relations

The lowland kingdoms have largely forgotten the Watchtower exists. The original crime records were lost centuries ago. Occasionally a scholar or treasure-hunter arrives seeking entrance to the caves; they are turned away, forcibly if necessary.

The Zwaeron treat the Condemned with wary respect. They know the Watchtower guards something, even if they don't know what. Their oral histories include warnings about the place that predate the penal colony.

Hephake officially claims sovereignty over the region but has never attempted to enforce it. The dwarves are content to let the Condemned continue their vigil—better them than us.

#### For Adventurers

The Watchtower offers grim hospitality to travelers crossing Wind Gap—shelter, food, and guidance through the pass in exchange for labor or trade goods. The Condemned ask few questions about visitors' pasts. They understand the value of not asking.

But they will not open the caves. For any price. For any reason. And they watch very carefully to ensure visitors don't try.

### Winterwood

Tags: forest

The Winterwood is the largest forest in the Celedrim Plains region, a vast expanse of ancient conifers that clings to the northern foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains. It marks the transition between the frozen steppe and the mountain ranges to the south—a belt of dark evergreens that provides shelter, resources, and danger in roughly equal measure.

#### Character

The trees of the Winterwood are old. Some of the oldest are thousands of years old, their trunks wide enough that a dozen people linking arms couldn't encircle them. The forest floor is a maze of fallen giants, their rotting bodies hosting entire ecosystems of fungi, insects, and small mammals. Snow filters through the canopy, but the interior is sheltered from the worst of the plains' winds.

The forest is dark. The dense canopy blocks most light even in summer, and in winter the perpetual twilight can be disorienting. Sound carries strangely through the trees—what seems nearby may be miles away, and things that should be loud arrive as whispers.

#### Inhabitants

The Winterwood is not empty. Wolves, bears, elk, and countless smaller creatures make their homes here. But the forest also shelters things that prefer darkness—creatures that have lived in these woods since before the first humans crossed the frozen plains.

The Neth do not enter the deep Winterwood. Their ancestors learned that lesson long ago. The Zwaeron skirt its edges, hunting the game that ventures out onto the tree line, but they too avoid the interior. Whatever bargains humans have struck with the lords of the forest, they predate written history and are not discussed.

#### The Jotunhills Border

The northern edge of the Winterwood brushes against the Jotunhills, and here the forest takes on a different character. The trees grow stunted and twisted, bent by winds that carry the cold breath of the Jotun highlands. The giants do not enter the deep forest—something there even they fear—but they hunt along the tree line, and woe to any traveler caught between the Jotun hunting parties and whatever lurks beneath the ancient canopy.

#### Relation to Argysis

The southern edge of the Winterwood overlooks Argysis, one of the Kharvorn sub-ranges where the lake dwarves of Sennos once lived before their exile. The dwarves have no love for the forest—they remember, even after thousands of years, that the Winterwood offered no shelter during their flight northward. Some say the forest itself turned them away, its ancient intelligence recognizing that the dwarves had brought doom upon themselves and refusing to share in it.

### Withepest

Tags: plains, tundra

Withepest is a vast, featureless expanse of frozen steppe west of the Dreamplains and east of the Northlands transition. The name is old—older than any current language spoken on the plains—and its meaning has been lost. The Neth translate it loosely as "where breath freezes" or "the white death," depending on which clan you ask.

#### Character

If the Dreamplains are unsettling, Withepest is simply brutal. There is nothing mystical about this region's danger—just endless cold, endless wind, and endless white. The terrain offers no shelter, no landmarks, no mercy. Travelers who attempt to cross Withepest without proper preparation simply die, their bodies preserved in the permafrost until spring thaws briefly expose them before burying them again.

The Zwaeron cross Withepest only when absolutely necessary, and only in large groups with multiple supply sleds. Even they have lost entire caravans to sudden blizzards that can descend without warning and last for days.

#### Hills of Starfire

On the eastern edge of Withepest, where it meets the approaches to the Dreamplains, a range of low hills breaks the flatness. The Hills of Starfire earned their name from a phenomenon that occurs on clear winter nights—the snow and ice on their slopes sometimes ignites with pale, cold flames that cast no heat but burn with eerie beauty.

The flames are not true fire. They appear to be a manifestation of light magic interacting with some mineral composition in the hills' bedrock. Mages who have studied the phenomenon believe the hills sit atop a buried light leyline, too weak to manifest elsewhere but concentrated enough here to produce visible effects.

The Neth consider the Starfire hills sacred. They do not settle there, but their shamans make pilgrimages during the winter months when the flames burn brightest. What they seek or find in the cold fire, they do not share with outsiders.

#### Ethundra

South of Withepest, where the steppe begins to transition toward the forested foothills of the Kharvorn Mountains, lies the region called Ethundra—a borderland of scrubby vegetation, frozen marshes, and the first scattered stands of hardy conifers that eventually thicken into the Winterwood.

Ethundra is marginally more hospitable than Withepest proper. Small game survives here—arctic hares, foxes, ptarmigan—and the Zwaeron sometimes establish temporary camps in the more sheltered valleys. But the region is contested territory, with Jotun hunting parties occasionally ranging down from the Jotunhills to raid Zwaeron camps and carry off prisoners for their frozen larders.

## Northlands

### Geography

The Northlands occupy the frozen heart of northern Clueanda, filling the space south of the Nysanna Range. This vast arctic tundra stretches from the North Sea—a small body of water in the extreme north—down to where it meets the Westwilds in the southwest and transitions into the Celedrim Plains to the east.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Nysanna Range forms the northern boundary, an east-west mountain chain that marks the edge of habitable land
- **East**: Transitions into the Celedrim Plains; the two regions meet at approximately where the Nysanna Range and Kharvorn Mountains join at their 120-degree angle
- **South/Southwest**: Grades into the Westwilds, a transitional zone of arid scrubland
- **West**: Reaches the coast overlooking distant waters

#### Terrain

The terrain consists primarily of frozen tundra: permafrost beneath shallow snow, occasional rocky outcrops, and rare patches of hardy lichen. Howling winds sweep across featureless white expanses for hundreds of miles. The coast is treacherous, with ice shelves that calve into the frigid sea and pack ice that shifts with the seasons.

#### Titanwurm Mountains

Scattered throughout the Northlands are several Titanwurm mountain ranges—isolated peaks and ridges that break the otherwise flat tundra. These are not traditional geological formations but the colossal remains of titanwurms, ancient creatures whose bones now form mountain ranges:

- Melrin Mountains
- Gwyndolsong Mountains
- Wurmling Mountains
- Sotori Mountains (south of Wurmling and Jemco, just north of the eastern Krenglelan Range)—composed of the colossal vertebrae of a titanwurm
- Jemco Mountains

### Notable Locations

#### The Northern Plains

The vast frozen grasslands that stretch between the Titanwurm mountain ranges, west of the Wurmling Mountains and south of the Gwyndolsong Mountains. The Beathamuir River cuts horizontally through the entire Northern Plains, one of the few sources of unfrozen water in this frozen realm. The river is massive—wide enough that in some stretches the far bank is barely visible—and fed by glacial melt from the Nysanna Range.

##### Circle of Stone

Like Stonehenge but far more imposing—colossal stones arranged in an ancient circle, each stone unbreakable and emanating massive magical power. The site sits at a convergence of Earth and Force leylines, allowing for extraordinarily powerful geomancy and force magic. The stones predate all known civilizations in the Northlands, and their creators remain a mystery.

The Circle has become a pilgrimage site for geomancers and force-attuned mages seeking to study or harness the immense power concentrated here.

##### Tower of Azül

Where the Beathamuir River crosses a water leyline, the Tower of Azül rises from an island in the river's center. The tower is ancient—built of blue-black stone that seems to drink in light—and has served many masters over the millennia. Currently it stands empty, its last occupant having departed (or died) within living memory.

The tower's position on the water leyline makes it valuable to any mage with water attunement. The river itself behaves strangely near the tower: it never freezes regardless of temperature, and fish caught in its waters near the island are said to grant prophetic dreams when eaten. The Neth tribes who range through the Northern Plains consider the tower taboo and will not approach within a mile of it, though they refuse to explain why.

Whoever built the tower understood both hydromancy and architecture that has not been replicated since. The interior is rumored to contain chambers that exist partially underwater, partially in air, with no clear boundary between—rooms where one can breathe liquid and drown in air.

#### Nysanna Range

The massive east-west mountain chain that forms the northern boundary of the Northlands, marking the edge of habitable territory before the polar wastes. The tallest mountains in the world, home to two white dragons, the Wydling ice goblins, and countless glaciers. See the dedicated [Nysanna Range](./Nysanna%20Range.md) entry for details.

#### Wurmling Mountains

One of the Titanwurm mountain ranges scattered throughout the Northlands, the Wurmling Mountains divide the frozen plains.

##### Temple of Zicadia

At the northern tip of the Wurmling Mountains, where force and air leylines intersect, stands the Temple of Zicadia. This remote institution is dedicated to elemental protection magic—specifically, the art of turning air into solid structures that can deflect attacks.

The temple is run by Master Felwana, a reclusive woman who lost her husband in a distant war and came to the Northlands to learn. She became a master of the art and now teaches others, though the temple is brutal and miserable. Life here is harsh—the temple faces frequent threats from the creatures of the frozen snowplains, and students must be prepared to defend themselves while mastering the difficult discipline of solidifying air itself.

### Anu'Itiklik

Tags: tundra, wasteland

A frozen, windblasted wasteland in the northwestern Northlands, Anu'Itiklik stretches from the foothills of the Senaveer Mountains in the west to the edges of the Northern Plains in the east. Hundred-mile-per-hour winds are nearly constant across these wastes, and the temperature rarely rises above freezing even in summer.

#### Geography

Anu'Itiklik is not merely cold—it is scoured. The relentless wind strips away anything not rooted or weighted down. Snow doesn't accumulate here; it blows horizontally across the permafrost in a perpetual white blur. Exposed rock is polished smooth. Anything left on the surface for more than a few days will be worn to nothing or buried beneath drifts that form and vanish with the shifting gales.

The region sits in the wind-shadow of no mountains—air currents from the North Sea and the polar wastes beyond the Nysanna Range converge here, creating a natural wind tunnel hundreds of miles wide. The Atowatowa say the wind here is the breath of the dead, exhaled from Celestia and sweeping south to remind the living that all things pass.

#### The Atowatowa

Anu'Itiklik is home to the Atowatowa, a confederation of caribou-herding clans who have adapted to this brutal environment over countless generations. Many Atowatowa are born with natural air attunements, allowing them to create pockets of still air around themselves and their herds—the only way to survive in a land where an unshielded face can be flayed raw in minutes.

The Atowatowa are fiercely territorial and deeply suspicious of outsiders. This xenophobia is not mere cultural isolationism—they guard secrets they believe are too dangerous for the outside world. The peaks to their northwest, where the planar border between Material and Celestia grows thin, are sacred ground. The mining operations in the Anderegnons represent an existential threat to everything the Atowatowa hold holy.

Their caribou herds follow the lichen across Anu'Itiklik in seasonal migrations, ranging as far as the Senaveer Mountains in spring where special high-altitude lichen grows. Caribou fed on this mountain lichen grow enormous—up to fourteen feet at the shoulder—and are reserved for clan leaders and war-chiefs.

#### The Wind-Roads

Despite the chaos of the surface winds, the Atowatowa have mapped what they call the Wind-Roads: channels of relatively predictable airflow that snake across Anu'Itiklik. Travelers who know these roads can move faster and more safely than those who fight against the wind. The Wind-Roads shift with the seasons, and keeping track of their current positions is a specialized knowledge passed down within certain families.

Outsiders who enter Anu'Itiklik without guides usually die within days—either frozen, lost, or simply worn down by the wind until they can no longer stand.

### Nysanna Range

Tags: mountains

The Nysanna Range is one of the most inhospitable places on Alaria—and by some measures, the most dramatic. These are the tallest mountains in the world, their peaks rising so high that the air becomes too thin to breathe. The entire range is plagued with constant blizzards, high winds, and freezing temperatures. It is rare for the temperature to climb above -20°F, and the high altitudes cause confusion, hallucination, and poor judgment in those who venture too high without magical protection.

Within the range lie a wide variety of wildlife, civilizations, and valuable resources—but claiming any of them requires surviving the mountains first.

#### The Glaciers

Massive glaciers fill the valleys and passes of the Nysanna Range, some of them miles thick and constantly grinding forward. These rivers of ice are not static; they calve enormous icebergs into the North Sea, reshape the landscape over centuries, and occasionally release ancient things frozen within them. The glaciers are also riddled with tunnels—some carved by meltwater, others by creatures that call the ice home.

The largest glaciers have names among those who know the range: the Breath of Nydus, the Thousand-Year Flow, the Grinding. Navigation through the range often means traveling *through* glaciers rather than around them, following tunnel networks that may or may not still exist from season to season.

#### Dragon Territories

Two white dragons claim the Nysanna Range as their hunting ground, dividing the mountains between them in a cold détente.

**Shananae** holds the western reaches, from the approaches to the Anderegnons to roughly the midpoint of the range. She is ancient and indifferent—not actively cruel, but utterly unconcerned with the lives of smaller creatures. The Atowatowa have learned to read the wind patterns that signal her hunts and adjust their movements accordingly.

**Niquous** claims the central range, his territory beginning where Shananae's ends and stretching east toward Witvein. He is younger and far more actively malevolent, a hunter who takes pleasure in terror. His blue-white scales make him nearly invisible against glacial ice. The Wydlings of Witvein have lost enough hunting parties to him that they've developed elaborate warning systems for his approach.

The space between their territories is not safe—it's simply where both dragons hunt.

#### Western Peaks

The western arm of the Nysanna Range curves northward toward the Senaveer Mountains and the Anderegnons, approaching the border between the Material Plane and Celestia. Here the mountains grow taller and stranger, their peaks often wreathed in aurora-light even during the day.

##### Top of the World

The highest peak in the western Nysanna Range, and by some measures the highest point in all of Clueanda. Top of the World rises where the planar membrane between Material and Celestia grows gossamer-thin—so thin that on clear nights, observers claim to see the faint shapes of spirits moving on the other side.

The Atowatowa consider this peak sacred ground. When their greatest leaders die, their bodies are carried up the treacherous slopes by a procession of wind-callers who still the lethal gales long enough to reach the summit. There, the body is laid upon the bare stone and left for the wind. The Atowatowa believe that here, closer to Celestia than anywhere else on the continent, the spirit can step directly across rather than making the long journey through death. What happens to the body is unclear—some say the wind takes it; others say it simply fades.

The peak is why the Atowatowa are so hostile to outsiders in general and to the Bollinger Mining Company in particular. Every step the miners take toward the mountains is a step toward desecrating the place where their ancestors crossed over.

##### Bjorin's Lookout

A weathered outcropping on the northwestern slope of the Nysanna Range, overlooking the Anderegnons and the approaches to Anu'Itiklik. Named for Bjorin Wolfseye, a Zwaeron pathfinder who lived three centuries ago.

Bjorin earned his name not from keen vision but from what he witnessed. According to Zwaeron legend, he was camped at this outlook when the aurora twisted into unnatural shapes and something emerged from the thinning planar border—a creature of light and memory that had no business existing in the Material world. Bjorin's dire wolf companion went mad at the sight. Bjorin himself survived by gouging out his own eyes before the thing could be fully seen.

Blind, he made his way back to the Zwaeron camps and lived another forty years, guiding caravans by scent and sound alone. The lookout bearing his name became a traditional waystation for Zwaeron scouts, who watch for unusual aurora activity and maintain signal-fires to warn the southern camps if the lights begin to twist.

The Zwaeron tell their children: *"If the sky dances wrong, run. Don't look back. Bjorin looked, and he was lucky."*

#### Witvein

The eastern Nysanna Range, on its northern slopes facing the polar wastes, is dominated by the region known as Witvein—a maze of tunnel-laden glaciers that serves as home to the Wydlings, the ice goblins of the far north.

The Wydlings have carved an entire civilization into these glaciers, creating networks of passages, chambers, and hunting blinds that only they can navigate safely. The ice shifts constantly, and the Wydlings have learned to read its movements—knowing which tunnels will collapse within days and which will last generations. Outsiders who enter Witvein without Wydling guides rarely emerge.

Unlike their southern goblin cousins who live in massive communal broods, Wydlings move in small extended-family hunting packs. They are patient, methodical predators—capable of waiting motionless in snowdrifts for hours before striking. Their pale blue skin and razor-sharp icicle teeth mark them as creatures perfectly adapted to this frozen hell.

The Wydlings maintain an uneasy awareness of Niquous, the white dragon whose territory borders their own. They have lost enough hunters to him that they've developed an elaborate system of scouts, signals, and escape routes. When Niquous hunts, the Wydlings vanish deeper into their glacier tunnels, waiting in absolute stillness until the danger passes.

##### Pyoa Noi

Within the eastern Nysanna Range stands one of the most bizarre landmarks in the Northlands: Pyoa Noi, a hundred-mile-long stone serpent that twists through the mountains, its petrified body diving in and out of the peaks like a sea serpent frozen mid-leap.

The serpent was once a living creature of unimaginable size, turned to stone by an incredibly powerful gorgon in an ancient battle. Over centuries, the Wydlings have hollowed out the serpent's interior, creating a network of tunnels and chambers within the stone body. Pyoa Noi is their greatest stronghold—a place where the ice cannot shift and the dragons cannot easily reach them.

The Wydlings defend Pyoa Noi fiercely from those who would mine it further. The stone of the petrified serpent has unusual properties that outside interests would love to exploit, but the Wydlings consider it sacred—the belly of a dead god, in their telling, and the only permanent home their people have ever known.

#### Last Chance

High on the northern face of the Nysanna Range, where the peaks give way to the polar wastes beyond, stands the ruined fortress of Last Chance. The name is grimly literal: this was the final point where skyships traveling the northern astral current could safely dock before being swept further into the storms and ice of the world's edge.

The astral currents that flow through Alaria's skies follow paths as fixed as ocean currents, and one of the major northern routes sweeps along the Nysanna Range before curving northwest toward oblivion. Skyships caught on this current without enough aether to break free would be carried into the perpetual storms beyond the mountains, never to return. Last Chance was built as a desperate waystation—a place to refuel, repair, or simply abandon ship before the current carried you past the point of no return.

The fortress has been abandoned for centuries now. Its docking spires still jut from the mountainside, encrusted with ice, and its interior is a frozen tomb of whatever crew last sheltered there. Occasionally treasure hunters or scholars make the dangerous climb to explore it, hoping to find salvage from the skyships that didn't make it—or records of what lies beyond the edge of the world. Few return with anything useful. Fewer still return at all.

The Wydlings avoid Last Chance. They say the wind sounds wrong there—that it carries voices from places that shouldn't exist.

#### Inthikrilix Dungeon

On the northern side of the Nysanna Range, where water and force leylines intersect, lies the Inthikrilix Dungeon—a massive fortress carved into the mountainside. This network of ice-encrusted tunnels delves deep into the mountain, leading eventually to the crypt of Inthikrilix, an ancient mage who mastered both ice and force magic.

The dungeon is guarded by spirits of ice and force—ethereal beings created by the leyline convergence or bound by Inthikrilix himself. These spirits manifest as crystalline wraiths that can freeze flesh instantly or crush intruders with invisible force. The deeper one ventures into the mountain, the more powerful and numerous the guardians become, and the temperature drops to levels that can kill unprotected explorers within minutes.

What treasures or secrets Inthikrilix left behind remain unknown. The few expeditions that have penetrated the outer chambers report that the architecture becomes increasingly alien the deeper one goes—as if the mage was building according to geometries that don't quite match the Material Plane.

### Senaveer Mountains

Tags: mountains

The Senaveer Mountains rise northwest of Anu'Itiklik, a rugged barrier between the frozen wastes and the polar approaches. They are home to a large population of northern rocs—massive predatory birds that hunt the caribou herds in the eastern foothills. The mountains are rich with the lichen that feeds the caribou, so the Atowatowa herders journey there every spring, timing their arrival to avoid the rocs' nesting season.

The Senaveer range is notable for its unusual geology: veins of a dark crystalline mineral run through the rock, glittering faintly even in dim light. The Atowatowa consider these veins sacred and refuse to mine them. They call the substance *itikwas*—"frozen tears"—and believe it to be the condensed grief of spirits who could not complete their crossing into Celestia.

#### Anderegnons

The Anderegnons are a miserable, cold, windy range of mountains north and west of the Senaveer, sitting directly on the border between the Material Plane and Celestia. The planar membrane here is so thin that the mountains themselves seem to exist in both worlds at once—their peaks occasionally visible from Celestia as faint gray shadows, and the aurora of the spirit world bleeding down to paint the snow in colors that have no names in mortal tongues.

##### The Ash

The Anderegnons are rich with malstaric ash, a substance that by all rights should not exist here. Malstaris is the shadow plane, the mirror of Celestia across the cosmic divide. Yet the ash is abundant—found in seams throughout the mountains, coating exposed surfaces after storms, accumulating in drifts in sheltered valleys.

The Atowatowa have an explanation. They believe that when a spirit crosses from the Material Plane into Celestia at Top of the World, the crossing strips away its shadow. Shadows cannot exist in Celestia—they have no place there. So the shadow falls, tumbling down the slopes of the sacred peak and the surrounding mountains, dissolving into ash as it separates from the spirit it once belonged to.

If this is true, then the malstaric ash of the Anderegnons is quite literally the residue of the dead—the abandoned shadows of every Atowatowa leader who ever crossed over. This makes the Bollinger Mining Company's operation not merely sacrilege but something closer to grave-robbery, harvesting the discarded darkness of ancestors.

##### The Bollinger Mining Company

The Bollinger Mining Company discovered the ash deposits two decades ago and has since established a precarious extraction operation. Malstaric ash is extraordinarily valuable—essential for certain shadow-magic rituals, useful in alchemical processes, and prized by artificers working with darkness-infused materials.

The operation is expensive and dangerous. Food must be shipped in; ash must be shipped out. The supply route skirts the eastern edge of the Senaveer Mountains, threading a needle between territories: stray too far west and the northern rocs will descend; stray too far east and the Atowatowa will capture and kill any trespassers.

The miners themselves are a desperate lot—criminals working off debts, adventurers seeking fortune, and a handful of true believers who think the ash holds secrets worth dying for. Turnover is high. The company pays well, but the wind, the cold, the isolation, and the ever-present threat of Atowatowa raids take their toll.

The Atowatowa have so far limited themselves to raids on supply caravans rather than direct assaults on the mining camps. Some observers believe this restraint won't last—that the herders are waiting for something, perhaps a sign from their ancestors or a tactical advantage. Others think the Atowatowa are simply patient, knowing that the mountains themselves will eventually kill or drive out the intruders without need for open war.

### The Plumes

Tags: poi

The Plumes are a small region with frequent, intense geysers of fire and steam. Crabs live around the edge of the holes in the ground, feeding off the archea that grow in the hot vents. Docile Magma Snails are throughout.

Not mountains at all, but composed of the collosal vertabrae of a titanwurm. This was the first of the titanwurm mountains to be discovered.

## Northern Isles

### Geography

The Northern Isles are a broad, fragmented archipelago occupying the northeastern waters of Clueanda, scattered across the Ocean of Azeros. The island chain resembles the Canadian arctic archipelago—a wide, tall region of relatively large islands broken by narrow, icy straits and channels.

#### Position and Extent

- **West**: The Frostmarch Peninsula forms the mainland anchor, transitioning from continental land into the island chain
- **South**: The Ocean of Azeros separates the isles from the Celedrim Plains coastline
- **North**: The Ocean of Azeros extends beyond the islands toward the polar ice
- **East**: Open ocean

The Ocean of Azeros surrounds and permeates the archipelago, stretching from north of the Celedrim Plains across the entire top of this region.

#### Climate

The islands are uniformly icy, though conditions worsen progressively toward the north. Even the southernmost islands remain frozen year-round, with ice floes clogging the channels between them. Navigation is treacherous—shifting pack ice, sudden storms, and the ever-present cold claim many ships.

#### Major Islands

- **Pherezi Imnuttut**: The massive eastern landmass, roughly 1000 miles long, containing Blizrynthine, Giantfell, the Hills of Insanity, and the Timeless Wastes
- **Aknimchuk**: Northwestern volcanic island with the Ashy Mountains, Scheyolonae, and the only ice-free harbor in the archipelago
- **Potalaptuk**: Central island where Bzulakar's Keep dominates the landscape
- **Soki**: Island south of Potalaptuk
- **Friursus**: Northern island in the Iceberg Isles chain
- **Zemkachi**: Eastern island near Lightning Strait
- **Moon Dog**: Small island cluster in the central archipelago

#### Seas and Straits

The Northern Isles are threaded with named bodies of water:

- **Whispering Sea**: The central waters of the archipelago, named for the unnatural quiet that Bzulakar's power has imposed—waves lap silently, and even storms seem muted here
- **Bruthweur Sea**: Eastern waters between the central islands and Pherezi Imnuttut
- **Iron Strait**: Southern passage connecting the Northern Isles to the Frostmarch Peninsula's northeastern waters
- **Lightning Strait**: Eastern passage near Zemkachi, known for sudden electrical storms
- **Passage of Hagol**: Western strait separating Aknimchuk from the mainland

#### The Iceberg Isles

A chain of smaller, heavily glaciated islands stretching across the northern archipelago. These islands are essentially floating mountains of ice with rocky cores, calving massive icebergs into the surrounding waters. Navigation through the Iceberg Isles is nearly impossible—the shifting ice, hidden rocks, and freezing temperatures destroy most vessels that attempt it.

### Political Climate

The Northern Isles have no unified government and few permanent settlements. Power here is measured in individual might, not political organization:

- **Bzulakar** dominates the central archipelago through sheer magical supremacy. No one challenges him; no one could.
- **Gelnor** controls the Foggy Isles through ancient compact and fog-shrouded isolation
- **Pherezi Imnuttut** is essentially lawless—whatever creatures inhabit Giantfell and the Hills of Insanity answer to no authority
- **Aknimchuk's** small trading settlement operates on frontier justice and mutual necessity

The isles attract those who wish to disappear: exiles, criminals, mad wizards, and others who find civilization intolerable. They come here knowing they will likely die, preferring that to whatever awaits them elsewhere.

### What Makes It Interesting

The Northern Isles are a place of extremes and contradictions:

- Fire leylines creating infernos in frozen canyons (Blizrynthine)
- Time flowing wrong in the Timeless Wastes
- The most powerful lich on Alaria living in a 2-mile ice tower
- Volcanoes providing the only warmth for hundreds of miles (Aknimchuk)
- Magical amber washing up on frozen beaches
- A fog lich atoning for ancient sins in perpetual mist

For adventurers, the Northern Isles offer treasures and dangers found nowhere else—but the journey alone will kill most who attempt it.

### What Will Go Wrong

- Bzulakar decides to expand his influence beyond the isles
- Something stirs in the depths of the Timeless Wastes, where time has pooled strangely for millennia
- The Thermarifts of Blizrynthine grow unstable, threatening to crack Pherezi Imnuttut apart
- A new power arrives in the isles, challenging Bzulakar's dominion
- The creatures of Giantfell begin migrating south toward inhabited lands

### Notable Locations

#### Bzulakar's Keep

In the very center of the Northern Isles stands [Bzulakar's](../../dramatis_personae/Bzulakar.md) domain—a 2-mile-high tower of permanently frozen ice where the ancient lich resides. His power has frozen the surrounding thousand-mile area and stilled the nearby seas to whispers. The tower is visible from much of the archipelago, a landmark and a warning.

#### Foggy Isles

The most densely foggy islands in this half of the world. Home to an old Tuktuk named Gelnor who is paragon attuned to fog and water. Lives here eternally to atone for his sins (he's a lich, immortal).

On shore are giant hermit crabs that eat the algae off the rocks.

#### Amber Coast

Located in Pherezi Imnuttut, the Amber Coast is a beach where beautiful amber minerals frequently wash ashore. These minerals possess magical properties, making them highly prized by mages and collectors. The constant flow of enchanted amber from the frozen depths creates a dangerous attraction—both for treasure seekers and the predators that hunt them along the icy shoreline.

#### Blyzrynthine

A canyonland region in the north of Pherezi Imnuttut, bordered by the Hills of Insanity to the north and east, and the mountainous region of Giantfell to the south. A fire leyline passes through Blyzrynthine, superheating the canyons below.

##### Thermarift

Deep within the canyons of Crevakus in Blyzrynthine, huge fiery rifts tear through the ground. These Thermarifts are caused by the fire leyline running beneath the canyonlands, creating massive fissures that belch flame and superheated air. The ground far below in the canyon depths is covered with these fiery tears in the earth, making the deep canyons effectively impassable without magical protection from heat and flame.

#### Timeless Wastes

Southwest of Blyzrynthine and west of Giantfell lie the Timeless Wastes—a frozen desert where time itself behaves strangely. Travelers cannot keep track of time accurately here; hours feel like days, days feel like hours, and aging progresses at unpredictable rates. Some emerge having aged decades in what felt like a day, while others spend what seems like weeks only to find mere hours have passed in the outside world. Everything about the Wastes feels wrong and disorienting, as if time itself has come unmoored from reality.

The River of Swords flows through the western Wastes—named not for any battle but for the way ice crystals form along its banks in blade-like formations that can slice through leather and flesh.

#### Giantfell

The southern reaches of Pherezi Imnuttut are dominated by Giantfell—a mountainous region that earns its name. Giants dwell here, though what kind and how many remains unclear. Few explorers venture into Giantfell, and fewer return. Those who do speak of enormous shapes moving through the peaks, structures built for beings three times human height, and the constant threat of being stepped on by something that doesn't notice you.

The settlement of Themopolkrik clings to Giantfell's southern coast—a hardy fishing village that survives by staying beneath the giants' notice and fleeing to boats when that fails.

#### Hills of Insanity

North and east of Blizrynthine, the Hills of Insanity roll across northeastern Pherezi Imnuttut. The name is not metaphorical. Something about this region affects the mind—travelers report auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and in severe cases, complete psychotic breaks. The effect worsens the longer one stays and doesn't fully fade for weeks after leaving.

Scholars have proposed various explanations: a curse from the early ages, contamination from the nearby Thermarifts, proximity to some buried entity, or simply the cumulative psychological toll of the Northern Isles finally manifesting. None have been proven. The hills remain largely unexplored, as expeditions tend to turn on themselves before accomplishing anything.

#### Potalaptuk

The central island of the Northern Isles, forever in the shadow of Bzulakar's Keep. The 2-mile ice tower dominates the landscape so completely that the island barely has an identity beyond "the place where the lich lives." The ice around Potalaptuk never melts, never shifts—Bzulakar's power holds it perfectly frozen, a demonstration of control that extends for hundreds of miles in every direction.

No one lives on Potalaptuk who hasn't been permitted by Bzulakar. What that permission requires, and why anyone would seek it, are questions best left unasked.

### Aknimchuk

Tags: island, volcanic

Aknimchuk is the largest island in the northwestern Northern Isles, notable for being one of the few places in the archipelago where volcanic activity provides heat in an otherwise frozen realm. The island is divided into two distinct regions: the volcanic south and the frozen north.

#### Geography

Aknimchuk stretches roughly 200 miles from north to south, separated from the mainland by the Passage of Hagol to the west and facing the open waters of the Northern Isles to the east. The island's southern half is dominated by the Ashy Mountains—an active volcanic range that provides the only natural warmth for hundreds of miles. The northern half, Scheyolonae, remains frozen year-round like the rest of the archipelago.

Smokey Bay cuts into the island's southern coast, its waters warmed by underwater volcanic vents. Ships that can navigate this far north sometimes shelter here, the only harbor in the Northern Isles where ice doesn't threaten to crush hulls.

#### The Ashy Mountains

The Ashy Mountains are a range of active volcanoes running across central Aknimchuk. Unlike the fire-leyline heat of Blizrynthine far to the east, these are natural volcanoes—mountains of stone and fire that have been erupting for millennia. The peaks constantly emit smoke and ash, giving the range its name and leaving a grey pallor over the southern half of the island.

The volcanic activity creates a microclimate where life can survive. Hardy shrubs and mosses grow on the lower slopes, and hot springs dot the valleys between peaks. Strange creatures make their homes here—things that have adapted to the heat and cannot survive in the frozen wastes beyond.

##### Tomb of Angi

High in the Ashy Mountains, carved into the side of a dormant peak, lies the Tomb of Angi. Angi was a fire mage of tremendous power who lived centuries ago, choosing this volcanic island as her final resting place. The tomb is said to contain her accumulated knowledge of fire magic, along with whatever treasures she gathered in her long life.

The tomb is guarded by fire elementals and constructs of living magma—Angi's final creations, still loyal to their dead mistress. Expeditions have attempted to breach the tomb; few have returned, and none have reached its heart.

#### Scheyolonae

The northern half of Aknimchuk, beyond the reach of volcanic warmth, is called Scheyolonae—a frozen expanse of tundra and ice that matches the rest of the Northern Isles in its brutality. The contrast between Scheyolonae and the volcanic south is stark; travelers moving north can feel the temperature drop degree by degree as they leave the mountains' influence.

##### Iceburn Lakes

A cluster of lakes in central Scheyolonae, the Iceburn Lakes are named for the peculiar sensation experienced by those who touch their waters—a burning cold that seems to freeze and scald simultaneously. The lakes never fully freeze despite the temperatures, and their waters glow faintly blue on moonless nights.

Local legend claims the lakes are the tears of a frost giant who died here in the early ages of the world. Whether true or not, the waters have unusual properties. Alchemists prize Iceburn water for certain cold-based concoctions, and some mages believe the lakes sit atop a minor convergence of water and ice magical energies.

##### Salamander Cave

Despite its name suggesting fire creatures, Salamander Cave in northern Scheyolonae is home to ice salamanders—pale, cold-adapted amphibians the size of large dogs that breathe frost rather than flame. The caves extend deep into the frozen earth, and the salamanders have carved out an extensive network of tunnels.

The ice salamanders are not aggressive unless provoked, but they fiercely defend their territory. Their frost breath can freeze exposed flesh in seconds, and they hunt in packs. Travelers who stumble into their caves rarely emerge.

#### Smokey Bay

The southern bay of Aknimchuk, warmed by underwater volcanic vents, is the only reliably ice-free harbor in the Northern Isles. Ships from the south sometimes make the dangerous journey here to trade with the few hardy souls who have made Aknimchuk their home.

A small settlement—more trading post than town—clings to the shores of Smokey Bay. The inhabitants are a mix of outcasts, exiles, and those strange enough to prefer the volcanic island's isolation to civilization elsewhere. They trade in volcanic minerals, Iceburn water, and information about the Northern Isles for those foolish enough to venture further into the archipelago.
