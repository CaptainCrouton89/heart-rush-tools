## Gaeic Melodies

Tags: magic

Gaeic melodies are the bardic reproduction of Faesong—the music of Melera that runs through Alaria and the rest of the universe. Through practice and talent, bards can reproduce aspects of Faesong to perform magical effects.

While Rusalka, faeries, nelkie, and nymphs can naturally hear and use Faesong for their magic, mortal bards must learn to approximate these melodies through study and performance.

Gaeic magic is somewhat related to the psywinds—the swirling mass of thoughts between the planar layers.
