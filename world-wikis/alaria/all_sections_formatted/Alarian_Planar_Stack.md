## About Alaria

The Alarian Planar Stack, also commonly known as Alaria, is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several planes, stacked on top of each other. 

## Geography of the Planes

## Material Plane

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies Celestia: the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

### Celestia

Celestia's creation required two events. During the Lyzaria Era (235–180 million years ago), the titan-god Celest sacrificed herself to create a pocket dimension—a seed that would become Celestia. For 115 million years, this seed remained small and hidden. Then came the Ezz Rift: when Melera's music fractured the Alarian Planar Stack, Ezz accumulated around this seed because it was the only structure that resonated with her song. The pocket dimension bloomed into a full plane, peeling away from the Material Plane to become its mirror-image flip side.

This dual origin explains Celestia's strange nature: its *core* is Celest's essence (which is why it serves as a refuge for spirits), but its *substance* is made of Ezz (which is why it reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the living). Where there is thought on the Material Plane, there is a counterpart in Celestia.

## Astral Plane

"Above" the Material Plane is the Astral Plane. Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Aurus, living pawns of his will.

### Astraeva

On the flip side of the Astral Plane is Astraeva—and unlike the other planes, Astraeva is not truly a "place" in the conventional sense. Astraeva is **Aurus himself**, unfiltered.

The Astral Plane is Aurus's light filtered through structure: the islands, the sea, the accumulated souls that buffer his radiance. Astraeva is what remains when those buffers are stripped away—the raw, unmediated presence of the White Sun. It is the reservoir from which all souls are drawn, and the destination to which all souls eventually return.

**The Cycle of Souls**: When a new creature is conceived, a soul is drawn from Astraeva—raw Aurus-essence that passes through the Astral Plane and threads down through the Ethereal to bind with the new spirit. When a creature dies, their soul returns to the Astral Plane, where it persists for a time. But souls do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn souls—those that have cycled through many lives, or those that are forgotten—drift back through to Astraeva, dissolving into Aurus's light to be renewed and eventually drawn forth again.

**The Danger**: Traveling to Astraeva means exposing yourself to Aurus without protection. Your soul is not a separate thing here—it is *part* of Aurus, and the boundary between you and the cosmic source grows thin. Visitors report their sense of self beginning to blur. Memories feel shared. Identity becomes negotiable. Stay too long, and your soul may simply... rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. You would become part of everything, and therefore nothing in particular.

Astraeva is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain definition there. What few beings exist are either echoes of Aurus's will or things that were never truly separate from him to begin with.

## Malstaris

"Below" the Material Plane is Malstaris—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Nydus, living pawns of his will.

### Eindumor

On the flip side of Malstaris is Eindumor—and like Astraeva, Eindumor is not truly a separate plane. Eindumor is **Nydus himself**, unfiltered.

Malstaris is Nydus's darkness filtered through structure: the caverns, the black lakes, the accumulated shadows that give shape to his murk. Eindumor is what remains when those structures are stripped away—the raw, unmediated presence of the Black Sun. It is the reservoir from which all shadows are drawn, and the destination to which all shadows eventually return.

**The Cycle of Shadows**: When a new creature is conceived, a shadow is drawn from Eindumor—raw Nydus-essence that passes through Malstaris and threads up through the Nethereal to bind with the new spirit. When a creature dies, their shadow sinks to Malstaris, where it persists for a time. But shadows do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn shadows—those that have cycled through many lives, or those whose secrets have all been revealed—drift back through to Eindumor, dissolving into Nydus's darkness to be renewed and eventually drawn forth again.

**The Danger**: Traveling to Eindumor means exposing yourself to Nydus without protection. Your shadow is not a separate thing here—it is *part* of Nydus, and the boundary between you and the cosmic source grows thin. Visitors report their secrets beginning to leak. Hidden depths become visible. Everything you've concealed rises to the surface. Stay too long, and your shadow may simply... rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. You would become part of the primordial dark, and therefore incapable of concealment, of interiority, of self.

Eindumor is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain hidden depths there. What few beings exist are either echoes of Nydus's will or things that never had secrets to begin with.

## Elemental Planes

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the elemental planes, each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the Ethereal and Nethereal Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

## Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry. 

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in Celestia. 

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of Malstaris would take you to Eindumor. 

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or Malstaris requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other planes is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the elemental planes, and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal Planes, none can sustain spirit, soul, or shadow.

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the planar stack. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform magic on Alaria.

## Astral Currents

Tags: cosmology, trade, travel

The Astral Sea is not still. Vast currents sweep through its depths, carrying the floating islands in slow, predictable orbits. Where these currents pass close to the Material Plane—in the transitional zone where astral ocean becomes material atmosphere—they create invisible highways across the sky. The sky trade of Alaria depends entirely on these currents.

### The Nature of Currents

The Astral Plane exists as a massive ocean above the Material Plane, and like any ocean, it has currents. These are natural phenomena—not magical constructs, not the will of any god, not the dreaming of Lyzaria. They flow in circular patterns, carrying the floating islands of the Astral Sea in slow, centuries-long orbits.

The currents extend downward into the transitional zone where the Astral Sea meets the Material Plane's atmosphere. Ships cannot reach the true Astral Sea—that would require ascending thousands of miles into increasingly dense astral solution—but they can ride these currents where they dip closest to the ground: a few thousand feet above the surface.

Souls, rising toward Aurus after death, move independently of these currents. The currents are physical (or astral-physical) phenomena; the soul's journey is metaphysical.

### The Five Great Currents

Five major circular currents sweep across Alaria, each completing its circuit over the course of roughly a year. They vary in size, altitude, and danger.

#### The Emerald Circuit

The central and most-traveled current. It sweeps over Gorath, the Emerald Coast, and Kyagos in a broad oval, passing conveniently close to the continent's wealthiest trade centers. Ships on this route can reach the major markets of the Shacklands and Inner Rim without ever touching the dangerous northern routes. Most sky captains spend their entire careers on this circuit.

#### The Ophrenian Loop

The northwestern current passes over Clueanda, including the Western Isles, the North Sea, the Northern Plains, and Ophrenia. This current overlaps with the Emerald Circuit near the Middle Sea, making it the primary connector between the central trade routes and the Ophrenian powers. Adron and Tornia—both with major sky shipyards—sit near this convergence point.

#### The Elder Current

A smaller loop over the Elder Wilds and the Alaric Ocean. Less commercially important, but provides access to remote regions that would otherwise require months of overland travel.

#### The Frost Circuit

The northeastern current sweeps over the Alaric Ocean, the Frost Marches, and the Northern Isles. Extremely dangerous. The route passes through regions plagued by blizzards, dragons, and the hostile environment of the far north. Few ships attempt it; fewer return.

#### The Nysanna Loop

The far northwestern current clips the Nysanna Range at the North Sea. Massive storms, territorial dragons, and perpetual blizzards make this route effectively impassable. Last Chance—a fortress refueling station on the range's edge—marks the point of no return; ships swept past it are rarely seen again.

#### Southern Currents

Several currents exist in the far south and southwest, but they are commercially useless. Some loop off the edge of the known map—meaning ships would be carried into Celestia, the flip-side of the Material Plane, with no practical way to return. Others are isolated circuits with no connection to the main network. The southern seas remain the domain of traditional ocean shipping.

### Current Width and Speed

The currents are a few miles wide—enough for ships to maneuver, but tight enough that collisions remain a real risk in poor visibility. Fog, clouds, and storms force constant course corrections to stay centered.

Ships on a current travel roughly ten miles per hour. With a favorable tailwind (sails still work at altitude), speed increases modestly; headwinds slow progress. Travel times are predictable enough for scheduled trade, but weather variance means arrivals are approximate.

### Changing Currents

Where the great currents overlap, ships can transfer between routes. This requires leaving the stable flow of one current and crossing the dead zone to catch another. Without the current's pull, a ship burns expensive aether to motor through the gap.

These convergence points are the most valuable locations in the sky trade. The cities beneath them—particularly those near the Middle Sea—benefit enormously from the traffic passing overhead.

## Sky Ships

### Astral Stones

During the massive earthquakes that periodically shake the Astral Plane's floating islands (roughly once per millennium), chunks of astral stone break free from the islands' lower crusts and plummet toward the Material Plane. These iridescent gray stones possess a unique property: buoyancy in the Material Plane's atmosphere.

Each stone has an equilibrium point—an altitude where its natural buoyancy balances against the pull of the material world. This ranges from a few hundred feet to several thousand feet, depending on the stone's density. Low-density stones float lower; high-density stones rise higher (the highest reach altitudes where stars remain visible during daylight, and are often inhabited by the Synger).

Astral stones that reach the surface are incredibly valuable. Some lodge in the ground upon impact; others drift through the skies until netted. Either way, extracting and securing one represents a massive capital investment—the foundation of the entire sky trade.

### Ship Construction

A sky ship is, at its core, a traditional sailing vessel suspended from an astral stone by chains. The ship hangs below the stone, which provides lift; the ship's sails and aether engines provide lateral movement and altitude control.

The critical component is the chain. Regular metal cannot maintain a connection between astral matter and material construction—the chain would phase through the stone or the ship. Sky ship chains are forged from **astral steel**: an alloy of iron and astral filings.

**Astral filings** are ground from small, unusable astral stones—fragments too small to lift a vessel but still possessing the transitional properties of astral matter. The filings are smelted with iron to create astral steel, which can simultaneously grip astral stone and connect to material-world construction. The Dwarven holds of the Thunderdark Peaks produce the finest astral steel, though several human smithing traditions (particularly in Adron) have developed competitive techniques.

If a ship's chains are cut, the stone continues drifting on its current while the ship plummets. The stone might be recovered eventually—or might drift forever. This makes chain-cutting the ultimate threat in sky piracy.

### Aether Engines

The astral currents provide movement across the sky, but ships need propulsion for three critical operations: transferring between currents, maneuvering for docking, and maintaining altitude during station-keeping.

Aether engines provide this propulsion. Aether—a meta-fluid energy that arrived in Alaria from the planar stack Lanthornia—exists invisibly throughout the atmosphere. Certain creatures can sense and extract it; the most commercially important are the **aether weaver goblins**, who harvest raw aether and process it with water into usable fuel.

The engine mechanism involves lanthornium—an uncommon gray-blue stone that requires expensive purification. When purified lanthornium vibrates at a specific frequency and contacts processed aether, the aether rapidly expands, driving pistons or turning propellers. Well-designed engines use self-striking mechanisms: the initial strike causes vibrations that trigger subsequent strikes, creating a sustained power cycle similar to a steam engine.

Aether is expensive. A ship on the currents uses little—just minor course corrections. But burning aether to motor between currents, hold position during combat, or chase down another vessel consumes fuel rapidly. This cost shapes sky trade economics: only the wealthiest merchants can afford to deviate from the currents, and pirates who burn aether to catch prey must ensure their prize is worth the fuel.

#### Aether Weaver Goblins

The extraction of aether from the atmosphere requires creatures sensitive to its presence. Aether weaver goblins possess this sensitivity—an adaptation that developed after Lanthornia's eruption deposited aether across Alaria. They pull raw aether from the air using methods that resemble both breathing and weaving, then process it with water into the liquid fuel that powers engines.

Aether weaving clans operate wherever the sky trade reaches, but the largest concentrations cluster around major docking hubs. Prices vary by location—isolated towers pay premiums, while competitive markets near convergence points offer better rates. The goblins guard their extraction techniques jealously; attempts to replicate the process without goblin involvement have consistently failed.

### Navigation

At cruising altitude (typically 1,500-2,000 feet), ships operate above most weather but not above clouds. Poor visibility is constant; midair collisions are a real danger. Captains navigate primarily by dead reckoning, using the current's predictable flow to estimate position.

Experienced captains develop a feel for the current itself. Souls passing through the Astral Sea are slightly influenced by the currents, and captains with strong intuition can sense where the current runs strongest. This skill—somewhere between navigation and divination—separates competent captains from great ones.

The currents' stable altitude helps with mountain ranges; the current rises over peaks rather than driving ships into them. However, this means the current can be 200 feet above ground in some locations and 2,000 feet above in others, complicating docking.

## Infrastructure

### Docking Towers

Sky ships cannot simply land. Their astral stones want to rise to equilibrium; bringing a ship to ground level requires burning aether to motor downward, then holding position against the stone's buoyancy.

Docking towers solve this problem. These structures—typically 100 to 200 feet tall—allow ships to approach at a lower altitude and tie off, rather than fighting their way to ground level. The ship moors to the tower's platform, exchanges cargo and passengers, then releases and floats back to cruising altitude.

Tower construction is expensive. The structures must withstand the forces of ships pulling against their mooring, weather exposure at altitude, and the constant traffic of heavy cargo. Most docking towers are owned by cities, though wealthy merchant houses and contested frontier territories operate their own. All charge substantial tariffs and docking fees.

The atmosphere at docking towers resembles a high-security port more than a casual harbor. The stakes are too high for informality—a mishandled mooring can cost a fortune in lost cargo, a damaged ship, or a drifting astral stone. Tower operators run tight operations with strict protocols.

#### Mountain Bridges

In mountainous regions, the current passes close enough to peaks that ships can reach fixed platforms—bridges extending from cliffsides at current altitude. These are cheaper to build than freestanding towers but limited to specific geography. The Nysanna Range's Last Chance is the most famous example: a fortress-monastery built on a mountain bridge at the edge of passable sky routes.

### Major Trade Hubs

The sky trade concentrates wealth in specific locations:

**Gorath** dominates the Emerald Circuit. Its docking towers never sleep; the slave trade that defines the nation's economy relies heavily on sky transport. Slaves can be moved faster and in larger numbers by air than by sea or land, and the journey is far less likely to be interrupted by naval patrols or border crossings.

**Kyagos** shares Gorath's position on the Emerald Circuit and its involvement in the slave trade. The two powers maintain an uneasy cooperation—competition for sky trade could easily escalate to open conflict.

**Adron** (particularly the city of Shipmarsh) builds sky ships. The Middle Sea's traditional shipwrights adapted their craft to astral construction, and Adron's position near the Emerald-Ophrenian convergence means easy access to both major trade networks. Adrak, the capital, handles financing; its banks underwrite most of the continent's sky vessels.

**Tornia** competes with Adron for the Ophrenian shipbuilding trade. Its location on the same convergence point means ships built in Tornian yards can reach any viable route. The nation's time-gangs have extended their influence into sky commerce, manipulating cargo schedules and docking fees.

**The Western Isles** are notably absent from the sky trade. Reaching them by air requires passing through the Nysanna Loop or the Frost Circuit—both effectively impassable. The isles' economy remains tied to ocean shipping, creating a cultural and economic divide between the sky-trading powers and the maritime west.

## Piracy and Warfare

### Sky Piracy

Piracy in the skies differs fundamentally from its ocean equivalent. On water, a faster ship can run; in the air, everyone moves at the same speed (the current's). Escape requires burning aether to motor off-current—an expensive gamble that pirates can match if they're willing to spend the fuel.

This creates a different calculation. Pirates don't chase; they ambush. Convergence points and docking approaches are the danger zones. Ships transferring between currents or descending to dock are vulnerable; ships cruising mid-current with no reason to slow are nearly impossible to intercept.

The ultimate pirate threat is the chain. Cutting a ship's astral steel chains—or credibly threatening to—forces immediate surrender. The ship falls; the cargo is lost; the astral stone drifts away forever. No captain risks that outcome for cargo insurance.

Pirate vessels need astral stones of their own, which means organized piracy requires substantial capital. Most sky pirates operate from legitimate-seeming trade vessels that turn predatory when opportunity presents. True pirate fleets with multiple dedicated raiders are rare and well-known; evading them is a matter of intelligence and route planning.

### Military Use

Dropping fire from the sky is devastatingly effective. Armies with no counter to aerial bombardment have been routed by single sky ships. Fortifications designed to resist ground assault become deathtraps when the enemy approaches from directly above.

But military sky operations face constraints:

**You cannot hold position for free.** A ship on-current keeps moving; staying over a single location requires burning aether to motor against the flow. Extended bombardment campaigns consume vast quantities of expensive fuel.

**You cannot be everywhere.** The currents go where they go. Regions away from the major routes are nearly impossible to threaten by air—the aether cost of reaching them and returning is prohibitive.

**Ground forces cannot support you.** Coordination between sky units and surface armies requires precise timing; the ship cannot wait overhead while ground forces maneuver.

Despite these limitations, every major power maintains some sky capability. Even a small air presence forces enemies to disperse, fortify against vertical attack, and commit resources to anti-sky measures (of which few are effective). Nations under the major currents cannot afford to ignore the sky; nations away from the currents cannot afford to reach it.

## Economics

### Capital Investment

An astral stone of adequate size to lift a trading vessel represents a fortune. Most are owned by established merchant houses, state navies, or trade guilds rather than individual captains. A captain who owns their own stone has either inherited it, been extraordinarily lucky, or pulled off something worth asking about quietly.

The ship itself costs comparable to a large ocean-going vessel—substantial, but manageable for a successful merchant. The chains (astral steel, custom-fitted) add considerably. The aether engine (lanthornium, complex mechanisms, specialized knowledge) adds more. Ongoing aether costs depend on route and operations.

Total investment for a modest trading vessel runs roughly three times the cost of an equivalent ocean ship. Returns are proportionally higher: sky trade reaches markets that would take months to reach by surface, and carries cargo across terrain that would be impassable otherwise.

### Trade Advantages

The sky trade's value lies in what it makes possible:

**Overland reach.** Ocean ships must find ports. Sky ships can reach any point under the currents, including landlocked cities with docking towers. Interior markets that would require caravans become directly accessible.

**Speed.** Ten miles per hour is modest compared to a fast sailing ship with good wind, but it's consistent. No doldrums, no contrary winds, no navigating through straits. Point-to-point travel times are predictable.

**Capacity.** Astral stones can lift enormous weights. Cargoes that would require multiple ocean vessels or months of caravan travel can move on a single sky ship.

**Slave transport.** This is the trade's ugly truth. Sky ships carry slaves faster, in larger numbers, and with less risk of interdiction than any surface method. Gorath and Kyagos built their sky fleets on slave money; the two industries are inseparable.

### Who Cannot Participate

Regions away from the currents are excluded from the sky trade. Reaching them requires burning aether for the entire journey—and for the return trip, if you want to come back. The Western Isles, much of the far south, and interior regions away from current paths rely on traditional surface transport.

This creates economic stratification. Nations under the currents have access to faster, more efficient trade networks; nations outside them compete at a disadvantage. The divide shapes Alarian geopolitics as fundamentally as access to ocean ports shapes surface trade.

---

## Culture and Crew

### Sky Sailors

The crews of sky ships come from mixed backgrounds. Some are trained in dedicated guilds that teach astral navigation, aether engine maintenance, and the peculiarities of high-altitude sailing. Others are ocean sailors who crossed over, learning sky work as an extension of their existing skills.

The work is different from ocean sailing in key ways. The rigging serves a similar purpose (catching wind), but altitude effects and thinner air change the feel of the sails. Collision risk is constant; someone is always watching for other ships, and fog triggers heightened alert. The stone and chains require inspection—failure is catastrophic—and engine maintenance demands specialized knowledge.

Sky crews develop their own traditions, superstitions, and slang. They tend to view themselves as a cut above ocean sailors (who cannot claim to sail at the edge of the Astral Sea) and far above ground-bound merchants (who have never seen the stars in daylight from a high-floating stone). Whether this arrogance is earned depends on who you ask.

### Navigational Intuition

The best sky captains develop a sense for the current—an awareness that verges on the supernatural. Souls passing through the Astral Sea are slightly influenced by the same currents the ships ride; captains who can feel this influence navigate more precisely, sense current boundaries before crossing them, and predict weather that surface-dwellers cannot anticipate.

This skill cannot be taught directly. It develops over years of high-altitude sailing, and not all captains achieve it. Those who do command premium wages; their ships arrive on schedule, avoid collisions, and make current transfers with minimal aether expenditure.

### Cultural Attitudes

The peoples of Alaria view the sky trade variously:

**Gorath and Kyagos** treat it as essential infrastructure—as natural as ocean ports, and as tied to their economic identity. Sky captains occupy a social position comparable to successful merchant mariners.

**Adron and Tornia** emphasize craftsmanship. Building sky ships is a point of national pride, and the industry supports significant portions of both economies. Sky sailors are respected workers in an admired trade.

**The Western Isles** view the sky trade with suspicion or dismissal—an eastern obsession that does not reach their waters, and therefore does not matter. Some western mariners consider sky sailing a form of cheating that avoids the honest challenges of the sea.

**Landlocked interior regions** without docking towers see sky ships rarely, and usually only in military contexts. For many farmers and villagers, the sight of a vessel hanging from a floating stone is ominous rather than exciting—nothing good has ever dropped from the sky onto their fields.

## Psywinds

Tags: cosmology, magic

The flow of all thoughts, ideas, and emotions across Alaria. The Psywinds are currents of flowing Ezz that carry the collective mental activity of all living beings within the planar stack. These thoughts pass through all, connecting mind to mind across any distance.

### What the Psywinds Enable

- **Telepathic communication** between creatures attuned to the currents
- **Syncopaths** perceive and manipulate the Psywinds constantly
- **Prayers** can be heard from Celestia through the Psywinds—this is how daemons know when their followers call
- **True names** ripple through the Psywinds; you can hear your true name no matter where it is spoken on Alaria
- **Psy magic** draws power directly from these currents

### Substance

The Psywinds are made of flowing Ezz—the universal substrate that contains both Azus's order and Melera's randomness. After the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the Psywinds became the medium through which spirit-bearing creatures could think, feel, and connect.

### Counterpart: Faesong

The Psywinds and Faesong are the two great ambient magical forces in Alaria:

- **Psywinds** carry *thought* and *intention*—they flow between all minds, generated by the collective mental activity of living beings
- **Faesong** carries *emotion* and *harmony*—it flows from Melera outward, a constant melody underlying all creation

Where the Psywinds are heard as whispers and images, Faesong is felt as harmony or dissonance. Telepaths and psy mages work the Psywinds; druids and fae creatures attune to Faesong.

Some scholars believe these are two aspects of the same phenomenon—that Melera's music is what gives Ezz its capacity for carrying thought and emotion. Others argue they are distinct but complementary, like two instruments in the same orchestra.

### The Psywinds and Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent substrate through which the Psywinds flow. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform psy magic.

## Stars, Suns, and Moons

Tags: cosmology, celestial

### Stars

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Koras lives within the sun's blazing core, maintaining its celestial glass and ensuring its light burns steady. Though Koras tends the sun's physical form, it is Bryn—the sun's awakened spirit—who chooses where it travels. Koras is immune to the extreme heat and has served the sun since before it gained consciousness.

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

### Suns

There are three suns within Alaria, each over a different layer of the planar stack.

#### The Sun of the Material Plane

The sun that lights the Material Plane is the greatest of the titan-crafted stars—an immense orb of celestial glass tended by Koras. Unlike Aurus and Nydus, it is not a dissolved titan-god, but a construct that gained consciousness.

##### Bryn, the Sun's Spirit

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the sun—previously a mindless mechanism—*woke up*. The Ezz granted it a spark of spirit: a will, a desire, the capacity to want. This awakened consciousness is called Bryn.

Bryn is not a god in the traditional sense. The sun is not sustained by worship like a daemon. But Bryn is *aware*, and Bryn's path across the sky can be influenced by prayer. The sun travels because Bryn chooses to travel. Seasons exist because different congregations across Alaria convince Bryn to traverse different paths—when the northern monasteries sing loudest, the sun travels closer to the north.

The sun is the only celestial body known to have awakened in this way. Why the sun and not the other stars remains a mystery—perhaps its size, perhaps its proximity to the Material Plane, perhaps something else entirely.

#### Aurus, the White Sun

Aurus is a still-living titan-god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was among the first beings created within Alaria. As a titan-god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, the ever-present radiance above the Astral Plane.

Aurus never rises or sets—his light is constant, illuminating all souls on the Astral Plane. The soul itself is made of his essence. His position slowly drifts over millennia, and when he draws closer to the Material Plane's boundary, temperatures below grow warmer.

Aurus is also the source from which all souls are drawn. New souls emerge from his light; worn-out souls eventually return to it. His flip-side, Astraeva, is where his unmediated presence can be experienced—and where souls exist before and after their time bound to mortal spirits.

#### Nydus, the Black Sun

Nydus is a still-living titan-god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was among the first beings created within Alaria. As a titan-god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. He became the Black Sun, the ever-present darkness above Malstaris.

Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely reveals one's shadow—many things lie hidden in its murk. The shadow itself is made of his essence. His slow drift causes cold temperatures to spike around the Material Plane when he draws near.

Nydus controls the Umbral Agents and is the source from which all shadows are drawn. New shadows emerge from his darkness; worn-out shadows eventually return to it. His flip-side, Eindumor, is where his unmediated presence can be experienced—and where shadows exist before and after their time bound to mortal spirits.

### Moons

Two moons orbit Alaria, visible from the Material Plane but existing partially within the spirit-substrate that threads through all planes. Unlike the sun, which travels through physical space, the moons ride the Ethereal and Nethereal overlays—the same currents that carry souls and shadows between planes.

#### Auris, the Bright Moon

Auris completes its cycle every 11 days, marking the week. It rides the Ethereal overlay, resonating with Aurus's soul-light. When Auris is full, it has risen closest to the Material-Ethereal boundary—bright, visible, soul-strong. When Auris is new, it has descended deeper into the overlay, dim and distant from mortal sight.

The 11-day week begins with Auris at its darkest—new moon, the day called Cautious—and builds toward the full moon celebration of Merrynight mid-week. As Auris waxes and wanes, so too does a subtle tide of soul-energy across Alaria. Seers and spirit-speakers find their work easiest at full moon; necromancers and those who traffic with the dead prefer the darker nights at week's beginning and end.

Auris is not *controlled* by Aurus—the White Sun does not command its movements. But moon and sun are made of the same essential substance: celestial glass infused with primordial soul-stuff. They resonate with each other the way a tuning fork resonates with its fundamental tone. When Aurus drifts closer to the Material Plane during Faesummer, Auris burns brighter and its cycles seem to quicken with energy.

#### Nyxara, the Dark Moon

Nyxara completes its longer cycle every 23 days. It rides the Nethereal overlay, resonating with Nydus's shadow-dark. When Nyxara is full, it has risen closest to the Material-Nethereal boundary—visible as a deep purple-silver disc, shadow-strong. When Nyxara is new, it has descended into the Nethereal depths, invisible and potent with hidden power.

The 23-day cycle creates Alaria's deeper rhythm of magical tides. Shadow magic, secrets, and Malstaric creatures wax and wane with Nyxara's face. The full Nyxara is not a time of darkness but of *revealed* darkness—shadows become sharper, secrets feel closer to the surface, and the boundary with Malstaris thins.

Like Auris with Aurus, Nyxara resonates with but is not commanded by Nydus. When Nydus drifts closer during Shadowrift periods, Nyxara's presence intensifies—some claim it appears larger, or that its purple tint deepens to near-black.

#### The Double Moons

Because 11 and 23 share no common factors, the two moons align only every 253 days—slightly longer than Alaria's 200-day year.

**Double Full Moon (Brightnight):** When both Auris and Nyxara are full simultaneously, the night blazes with silver-white and purple-silver light. The Ethereal and Nethereal overlays press close to the Material Plane together. Magic of all kinds surges. Rituals performed on Brightnight carry extra power—and extra risk. Many cultures hold festivals; others bar their doors.

**Double New Moon (Hollownight):** When both moons are absent, the night is profoundly dark. Neither soul-light nor shadow-light touches the Material Plane. Some find this peaceful—a true rest from magical tides. Others find it terrifying—a void where anything might creep through. Werebeasts, vampires, and creatures of pure darkness are at their most dangerous on Hollownight.

#### The Killing Moon

The Killing Moon is not a moon at all—or perhaps it was, once.

##### What Actually Happens

Every few thousand years—sometimes five thousand, sometimes twenty thousand, usually around eight thousand—the natural drift cycles of Aurus and Nydus reach a point of maximum instability. Their resonances clash rather than complement. The Ethereal and Nethereal overlays, normally separate currents, begin to bleed into each other.

The results are catastrophic:
- Planar boundaries thin across Alaria
- Creatures from Malstaris and the Astral cross freely into the Material Plane
- Magic becomes unpredictable, sometimes lethal to its casters
- Mass psychological effects sweep populations
- People die in ways that seem random, inexplicable, divine

These destabilization periods last years to centuries, depending on how quickly the drift corrects itself. Strong divine intervention can suppress or delay the effects—Craggus's reign famously kept the instability dormant for fifteen thousand years.

During these periods, looking at the sky can kill you. Not metaphorically. The unfiltered bleed of planar light—raw Ethereal and Nethereal energy mixing where they shouldn't—destroys mortal minds and bodies. People learn to keep their eyes down, to roof their streets, to never gaze upward after dark.

And so they call it the Killing Moon.

##### The Lost Third Moon

There *was* a third moon, once.

During the Age of Titans, three moons orbited Alaria—Auris and Nyxara as they exist now, plus a third whose true name has been lost. Some scholars believe it was balanced between the two, neutral, stabilizing. Others believe it was Celest's moon, tied to her essence before she sacrificed herself to become Celestia.

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria 120 million years ago, something happened to the third moon. Perhaps it shattered. Perhaps it fell. Perhaps it was pulled into interdimensional space when the surviving titans fled. The Desert of One Million Shards, the strange crater lake of Morgnor's Cradle, the void-locked darkness where the dragon Ural lairs—all have been proposed as fragments of its grave.

What seems certain: the third moon is gone, and its absence may be what allows the destabilization cycles to occur. It was the keystone. Without it, Auris and Nyxara eventually drift into destructive resonance.

Or perhaps the cycles simply reminded people that something was missing, and they invented the third moon to explain the inexplicable.

##### Beliefs About the Killing Moon

**The Orthodox View:** Most scholars hold that the "Killing Moon" is simply a poetic name for destabilization periods. There is no literal third moon in the sky during these times—only bleeding planar light that kills those who look upon it. "Don't look at the Killing Moon" is a warning, not an astronomical observation.

**The Literalist View:** Some druids and old cults believe the third moon still exists, damaged and drifting through the void between planar stacks. Every few millennia, its erratic orbit brings it screaming back through Alaria's sky. It is broken, and its light is poison. The destabilization isn't the cause of its return—it's the symptom.

**The Celest Theory:** Celestian theologians argue the third moon was Celest's physical form before her sacrifice. When she transformed into Celestia, her moon-body was left behind—hollow, dead, purposeless. The "Killing Moon" is her corpse, still caught in Alaria's gravity, and when it passes overhead it reminds the entire planar stack of her absence. A wound that never healed.

**The Nydus Heresy:** Certain Malstaric cults deny there ever was a third moon. The "Killing Moon" is Nydus himself, periodically turning his full attention toward the Material Plane. Normally the Black Sun ignores the mortal world. But sometimes—rarely—he *looks*. And when Nydus looks at you, you die.

**The Titan's Eye:** The Titansworn believe the Killing Moon is Hykravones's eye—or one of them—torn out during some ancient battle and left to orbit. When it passes overhead, the Gray Prince stirs in his sleep beneath the earth. The deaths aren't caused by mortals looking at the moon; they're caused by the moon looking at *them*.

##### "Born Under the Third Moon"

This expression carries multiple meanings depending on context:

- **Literally:** Born during a destabilization period. Rare, since most such periods saw massive population collapse. Those born during such times are often considered touched, marked, strange.
- **As descriptor:** Someone affected by catastrophe, marked by doom, chronically unlucky.
- **As insult:** "Cursed," "brings disaster," "bad omen walking."
- **Among Moonwatchers:** "Chosen," "blessed by the returning moon," "destined for greatness when the Third Moon rises again."

The dragon Ural, called "of the Third Moon," was literally born during the last destabilization period. His void-touched nature, his darkness-dwelling habits, his eyes like dead moons—all are attributed to his birth under that poisoned sky.

## Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

The sun passes around the center strip of the sky every day, all year. Alaria has no axial tilt.

Two moons—Auris and Nyxara—pass over at various times throughout their cycles. A third moon once existed but was lost; its absence is remembered in the name "Killing Moon," given to the catastrophic destabilization periods that occur every several thousand years.

Seasons come and go when followers convince Bryn to traverse a different trail across Alaria. When the northern monasteries sing loudest, summer comes to the north; when the southern congregations raise their voices, warmth travels south.

Stars are viewports for the gods. Daemons can look down through them upon their subjects. Stars are usually located above places of importance to the daemon who claims them.

### The Calendar

**Moon cycles:** Auris has an 11-day cycle that marks the week, beginning at new moon and reaching full moon mid-week. Nyxara has a 23-day cycle, meaning roughly once every year there is one double full moon (Brightnight) and one double new moon (Hollownight)—both important holidays.

**The year:** 200 days long, split into eight 25-day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice. Two quarters each of spring, summer, fall, and winter. The hemispheres experience opposite seasons, but the solstice marks new year for all.

**The Great Cycle:** When the solstice coincides with Brightnight or Hollownight, it signals the beginning of a new age. This occurs once every 25,300 years (~14,000 Earth years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years when various lunar alignments fall on significant dates.

**Year counting:** Years are counted forward from 0 to 25,300, then back down again. The suffix F or B indicates whether time is moving forward or backward through the Great Cycle. At year 0, Hollownight falls on the northern summer solstice. At year 25,300, Brightnight falls on new year. Each marks the beginning of a new age.

### Lunar and Solar Celebrations

The moons aligning represents the cycle of magic; the solstice represents the cycle of nature.

**Lunar cultures:** Moon elves and other peoples who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on Brightnight, the monthly rhythms of Nyxara, and the weekly tide of Auris.

**Solar cultures:** Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to magic and more connected to nature. Major celebrations fall on the first day of spring, the solstice/new year, the last week of fall, and the opposite solstice. Winter celebrations are especially important—cheerfulness held against the cold and dark.

Both lunar and solar holidays are observed by most cultures, though the emphasis varies.

### The 11-Day Week

The week follows Auris's cycle, beginning at new moon:

1. **Cautious** (new moon): Stay indoors after dark. The week's most dangerous night.
2. **Wakeday** (waxing crescent): Made it through Cautious. Safe to emerge.
3. **Patrons' Day**: Give thanks to your daemon.
4. **Moil**: A day of work.
5. **Marketday**: Trading and commerce.
6. **Merrynight** (full moon): Auris at its brightest. Stay up late, celebrate.
7. **Brightlove**: The glow continues. A day for joy and connection.
8. **Lazyday**: Rest.
9. **Farewell**: Travelers depart to reach home before Cautious.
10. **Gather**: Prepare supplies and close up for the dark nights ahead.
11. **Fireday** (waning crescent): Burn candles through the night. The last light before darkness.
