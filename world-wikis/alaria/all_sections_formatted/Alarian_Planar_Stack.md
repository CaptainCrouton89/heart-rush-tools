## About Alaria

The Alarian Planar Stack, also commonly known as Alaria, is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several planes, stacked on top of each other. 

## Geography of the Planes

## Material Plane

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies Celestia: the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

### Celestia

Celestia's creation required two events. During the Lyzaria Era (235–180 million years ago), the titan-god Celest sacrificed herself to create a pocket dimension—a seed that would become Celestia. For 115 million years, this seed remained small and hidden. Then came the Ezz Rift: when Melera's music fractured the Alarian Planar Stack, Ezz accumulated around this seed because it was the only structure that resonated with her song. The pocket dimension bloomed into a full plane, peeling away from the Material Plane to become its mirror-image flip side.

This dual origin explains Celestia's strange nature: its *core* is Celest's essence (which is why it serves as a refuge for spirits), but its *substance* is made of Ezz (which is why it reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the living). Where there is thought on the Material Plane, there is a counterpart in Celestia.

## Astral Plane

"Above" the Material Plane is the Astral Plane. Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Aurus, living pawns of his will.

### Astraeva

On the flip side of the Astral Plane is Astraeva—and unlike the other planes, Astraeva is not truly a "place" in the conventional sense. Astraeva is **Aurus himself**, unfiltered.

The Astral Plane is Aurus's light filtered through structure: the islands, the sea, the accumulated souls that buffer his radiance. Astraeva is what remains when those buffers are stripped away—the raw, unmediated presence of the White Sun. It is the reservoir from which all souls are drawn, and the destination to which all souls eventually return.

**The Cycle of Souls**: When a new creature is conceived, a soul is drawn from Astraeva—raw Aurus-essence that passes through the Astral Plane and threads down through the Ethereal to bind with the new spirit. When a creature dies, their soul returns to the Astral Plane, where it persists for a time. But souls do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn souls—those that have cycled through many lives, or those that are forgotten—drift back through to Astraeva, dissolving into Aurus's light to be renewed and eventually drawn forth again.

**The Danger**: Traveling to Astraeva means exposing yourself to Aurus without protection. Your soul is not a separate thing here—it is *part* of Aurus, and the boundary between you and the cosmic source grows thin. Visitors report their sense of self beginning to blur. Memories feel shared. Identity becomes negotiable. Stay too long, and your soul may simply... rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. You would become part of everything, and therefore nothing in particular.

Astraeva is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain definition there. What few beings exist are either echoes of Aurus's will or things that were never truly separate from him to begin with.

## Malstaris

"Below" the Material Plane is Malstaris—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Nydus, living pawns of his will.

### Eindumor

On the flip side of Malstaris is Eindumor—and like Astraeva, Eindumor is not truly a separate plane. Eindumor is **Nydus himself**, unfiltered.

Malstaris is Nydus's darkness filtered through structure: the caverns, the black lakes, the accumulated shadows that give shape to his murk. Eindumor is what remains when those structures are stripped away—the raw, unmediated presence of the Black Sun. It is the reservoir from which all shadows are drawn, and the destination to which all shadows eventually return.

**The Cycle of Shadows**: When a new creature is conceived, a shadow is drawn from Eindumor—raw Nydus-essence that passes through Malstaris and threads up through the Nethereal to bind with the new spirit. When a creature dies, their shadow sinks to Malstaris, where it persists for a time. But shadows do not remain there forever. Eventually, worn shadows—those that have cycled through many lives, or those whose secrets have all been revealed—drift back through to Eindumor, dissolving into Nydus's darkness to be renewed and eventually drawn forth again.

**The Danger**: Traveling to Eindumor means exposing yourself to Nydus without protection. Your shadow is not a separate thing here—it is *part* of Nydus, and the boundary between you and the cosmic source grows thin. Visitors report their secrets beginning to leak. Hidden depths become visible. Everything you've concealed rises to the surface. Stay too long, and your shadow may simply... rejoin the source. You would not die, exactly. You would become part of the primordial dark, and therefore incapable of concealment, of interiority, of self.

Eindumor is nearly empty of defined entities because almost nothing can maintain hidden depths there. What few beings exist are either echoes of Nydus's will or things that never had secrets to begin with.

## Elemental Planes

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the elemental planes, each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the Ethereal and Nethereal Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

## Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry. 

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in Celestia. 

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of Malstaris would take you to Eindumor. 

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or Malstaris requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other planes is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the elemental planes, and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal Planes, none can sustain spirit, soul, or shadow.

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the planar stack. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform magic on Alaria.

## Psywinds

Tags: cosmology, magic

The flow of all thoughts, ideas, and emotions across Alaria. The Psywinds are currents of flowing Ezz that carry the collective mental activity of all living beings within the planar stack. These thoughts pass through all, connecting mind to mind across any distance.

### What the Psywinds Enable

- **Telepathic communication** between creatures attuned to the currents
- **Syncopaths** perceive and manipulate the Psywinds constantly
- **Prayers** can be heard from Celestia through the Psywinds—this is how daemons know when their followers call
- **True names** ripple through the Psywinds; you can hear your true name no matter where it is spoken on Alaria
- **Psy magic** draws power directly from these currents

### Substance

The Psywinds are made of flowing Ezz—the universal substrate that contains both Azus's order and Melera's randomness. After the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the Psywinds became the medium through which spirit-bearing creatures could think, feel, and connect.

### Counterpart: Faesong

The Psywinds and Faesong are the two great ambient magical forces in Alaria:

- **Psywinds** carry *thought* and *intention*—they flow between all minds, generated by the collective mental activity of living beings
- **Faesong** carries *emotion* and *harmony*—it flows from Melera outward, a constant melody underlying all creation

Where the Psywinds are heard as whispers and images, Faesong is felt as harmony or dissonance. Telepaths and psy mages work the Psywinds; druids and fae creatures attune to Faesong.

Some scholars believe these are two aspects of the same phenomenon—that Melera's music is what gives Ezz its capacity for carrying thought and emotion. Others argue they are distinct but complementary, like two instruments in the same orchestra.

### The Psywinds and Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent substrate through which the Psywinds flow. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform psy magic.

## Stars, Suns, and Moons

### Stars

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Koras lives within the sun's blazing core, maintaining its celestial glass and ensuring its light burns steady. Though Koras tends the sun's physical form, it is Bryn—the sun's awakened spirit—who chooses where it travels. Koras is immune to the extreme heat and has served the sun since before it gained consciousness.

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

### Suns

There are three suns within Alaria, each over a different layer of the planar stack.

#### The Sun of the Material Plane

The sun that lights the Material Plane is the greatest of the titan-crafted stars—an immense orb of celestial glass tended by Koras. Unlike Aurus and Nydus, it is not a dissolved titan-god, but a construct that gained consciousness.

##### Bryn, the Sun's Spirit

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria, the sun—previously a mindless mechanism—*woke up*. The Ezz granted it a spark of spirit: a will, a desire, the capacity to want. This awakened consciousness is called Bryn.

Bryn is not a god in the traditional sense. The sun is not sustained by worship like a daemon. But Bryn is *aware*, and Bryn's path across the sky can be influenced by prayer. The sun travels because Bryn chooses to travel. Seasons exist because different congregations across Alaria convince Bryn to traverse different paths—when the northern monasteries sing loudest, the sun travels closer to the north.

The sun is the only celestial body known to have awakened in this way. Why the sun and not the other stars remains a mystery—perhaps its size, perhaps its proximity to the Material Plane, perhaps something else entirely.

#### Aurus, the White Sun

Aurus is a still-living titan-god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was among the first beings created within Alaria. As a titan-god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, the ever-present radiance above the Astral Plane.

Aurus never rises or sets—his light is constant, illuminating all souls on the Astral Plane. The soul itself is made of his essence. His position slowly drifts over millennia, and when he draws closer to the Material Plane's boundary, temperatures below grow warmer.

Aurus is also the source from which all souls are drawn. New souls emerge from his light; worn-out souls eventually return to it. His flip-side, Astraeva, is where his unmediated presence can be experienced—and where souls exist before and after their time bound to mortal spirits.

#### Nydus, the Black Sun

Nydus is a still-living titan-god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was among the first beings created within Alaria. As a titan-god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. He became the Black Sun, the ever-present darkness above Malstaris.

Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely reveals one's shadow—many things lie hidden in its murk. The shadow itself is made of his essence. His slow drift causes cold temperatures to spike around the Material Plane when he draws near.

Nydus controls the Umbral Agents and is the source from which all shadows are drawn. New shadows emerge from his darkness; worn-out shadows eventually return to it. His flip-side, Eindumor, is where his unmediated presence can be experienced—and where shadows exist before and after their time bound to mortal spirits.

## Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

Sun passes around center strip every day, all year. No Tilt. 

Three moons pass over at various times throughout month.

Seasons come and go when followers convince Bryn to traverse a different trail across Alaria.

Stars are viewports for the gods. They can look down upon their subjects. Usually located above some place of importance to them.

Moon cycles: Two main moons, one has 11 day cycles, is used to tell what day of the week it is. Full moon once a week, on the start of the week. The other goes through a 23 day cycle, meaning about once every year there is one double full moon, and one moonless night, each important holidays. The year is 200 days long, split into eight, 25 day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice (no summer v winter with two hemispheres). 2 quarters spring, 2 quarters summer, 2 quarters fall, 2 quarters winter. When solstice (new year) coincides with a double full moon, or a double empty, it signals the beginning of a new age, occurring once every 25,300 years (~18,000 Earth Years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years. 

Moon phase is determined by location of Aurus and Nydus, the light and dark suns respectively. Moons tied to magic of Malstaric and Astral planes.  

Third, rogue moon, known as the Killing Moon. Looking upon it kills you. Comes up once every 8,000 years or so, but isn't consistent. Remains up for same duration, so can mean ~8,000 years of death. 

Years counted forward from 0 to 25,300, and then back down again. The suffix F or B stands for if time is going forward or backward. At 0 there is a double new moon during the northern-summer solstice/southern-winter solstice. At 25,300, there is a double full moon on new-year. Each marks the beginning of a new age. 

Moons aligning represents cycle of magic, whereas new year is cycle of nature. Moon elf, and other cultures who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on dual full moon, etc. 

Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to magic and more so to nature. Celebrations on first day of spring, new-year/solstice, last week of fall, and other solstice. Both are celebrated, though winter ones are more about trying to be cheerful in the face of winter.

Moon and Magic divinely intertwined.

#### 11 days of the week, starting at new moon, going to full, then waning again:

1. Cautious (new moon): Don't go out at night
2. Wakeday (waxing crescent): Made it to next week, can come out now
3. Patrons' Day: Thank your daemon
4. Moil
5. Marketday: Trading happens
6. Merrynight: Full moon, time to stay up late
7. Brightlove: More full moon, time for joy
8. Lazyday
9. Farewell: People leave to return home
10. Gather: Prepare (for fireday and cautious, but also just in general)
11. Fireday (waning crescent): Burn candles during hte night
