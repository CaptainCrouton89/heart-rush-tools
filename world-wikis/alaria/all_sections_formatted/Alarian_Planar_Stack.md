## About Alaria

The Alarian Planar Stack, also commonly known as Alaria, is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several planes, stacked on top of each other. 

## Geography of the Planes

## Material Plane

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies Celesté: the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

### Celesté

Celesté was created when the Alarian Planar Stack fragmented and Ezz poured in from beyond. The material plane peeled apart and a new plane of conceptual existence was born. Emotion, free will, and thought poured into Alaria. Celesté is made of the coalescense of thought/emotion/etc on the material plane. Where there is thought, there is a counterpart to the material planes.

## Astral Plane

"Above" the Material Plane is the Astral Plane. Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Aurus, living pawns of his will.

### Astraeva

On the flip side of the Astral Plane is Astraeva. Astraeva mirrors the Astral Plane but is devoid of souls. Aurus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

## Malstaris

"Below" the Material Plane is Malstaris—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Nydus, living pawns of his will.

### Eindumor

On its flip side of Malstaris is Eindumor. Eindumor mirrors Malstaris but is devoid of shadows. Nydus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

## Elemental Planes

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the elemental planes, each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

## Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the Ethereal and Nethereal Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

## Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry. 

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in Celesté. 

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of Malstaris would take you to Eindumor. 

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or Malstaris requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other planes is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the elemental planes, and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal Planes, none can sustain spirit, soul, or shadow.

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the planar stack. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform magic on Alaria.

## Psywinds

Tags: poi

The flow of all thoughts, ideas, and emotions across Alaria. These thoughts pass through all. It is how telepathic creatures communicate. It allows syncopaths to function. It is also how prayers can be heard from Celesté. You can hear your true name no matter where it is spoken from on Alaria.

The psy winds are made of flowing ezz.

Somewhat related to Faesong.

## Stars, Suns, and Moons

Tags: cosmology, celestial

### Stars

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Lives and maintains the star that is the sun, propelled by Bryn across the sky each day. Immune to the extreme heat from the sun.

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

### Suns

There are three suns within Alaria, each over a different layer of the planar stack.

#### Aurus, the White Sun

Aurus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, up above the Astral Plane.

Very slowly bobs around the sky above the Astral Plane. Its positive energy makes material plane warmer or cooler.

#### Nydus, the Black Sun

Nydus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. He became the Black Sun, up above Malstaris.

The black sun that illuminates all of malstaris. Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely illuminates one's shadow. Many things lie hidden in the dark.

What one's shadow is made of.

Slowly bobs around the sky, causing cold temperatures to spike around the Material Plane.

#### Bryn

Bryn propels the sun across the sky each day.

## Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

Sun passes around center strip every day, all year. No Tilt. 

Three moons pass over at various times throughout month.

Seasons come and go when followers convince Bryn to traverse a different trail across Alaria.

Stars are viewports for the gods. They can look down upon their subjects. Usually located above some place of importance to them.

Moon cycles: Two main moons, one has 11 day cycles, is used to tell what day of the week it is. Full moon once a week, on the start of the week. The other goes through a 23 day cycle, meaning about once every year there is one double full moon, and one moonless night, each important holidays. The year is 200 days long, split into eight, 25 day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice (no summer v winter with two hemispheres). 2 quarters spring, 2 quarters summer, 2 quarters fall, 2 quarters winter. When solstice (new year) coincides with a double full moon, or a double empty, it signals the beginning of a new age, occurring once every 25,300 years (~18,000 Earth Years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years. 

Moon phase is determined by location of Aurus and Nydus, the light and dark suns respectively. Moons tied to magic of Malstaric and Astral planes.  

Third, rogue moon, known as the Killing Moon. Looking upon it kills you. Comes up once every 8,000 years or so, but isn't consistent. Remains up for same duration, so can mean ~8,000 years of death. 

Years counted forward from 0 to 25,300, and then back down again. The suffix F or B stands for if time is going forward or backward. At 0 there is a double new moon during the northern-summer solstice/southern-winter solstice. At 25,300, there is a double full moon on new-year. Each marks the beginning of a new age. 

Moons aligning represents cycle of magic, whereas new year is cycle of nature. Moon elf, and other cultures who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on dual full moon, etc. 

Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to magic and more so to nature. Celebrations on first day of spring, new-year/solstice, last week of fall, and other solstice. Both are celebrated, though winter ones are more about trying to be cheerful in the face of winter.

Moon and Magic divinely intertwined.

#### 11 days of the week, starting at new moon, going to full, then waning again:

1. Cautious (new moon): Don't go out at night
2. Wakeday (waxing crescent): Made it to next week, can come out now
3. Patrons' Day: Thank your daemon
4. Moil
5. Marketday: Trading happens
6. Merrynight: Full moon, time to stay up late
7. Brightlove: More full moon, time for joy
8. Lazyday
9. Farewell: People leave to return home
10. Gather: Prepare (for fireday and cautious, but also just in general)
11. Fireday (waning crescent): Burn candles during hte night
