# Rimihuica

Rimihuica dominates the center of Alaria. The Tarkhon-controlled strait guards its northern approach, which then spills into the Dunes of Kunagi and other desert badlands. Farther south the land rapidly shifts into lethal jungles, cloud-wrapped mountain chains, and the volatile Emerald Coast. The continent ends in the lawless Shacklands, where slave markets and pirate kings hold sway. Rimihuica is a study in contrasts—deserts, jungles, and frontier states separated by mountain walls and storm-lashed coastlines.

## Featured Regions

- **Westrim** – The arid northwest, home to the Dunes of Kunagi and Ishnit Jungles.
- **Innerrim** – The central jungle basin divided by the Cloud Mountains.
- **Emerald Coast** – Tropical coastlines south of the mountain ranges.
- **Shacklands** – Southern territories ruled by the slave trade and criminal powers.
- **Tarkhon Empire** – The strait-spanning empire that controls the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the western oceans.

## Tarkhon

### Geography

The Tarkhon Empire straddles the critical strait between Clueanda and Rimihuica, controlling territory on both continents and dominating the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. This strategic position has made Tarkhon one of the most powerful—and most resented—political entities in the region.

#### Position and Extent

##### On Clueanda (Northern Holdings)
- **Nektuna**: The imperial heartland, controlling the northern shore of the strait
- **Enymu**: Agricultural state east of Nektuna
- **Kerwin**: Halfling kingdom in the far northeast, nominally tributary
- **Astrelle**: Vassal state of Nektuna
- **Vogenfeld**: Uline dwarf settlements in the northern mountains, guarding the passes against Hedroscobb
- **Murth**: Dual-capital state of Rhea scholars and human merchants

##### On Rimihuica (Southern Holdings)
- Extends from the strait southward to the northern shoreline of the Eronia Range
- Controls the coastal lands north of the great mountains that separate it from Westrim and the Dunes of Kunagi

##### Southwestern Holdings (Kingdoms of Fire)
- **Kabir**: Northeastern Neferati kingdom facing the Sea of Merchants
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: Southernmost of the western holdings
- **Yaif**: Western Neferati kingdom

#### The Tarkhon Strait

The empire's lifeblood—a narrow passage connecting the Middle Sea to the open ocean beyond. This chokepoint means all maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world must pass through Tarkhon-controlled waters.

Tarkhetan, the capital, sits directly on the strait. Its massive navy and fire-mage garrison ensure that every ship pays tribute. Those who refuse are burned.

#### Terrain

The Tarkhon heartlands are temperate and green—rolling hills and fertile plains with easy access to the ocean. This is hospitable land that supports both civilization and agriculture, a stark contrast to the desert and jungle that lies south of the Eronia Range.

To the north, the land grows drier as it approaches Kerwin and the volcanic Fireknife Mountains. To the south, the Eronia Range marks the boundary between Tarkhon territory and the lands beyond—mountains that were cleared of hostile inhabitants two centuries ago by Klor the Blood Lord.

#### The Wurmspine

The massive mountain range that forms Tarkhon's northern frontier, separating the empire from the orcish Wildwood and stretching from the coastal regions in the west to the steppes in the east. The Wurmspine is not a single chain but a complex system of interconnected ranges, peaks, and highland regions.

**Major components of the Wurmspine:**
- **Vogenfeld**: The Uline dwarf settlements controlling the main passes against Hedroscobb
- **Murth**: The dual mountains of Mt. Disyus and Mt. Arn, home to Rhea scholars and human merchants
- **Wurn Mountains**: Eastern alpine range home to the Stone Men
- **Fireknife Mountains**: Volcanic range northeast of the Wurn, marking Kerwin's border
- **Freedom's Way**: Mountain passes and highlands west of Vogenfeld
- **Silver Hills**: Rolling mineral-rich highlands
- **Mt. Thryke**: Major peak in Morgnor's Cradle territory
- **Morgnor's Cradle**: Dragon-ruled mountains northwest of Thespia
- **Hills of Nowhere**: Remote highland region
- **Kobuk**: Mountain territory home to surviving Coghead goblins
- **Hills of Hellion**: Treacherous peaks along the range's edge

The Wurmspine serves as both barrier and boundary—protecting Tarkhon from northern invasion while defining the limits of imperial influence. Control of the Wurmspine passes has determined the fate of empires; the dwarves of Vogenfeld have held these passes for centuries, though their loyalty grows strained as Tarkhon forgets its obligations.

### Political Climate

Tarkhon is an empire held together by profit rather than loyalty. Subsidiary states receive preferential trade terms in exchange for fealty, tribute, and cooperation. This arrangement works as long as Tarkhon remains wealthy and powerful—but it means every member is constantly calculating whether the benefits still outweigh the costs.

The current ruler, **King Selron II**, governs from Tarkhetan. His authority is absolute in the core territories but fades rapidly with distance. The Kingdoms of Fire act as a bloc. The dwarven city-states answer to the First Brotherhood as much as to Tarkhon. And Kerwin's immortal king has outlived every emperor for five centuries.

The empire's great symbol is the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame in Tarkhetan's cathedral. The torch was lit when the Neferati founders established the city six centuries ago, kindled from sacred fire they brought north from Yaif. It has burned there ever since, symbol of an empire that has changed hands but never broken.

### What Makes It Interesting

- **The Chokepoint Empire**: Tarkhon's entire economy depends on controlling the strait. If an alternative route opened—overland, magical, or otherwise—the empire would collapse. This makes Tarkhon both desperate to maintain control and paranoid about anything that might threaten it.

- **The Immortal Witness**: King Ulyas of Kerwin remembers the Neferati emperors, the founding families, the old bargains that bound the empire together. He was ancient when Tarkhon was young. His existence is an embarrassment to imperial narratives—he knows things the current dynasty would prefer forgotten, and he has no reason to keep their secrets.

- **The Necessary Monster**: Klor the Blood Lord cleared the southern mountains through systematic genocide. Tarkhon honors him as a hero. The descendants of those he killed—scattered across neighboring lands—remember differently.

- **The Conditional Loyalty**: Every subsidiary state is one bad trade deal away from reconsidering membership. The Kingdoms of Fire negotiate as a bloc. The dwarven cities have their own allegiances. Even loyal Enymu could be turned with the right pressure.

### What Will Go Wrong

- **The Kingdoms of Fire Departure**: If the four Neferati monarchies decided to leave together, Tarkhon would struggle to stop them. Something might push them over the edge—a new trade deal, an insult from Tarkhetan, a better offer from elsewhere. Queen Khalira of Wadiyah is already preparing for something.

- **The Alternative Route**: Someone could discover (or create) a way around the strait. A canal, a portal, a mountain pass, a magical transport network. The moment trade can bypass Tarkhon, the empire dies.

- **Ulyas's Choice**: The immortal king has been playing along for five centuries because it was convenient. If he decided to stop—if he actively opposed the empire—Kerwin's strategic position and his personal power could cause real problems.

- **The Northern Collapse**: Vogenfeld's dwarves have held the northern passes for centuries, but Tarkhon has forgotten to pay them. If the dwarves withdraw—or worse, help the orcs through their secret tunnels—six orcish tribal states from Hedroscobb could sweep south. The orcs have been fighting each other for generations, but if they ever unite, nothing stands between them and Tarkhon except increasingly resentful dwarves.

### Astrelle

Tags: state, nation

A vassal state of Nektuna, occupying the southern shore of the Tarkhon Passage directly across from the imperial capital. Astrelle's strategic position—hosting two of the empire's most critical fortresses—gives it leverage far beyond its size.

#### Position and Borders

Astrelle occupies the northern coast of the Rimihuica continent, facing Nektuna across the strait:
- **North**: The Tarkhon Passage (water)
- **South**: The Eronia Range foothills
- **West**: Territories leading toward the Kingdoms of Fire
- **East**: The passage widening toward the Middle Sea

The state is essentially a coastal strip, its importance entirely derived from its position across from Tarkhetan.

#### Political Status

Astrelle was absorbed into Nektuna's orbit roughly two centuries ago through a combination of marriage alliances and economic pressure. The absorption was peaceful—Astrelle's rulers recognized they couldn't resist Tarkhon's power and negotiated the best terms they could.

The current arrangement makes Astrelle a vassal state:
- Self-governing in internal matters
- Subordinate to Tarkhetan in foreign policy
- Required to host and support imperial fortresses
- Required to provide troops for imperial defense

In exchange, Astrelle receives preferential trade terms and protection. Whether this is a fair bargain depends on who you ask.

#### Duchess Ysmera

The current ruler of Astrelle is **Duchess Ysmera**, a shrewd woman in her sixties who has navigated vassal politics for three decades.

Ysmera's niece, **Vethira**, is married to King Selron II—making the duchess both vassal and family to the crown. This creates awkward dynamics. Is she representing Astrelle's interests at court, or is she there to keep Astrelle in line? Both, probably.

Ysmera walks a careful path: loyal enough to avoid imperial displeasure, independent enough to maintain Astrelle's dignity. She advocates for her people where she can and accepts what she cannot change.

#### Torsnerhun Fortress

The most prestigious military posting in Tarkhon, directly across the Needle from Tarkhetan itself.

Torsnerhun and Tarkhetan together control the Needle—the narrowest point of the strait. Firemages on both shores can burn any ship attempting to run the passage without permission. The two fortresses work in coordination, their fires overlapping to create an impassable barrier.

**Garrison**: ~500 elite soldiers, including a significant firemage detachment. The best equipment, the best training, the best officers.

**Posting**: Torsnerhun is where careers are made. Officers assigned here are on the rise—they've distinguished themselves and are being groomed for higher command. The competition for posting is fierce.

**Commander**: **General Halric Vance**, a decorated veteran in his fifties. Loyal to the crown, respected by his troops, and aware that his position makes him a political figure whether he likes it or not.

#### Sharvatunis Fortress

The eastern guardian of the Tarkhon Passage, watching the approaches from the Middle Sea.

Sharvatunis sits on Astrelle's eastern coast, positioned to intercept any fleet approaching from the east before it reaches the Needle. It's the first line of defense against naval threats from the Middle Sea kingdoms.

**Garrison**: ~300 soldiers, professional but not elite. Adequate equipment, adequate training. Good enough for a posting that rarely sees action.

**Posting**: Sharvatunis is neither prestigious nor punishing—it's simply a solid, respectable assignment. Officers serve their terms, do their jobs, and move on. Nothing exciting happens, but nothing terrible either.

**Commander**: **Captain Mira Solent**, a career officer in her forties. Competent, unambitious, and content to run a well-maintained fortress until retirement.

#### Terrain and Climate

Similar to Nektuna—warm Mediterranean climate, rocky coastline, olive groves and vineyards on the hillsides. The land rises toward the Eronia Range in the south, becoming rougher and less populated as elevation increases.

#### Population

Astrelle is primarily human, with smaller populations of Craven and others. The people are culturally similar to Nektuna—same language, same customs, same religion centered on the Evertorch—but they maintain a distinct identity as Astrellans rather than Nektunans.

There's a quiet resentment of vassal status among some Astrellans, particularly the old noble families who remember independence. But most have adapted. The trade benefits are real. The alternative—defiance—would be catastrophic.

#### Economy

Astrelle's economy is largely agricultural—olives, wine, grain—supplemented by fishing and minor trade. The fortresses bring some economic activity, but the real money flows through Tarkhetan across the water.

Astrellans complain that they do the work while Nektuna takes the profit. This is largely true. But they also acknowledge that without Nektuna's protection, someone else would take both the work and the profit.

#### The Awkward Position

Astrelle hosts two of the empire's most critical fortresses. This gives Duchess Ysmera leverage—Tarkhon needs Astrelle's cooperation to maintain control of the strait.

But it also makes Astrelle a permanent military zone. Imperial troops are always present. Imperial officers report to Tarkhetan, not to the duchess. In theory, Astrelle governs itself. In practice, the fortresses are imperial territory that happens to be surrounded by Astrellan land.

If Astrelle ever seriously considered independence, those fortresses would turn inward very quickly.

### Chykum

Tags: city, state, nation

A city-state in Tarkhon.

TODO

### Copper Hills

Tags: hills, geography

Low, scrubby hills in western Kerwin, rich with copper ore. The hills provide Kerwin's modest mining industry and contain mysteries older than the halflings who work them.

#### Geography

The Copper Hills rise gently from the farmland surrounding Tarkha, their ruddy soil giving them their name. They're not dramatic—more rumpled than mountainous—but they extend for miles, dotted with mine shafts, quarries, and the occasional hardy farm.

The hills mark the transition between Kerwin's agricultural heartland and the wilder territories to the west. Beyond the Copper Hills, the land grows rougher and less settled.

#### Mining

The town of **Chykum** serves as the center of Kerwin's mining industry. Halflings and a smattering of dwarven advisors extract copper from the earth, producing enough to meet Kerwin's needs and trade surplus to Tarkhon merchants.

The mining is modest by Tarkhon standards—no great industrial operations, no slave labor, no environmental devastation. The halflings dig what they need, trade what they don't, and leave the rest in the ground for future generations.

#### The Old Workings

The Copper Hills are older than the halflings—older than Tarkhon, older than recorded history. Ancient mine shafts riddle the deeper hills, their origins unknown. These workings were here when the halflings arrived. Whoever dug them is long gone.

Halfling miners occasionally break through into these old tunnels. They find:
- Strange tools made of materials that resist identification
- Carvings in languages no one recognizes
- Chambers that should have collapsed centuries ago but haven't
- Sometimes, things that move in the darkness

A sensible miner seals such discoveries and moves on. The old workings are bad luck. Everyone knows this. No one asks why.

#### Chykum

The largest settlement in the Copper Hills, serving as both mining center and market town for the surrounding area. Chykum has a population of perhaps two thousand—large by Kerwin standards—and maintains the only real metalworking facilities in the kingdom.

Dwarven advisors from the First Brotherhood maintain a small presence here, ostensibly to help with technical mining questions. Whether they're also keeping an eye on Kerwin for the Brotherhood is a matter of speculation.

### Ekfusy

Tags: fortress, poi

A functional but miserable fortress on Midton Island, watching the eastern approaches to the Tarkhon Passage.

#### Position

Midton Island sits south of Enymu, in the eastern portion of the passage where the strait begins to widen toward the Middle Sea. Ekfusy fortress guards this approach—any ship entering the passage from the east passes within sight of its walls.

#### Strategic Value

Ekfusy is the eastern counterpart to Fort Tenze in the west—a secondary checkpoint to catch anything that might slip past the Needle. In theory, it's vital to the empire's defense.

In practice, nothing ever happens at Ekfusy. The Needle catches everything. Ships that make it past Tarkhetan are already taxed and documented. The eastern fortress exists mostly as insurance against scenarios that never occur.

#### The Worst Posting in Tarkhon

Ekfusy is where careers go to die.

The island has nothing. No city, no town, barely any villages—just the fortress, its garrison, and miles of rocky coastline. The nearest entertainment is a fishing hamlet where the locals resent the soldiers. Supply ships come once a month if the weather cooperates.

Soldiers assigned to Ekfusy are either being punished, have offended someone powerful, or drew the shortest straw in their regiment. Officers posted here have usually done something to deserve it—though sometimes it's just bad luck.

#### Conditions

The fortress itself is adequate—maintained, defensible, properly supplied. The crown hasn't neglected its physical structure.

Everything else is miserable:
- No women (the fishing hamlet's daughters learned long ago to stay away from the garrison)
- No entertainment beyond gambling and drinking
- No advancement opportunities (nothing happens, so there's nothing to distinguish oneself)
- Months of boredom punctuated by inspections from officers who clearly don't want to be there either

Discipline has... relaxed. The garrison does its job—watches the strait, maintains the fortress, reports to Tarkhetan—but initiative died years ago. Officers look the other way at minor infractions. Smugglers have been known to pay Ekfusy's commanders to report "nothing unusual" about certain ships.

#### The Garrison

Roughly 200 soldiers, mostly conscripts and punishment postings. A handful of career soldiers who've resigned themselves to mediocrity. One or two officers hoping to serve their time and escape.

The current commander, **Captain Theras Vold**, is a competent man who made enemies in Tarkhetan. He does his job, keeps the fortress functional, and drinks more than is healthy. He'll serve his term and retire, assuming he doesn't drink himself to death first.

#### The One Advantage

Ekfusy is far from politics. No one watches, no one cares, no one interferes. For soldiers who just want to be left alone—for whatever reason—it's oddly peaceful.

Some say there are men at Ekfusy with pasts they're running from. The fortress asks no questions. Do your job, keep your head down, and no one from the mainland will bother you.

### Enymu

Tags: state, nation

The breadbasket of Tarkhon—a farming state that feeds the empire but sees little of the wealth. Bordered by the forbidden Stone Forest to the west and the Wurn Mountains to the north.

#### Position and Borders

Enymu occupies the northeastern portion of Tarkhon's core territory:
- **West**: Nektuna (and the Stone Forest on the border)
- **North**: The Wurn Mountains (home to the Stone Men)
- **East**: Frontier territories, eventually leading to Kerwin
- **South**: The Tarkhon Passage (Midton Island and Ekfusy fortress lie offshore)

The state is landlocked except for a small coastal stretch in the southeast, which provides limited access to the passage but no significant harbors.

#### Terrain and Climate

Temperate continental climate—warm summers, cold winters, and reliable rainfall that makes the land excellent for farming. The central lowlands are almost entirely cultivated, a patchwork of grain fields, vegetable plots, and pastures.

The terrain rises gradually toward the Wurn Mountains in the north, with rolling hills and sheep pastures in the foothills. The eastern reaches are more forested, providing timber for construction and fuel.

#### Aldrichold

The capital of Enymu, sitting at the junction of the Greenway (the main road to Tarkhetan) and the river that waters the central farmlands.

Aldrichold is more large town than true city—perhaps 15,000 people, mostly involved in administration, trade, and supporting the royal household. The palace is a fortified manor house, comfortable but not grand. The Aldric kings have never seen the point of showing off.

The town has a central market, several temples (including one to the Evertorch, modestly attended), guild halls for the craftsmen, and warehouses where grain is stored before shipment to Nektuna.

#### The Stone Forest

The western border between Enymu and Nektuna is marked by one of Alaria's great mysteries: an entire forest transformed into stone.

Every tree stands petrified in perfect detail—bark, branches, leaves, all gray stone. Animals caught in the transformation remain frozen: birds mid-flight, deer mid-leap, a bear eternally rising on its hind legs. The forest is silent except for wind through stone branches.

**The Forbidden Zone**: Entry to the Stone Forest is forbidden by ancient pact between Enymu and Nektuna. No one remembers exactly when the pact was made or why. Everyone knows the rule: stay out.

**The Titan Crystals**: In the roots of the stone trees grow crystalline formations that ring at a frequency only titans can hear. If disturbed by sentient touch, these crystals might wake the **Hykravones**—slumbering titans buried deep beneath the earth.

**The Wardens**: Enymu's Stone Wardens patrol the forest's borders, turning away anyone who approaches. They don't enter the forest themselves. They just make sure no one else does.

**The Pressure**: Scholars from Tarkhetan want access. They call the pact "superstition." High Warden Gellert and Lord Councillor Beren have refused. But King Selron has been pressuring King Aldric, and Aldric trusts Selron...

#### The Wurn Mountains

The northern border of Enymu is defined by the Wurn Mountains—a range of peaks inhabited by the **Stone Men**, a human subculture with gray, rock-hard skin from generations of elemental exposure.

The Stone Men are serious, blunt, and pragmatic. They keep to themselves in their high valleys, herding sheep and goats, trading occasionally with lowland Enymu. Relations are generally peaceful but not warm—the Stone Men find lowlanders soft, and lowlanders find Stone Men unsettling.

Occasionally, trouble comes down from the mountains: bandits using the peaks as refuge, monsters driven from their lairs, or raids by Stone Men bands who've decided the lowlands have something worth taking. Enymu's army handles these problems, but the northern frontier is never entirely quiet.

#### The Greenway

The main road connecting Enymu to Tarkhetan and the rest of Tarkhon. Well-maintained by Enymese standards (which means passable but not paved), the Greenway carries most of the grain, wool, and livestock that flows from Enymu to Nektuna's markets.

Traveling the Greenway, you pass through the heart of Enymu's farmland: villages every few miles, fields stretching to the horizon, the occasional fortified manor house where local lords administer their lands.

#### The Craven Communities

Enymu's substantial Craven minority lives throughout the state, but several towns have particularly large populations:

- **Stoneheart Vale**: Named for the noble family that rose from Craven commoners, this town in the eastern hills is majority Craven and proud of it.
- **Borderwatch**: A town near the Stone Forest staffed largely by Craven Stone Wardens.

Unlike in Nektuna, Craven here face no legal discrimination. They farm, trade, serve in the army, and even hold noble titles. Craven from Nektuna sometimes emigrate for better treatment.

#### Relationship with Nektuna

Enymu is loyal to Tarkhon—but that loyalty shouldn't be mistaken for enthusiasm.

The relationship is fundamentally exploitative. Enymu produces; Nektuna profits. Enymu's grain feeds Tarkhetan's population, but Nektuna's merchants set the prices. The wealth flows out, and the Enymese see little return.

King Aldric IV maintains the relationship because:
1. He genuinely believes King Selron is his friend
2. His ancestors accepted these terms
3. The alternative—defiance—seems worse

His advisors are less naive. Lord Councillor Beren handles most negotiations with Tarkhetan precisely because he doesn't trust Nektuna's envoys. Marshal Kira Stoneheart maintains Enymu's military at respectable strength because she knows that respect requires capability.

For now, Enymu remains loyal. But younger Enymese are asking questions. And someday, King Aldric will learn what Selron really thinks of him.

#### Points of Interest

**The Grain Exchange**: A large warehouse complex in Aldrichold where Enymu's harvest is collected, graded, and sold to Nektuna's merchants. The prices set here determine whether Enymese farmers prosper or merely survive.

**The Old Stones**: A ring of standing stones in the northern hills, predating human settlement. The Stone Men consider it sacred. Local Enymese avoid it.

**The Warden's Tower**: High Warden Gellert's headquarters, overlooking the Stone Forest from a safe distance. Contains generations of records about the forest—and the one ancient text that explains why entry is forbidden.

### Eronia Range

Tags: mountains, geography

TODO

### Fireknife Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

Part of the greater Wurmspine range, the Fireknife is a volcanic segment along the northwestern border of Kerwin, marking the boundary between settled Tarkhon territory and the wild lands beyond. Dangerous, unstable, and largely avoided by sensible travelers.

#### Geography

The Fireknife range rises sharply from the rolling farmland of Kerwin, its peaks jagged and asymmetrical—the result of volcanic activity that has never fully ceased. The mountains smoke constantly, venting sulfurous gases from countless fissures. At night, the peaks sometimes glow red where magma approaches the surface.

The range is not as tall as some mountain chains, but what it lacks in height it makes up for in hostility. The rock is unstable, prone to sudden collapses and rockslides. Hot springs bubble in unexpected places, sometimes scalding and sometimes merely warm. Paths that were safe last month may be impassable now.

#### Climate and Hazards

The Fireknife creates its own weather. Warm air rising from volcanic vents meets cooler air from the surrounding lands, producing unpredictable fog, sudden rainstorms, and occasionally ash falls when a vent becomes particularly active.

Known hazards include:
- **Sudden venting**: Fissures can open without warning, releasing superheated gas or magma
- **Unstable ground**: What looks like solid rock may be thin crust over hollow chambers
- **Toxic air**: Some valleys collect poisonous gases in concentrations that kill without warning
- **Hot springs**: Range from pleasantly warm to instantly lethal, often indistinguishable until tested

#### The Shrine

Somewhere deep in the Fireknife is a shrine—old, hidden, and hungry. King Ulyas of Kerwin travels there once a year with prisoners and criminals. He returns alone.

No one else has found the shrine and returned to speak of it. Whether this is because the shrine is well-hidden or because it doesn't allow witnesses is unclear.

The halflings of Kerwin tell stories about the shrine, though they're careful about when and where. Something waits there. Something that predates Tarkhon, predates Kerwin, predates perhaps the halflings themselves. It requires blood to continue existing. Ulyas has been paying that price for nearly nine centuries.

#### Wildlife

The Fireknife supports a harsh ecosystem of creatures adapted to volcanic conditions. Fire-resistant insects, heat-tolerant reptiles, and occasional fire elementals can be found on the slopes. Nothing large survives here—the environment is too hostile for creatures that can't find shelter from sudden venting.

#### Travel

Travel through the Fireknife is possible but inadvisable. A few passes exist that are relatively stable, but "relatively" is doing heavy lifting. Guides who know the current state of the paths can be hired in Kerwin, though they charge substantial fees and refuse to go too deep.

No roads cross the Fireknife. Anyone who needs to reach the lands beyond goes around.

#### Relationship to Other Volcanic Ranges

The Fireknife is sometimes confused with the Fleimrut Mountains to the south, which share some volcanic characteristics. However, the Fleimrut is fed by an unstable Yolus leyline and has experienced recent catastrophic eruptions (the Fleimrut Awakening). The Fireknife has no known leyline connection and maintains a more consistent—if still dangerous—level of activity.

### Fleimrut Mountains

Tags: mountains

Extremely treacherous. Underground fire-geysers are all over the place. Lots of caves, equally treacherous.

#### The Fleimrut Awakening

The fire-geysers that dominate the mountain range are fed by a Yolus leyline that has never achieved stability. This volatile magical current has made the Fleimrut a zone of perpetual fire hazard, but in 2500 SD, the situation escalated catastrophically.

In what scholars and locals call "The Fleimrut Awakening," the geysers erupted with unprecedented violence. Since then, Emberlords and Cinder Swarms pour from the vents with alarming frequency, turning the mountains into an active war zone between the physical and elemental planes. The eruptions continue with unpredictable intensity, making travel through the region increasingly dangerous.

#### Fire-Trolls & Elemental Symbiosis

Home to a large population of fire-trolls—trolls attuned to fire and shaped by the mountain's hostile environment. Over generations, these creatures have developed a strange symbiosis with the fire elementals that emerge from the unstable Yolus leyline.

Rather than being destroyed by these entities, fire-trolls have learned to coexist with them, developing an unusual cultural and biological relationship. They function as intermediaries between the physical and elemental realms, brokering uneasy peace in the mountain's violent landscape. However, this symbiosis has also made them valuable—and dangerous—as both allies and weapons in the hands of those who understand how to negotiate with them.

### Fort Tenze

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi

The cursed ruins of a once-vital fortress on Pyris Island's eastern coast.

#### Position

Fort Tenze guards a secondary chokepoint west of the Needle—not as critical as the main strait, but significant. Ships attempting to bypass Tarkhetan's tariffs by hugging the western coast would pass within range of Fort Tenze's walls.

Or they would, if the fortress still functioned.

#### History

Fort Tenze was built during the Neferati era, one of several fortresses securing Tarkhon's control of the passage. For centuries it functioned as intended—garrisoned, maintained, watching the western approaches.

During the **Severance** (~300 years ago), the civil war that ended Neferati rule, Fort Tenze's garrison chose the losing side. They held for the Neferati claimant while the human faction took Tarkhetan itself.

When the victors came to take the fortress, something went wrong.

The details are disputed. Some historical accounts say the garrison's firemages lost control during the final assault, consuming themselves and the fortress in magical backlash. Others say the Neferati commander performed a desperate ritual—a curse, a summoning, a final act of spite. What's certain is that Fort Tenze burned with unnatural fire.

The flames were eventually extinguished, but the wrongness remained.

#### The Curse

Fort Tenze's stones are twisted in ways that shouldn't be possible. Walls that were straight now curve. Stairs lead to nowhere. Rooms that should connect don't. The geometry is subtly, persistently wrong.

More disturbing are the effects on people who stay too long:
- Workers report whispers in languages they don't understand
- Figures appear in peripheral vision—never when looked at directly
- Dreams of burning, of being trapped in walls, of fire that doesn't consume but doesn't stop
- Equipment fails at critical moments. Stones won't set. Mortar cracks overnight.
- People disappear. Not often, but enough.

Three times the crown has ordered Fort Tenze rebuilt. Three times the attempt has been abandoned after casualties and failures. The current policy is to ignore it.

#### Current State

The fortress is empty of official presence. The Pyrisi avoid it—they tell stories to keep children away.

Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, taking advantage of the unguarded chokepoint. But even they don't stay long. A few hours to transfer cargo, then gone before nightfall. Nobody sleeps in Fort Tenze.

Some say there's a presence in the deepest ruins—where the Neferati commander made his last stand. Treasure hunters occasionally go looking. They rarely come back.

#### Strategic Implications

The absence of Fort Tenze creates a gap in Tarkhon's defenses. Smugglers exploit it. Fast ships can slip through the western passage without paying tariffs.

This costs the crown money, but not enough to justify another attempt at rebuilding. Some on the royal council want to try anyway—with priests, exorcists, whatever it takes. Others say the risk isn't worth it.

And some whisper that certain parties—smugglers, merchants who profit from contraband, even foreign powers—would prefer Fort Tenze stay ruined. Perhaps some of them are ensuring it stays that way.

### Gissemari

Tags: state, nation

The artistic heart of the Kingdoms of Fire. Where Yaif preserves tradition and Kabir accumulates wealth, Gissemari creates beauty. The Neferati passion burns here in forges and workshops, producing masterworks that collectors across Alaria pay fortunes to acquire.

#### Position and Borders

Gissemari occupies the southern-central portion of the Neferati peninsula:
- **North**: Yaif and Kabir
- **South**: Wadiyah
- **East and West**: Coastline and the Sea of Merchants

The terrain is more varied here than in the other kingdoms—volcanic highlands, fertile valleys, and a coastline of hidden coves and artist retreats.

#### The Flame of the Forge

Gissemari's Eternal Flame burns in the **Great Forge of Gissemari**—not a temple but a working smithy, the largest and oldest in the world. Here, master craftsmen have created legendary works for millennia, their creations heated in fire that has burned since before mortal hands shaped metal.

The Great Forge is:
- A working facility where master smiths create weapons, jewelry, and art
- A sacred site where the flame is tended by priest-smiths who see no distinction between craft and worship
- A school where apprentices spend decades learning techniques passed down for generations
- A museum holding examples of the greatest works ever produced here

Items forged in the Great Forge are marked with its sigil—three flames intertwined. This mark is guarantee of quality, worth more than the materials themselves.

#### Terrain and Climate

Moderate by Neferati standards—hot but with reliable rainfall from ocean moisture. The volcanic soil is exceptionally fertile, supporting agriculture that feeds the kingdom's artisan population.

The landscape is beautiful: dramatic volcanic peaks, lush valleys, and a coastline that artists have painted for generations. Many believe Gissemari's natural beauty inspires its cultural achievements.

#### Capital: Forgeheart

Built around the Great Forge, Forgeheart is a city of artists, craftsmen, and those who serve them. Every street has workshops. Every plaza has galleries. The air smells of hot metal, exotic woods, and the oils used in painting.

**Population**: ~55,000

The city sprawls without plan—buildings added as needed over centuries, creating a maze of streets that locals navigate by landmark and outsiders navigate with difficulty. The architecture ranges from ancient stone structures to experimental designs that challenge conventional engineering.

Forgeheart is loud with the ring of hammers, the roar of furnaces, and the passionate arguments of artists about technique, meaning, and whether that particular shade of red truly captures the essence of flame.

#### Prince-Consort Vhelan

Gissemari is technically ruled by **Queen Ishari**, who is seven years old. In practice, her father **Prince-Consort Vhelan** rules as regent—and will continue until Ishari comes of age in a decade.

Vhelan is forty-one, an accomplished sculptor in his own right, and utterly uninterested in politics. He married the previous queen for love, not ambition, and found himself regent when she died in childbirth.

**Appearance**: Paint-stained hands, distracted expression, horns carved with intricate patterns he did himself. He looks like what he is: an artist forced to do administrative work.

**Philosophy**: Beauty matters. Politics doesn't. Let Yaif worry about tradition and Kabir about money and Wadiyah about vengeance. Gissemari should focus on what it does best: creating things that will last forever.

**Role in the Council**: The reluctant mediator. Vhelan has no strong opinions about Tarkhon policy, which paradoxically makes him valuable—he can break deadlocks between Seraphel's patience, Rashaan's accommodation, and Khalira's confrontation. His votes go whichever way ends the meeting fastest so he can get back to his studio.

#### The Artisan Guilds

Real power in Gissemari lies with the guilds that organize its craftsmen:

**The Smiths' Brotherhood**: Metalworkers of all kinds, from weaponsmiths to jewelers. The oldest and most prestigious guild, directly connected to the Great Forge.

**The Painters' Circle**: Artists working in pigment on any surface. Famous for their fire-portraits that seem to flicker with inner light.

**The Sculptors' Academy**: Shapers of stone, metal, and stranger materials. Vhelan rose through their ranks.

**The Weavers' Compact**: Textile artists creating fabrics that shimmer like flame.

**The Glassblowers' Union**: Masters of volcanic glass, creating works of impossible delicacy.

Each guild governs itself, trains its apprentices, and jealously guards its techniques. The throne can request, but the guilds decide.

#### Culture

Gissemari lives for creation. The Neferati passion that in other kingdoms drives conquest or commerce here drives art.

Every Gissemari citizen is expected to practice some form of craft, even if only as hobby. Children apprentice from young ages. Status comes from skill rather than birth or wealth. The greatest artists are celebrities, their works fought over by collectors.

Fire ceremonies here incorporate performance art—fire dancing that tells stories, flame sculptures that form and reform, collaborative works created in the heat of the moment and allowed to burn away.

Innovation is sacred. Gissemari artists constantly experiment with new techniques, new materials, new forms of expression. Tradition exists to be built upon, not preserved unchanged.

#### Military

**Size**: Small

**Quality**: Medium

**Character**: Defensive and specialized

Gissemari maintains the smallest military of the four kingdoms, relying on its neighbors for protection. What forces it has are equipped with the finest weapons in the world—Forge-marked blades and armor that make individual soldiers far more effective.

The kingdom's real military value lies in production. In any conflict, Gissemari's forges would arm the Fire alliance. The smiths can produce quality weapons faster than any competitor.

#### Young Queen Ishari

The nominal ruler of Gissemari is **Queen Ishari**, seven years old and already showing artistic talent—she paints with surprising sophistication for her age.

Ishari is bright, curious, and largely unaware of the political complexities surrounding her. Her father shields her from Council matters, wanting her to have a childhood before the burdens of rule.

This creates uncertainty. When Ishari comes of age, what kind of ruler will she be? Will she share her father's disinterest in politics? Will she prove more ambitious? The other monarchs—and Tarkhon—are watching carefully.

#### The Art Market

Gissemari works command extraordinary prices across Alaria. A Forge-marked blade might cost as much as a small estate. A master painter's portrait might fund a merchant house for a year.

This creates economic power of a different kind than Kabir's. Gissemari doesn't trade in volume—it trades in excellence. The wealthy of every kingdom, including Tarkhon's nobility, depend on Gissemari for status symbols.

King Selron II has a Gissemari sword. Admiral Kessa Thorn commissioned a Gissemari portrait. High Priestess Salenne wears Gissemari jewelry. In a sense, Gissemari already owns part of Tarkhetan—the part that cares about beautiful things.

#### Relationship with Other Kingdoms

**With Yaif**: Respectful. Gissemari artists often seek Yaif's blessing for works intended for sacred purposes. The ancient traditions inspire modern creation.

**With Kabir**: Mutually beneficial. Kabir's merchants distribute Gissemari works; Kabir's wealth funds Gissemari commissions. Art needs patrons.

**With Wadiyah**: Uneasy. Queen Khalira has little patience for art that doesn't serve political ends. Prince-Consort Vhelan finds her intensity exhausting.

**With Tarkhon**: Complicated by commerce. Gissemari sells to anyone who can pay, including Tarkhon's elite. Some Neferati find this distasteful—providing beauty to those who stole their empire. Gissemari artists argue that their works carry Neferati culture into the enemy's homes, a conquest of aesthetic rather than arms.

### Kabir

Tags: state, nation

The northeastern Kingdom of Fire, facing the Sea of Merchants. The wealthiest of the four kingdoms, built on trade rather than tradition. Where Yaif preserves the past and Gissemari creates beauty, Kabir makes money—and uses that money to maintain Neferati influence in a world that would rather forget them.

#### Position and Borders

Kabir occupies the northeastern portion of the Neferati peninsula:
- **West**: Yaif
- **South**: Gissemari
- **North and East**: The Sea of Merchants, with direct access to major trade routes

The coastline is gentler here than in Yaif—natural harbors, sandy beaches between volcanic headlands, and ports that have welcomed traders for millennia.

#### The Flame of the Lighthouse

Kabir's Eternal Flame burns in the **Great Lighthouse of Kabir**—a tower rising from a rocky promontory at the harbor's mouth. The flame has guided ships safely to port since before human memory. It never wavers, never dims, and can be seen from forty miles at sea.

The lighthouse is both sacred site and practical infrastructure. The priests who tend it are also harbor pilots, guiding ships through the treacherous approaches. The flame that represents Neferati spirituality also makes Kabir's trade possible.

This duality defines Kabir: sacred fire put to practical use. The other kingdoms sometimes find this crass. Kabir finds it practical.

#### Terrain and Climate

Hot but less arid than Yaif, thanks to sea breezes and more reliable rainfall. The coastal lowlands support intensive agriculture—vegetables, fruits, and the famous Kabiri peppers that burn hotter than any spice known.

The interior rises toward volcanic hills shared with Gissemari, but most of Kabir's population clusters along the coast, where the trade is.

#### Capital: Harborflame

The largest city in the Kingdoms of Fire, built around the natural harbor protected by the Great Lighthouse. Harborflame is a bustling commercial center—warehouses, trading houses, shipyards, and markets that never close.

**Population**: ~80,000

The city is loud, crowded, and prosperous. Merchants from across Tarkhon and beyond come here to trade, despite the heat that makes non-Neferati miserable. The money is worth the discomfort.

Architecture in Harborflame is practical rather than beautiful—warehouses built for storage, homes built for comfort, temples that double as meeting halls. The one exception is the Lighthouse complex, which combines function with genuine grandeur.

#### King Rashaan

The ruler of Kabir is **King Rashaan**, a merchant-king who built his fortune before inheriting the throne and has continued building it since.

Rashaan is fifty-two years old, sharp-minded, and pragmatic to a fault. He believes in profit, stability, and deals that benefit both parties. Ideology bores him. Results matter.

**Appearance**: Well-fed but not fat. Expensive clothes in understated styles. Shrewd eyes that calculate the value of everything they see. His horns are decorated with gold caps—a merchant's affectation.

**Philosophy**: Rashaan believes the Neferati will thrive through economic power, not military confrontation. Control the trade, and you control everything. Why fight Tarkhon when you can make them dependent on your ports, your goods, your financing?

**Role in the Council**: The voice of accommodation. Rashaan consistently argues for maintaining good relations with Tarkhon, accepting profitable arrangements, and waiting for economic leverage to achieve what military force cannot.

His detractors—especially Queen Khalira—call him a collaborator. He calls them children who don't understand how power actually works.

#### The Merchant Houses

Kabir's real power lies in its great merchant houses—trading families that have accumulated wealth over generations. The throne can propose, but the merchant houses dispose. No king of Kabir has successfully defied them.

Major houses include:

**House Emberfin**: Controls shipping and shipbuilding. Their vessels carry goods across the Sea of Merchants.

**House Coalgrip**: Dominates the spice trade, particularly Kabiri peppers. Their contracts span continents.

**House Ashmarket**: Financiers and moneylenders. They've bankrolled kingdoms—including, rumor has it, King Selron II himself during a cash-flow crisis.

King Rashaan rose from House Ashmarket. He married into the royal line and inherited when his father-in-law died. Some say he bought the throne. He says he earned it.

#### Culture

Kabir is innovative where Yaif is traditional, but its innovation is commercial rather than artistic. New financial instruments, new trade routes, new ways of moving goods and money—Kabir invents these the way Gissemari invents art.

The Neferati passion here is channeled into deal-making. Merchants negotiate with the same intensity that priests in Yaif bring to ritual. A good trade is a beautiful thing. A great trade is transcendent.

Fire ceremonies in Kabir are shorter than elsewhere—time is money. Fire dancing incorporates competitive elements—traders challenging each other. The eternal flame burns in a lighthouse, guiding ships to profit.

Some Neferati find this vulgar. Kabir finds it honest.

#### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: Medium

**Character**: Naval and defensive

Kabir maintains a significant navy—necessary to protect its trade routes—and enough land forces to defend its borders. But the kingdom prefers to solve problems with money rather than blood.

Why fight a war when you can buy the outcome you want? Why maintain a massive army when you can hire mercenaries for specific needs? Kabir's wealth is its military strength.

#### The Money Question

Kabir's wealth creates complicated politics.

The kingdom is the most prosperous in the Fire bloc—which means it contributes the most to collective efforts. Kabir funds the Council of Four Flames. Kabir subsidizes Wadiyah when harvests fail. Kabir bankrolls any military buildup the bloc might undertake.

This gives Kabir leverage, but also obligation. The other kingdoms resent their dependence on Kabir's money even as they accept it. King Rashaan sometimes wonders if the bloc is alliance or expense.

#### Relationship with Tarkhon

Kabir has the closest relationship with Tarkhon of any Fire kingdom—which means the most complicated relationship.

The kingdom trades extensively through Tarkhon-controlled ports. Kabiri merchants operate in Tarkhetan. Kabiri ships pay Tarkhon tariffs. The economic ties are deep and profitable for both sides.

This makes Kabir reluctant to rock the boat. Any conflict with Tarkhon would devastate Kabiri trade. King Rashaan has worked hard to maintain good relations—so hard that some question where his loyalty truly lies.

But Rashaan is still Neferati. He still remembers the Severance. He still believes the Evertorch belongs to the Fire. He's just not willing to burn his kingdom's economy to prove it.

#### Relationship with Other Kingdoms

**With Yaif**: Distant but respectful. Yaif provides spiritual legitimacy; Kabir provides money. Neither fully approves of the other.

**With Gissemari**: Friendly. Kabir funds many Gissemari artists and commissions work for its merchant houses. Art and commerce mix well.

**With Wadiyah**: Tense. Queen Khalira calls Rashaan a traitor to Neferati values. Rashaan calls Khalira a fool who will get them all killed. The Council meetings can get heated.

#### The Calculation

King Rashaan is always calculating. Every decision runs through the same analysis: What does this cost? What does it return? What's the risk?

He calculates that the Neferati will eventually reclaim Tarkhon—but through economic dominance, not military conquest. In a century, Kabiri money will fund half of Tarkhetan. In two centuries, Kabir might own the throne without ever drawing a sword.

Unless Queen Khalira does something stupid first.

### Kerwin

Tags: state, nation

The northeastern territory of the Tarkhon Empire—though "territory" implies more control than Tarkhon actually exercises. Kerwin is a land of rolling farmland and quiet villages, ruled by an immortal halfling king who predates the empire by centuries.

#### Position and Borders

Kerwin occupies the northeastern corner of Tarkhon's claimed territory, bounded by:
- **West**: Enymu and the broader Tarkhon heartland
- **Northwest**: The Fireknife Mountains (volcanic, dangerous)
- **East and South**: Sparsely populated frontier lands

The region sits at the edge of imperial attention—far enough from the strait to be strategically unimportant, close enough to be claimed.

#### Terrain and Climate

Kerwin is semi-arid but fertile enough for farming. The land rolls gently from the Fireknife foothills in the northwest down toward the coastal lowlands. Summers are hot and dry; winters are cold but brief. Rain comes in spring and autumn, enough to sustain wheat, barley, and extensive sheep pastures.

The landscape has a faded grandeur—roads too wide for their traffic, bridges built for armies that never came, the bones of imperial ambition overgrown with wildflowers.

#### Tarkha

The capital of Kerwin—an ancient city that predates Tarkhon itself.

Tarkha was already old when the Neferati came north. The halflings had built it for their own purposes: wide avenues for their festivals, great plazas for their markets, a palace for kings who expected to rule forever. When Tarkhon absorbed Kerwin five centuries ago, the empire's architects found a city that needed no improvement.

Tarkha is grander than most expect from a halfling city. The halflings built it for a king who expected to rule forever, and the architecture reflects those ambitions. Visitors from Nektuna find the scale disorienting—everything built for importance, inhabited by people who don't care about importance at all.

The palace still functions as seat of government. King Ulyas rules from a modest chamber in one wing while the rest of the building gathers dust. He's been here longer than the empire has existed. The halflings find Tarkha perfectly comfortable. Ulyas finds it home.

#### The Fireknife Mountains

A volcanic range along Kerwin's northwestern border, marking the boundary between settled land and wilderness. The Fireknife peaks smoke constantly, their slopes scarred by ancient lava flows and dotted with hot springs. Travel through the mountains is possible but dangerous—paths shift, vents open without warning, and the rock itself is unstable.

The halflings avoid the Fireknife. They tell stories of spirits in the peaks, of travelers who entered and never returned, of lights that move against the wind. These stories are probably exaggerated.

King Ulyas travels into the Fireknife once a year. He takes prisoners and criminals with him. He returns alone. The halflings have learned not to ask questions.

#### The Copper Hills

Low hills west of Tarkha, their ruddy soil rich with copper ore. The mining town of **Chykum** extracts enough copper to supply Kerwin's modest needs and trade surplus to Tarkhon merchants.

The hills are older than the halflings—older than Tarkhon. Ancient mine shafts riddle the deeper hills, their origins unknown. Halfling miners occasionally break through into these old workings. They find strange tools, stranger carvings, and sometimes things best left undisturbed. A sensible miner seals such discoveries and moves on.

#### Da Sharma

The southern region of Kerwin, where farmland gives way to sheep pastures and the influence of Tarkha fades. Da Sharma is insular, traditional, and faintly suspicious of outsiders—including halflings from northern Kerwin.

The people here maintain old shrines to spirits that predate Tarkhon, predate Kerwin, predate perhaps the halflings themselves. They light candles on certain nights, leave offerings at certain stones, and speak certain names only in whispers. When asked about these practices, they smile and change the subject.

#### Settlements

Kerwin's towns are modest affairs—farming communities, market villages, waypoints on roads that once carried imperial traffic. Notable settlements include:

- **Sharmatenu**: The largest town after Tarkha, a market center for the central farmlands
- **Chykum**: Mining town in the Copper Hills
- **Hebbythus**, **Nehemiter**, **Hebmu**: Agricultural villages along the main road
- **Clynisi**, **Ankbalen**: Eastern frontier settlements
- **Dlesy**, **Cuntzam**: Da Sharma communities
- **Kastorbekt**, **Akhzubdet**: Southern towns near the border with wilder lands

#### Relationship to Tarkhon

Kerwin is nominally part of the Tarkhon Empire. In practice, this means:
- Kerwin pays modest tribute to Tarkhetan
- Tarkhon merchants travel freely through Kerwin
- Kerwin acknowledges the emperor's theoretical sovereignty

What it does not mean:
- Tarkhon troops garrison Kerwin
- Tarkhon laws supersede Kerwin customs
- Tarkhon has any real say in Kerwin's governance

King Ulyas agreed to this arrangement five centuries ago. He has outlived every emperor since. Periodically, ambitious officials in Nektuna suggest bringing Kerwin more firmly under imperial control. These officials tend to have short careers.

#### The Neferati Memory

Ulyas remembers the Neferati founders—the fire-blooded conquerors who came north and built Tarkhetan. He remembers when they negotiated Kerwin's entry into the empire, promising autonomy in exchange for tribute. He remembers their emperors, their court intrigues, their slow dilution into humanity.

He also remembers the Severance—the civil war that ended Neferati rule. Kerwin stayed neutral, which is why it still exists. Ulyas watched both sides burn each other while his halflings tended their sheep.

Now humans hold the throne, and they've forgotten most of what Ulyas remembers. He hasn't told them. He hasn't decided if he ever will.

### Midton

Tags: island, geography

A small, rocky island in the eastern Tarkhon Passage, home to Ekfusy fortress and little else.

#### Geography

Midton sits south of Enymu, where the Tarkhon Passage begins to widen toward the Middle Sea. The island is small—perhaps ten miles long and five wide—with rocky coastlines and sparse vegetation.

The terrain is unremarkable: low hills, scrubby grass, a few wind-twisted trees. No natural harbors worth mentioning. The only significant structure is Ekfusy fortress on the northern shore.

#### Population

Midton has no real population. A fishing hamlet of perhaps fifty souls clings to the southern coast, their ancestors presumably stranded here generations ago and too stubborn to leave. They catch fish, curse the wind, and avoid the soldiers.

The fortress garrison adds another 200, but they don't count—they're temporary, rotating in and out on tours of duty, counting the days until they can leave.

#### Strategic Value

Midton's only importance is its position. Ships entering the Tarkhon Passage from the east must pass within sight of the island. Ekfusy fortress watches for hostile fleets, pirates, or smugglers.

In practice, this matters less than it should. The Needle catches everything. By the time ships reach Midton's longitude, they've already been taxed and documented at Tarkhetan. Ekfusy exists mostly as insurance—a backup that rarely proves necessary.

#### Conditions

Life on Midton is miserable. The island offers nothing: no entertainment, no women, no opportunities. The fishing hamlet resents the garrison. The garrison resents being here. The wind blows constantly.

Supply ships visit monthly, weather permitting. Mail is slow. News from Tarkhetan arrives weeks late. For the soldiers stationed here, Midton might as well be another world.

#### The Blessing in Disguise

Some find Midton's isolation appealing. No politics. No intrigues. No one watching, no one caring. For men with pasts they'd rather forget, Midton offers anonymity.

The garrison doesn't ask questions. Do your job, keep your head down, serve your time. Whatever you're running from, it won't follow you here.

### Murth

Tags: state, nation

A dual-mountain state in the Wurmspine range of western Tarkhon, where Rhea scholar-monks and human merchants share an uneasy but enduring partnership. Two cultures, two capitals, one strange nation bound together by underground tunnels and a shared water source.

#### Position and Borders

Murth occupies two mountains and the valleys between them in western Tarkhon:
- **North**: Mt. Disyus, home to Eynmore
- **South**: Mt. Arn, home to Vastilin
- **Northwest**: The Plains of Oblivion (cursed memory-erasing grasslands)
- **East**: Mountains leading toward Vogenfeld
- **South/Southeast**: Routes toward the Kingdoms of Fire

The state is relatively isolated—mountain terrain limits access, and neither city has pursued expansion. Murth wants to be left alone with its books and its trade.

#### Mt. Disyus

The northern mountain, rising to heights where human visitors struggle to breathe. The thin air suits the Rhea perfectly—their air-elemental nature finds the altitude comfortable, even preferable.

The mountain's upper reaches are carved with monastery complexes, meditation halls, and the ancient libraries of **Eynmore**. Lower slopes support terraced gardens where Rhea cultivate rare alpine herbs.

**Features:**
- **Eynmore** (capital): Monastery city of the Rhea, population ~8,000
- **The High Halls**: Meditation chambers open to the sky
- **The Eternal Library**: Knowledge collected over a thousand years
- **The Garden Terraces**: Rare herbs for healing and magical work

#### Mt. Arn

The southern mountain, lower and warmer than its twin. Rich in iron and copper, Mt. Arn attracted human miners centuries ago—they stayed, built a city, and eventually discovered they had neighbors.

**Vastilin** sprawls across the southern slopes: markets, foundries, warehouses, and all the comfortable chaos of human habitation. The mountain's wealth flows through here—both the metals mined from the rock and the services sold from Eynmore above.

**Features:**
- **Vastilin** (capital): Merchant city of humans, population ~12,000
- **The Iron Foundries**: Metal processing and smithing
- **The Great Market**: Trade hub for the western mountains
- **The Lower Tunnels**: Mining operations extending deep into the mountain

#### Lake Stillwater

The heart of Murth—an underground lake lying beneath both mountains, fed by glacial melt and ancient aquifers. The water is unnaturally still, unnaturally clear, and unnaturally cold.

Lake Stillwater is why Murth exists. A thousand years ago, both communities dug for water and found the same lake. Rather than fight, they negotiated the **Stillwater Compact**: shared access, shared responsibility, connecting tunnels.

The lake's shores—such as they are in the underground darkness—host the **Chamber of the Compact**, where the original agreement is carved in stone. Representatives from both cities meet here for matters requiring joint decision.

Some say the lake has properties beyond simple water. Rhea scholars study it; human merchants would love to bottle it. Neither has succeeded in understanding—or exploiting—whatever makes Stillwater special.

#### The Murthian Tunnels

Miles of passages connect Eynmore and Vastilin through the mountains, with Lake Stillwater at the center. The tunnels are Murth's circulatory system—trade, communication, and transport all flow through them.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Stillwater Shore**: Underground lake access, neutral ground
- **The Chamber of the Compact**: Meeting hall carved from stone, where the original treaty is inscribed
- **The Waystation**: Midpoint rest stop, perpetually staffed
- **The Iron Gate**: Vastilin's tunnel entrance, heavily guarded
- **The Breath Gate**: Eynmore's tunnel entrance, where thin air meets thick

The tunnels are governed by **tunnel-wardens**—officials from both communities who maintain neutrality and ensure neither city can cut off the other. The current Chief Warden is **Sera Coldwell**, a human woman trusted by both sides (which means neither side fully trusts her).

#### Eynmore

The Rhea capital on Mt. Disyus. A city of contemplation, scholarship, and mastery.

Eynmore doesn't feel like a city to human visitors—it's too quiet, too orderly, too empty of the bustle that defines urban life. The Rhea don't crowd together; they space themselves for focus. The result is a settlement that seems half-populated even when everyone is present.

**Architecture**: Carved from mountain stone, elegant but austere. Buildings are integrated into the rock rather than imposed upon it. Open spaces allow air to flow—the Rhea need to feel the wind.

**Government**: The **High Contemplative** leads, currently **Whisper-of-Still-Waters**—a Rhea so old and focused that she barely acknowledges the physical world. She speaks rarely. When she does, Eynmore listens.

**Character**: Quiet. Patient. Dedicated to pursuits measured in decades. Visitors find it peaceful or maddening depending on temperament.

#### Vastilin

The human capital on Mt. Arn. A city of commerce, craft, and comfortable excess.

Vastilin is everything Eynmore isn't—loud, crowded, messy, alive. Markets compete for attention. Foundries pour smoke. Taverns overflow. It's a proper city, even if it's built on a mountainside in the middle of nowhere.

**Architecture**: Practical construction in local stone, expanded piecemeal over centuries. The city has no plan—buildings were added where needed, creating a maze of streets that locals navigate by instinct.

**Government**: The **Merchant Council** of seven major families controls city affairs. The **First Merchant**, currently **Aldous Brennan**, mediates between them and represents Vastilin in joint decisions with Eynmore.

**Character**: Busy. Pragmatic. Focused on the next deal, the next shipment, the next opportunity. Visitors find it refreshingly normal after the strangeness of Rhea culture.

#### The Plains of Oblivion

Northwest of Murth, beyond the mountains' protection, lie cursed grasslands where memory dissolves. Travelers who enter forget—first recent events, then learned skills, then eventually who they are.

The plains creep closer to Murth some years, retreat others. No pattern has been found. The cause is unknown—perhaps ancient magic, perhaps something worse.

**Satyrn Gray**, the palace of **Queen Eranes**, stands somewhere in those plains. Eranes is a half-titan of immense power who deliberately forgot her own heartbreak—and took the surrounding land with her. She's not hostile to Murth, but she's not friendly either. She barely remembers Murth exists.

Murth maintains watchers to track the plains' boundaries and warn if they expand. Sometimes the watchers forget to come home.

#### Relationship with Tarkhon

Murth is technically part of the Tarkhon Empire, paying tribute to Tarkhetan. In practice, the relationship is distant.

Murth has nothing Tarkhon urgently wants—no strategic position, no vital resources, no threat worth addressing. The tribute payments are modest. The imperial presence is minimal. Tarkhon has bigger concerns.

This suits Eynmore perfectly. The Rhea want to be forgotten by empires.

This frustrates Vastilin somewhat. The merchants would welcome deeper integration—more trade, more markets, more opportunity. But not enough to push for it unilaterally.

#### Points of Interest

**The Breath Gate**: Where Eynmore's thin air meets the tunnel's thicker atmosphere. Human visitors pause here to acclimatize before ascending. Rhea visitors pause to enjoy the last comfortable air before descending.

**The Market of Whispers**: A trading post in the tunnel system where Rhea and human merchants meet to negotiate. Named for the Rhea habit of speaking softly—and for the secrets that change hands here.

**The Monastery of the Empty Hand**: Where Master Stonefist trains martial monks in combat techniques refined over sixty years. Occasionally accepts outside students—for a price, and a commitment.

**The Archive of Fallen Pages**: Texts too dangerous for the main library, sealed in a chamber that only the High Contemplative can open. Rumors claim it contains knowledge that could end kingdoms. The Rhea neither confirm nor deny.

### Nektuna

Tags: state, nation

The imperial heartland of the Tarkhon Empire, controlling both shores of the Needle—the strait's narrowest point and the key to everything.

#### Position and Borders

Nektuna occupies the central position in Tarkhon's territory:
- **North**: Enymu (agricultural tributary)
- **South**: The strait itself, with Astrelle (vassal) on the opposite shore
- **West**: Pyris Island (controlled territory)
- **East**: The broader Tarkhon Passage, narrowing toward Eros

The Needle—where Tarkhetan faces Torsnerhun fortress across the narrowest water—is the geographic heart of Tarkhon's power.

#### Terrain and Climate

Warm Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot, dry summers. The land rises from the harbor in a series of hills, each topped with fortifications or noble estates. Olive groves and vineyards cover the slopes outside the city walls.

The coastline alternates between rocky cliffs and protected harbors. Tarkhetan occupies the best natural harbor on the strait, which is why it became the capital.

#### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire, built on hills overlooking the Needle. From the palace walls, you can see clear across to Torsnerhun fortress on the Astrelle shore.

The city is divided into districts by elevation and wealth:

**The Old City** — The highest hills. Noble estates, the royal palace, the great cathedral where the Evertorch burns. Wealth, power, and ancient blood.

**The Middle City** — Lower slopes. Merchant houses, guild halls, the homes of successful craftsmen. Where business happens and fortunes are made.

**The Waterfront** — Along the harbor. Warehouses, shipyards, tenements, taverns, brothels. Craven make up the majority. The smell of fish, tar, and humanity.

**The Undercity** — Tunnels, cellars, forgotten passages beneath the streets. Smugglers, thieves, and things that don't like sunlight.

#### The Evertorch Cathedral

The great cathedral at Tarkhetan's heart, where the Evertorch has burned without interruption for six centuries. The flame is the empire's holiest symbol—rulers are crowned in its light, the most binding oaths are sworn before it.

The Neferati founders brought sacred fire north from Yaif and kindled it here when they established Tarkhetan. It has never moved. The cathedral was built around it, growing grander over centuries as the empire grew wealthy.

The cathedral is also a center of fire magic. Ritual work occurs here, sustained by both the Evertorch's power and the fire leyline running beneath the Old City.

What the human clergy don't like to discuss: the Evertorch is a Neferati creation, lit by Neferati hands, sustained by Neferati traditions. It burns with fire from Yaif. The Kingdoms of Fire haven't forgotten.

#### The Fire Leyline

A leyline of fire runs beneath Tarkhetan, concentrated under the Old City. Children born here sometimes manifest fire attunement—and those who do are claimed by the Firemage Corps.

The Corps' Citadel of Flames sits on the leyline's strongest point, training mages who can burn ships from the city walls.

#### Besnoumeru

Nektuna's second city, built on a **time leyline**. The Oracle Merchants born here can sense market changes before they happen—not prophecy, but an instinct for timing that has made Besnoumeru almost as wealthy as Tarkhetan.

The city has an eerie calm. Nobody rushes. The merchants already know what's coming.

#### Pyris Island

A moderate-sized island southwest of the strait. Home to the Pyrisi—stocky, hardy folk descended from human-dwarf interbreeding over centuries. They're farmers and fishers who want to be left alone.

The island includes a town and several villages in the north, supporting a modest population that pays taxes and provides sailors for the navy.

#### Fort Tenze (Ruined)

On Pyris's eastern coast stand the ruins of Fort Tenze, guardian of a secondary chokepoint. The fortress has been abandoned for nearly three centuries, ever since the **Severance**—the civil war that ended Neferati rule.

During the Severance, Fort Tenze's garrison sided with the Neferati faction. When they lost, something went wrong. The fortress burned with unnatural fire that left the stones themselves twisted. The wrongness never left.

Three attempts to rebuild have failed. Workers suffer accidents, disappearances, madness. Equipment fails. Stones won't set. People hear whispers, see figures in their peripheral vision, dream of burning.

The crown has stopped trying. Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, but nobody stays long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

#### The Harbor

Tarkhetan's harbor is the busiest port in the region. Ships from across Alaria arrive and depart at all hours, their cargoes taxed, inspected, and sent onward.

The harbor is protected by both geography (natural breakwaters, defensible approaches) and magic (firemages on the walls can burn any hostile fleet). This combination makes Tarkhetan's harbor essentially unassailable by naval attack.

#### The Needle

The narrowest point of the Tarkhon Passage—perhaps half a mile of water between Tarkhetan's walls and Torsnerhun fortress on the Astrelle shore.

Nothing passes the Needle without Tarkhetan's permission. Firemages on both shores can burn ships attempting to run the strait. The navy patrols constantly. Even if a ship somehow slipped through, the fortresses further east would catch it.

This chokepoint is everything. Tarkhon's wealth, power, and existence depend on maintaining absolute control of the Needle.

#### Relationships

**With Astrelle**: Vassal state across the Needle. Astrelle hosts Torsnerhun fortress, making it strategically vital. The current Duchess Ysmera is also the queen's aunt—family ties complicate the overlord-vassal relationship.

**With Enymu**: Loyal tributary to the north. Provides food, conscripts, and access to the Stone Forest border. The honorable kings of Enymu have never given Nektuna trouble.

**With Kerwin**: Distant and nominal. King Ulyas pays tribute but effectively governs himself. He was ancient when Tarkhon was founded—and he remembers things the current dynasty would prefer stayed forgotten.

**With the Kingdoms of Fire**: Complex. They're nominally tributary but act as a bloc. They remember founding the empire the humans now rule. The relationship is stable but fragile.

A moderate-sized island southwest of the Tarkhon Strait, part of Nektuna's territory. Home to the Pyrisi—a hardy, independent folk who want nothing more than to be left alone—and the cursed ruins of Fort Tenze.

#### Geography

Pyris is the largest island in the western passage, roughly forty miles long and twenty wide. The terrain is hilly, with rocky coastlines giving way to modest farmland in the interior. A spine of low hills runs north-south through the island's center.

The climate is Mediterranean—milder than the mainland, with reliable rainfall and good growing conditions. The soil is decent for olives, grapes, and grain.

#### The Pyrisi

The island's population descends from centuries of interbreeding between humans and dwarves—a mixing that occurred long before anyone thought to record it. The result is a people who are stocky, hardy, and stubborn.

The Pyrisi are primarily farmers and fishers. They grow olives and grapes, catch fish, and want to be left alone. They pay their taxes to Tarkhetan, send their young to serve in the navy, and otherwise try not to attract attention.

They have little interest in mainland politics. When Tarkhetan's intrigues spill over, the Pyrisi wait for it to pass. When asked their opinion on the succession, they shrug. When pressed about the Neferati legacy, they change the subject.

This isn't ignorance—it's survival. The Pyrisi have learned that attracting attention rarely ends well for islanders.

#### Settlements

**Pyris Town** is the largest settlement, located on the northern coast. Perhaps 3,000 people live here—merchants, craftsmen, and the administrators who handle the island's relationship with Tarkhetan. The town has a modest harbor, a small market, and a temple to the Evertorch (rarely attended).

Several **villages** dot the interior and southern coast, home to farming families who've worked the same land for generations. These communities are insular, intermarried, and suspicious of outsiders—including visitors from Pyris Town.

#### Fort Tenze

On the island's eastern coast stand the ruins of **Fort Tenze**, once a vital fortress guarding the western approaches to the strait.

Fort Tenze has been abandoned for three centuries, ever since the Severance—the civil war that ended Neferati rule. The garrison sided with the losing faction. When the victors came to take the fortress, something went wrong. The place burned with unnatural fire and has been cursed ever since.

Three attempts to rebuild have failed. Workers suffer accidents, disappearances, madness. The Pyrisi avoid the ruins. They tell stories to keep children away. Even smugglers don't stay long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

#### Strategic Position

Pyris guards a secondary chokepoint—not as critical as the Needle, but significant. Ships hugging the western coast to avoid Tarkhetan's tariffs must pass within range of... well, where Fort Tenze's walls used to be.

The fortress's absence creates a gap in Tarkhon's defenses. Smugglers exploit it. The crown knows but hasn't successfully addressed the problem.

#### Relationship with Tarkhetan

Pyris is technically part of Nektuna, governed from Tarkhetan. In practice, the island largely governs itself. A minor noble holds the title of Governor of Pyris—usually someone being quietly exiled from court politics—and the Pyrisi ignore them as much as possible.

The island pays taxes, provides sailors, and hosts the cursed ruins of a fortress nobody wants to rebuild. In exchange, Tarkhetan mostly leaves them alone.

It's not a bad arrangement. The Pyrisi have survived worse.

### Sea of Merchants

### Tarkhetan

Tags: city, capital

The capital city of the Tarkhon Empire.

TODO

### Tarkhon Empire

Tags: state, nation, empire

The dominant empire of the Tarkhon region, controlling the critical strait between the Middle Sea and the western ocean.

#### The Evertorch

In Tarkhetan's great cathedral burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting centuries ago. The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing the empire's eternal dominion and unbroken continuity.

The flame burns without fuel, without maintenance, without apparent source. Scholars have studied it for generations without understanding how it works. Some believe it's fed by a leyline. Others think it's a divine gift. A few whisper that something was sacrificed to light it, and that sacrifice is what keeps it burning.

The Evertorch was lit in Tarkhetan when the Neferati founders established the empire six centuries ago. They brought sacred fire from the Flame of Yaif and kindled it here, at the heart of their new dominion. It has never moved.

#### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire, built on the northern shore of the strait. Tarkhetan is a city of extremes—fabulous wealth alongside desperate poverty, gleaming palaces beside rotting slums, merchant princes who could buy kingdoms and beggars who will never own anything.

The city's power comes from position, not production. Every ship that passes through the strait pays tribute. Every merchant who wants access to Tarkhon markets pays fees. The city produces little itself but takes a cut of everything that moves through.

King Selron II rules from the great palace overlooking the strait. His court is a nest of intrigue—lords from across the empire jockeying for position, merchants buying influence, and spies from every neighboring power watching for weakness.

#### The Strait

The narrow passage connecting the Middle Sea to the western ocean. Ships can cross it in hours, but those hours pass under the watchful eyes of Tarkhon's navy and the burning gaze of its firemages.

The strait is everything. Without it, Tarkhon is just another middling power. With it, Tarkhon controls half the world's trade. This makes the empire both fabulously wealthy and desperately paranoid. Any threat to the strait is an existential threat to the empire itself.

#### Leylines

Tarkhon's territory contains several important leylines:

- **Fire Leyline**: Runs through Nektuna and Tarkhetan, producing the firemages who serve as the empire's elite military asset
- **Time Leyline**: Runs through Besnoumeru, enabling the city's famous merchants to anticipate market changes before they happen
- **Yolus Leyline**: Runs through the Fleimrut Mountains, unstable and dangerous, responsible for the Fleimrut Awakening

#### The Imperial Legacy

The Neferati founders understood from the beginning that controlling the strait meant controlling trade. They built Tarkhetan on the Needle, lit the Evertorch, and established an empire based on commerce rather than conquest.

For nearly three centuries, Neferati emperors—or their increasingly diluted descendants—ruled from Tarkhetan. They expanded through trade agreements and tributary arrangements, absorbing states like Kerwin through negotiation rather than war.

Then came the Severance, and human hands took the throne. The new rulers maintained the symbols and traditions of their predecessors while slowly forgetting their origins. The Evertorch still burns. The institutions still function. But the fire that founded them has withdrawn to the Kingdoms of Fire, waiting.

### The Rash

### Vogenfeld

Tags: state, nation

The northern shield of Tarkhon—three Uline dwarf settlements in the Wurmspine Mountains between the empire and the orcish hordes of Hedroscobb. For centuries, the dwarves have held the passes. For centuries, they've watched the Wildwood. And for decades now, they've wondered why they bother.

#### Position and Borders

Vogenfeld occupies a stretch of mountains at Tarkhon's northern frontier:
- **North**: The Wildwood and the orcish territories of Hedroscobb (Glivornax most directly)
- **South**: Open land leading to Tarkhon proper
- **East**: The Wurn Mountains and Stone Men territory
- **West**: More mountains, eventually leading to Murth

The position is strategic—the passes through these mountains are the only practical route for armies moving between Hedroscobb and Tarkhon. Control the passes, and you control the invasion route.

#### Terrain and Climate

The surface is harsh alpine terrain—jagged peaks, narrow passes, treacherous in winter. Snow lies on the highest peaks year-round. The passes are barely navigable even in summer.

The dwarves don't live on the surface. They live *in* the mountains, in vast tunnel complexes carved over millennia. The tunnels maintain comfortable temperatures year-round, ventilated by the elaborate chain-operated air systems that give Uline dwarves their nickname.

#### The Three Settlements

**Atlangsow** — Western, largest (~5,000)

Built into a mountain overlooking the main pass between Tarkhon and the Wildwood. The great gates of Atlangsow have never fallen to enemy assault. The tunnels extend miles into the mountain, with forges, living quarters, mushroom farms, and endless passages.

The Council of Thanes meets here most often. Thane Gorveth, the eldest of the three thanes, makes his home in the deep chambers.

**Kaisa** — Central (~4,000)

Smaller on the surface, but Kaisa's tunnels extend furthest north. Secret passages emerge in the Wildwood itself, allowing scouts to observe orc movements without being seen.

Kaisa produces the best scouts and the most aggressive warriors. Thane Brunhild leads from here, always pushing for more patrols, more intelligence, more action.

**Glashof** — Eastern (~3,000)

Controls the eastern approaches where the Vogenfeld range meets the Wurn Mountains. Glashof maintains contact with the Stone Men—not allies exactly, but neighboring mountain peoples who understand each other.

Thane Keldris rules here, the youngest of the thanes and increasingly vocal about Vogenfeld's grievances.

#### The Pass of Oaths

The main route through the mountains, overlooked by Atlangsow's gates. This is where the Vogenfeld Pact was sworn five centuries ago—where dwarven thanes and Tarkhon's representatives agreed that Vogenfeld would guard the north in exchange for tribute and honor.

Stone monuments line the pass, carved with the names of dwarves who died holding this ground. Thousands of names. Generations of sacrifice.

The monuments are maintained perfectly. The dwarves remember, even if Tarkhon has forgotten.

#### The Tunnel Networks

The official maps show the main passages—routes for trade, travel, and defense. These are impressive enough: miles of tunnels connecting the three settlements, forges and armories, living quarters and meeting halls.

The unofficial maps show much more.

Secret tunnels extend in every direction. Emergency passages connect the settlements through routes no enemy would find. Hidden exits emerge throughout the mountains—some facing south toward Tarkhon, others facing north toward the Wildwood.

The northern tunnels are the most sensitive. Some emerge miles into orc territory, allowing scouts to gather intelligence. Others could theoretically be used to guide armies through the mountains, bypassing the defended passes entirely.

The dwarves don't talk about what those northern tunnels could be used for. But everyone knows they exist.

#### The Patrols

Every day, Vogenfeld sends patrols into the Wildwood's edge. Small groups of warriors, moving quietly, watching for signs of orcish movement.

They look for:
- Unusual gatherings of orc warriors
- Signs that tribal conflicts have paused
- Any indication of coordination between the six great tribes
- Evidence that someone is trying to unite Hedroscobb

These patrols are dangerous. Orcs hunt the southern Wildwood too. Dwarves die every year on patrol duty. Their names go on the monuments.

Tarkhon doesn't know about the patrols. Tarkhon doesn't ask. Tarkhon has forgotten why the patrols matter.

#### The Council of Thanes

**Thane Gorveth of Atlangsow** (eldest)

Over two hundred years old, Gorveth remembers when Tarkhon still paid proper tribute. He remembers his grandfather's stories of the last great invasion. He counsels patience because he's seen what orc armies can do and knows that Vogenfeld's duty is real, regardless of Tarkhon's failures.

But patience has limits. Even Gorveth's.

**Thane Brunhild of Kaisa**

One hundred seventy years old, Brunhild is a warrior-thane who has personally led patrols into the Wildwood. She argues that Tarkhon must be reminded of Vogenfeld's value—through negotiation if possible, through demonstration if necessary.

She's not advocating abandonment of the Pact. Not yet. But she's laying the groundwork for what comes if Tarkhon continues to ignore them.

**Thane Keldris of Glashof** (youngest)

Only ninety years old, Keldris represents a generation that has never seen orcish invasion. He knows the duty intellectually but doesn't feel it in his bones like the elders do.

Keldris asks the question others won't: If Tarkhon has broken the Pact, why should Vogenfeld honor it? Why should dwarves die for an empire that doesn't remember them?

He's been spending time in the deep tunnels lately. The northern ones.

#### The Orcish Threat

North of Vogenfeld lies **Hedroscobb**—the Wildwood, an endless forest inhabited by six great orcish tribal states and countless smaller bands.

The six great tribes:
- **Hedroscobb** — Directly north, the black orcs with their corrosive iron armor; the closest and largest threat
- **Glivornax** — Beyond Hedroscobb to the northwest, the most diplomatically sophisticated; they guard the healing waters
- **Tarn** — North-central, controlling a stretch of the Grand Tolkarsus river; spirit warriors who are nearly impossible to kill
- **Uhionai** — Far northwest, the tree-bound orcs of Ryunimir Forest who become trees when they die
- **Grieb** — Northeast, the lakemen who answer to a hag queen; nobody attacks them and nobody talks about why
- **Shazuihn** — Eastern forest edge, the boar riders who raid everyone constantly

These states have warred among themselves for as long as anyone remembers. Territory, resources, honor, ancient grudges—the reasons change but the fighting continues.

This constant warfare is why Tarkhon has been safe. If the orcs ever stopped fighting each other, if they ever united, their combined strength would be overwhelming.

Recent reports from Vogenfeld patrols are concerning. Some tribal conflicts have paused. Unusual gatherings have been observed. Something is happening in Hedroscobb.

It might be nothing. The orcs have had would-be unifiers before.

But if it's not nothing, Vogenfeld will be the first to know. And the first to fall.

#### Relationship with Tarkhon

The relationship is broken but not yet severed.

Vogenfeld still receives tribute from Tarkhetan—but the payments are a fraction of what they once were, delivered with contempt rather than gratitude. Young officials in Tarkhetan openly question why the empire pays "those mountain dwarves" at all.

The dwarves still patrol, still watch, still maintain the passes. But the question of how long this continues grows louder every year.

Three possible futures:
1. Tarkhon remembers its obligations, restores proper tribute, and the alliance continues
2. Vogenfeld withdraws to its tunnels, lets the patrols lapse, and waits to see what happens
3. Vogenfeld decides that if Tarkhon won't pay for protection, perhaps someone else will

The third option is unthinkable. Until recently, it was unthinkable.

#### What Lies Beneath

The Uline didn't just fight surface threats. The monsters of the deep—shadereavers and worse—have always threatened the tunnels.

Vogenfeld's warriors train against these creatures as much as against orcs. The iron blades and hammers they carry are designed for close-quarters tunnel fighting, for enemies that come from below as well as above.

This means Vogenfeld's forces are uniquely versatile. They can fight on the surface in mountain terrain. They can fight underground in absolute darkness. They can hold positions that other armies couldn't reach.

If Vogenfeld ever turned those skills against Tarkhon rather than for it, the results would be devastating.

But that's unthinkable.

Isn't it?

### Wadiyah

Tags: state, nation

The southernmost and most isolated of the Kingdoms of Fire. While other kingdoms counsel patience, accommodation, or indifference, Wadiyah remembers the Severance with burning anger. Queen Khalira believes the time for waiting has ended. The fire kingdoms should reclaim what is theirs—and if the other monarchs won't act, Wadiyah will.

#### Position and Borders

Wadiyah occupies the southern tip of the Neferati peninsula:
- **North**: Gissemari
- **South, East, and West**: Open ocean

The most isolated of the four kingdoms, separated from the others by mountains and distance. This isolation has bred independence—and resentment.

#### The Flame of the Abyss

Wadiyah's Eternal Flame burns in the **Pit of First Fire**—not a temple or a lighthouse or a forge, but a volcanic vent where fire emerges directly from the earth's molten heart.

The Pit is a natural phenomenon that has burned since before life existed on Alaria. The flame rises from a shaft so deep that none have seen its bottom. Priests who tend the Pit say it connects to the world's core—that this is not merely an eternal flame but the source of all fire, the heat that keeps the world alive.

The Pit's fire is wilder than the other kingdoms' flames. It surges and subsides with its own rhythms. It cannot be controlled or contained—only watched, respected, and feared.

This shapes Wadiyah's culture. Where other kingdoms have tamed their flames, Wadiyah serves a fire that cannot be tamed.

#### Terrain and Climate

The harshest of the four kingdoms—volcanic soil, limited rainfall, and thermal vents that make parts of the landscape literally uninhabitable. The population clusters in the few areas where the earth's heat doesn't seep through.

The southern coast is dramatic: black volcanic cliffs dropping into crashing waves, geysers of steam rising from the water where hot rock meets cold ocean, and the ever-present smell of sulfur.

Outsiders find Wadiyah uncomfortable at best, dangerous at worst. The Wadiyans find it home.

#### Capital: Abyssward

Built on the rim of the volcanic basin that contains the Pit of First Fire, Abyssward is a city that exists in constant awareness of the fire below.

**Population**: ~30,000

The city is smaller and poorer than the other Neferati capitals. Resources are scarce; the land doesn't support large populations. What Abyssward lacks in wealth, it makes up in intensity.

The architecture is stark—dark volcanic stone, minimal ornamentation, buildings designed to withstand earthquakes and eruptions. Beauty here is found in survival, not decoration.

The Pit dominates everything. Its glow lights the city at night. Its heat warms homes in winter. Its rumbling provides a constant background to life. The Wadiyans live above fire that could consume them at any moment—and this shapes who they are.

#### Queen Khalira

The ruler of Wadiyah is **Queen Khalira**, thirty-four years old and the most dangerous person in the Kingdoms of Fire.

Khalira is passionate even by Neferati standards—fierce, impatient, and absolutely convinced that the time for patience has ended. Three centuries of waiting has achieved nothing. The humans still hold the Evertorch. The Severance wounds still fester. Something must be done.

**Appearance**: Striking rather than beautiful. Bright red skin that seems to genuinely flicker with inner fire. Sharp features, short-cropped hair, and eyes that blaze with intensity. She carries herself like a weapon waiting to be used.

**Philosophy**: The Neferati created Tarkhon. The humans stole it. Every day the Evertorch burns in Tarkhetan is an insult to Neferati honor. Accommodation is surrender. Patience is cowardice. The fire kingdoms have the power to take back what's theirs—they lack only the will.

**Role in the Council**: The voice of confrontation. Khalira pushes for action—demanding the Evertorch's return, threatening withdrawal from Tarkhon, proposing alliances with Tarkhon's enemies. The other monarchs have spent considerable effort restraining her.

So far, they've succeeded. But Khalira's patience is running out.

#### The Cult of the Abyss

Wadiyah's priesthood differs from other kingdoms. Where Yaif's priests preserve tradition and Gissemari's priest-smiths create, Wadiyah's **Cult of the Abyss** serves a fire they cannot control.

The Cult teaches that the Pit's fire is the truest form of flame—wild, untamed, and hungry. Other eternal flames have been domesticated, put to human purposes. The Pit remains pure. To serve it is to accept that some forces cannot be controlled, only honored.

This theology shapes Wadiyah's politics. If fire cannot be controlled, why should the Neferati accept human control of their empire? If the Pit demands respect rather than submission, why should the Neferati submit to Tarkhon?

The current High Priestess, **Embrath**, is Khalira's strongest supporter. Where other priests counsel acceptance, Embrath preaches righteous anger.

#### Culture

Wadiyah is intense in a way that makes even other Neferati uncomfortable. The passion that elsewhere expresses as art or commerce here expresses as barely contained fury.

Fire ceremonies in Wadiyah are tests of endurance—walking on coals, handling live flames, proving worthiness through pain. Fire dancing is competitive and sometimes violent. The boundary between dance and combat blurs.

The Wadiyans see themselves as the true Neferati—uncompromised by comfort, uncorrupted by accommodation. The other kingdoms have grown soft in their prosperity. Only Wadiyah remembers what was lost.

This creates friction. Other Neferati find Wadiyah exhausting, even frightening. Wadiyans find the others disappointing.

#### Military

**Size**: Medium (disproportionate to population)

**Quality**: High

**Character**: Aggressive and ready

Wadiyah maintains a larger military than its population suggests—a deliberate choice, funded by sacrificing other priorities. The army trains constantly, preparing for a war that Khalira believes is inevitable.

**The Abyssal Guard**: Wadiyah's elite force, warriors who have passed the harshest tests of fire. They're fanatically loyal to the queen and would march on Tarkhetan tomorrow if she ordered it.

Unlike the other kingdoms, Wadiyah's military isn't defensive. It's built to attack. The question is when—and whether the Council will authorize it.

#### The Growing Crisis

Khalira is losing patience with the Council's caution.

She's begun making independent moves:
- Establishing contacts with Tarkhon's enemies
- Stockpiling weapons beyond defensive needs
- Sending agents to Tarkhetan to gather intelligence
- Making speeches that stop just short of calling for war

The other monarchs know. They've tried to rein her in, but Khalira has stopped attending every Council meeting. She's stopped deferring to Seraphel's age or Rashaan's wealth. She's started acting like Wadiyah doesn't need the bloc's permission.

If Khalira acts alone—attacks Tarkhon shipping, demands the Evertorch, or does something even more dramatic—she could drag all four kingdoms into a war none of them are ready for.

Or she could succeed. And prove that patience was always the wrong strategy.

#### Relationship with Other Kingdoms

**With Yaif**: Strained. Queen Seraphel has spent years trying to moderate Khalira. Khalira has lost respect for what she sees as Yaif's ossified caution.

**With Kabir**: Hostile. Khalira openly calls King Rashaan a collaborator and a coward. Rashaan calls her a danger to everyone. They can barely speak civilly.

**With Gissemari**: Cold. Prince-Consort Vhelan's artistic focus seems frivolous to Khalira. She has no use for beauty that doesn't serve the cause.

**With Tarkhon**: None. Wadiyah has no diplomatic relationship with Tarkhetan, no merchants in its markets, no presence at court. Khalira refuses to engage with the thieves who stole the Neferati empire.

#### What Happens Next

Khalira is preparing for something. The signs are unmistakable:
- Military buildup beyond defensive needs
- Secret contacts with unknown parties
- Rhetoric growing more inflammatory
- Withdrawal from Council consensus

She hasn't shared her plans with the other monarchs. She may not have specific plans—yet. But the fire in Wadiyah is building toward something.

The Pit of First Fire cannot be controlled. Neither, it seems, can its queen.

Whatever Khalira does next will change everything. The only question is whether the Kingdoms of Fire will rise with her—or burn because of her.

### Wurm Tooth Mountain

Tags: mountain, geography

TODO

### Wurn Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

Part of the greater Wurmspine range, the Wurn Mountains form Enymu's northern border. Home to the Stone Men—a human subculture whose gray, rock-hard skin marks generations of elemental exposure. Switzerland vibes: alpine meadows, dramatic peaks, isolated valleys, and a people who want to be left alone.

#### Geography

The Wurn Mountains rise sharply from Enymu's northern farmlands, their peaks reaching high enough for permanent snow. The range extends roughly east-west, creating a natural barrier between the settled lands of Tarkhon and the territories beyond.

The mountains are dramatic but not impassable. Several valleys cut through the range, providing routes for trade and (occasionally) invasion. The Stone Men control these passes, collecting tolls from travelers and turning back those they don't like.

#### Climate

Alpine conditions prevail above the tree line: harsh winters, brief summers, unpredictable weather. Snow can fall any month of the year in the highest reaches.

The lower valleys are more temperate—cold in winter but capable of supporting grazing and limited agriculture. This is where most Stone Men settlements are located.

#### The Stone Men

The Stone Men are a human subculture who have lived in the Wurn Mountains for countless generations. Their most distinctive feature is their skin: gray, rough, and hard as rock—a result of prolonged elemental exposure that has become hereditary.

**Appearance**: Gray skin with a texture like weathered stone. Otherwise human in form, though often stocky and powerfully built. Their eyes are usually pale—gray, blue, or occasionally colorless.

**Culture**: The Stone Men are serious, blunt, and pragmatic. They say what they mean, mean what they say, and find lowlander habits of politeness and indirection baffling. Why waste words?

They value self-sufficiency, physical endurance, and keeping their word. Hospitality is sacred—once you're under a Stone Man's roof, they'll die to protect you. But earning that hospitality requires proving you're worth the effort.

**Lifestyle**: Primarily pastoral—sheep and goats graze the alpine meadows, providing wool, milk, and meat. Limited farming in the valleys produces hardy grains and vegetables. Trade with lowland Enymu provides metals, tools, and luxuries.

#### Settlements

Stone Men communities are scattered through the mountain valleys, typically consisting of stone houses clustered around a central meeting hall. Populations are small—a few hundred people is a large village.

Notable communities include:

- **Grayhaven**: The largest Stone Men settlement, positioned to control the main pass between Enymu and the territories beyond. Perhaps 800 residents.
- **High Watch**: A fortress-village overlooking the northern approaches. The Stone Men here consider themselves guardians against whatever lies beyond the mountains.
- **The Old Stones**: A ring of standing stones predating human settlement, considered sacred by the Stone Men. They gather here for important ceremonies and disputes.

#### Relations with Enymu

The relationship between the Stone Men and lowland Enymu is... complicated.

**Trade**: Regular, though not warm. Stone Men bring wool, cheese, and mountain herbs to lowland markets. They buy metal tools, grain, and the occasional luxury. Both sides benefit, but neither pretends to like each other.

**Trouble**: Occasionally, Stone Men bands raid lowland farms—usually young warriors proving themselves, sometimes organized groups seeking wealth. Enymu's army responds, there's fighting, eventually negotiation. This cycle has repeated for centuries.

**Mutual Suspicion**: Lowlanders find Stone Men unsettling—their gray skin, their bluntness, their alien customs. Stone Men find lowlanders soft, dishonest, and overly concerned with appearances. Neither opinion is entirely unfair.

**Stability**: Despite the friction, neither side wants war. The Stone Men can't conquer the lowlands; Enymu can't pacify the mountains. They've settled into an uneasy coexistence punctuated by occasional violence.

#### The Old Stones

A ring of massive standing stones in the central mountains, predating any known civilization. The Stone Men consider this site sacred, gathering here for important ceremonies, dispute resolution, and the election of their informal leaders.

Lowland Enymese are not welcome at the Old Stones. Those who have trespassed have been turned back—forcefully if necessary. What exactly happens at Stone Men ceremonies is unknown to outsiders.

Some scholars believe the Old Stones are connected to the titan crystals in the Stone Forest. The Stone Men neither confirm nor deny this.

#### What Lies Beyond

The Wurn Mountains form the northern boundary of Tarkhon's sphere of influence. Beyond them lie:

- Territories not claimed by any major power
- Eventually, the lands leading toward Hedroscobb and the six orcish tribal states
- Vogenfeld's dwarven defenders, watching the northern frontier

The Stone Men consider themselves the first line of defense against whatever might come from the north. This is partly why they maintain warrior traditions despite their pastoral lifestyle. They remember times when things came down from beyond the mountains.

#### Wildlife

The Wurn Mountains support diverse alpine wildlife:
- Mountain sheep and goats (both wild and domesticated)
- Eagles and other raptors
- Mountain lions and wolves
- Bears in the lower forests
- Various "strange mountain animals" that the Stone Men speak of but lowlanders rarely see

The Stone Men have their own names for creatures that appear in no lowland bestiary. Whether these are real or legendary is unclear to outsiders.

### Yaif

Tags: state, nation

The westernmost of the Kingdoms of Fire, and the oldest. Home to the Flame of First Fire, the Temple of Origins, and the ancient traditions that define Neferati identity. If the other kingdoms are the children of fire, Yaif is the mother.

#### Position and Borders

Yaif occupies the western portion of the Neferati peninsula:
- **East**: Kabir
- **South**: Gissemari
- **North and West**: The Sea of Merchants and open ocean

The coastline is dramatic—volcanic cliffs dropping into deep water, with natural harbors carved by ancient lava flows. The interior rises toward a central volcanic plateau where the Temple of First Fire stands.

#### The Flame of First Fire

At Yaif's heart burns the oldest of the Eternal Flames—the **Flame of First Fire**. According to Neferati tradition, this is the original flame from which all others were kindled, burning since before the world had names.

The flame burns in the **Temple of First Fire**, a massive structure carved from volcanic rock on the central plateau. The temple complex includes:
- The Flame Chamber itself (accessible only to priests and monarchs)
- The Hall of Origins (where the founding of Tarkhon is commemorated)
- The Archive of Ashes (containing records written in fire on treated stone)
- Living quarters for the priests who tend the flame

The Evertorch in Tarkhetan was lit from this flame six centuries ago. This is the core of Yaif's claim—and the Neferati's claim—to Tarkhon itself.

#### Terrain and Climate

Hot and arid, even by Neferati standards. The volcanic soil is rich but water is scarce. Agriculture depends on careful irrigation from the few rivers that flow from the central highlands.

The landscape is dominated by dark volcanic rock, ancient lava flows now weathered into strange formations, and the ever-present heat that rises from the ground. Visitors from cooler climates find Yaif nearly unbearable. The Neferati find it comfortable.

#### Capital: Ashenheart

Yaif's capital is built into the slopes of an extinct volcano, its buildings carved from the same dark stone that surrounds it. The architecture is ancient—some structures predate recorded history—and the streets follow paths worn by thousands of years of feet.

**Population**: ~40,000

Ashenheart is a city of temples, shrines, and sacred sites. More priests per capita than any other city in Tarkhon. The spiritual heart of Neferati culture.

The city is quieter than outsiders expect. Where other Neferati kingdoms burn bright with passion and innovation, Yaif burns steady with tradition and memory. The fire here is ancient, patient, eternal.

#### Queen Seraphel

The ruler of Yaif is **Queen Seraphel**, who has sat the throne for sixty-three years—longer than any other current Neferati monarch.

Seraphel is old by Neferati standards—nearly eighty—but her mind remains sharp and her patience is legendary. She has seen kings rise and fall in Tarkhetan, watched empires rise and fall beyond the sea, and waited while the Kingdoms of Fire debated their future.

**Appearance**: Withered but dignified. Her red skin has faded to a deep rust, her horns have grown long and curved, and her eyes hold the weight of decades. She moves slowly but deliberately.

**Philosophy**: Seraphel believes in patience. The Neferati founded Tarkhon. The Neferati will reclaim it. But not through war or ultimatums—through time. Humans burn fast and die young. The Neferati can wait them out.

**Role in the Council**: The voice of caution. When Queen Khalira demands action, Seraphel reminds her that action taken too soon is worse than no action at all. When King Rashaan counsels accommodation, Seraphel warns that accommodation becomes surrender if it goes too far.

#### The Priesthood of First Fire

Yaif's most powerful institution isn't the throne—it's the priesthood that tends the Flame of First Fire.

The **High Priest of Origins** holds a position nearly equal to the queen's. The priesthood controls access to the flame, interprets sacred traditions, and advises on matters of spiritual significance. No major decision in Yaif is made without their blessing.

Current High Priest: **Ashvareth**, an ancient Neferati who claims to have personally witnessed the founding of Tarkhon. Whether this is true or exaggeration is debated. Either way, his authority is unquestioned.

#### Culture

Yaif is traditional where other Neferati kingdoms are innovative. The people here value:
- Continuity with the past
- Proper observance of ritual
- Patience and long-term thinking
- Sacred duty over personal desire

This doesn't mean Yaif is stagnant—Neferati passion still burns here. But it's directed toward preserving and perfecting traditions rather than creating new ones.

Fire dancing in Yaif follows ancient forms. The fire ceremonies are conducted exactly as they were a thousand years ago. Innovation is welcome, but only if it honors what came before.

#### Military

**Size**: Medium

**Quality**: High

**Character**: Ceremonial and defensive

Yaif maintains a significant military force, but it's oriented toward defending the sacred sites rather than projecting power. The **Temple Guard** is an elite force dedicated to protecting the Flame of First Fire—they would fight to the death before allowing any threat near it.

In any conflict, Yaif would be the last kingdom to fall. The terrain favors defense, the population is dedicated, and the prospect of losing the First Fire is unthinkable.

#### The Question of the Evertorch

More than any other kingdom, Yaif feels the loss of the Evertorch.

The flame in Tarkhetan was kindled from Yaif's fire. When Neferati priests visit Tarkhetan, they can tell—the Evertorch burns with the same light as the Flame of First Fire. It's a piece of Yaif, stolen and never returned.

Queen Seraphel has never publicly demanded the Evertorch's return. But the priesthood of Yaif holds detailed records of exactly how the flame was taken, exactly who took it, and exactly what promises were made. Those promises have not been kept.

Someday, Yaif intends to collect.

#### Relationship with Other Kingdoms

**With Kabir**: Respectful but distant. Yaif finds Kabir's commercial focus vulgar; Kabir finds Yaif's traditionalism stifling.

**With Gissemari**: Friendly. The artists of Gissemari often seek Yaif's blessing for their works, and Yaif appreciates beauty that honors tradition.

**With Wadiyah**: Tense. Queen Khalira's radicalism alarms Yaif's conservative establishment. Seraphel has spent considerable effort restraining Wadiyah's impulses.

**With Tarkhon**: Cold. Yaif remembers everything. They participate in the empire because the alternative is worse, but they've never forgiven the Severance and never will.

## Westrim

### Geography

Westrim occupies the northwestern quadrant of Rimihuica, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert and ringed by mountains and deadly jungles. This is a land of extremes—scorching desert sands, impenetrable jungle, and the mountain fortresses of dwarven city-states.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eronia Range forms the northern boundary, separating Westrim from the Tarkhon Empire. This mountain range includes several smaller ranges home to dwarven city-states.
- **East**: Transitions into the Innerrim jungle basin
- **South**: The Ishnit Jungles wrap around the southern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi
- **Southwest**: The Agreben Sea and the Greenwater Isles
- **West**: The Western Isles lie offshore; the state of Mueras occupies the western coastal region

#### Major Features

##### Dunes of Kunagi

The dominant feature of Westrim—a vast, kidney-shaped desert of golden sand stretching across the interior. Home to giant sand wurms reminiscent of *Dune*. The only reliable water source for hundreds of miles is Benshu's Promise, an oasis guarded by a deadly sphinx who demands riddles be answered before any may drink.

##### Ishnit Jungles

Covering the entire southern side of the Dunes of Kunagi, the Ishnit Jungles are among the most dangerous wilderness areas in Alaria. Home to the Naruaghin people and countless deadly monsters. Notable locations include:
- **Ekomorn**: A rift extending to the center of the material plane, feared by all
- **Demonwatch**: A darkstone palace on the southern cape, overrun by confined but immortal demons

##### Eronia Range

The northern mountain barrier, home to multiple dwarven city-states nestled among the peaks. These mountains catch moisture from the north, contributing to the rain shadow that creates the Dunes of Kunagi.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Agreben Sea**: Southwest of Westrim, south of Mueras, west of the Ishnit Jungles
- **Gulf of Norag**: South of the Ishnit Jungles

### Notable Locations

#### Dunes of Kunagi

##### Husakas

A desert region in the southwest Dunes of Kunagi, roamed by scorpion riders who have adapted to the harsh conditions. The water here carries a terrible curse—drinking causes complete loss of long-term memory. This has shaped the Husakas people's entire culture around memory preservation and scorpion symbiosis.

See the full [Husakas](Husakas.md) entry for the scorpion rider culture, the Twice-Born, and notable locations.

##### House of the Scorpion

A half-buried palace in northern Husakas where the Prince of Scorpions dwells—a tragic, transformed figure who maintains all scorpions in the desert. The Husakas make bicentennial pilgrimages here, trading memories for the continued survival of their bonded mounts.

See the full [House of the Scorpion](House%20of%20the%20Scorpion.md) entry for the Prince, the pilgrimage ritual, and why killing him would be catastrophic.

##### Gyerekas

The fossil reef hills marking Husakas's southern boundary—ancient coral formations and the bones of creatures from a vanished sea. The Husakas call it the Bone Garden. It serves as neutral trading ground and contains dangerous cave systems leading into unknown depths.

See the full [Gyerekas](Gyerekas.md) entry for the reef's resources, the Leviathan's Rest, and the Dwellers Below.

##### Spotted Forest

Where the Dunes of Kunagi surrender to the savanna, the land fractures into scattered oases—the Spotted Forest. A patchwork of verdant islands fed by underground springs, home to the Spotted Ones (mixed Husakas-Chule descent) who serve as intermediaries between desert and grassland cultures.

See the full [Spotted Forest](Spotted%20Forest.md) entry for the oasis ecology, trading crossroads, and current tensions.

#### Mueras

The westernmost state of Rimihuica, Mueras occupies a stretch of brutally fragmented coastline where the land has shattered against the sea. Cliff-walled islands, treacherous channels, and hidden harbors define this region—geography that created the merchant-king oligarchy. Those who know the waters control the trade; those who control the trade rule Mueras.

The coast runs roughly 400 miles north to south, from the Mueras Highlands and Hammer Coast in the north to the Beak of Mueras peninsula in the south. Inland, the arid Dustwind Plateau separates the wealthy coastal cities from the darker eastern reaches—the Taflex Forest, Grimreach, and the shadow-haunted Darkened Coast.

Key features include:
- **Labyrinth Sound**: A maze of treacherous channels controlled by pilot guilds loyal to the merchant-kings
- **Corpse Bay**: Waters where the dead wash ashore with disturbing regularity
- **Kaspion**: The old capital, death-cursed when King Kasper fell 118 years ago, now a ghost-haunted ruin
- **Bazz**: The de facto capital, seat of the Council of Seven merchant-king houses
- **The Darkened Coast**: A stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow, home to dark-attuned sea creatures
- **Sal'emri Bay**: Tarkhon trading enclaves maintaining careful neutrality in merchant-king politics

See the full [Mueras](Mueras.md) entry for detailed coverage of settlements, merchant houses, and regional hazards.

#### Atriik

A confederation of four city-states in southwestern Westrim, occupying the territory between the Milras Forest (north), the Dunes of Kunagi (east), the Bloodlands and Ishnit Jungles (south), and Shark Bay (west). The Kor and Sharabha peoples here share a culture of elaborate courtesy that masks constant political maneuvering.

Key features include:
- **The City-States**: Lupuno, Byonowidi, Shinii, and Wykakas—three Kor monarchies and one Sharabha
- **Mykala**: A ruined fortress at the base of a colossal tree (30-mile canopy), sacred to all four city-states
- **Milras Forest**: Dense old-growth woodland containing the time-warped ruins of Milreun Palace
- **Fatiik Forest**: Contested woodland on the Naruaghin border
- **Sprenwood**: Managed coastal forest providing timber and furs
- **Shark Bay**: Maritime access controlled by the Kendor sea-folk of Watalina
- **The Bloodlands**: Scarred buffer zone between Atriik and Naruaghin territory
- **Kunagi Hills**: Eastern transitional zone, gateway to the desert trade

See the full [Atriik](Atriik.md) entry for detailed coverage of the city-states and regional features.

### Atriik

Tags: region, state, nation

A confederation of four city-states in southwestern Westrim, wedged between the Milras Forest to the north, the Dunes of Kunagi to the east, the Bloodlands and Ishnit Jungles to the south, and Shark Bay to the west. Atriik is not a unified nation but a loose alliance of Kor and Sharabha monarchies bound by shared culture, mutual defense, and elaborate courtesy that masks constant low-grade political maneuvering.

The land here transitions from the deep forests of the north through savanna and scrubland into the contested Bloodlands bordering Naruaghin territory. Four major rivers—the Sha Puniki, Sha Ulokoni, Sha Kariki, and Sha Sonisst—drain from the forests toward the desert's edge, providing the water that makes settlement possible.

#### Geography

**Northern Boundary**: The Milras Forest, a dense old-growth woodland extending to the Wyrm Teeth hills. The forest contains Milreun Palace, an ancient time-distorting ruin.

**Eastern Boundary**: The Kunagi Hills, a transitional zone of scrub-covered ridges that give way to the Dunes of Kunagi proper. This is desert-margin territory—dry but not yet lifeless.

**Southern Boundary**: The Bloodlands, a scarred buffer zone where Atriik's settled lands give way to Naruaghin raiding territory. Beyond lies the Ishnit Jungles.

**Western Boundary**: Shark Bay and the coastal forests (Sprenwood). The bay provides Atriik's only maritime access, though the Kendor sea-people of Watalina control the deeper waters.

**Central Terrain**: Savanna-woodland mosaic, with scattered trees and tall grasses between the major forests. Good hunting territory; the source of Atriik's fur trade.

#### The City-States

##### Lupuno

The northwestern city-state, built where the Sha Puniki emerges from the Milras Forest. Lupuno controls the timber trade from the forest edge and the river traffic heading south. The Kor monarchy here has the closest ties to Kura and the northern states.

**Population**: ~18,000

##### Byonowidi

The western city-state and Atriik's only Sharabha monarchy. Located on the Sha Ulokoni near the edge of Sprenwood, Byonowidi is the confederation's fur-trading heart. Sharabha cavalry from Byonowidi are renowned across Westrim.

**Population**: ~20,000

The Sharabha royal family chafes at being the odd kingdom out—three Kor monarchies united by race against one Sharabha, despite identical cultural values. Political marriages between the houses have done little to ease this tension.

##### Shinii

The eastern city-state, positioned on the Kunagi Hills' western edge as the gateway to desert trade. Shinii handles the caravans coming west from the Dunes of Kunagi, exchanging Atriik's furs and timber for glass, spices, and goods from across the desert.

**Population**: ~15,000

##### Wykakas

The southernmost city-state, built on the Sha Sonisst as Atriik's first line of defense against Naruaghin incursions from the Bloodlands. Wykakas is more militarized than its sister cities—less courtly polish, more practical vigilance.

**Population**: ~12,000

#### Mykala

At the center of Atriik stands Mykala—a ruined fortress built at the base of the largest tree in all of Alaria. The tree's canopy stretches thirty miles in diameter; its trunk measures two miles across. In its shade, the fortress was constructed in an age now forgotten.

Mykala is sacred to all four city-states. Pilgrimages here are common, and the site's neutrality is the one thing all four monarchies agree on. Currently, a druid maintains the grove and accepts pilgrims. An Elnor has arrived with intentions to claim the site, and the resulting standoff threatens the religious stability of the entire confederation.

#### The Rivers

Atriik's four rivers all bear the prefix "Sha" (meaning "river" or "waters" in the local tongue):

- **Sha Puniki**: Flows from Milras Forest past Lupuno toward the eastern scrublands
- **Sha Ulokoni**: Flows through Sprenwood past Byonowidi
- **Sha Kariki**: Central river through Fatiik Forest
- **Sha Sonisst**: Southern river through Wykakas, reaching the Bloodlands

#### Sandskull

East of the settled lands, where the Kunagi Hills meet the desert proper, stand the ruins of Sandskull—a fortress or temple of unknown origin, half-buried in drifting sand. The skull-shaped rock formation that gives it its name is visible for miles across the flat terrain.

Sandskull predates Atriik's founding. Local legends connect it to the wyrm-keepers who once controlled the giant sand wurms of the Kunagi, though the ruins show no obvious connection to Urk Noulgas in the Wyrm Teeth. Treasure hunters occasionally make the journey; fewer return than set out.

#### Culture

See also: [Atriik (state entry)](../../nations_and_powers/states/Atriik.md)

The Kor and Sharabha of Atriik share a culture of elaborate courtesy, formal speech, and social hierarchy. Direct confrontation is avoided; indirect implication is the weapon of choice. Political disputes play out through carefully worded letters, deliberate scheduling of meetings, and the studied application of hospitality or its absence.

Outsiders find this exhausting. Atriik nobles consider directness barbaric.

### Baerlüen Mountains

### Bloodlands

Tags: region, geography

The scarred buffer zone between Atriik's southern reaches and the Ishnit Jungles, where generations of warfare between the Kor/Sharabha city-states and the Naruaghin tribes have stained the earth red—sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally.

#### Character

The Bloodlands are not a single terrain type but a transition zone: the thinning southern edge of Fatiik Forest gives way to thornscrub, then to burned grassland, then to the jungle's northern fringe. The soil here is iron-rich and red-brown, which gives the region its name—though the blood that has been spilled across these lands over centuries hasn't hurt the reputation.

This is raiding country. Neither side holds it permanently. The Naruaghin push north when they sense weakness; Atriik forces push south when they need to make a point. The result is a landscape of abandoned fortifications, burned villages, and mass graves that the rain uncovers every wet season.

#### Warfare Pattern

The conflict here isn't a war in any formal sense—there are no declarations, no treaties, no clear objectives beyond "raid what you can, hold what you must." The pattern repeats:

1. **Dry Season**: Naruaghin war parties move north through the Bloodlands, probing Atriik's defenses. Small raids for slaves, food, and prestige.

2. **Early Rains**: Raiding intensifies as both sides try to secure resources before the rivers flood. Major clashes are more common.

3. **Wet Season**: The Sha Sonisst floods, the jungle paths become impassable, and both sides retreat to defensible positions. Relative peace.

4. **Late Dry**: The cycle begins again.

#### Notable Features

**The Bone Field**: A stretch of open ground where a particularly bloody battle occurred generations ago. The dead were never buried properly, and bones still surface after heavy rains. Both sides avoid camping here.

**Fort Wykakas-South**: The southernmost permanent Atriik fortification, a stone-and-timber structure overlooking a Sha Sonisst ford. Manned year-round by Wykakas militia, it marks the effective limit of Atriik control.

**The Burned Villages**: At least a dozen abandoned settlements dot the Bloodlands—places where Atriik settlers tried to push south or Naruaghin groups tried to establish permanent camps. All burned, all empty.

**The Jungle's Edge**: Where the Bloodlands meet the Ishnit proper, the transition is abrupt. One step you're in thornscrub; the next, the jungle canopy closes overhead. Naruaghin war parties emerge from this edge without warning and vanish back into it when pursued.

#### Strategic Significance

The Bloodlands exist because neither side can conquer them. Atriik lacks the numbers and the unity to push into the Ishnit Jungles proper. The Naruaghin lack the organization and logistics to hold territory north of the jungle edge. The result is a permanent wound in the landscape—and a constant drain on Atriik's southern city-states.

Wykakas bears the brunt of this, which explains why that city-state is the most militarized and least courtly of the four. You don't develop elaborate greeting rituals when you're checking the southern perimeter for war parties.

#### Benshu's Promise

This oasis is located in the Dunes of Kunagi, and is the only source of freshwater for hundreds of miles. It is guarded by Benshu, a large, incredibly deadly sphinx. To drink from the water, you must answer at least one of the sphinx's three questions correctly. If you drink from the oasis before asking the sphinx for permission, the sphinx captures you (all your muscles go limp) and gives you choice for doing maze or being eaten.

#### Shyalaviin (Malasi Karkus)

Hills just south of the Eronia range that poke into the northern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi. This region, also known as Malasi Karkus, is home to the Blitzling—creatures that inhabit these transitional hills between the mountains and the desert sands.

### Dustwind Plateau

Tags: plains, geography, arid

The arid heart of Mueras, a high tableland swept by winds that never cease. The Dustwind Plateau separates the wealthy coastal cities from the eastern reaches—a buffer zone where few settlements survive and fewer prosper. Caravans cross it to avoid the longer sea route around the Beak, but the journey is harsh, and the plateau claims its share of the unprepared.

The plateau rises gradually from the coast, reaching its full height some forty miles inland. From there, it stretches east to the edge of the Taflex Forest, north to the Mueras Highlands, and south toward the approaches to Grimreach. The elevation creates the dryness—moisture from the sea rarely reaches this far—and the constant wind strips what little water remains.

#### The Wind

The plateau's namesake wind blows from the northeast, funneled between the Mueras Highlands and the distant Eronia Range. It carries fine dust from the plateau surface—a reddish powder that gets into everything: clothes, food, lungs, eyes. Veteran plateau travelers wrap their faces and accept the grit as part of the journey.

The wind never stops. Even on calm days by coastal standards, the plateau wind persists. During storms, it can strip flesh from exposed skin, sandblast wood, and overturn laden carts. The storms are rare but deadly, and experienced guides watch the horizon constantly for the telltale red clouds.

Locals claim the dust carries whispers—fragments of voice from the dead of Kaspion, carried by the wind from the cursed city. Scholars attribute the sounds to wind through rock formations, the acoustic tricks of a landscape carved by erosion. Both explanations have merit. This is Mueras; the mundane and the supernatural coexist.

#### Crossing the Plateau

Three main routes cross the Dustwind:

**The Northern Track**: From the Hammer Coast settlements to the Tarns, skirting the edge of the Mueras Highlands. The shortest crossing, but also the roughest—the track climbs through broken terrain where flash floods cut sudden gullies. House Hammren maintains way stations along this route.

**The Central Road**: From Bazz and the Labyrinth Sound ports to the Taflex Forest edge. The most-traveled route, used by timber merchants and those seeking the Yngli trade. Way stations are more frequent here, though still a day's travel apart.

**The Southern Passage**: From the Beak of Mueras toward Grimreach and the Darkened Coast trade. The least-traveled route, used mainly by those whose business involves shadow-touched goods. House Yoros maintains this road, such as it is.

All three routes require preparation. Water sources are rare and unreliable—springs that flow one season may be dry the next. Guides who know the current conditions are essential, and the merchant-kings charge for their services. The pilot-guild model extends even here: those who know the way control the passage.

#### Way Stations

Scattered across the plateau, way stations provide the only shelter between settlements. Most are simple affairs: stone walls, a roof, a cistern to catch what rain falls, and pens for pack animals. Some are maintained by merchant-king houses as part of their caravan operations; others are independent, charging travelers for water, fodder, and protection from the elements.

The way stations have their own culture, distinct from either coast or forest. The people who run them are a tough, independent breed, willing to live in isolation for the freedom it provides. They answer to no merchant-king directly, though they maintain working relationships with whoever controls their route. A way station keeper who makes enemies of a major house won't stay in business long.

#### The Highland Commons

Where the plateau meets the Mueras Highlands, the terrain rises into rocky hills with thin soil and sparse vegetation. This is "the commons"—the one part of Mueras no merchant-king has claimed. Yngli herding communities maintain small flocks of hardy goats here, and a few mining operations extract iron and copper from shallow deposits.

The commons folk are poor by coastal standards but free in ways the city-dwellers aren't. They owe no harbor fees, swear no pilot oaths, and answer to no house. When the merchant-kings need expendable muscle—raiders to harass rival caravans, soldiers for operations too dirty for house troops—they recruit from the commons. The pay is good; the survival rate is not.

#### Plateau Wildlife

Life on the Dustwind is sparse but persistent. Hardy scrub vegetation clings to ravines where water occasionally collects. Reptiles dominate—lizards, snakes, and the occasional dust drake, a smaller cousin of true dragons that has adapted to the arid environment. Dust drakes are dangerous but valuable; their scales are used in alchemical preparations, and a live one can fetch a fortune in Bazz.

Larger predators are rare but present. Something hunts the plateau's edges—tracks suggest a large cat, but sightings are inconsistent. The locals call it the "dustwalker" and give offerings at certain rock formations to appease it. Whether it's a natural animal, something supernatural, or simply legend is unclear.

#### The Dead Winds

Certain areas of the plateau are avoided even by experienced guides. These "dead wind" zones are places where the constant wind doesn't reach—sheltered valleys or canyon systems where the air sits still and heavy. The stillness is unsettling after the constant motion elsewhere, but that's not why they're avoided.

The dead wind zones are haunted. Not by ghosts in the Kaspion sense—the dead of the plateau don't walk. But the silence has weight, and travelers who camp in dead wind zones report nightmares, strange sounds, and the sense of being watched. Some don't wake at all.

Scholars theorize the dead wind zones are places where Kasper's curse settled most heavily—where the spiritual damage from his mass death collected like water in low ground. Others suggest older causes, pre-dating Kasper by centuries. The plateau has been harsh country for longer than humans have recorded history.

#### The Dust Trade

One unlikely industry thrives on the plateau: dust collection. The reddish dust that coats everything has alchemical properties—used properly, it enhances fire magic and serves as a component in various preparations. House Velani maintains dust-collection operations at several points on the plateau, harvesting the wind's leavings and shipping them to markets across Alaria.

The collectors are an odd bunch, even by plateau standards. They work alone, tending collection screens and storage vessels, rarely seeing another person for weeks at a time. The isolation drives some mad. Others find peace in it. Either way, the dust keeps flowing to market, and House Velani keeps paying.

### East Naruaghin Tribes

Tags: state, nation

The East Naruaghin occupy the borderlands between the Ishnit Jungles and the Green Wilds of Enapay. Once the most prosperous of the three tribal confederations, they are now locked in an existential war with the Dwelyn—a conflict they were losing badly until Surrey Mahaila fell ill.

#### Territory

The eastern tribes claim the jungle fringe where dense Ishnit growth gives way to the more open Green Wilds. This transitional zone offers the best hunting in all Naruaghin territory—game is plentiful, rivers are navigable, and the soil supports cultivation. It's also why the Dwelyn want it.

#### Culture

The East Naruaghin have adapted more than their kin. Contact with Enapay—first through trade, then through war—has forced them to organize. Where other Naruaghin tribes fight in loose warbands, the East have developed something approaching military discipline.

**War Councils**: The eastern tribes coordinate through councils of war-leaders who meet regularly to plan strategy. This is unprecedented among Naruaghin, who traditionally settle disputes through individual combat.

**Fortified Settlements**: Eastern villages feature defensive earthworks, sharpened-stake perimeters, and elevated watchtowers. They've learned that the Dwelyn don't fight like Naruaghin—they fight like an army.

**Trophy Beads**: The East Naruaghin have adopted a version of the Dwelyn bead tradition, wearing strings of Dwelyn teeth and bone fragments to mark their kills. It began as mockery but has become genuine cultural practice.

#### The Dwelyn War

The conflict began three generations ago when Dwelyn expansion pushed into traditional East Naruaghin hunting grounds. Initial skirmishes escalated into sustained warfare. For decades, the Dwelyn dominated—their queen's dragon, Surrey Mahaila, could devastate entire war-parties with a single pass.

Then Surrey Mahaila fell ill.

The dragon's sickness has transformed the war. Dwelyn raids have become cautious. Their queen no longer rides to battle. The East Naruaghin have pressed their advantage, reclaiming territory and launching counter-raids into the Green Wilds themselves.

But the tribes know this reprieve may be temporary. If the Dwelyn cure their dragon, the war returns to its former balance. If they don't, the East Naruaghin might finally drive their enemies from the jungle entirely—or the Dwelyn might grow desperate enough to attempt something drastic.

#### Dragon Relations

The East Naruaghin occupy a narrow corridor between the territories of Pythalomos and Senwyn. Neither dragon hunts here regularly—they prefer the deeper jungle where prey can't escape. This relative safety from dragon predation is one reason the eastern tribes have grown strong enough to resist the Dwelyn.

The tribes maintain a wary respect for Surrey Mahaila, despite the war. The emerald dragon is ancient, and Naruaghin oral tradition speaks of her presence long before the Dwelyn arrived. Some shamans whisper that the dragon's sickness is a punishment—though for what, they cannot agree.

#### Relations with Other Tribes

The other Naruaghin view the East with complicated feelings. The South raid them for resources and warriors; the North consider them corrupted by foreign contact. Yet when major threats emerge—dragon attacks, demon incursions—the East can call on tribal solidarity. Blood is blood.

The East Naruaghin increasingly see themselves as the Naruaghin future: organized, disciplined, capable of facing external threats. They pity their cousins, trapped fighting dragons and demons while the East builds something that might last.

#### Notable Locations

**Ishtar Ford**: The main crossing point on the Ishtar River, and the de facto border between Naruaghin and Dwelyn territory. Both sides maintain camps here during truces; both sides have burned the other's camps during offensives.

**The Raid Camps**: Semi-permanent military encampments where eastern warriors gather before strikes into Dwelyn territory. Locations shift regularly to avoid retaliation.

**Bone Hill**: A prominent hill where the East Naruaghin display the skulls of slain Dwelyn warriors. It serves as both trophy display and territorial marker. The Dwelyn have burned it twice; the Naruaghin have rebuilt it three times.

### Enapay

Tags: state, nation

The ancient Dwelyn monarchy occupying the Green Wilds at the edge of the Ishnit Jungles. Enapay has been the Dwelyn homeland since before written history, its queens bonded to the emerald dragon Surrey Mahaila through a ritual known only to the royal line.

For full details on government, culture, and current crisis, see the state entry: [Enapay](../../nations_and_powers/states/Enapay.md)

#### Territory

Enapay claims the entirety of the Green Wilds, though effective control extends only as far as Dwelyn settlements and patrol routes. The nation's heartland lies along the Ishtar River, with the capital Lise at its delta. Eastern territories—the Green Marches—remain contested with East Naruaghin tribes.

The nation has no coastline. The Gulf of Norag lies thirty miles south of Lise, but Naruaghin tribes and cursed waters prevent direct access. All trade flows overland or upriver.

### Fatiik Forest

Tags: forest, geography

A transitional forest in central-southern Atriik, straddling the border between settled Kor lands and the contested Bloodlands to the south. The Sha Kariki flows through its center.

#### Character

Fatiik is neither as ancient as Milras nor as managed as Sprenwood—it exists in a state of perpetual wildness because no one can hold it long enough to tame it. The forest is prime territory for Naruaghin raiding parties moving north, and Atriik hunting parties moving south, and the two groups meet with depressing regularity.

The trees are drought-adapted species suited to the drier climate near the Kunagi: thorny acacias, fever trees, and the distinctive baobab-like giants that store water in their swollen trunks. The canopy is open enough for mounted passage, which makes it excellent cavalry country—and terrible infantry ground when the enemy knows the terrain better than you do.

#### Contested Territory

Fatiik is officially part of Atriik, claimed by both Wykakas and Byonowidi depending on which royal house you ask. In practice, control extends only as far as patrols can enforce it. The forest's southern half is effectively a no-man's-land where:

- Kor hunting parties take game and furs, always in armed groups
- Sharabha cavalry from Byonowidi conduct sweeps for Naruaghin scouts
- Naruaghin war parties probe north, testing the defenses
- Outlaws and deserters from all sides hide in the deeper groves

#### The Sha Kariki

The central river provides the only reliable water in the forest during the dry season. Control of the Sha Kariki's crossing points is hotly contested—whoever holds the fords can project force across the forest. Several small fortified camps dot the riverbank, manned by Atriik militia during the raiding season and abandoned when the rains come.

#### Notable Features

**The Raiding Trail**: An informal but well-worn path running north-south through the forest, used by Naruaghin parties approaching Atriik. Atriik forces patrol it; Naruaghin scouts know how to avoid them.

**Fever Tree Grove**: A distinctive stand of yellow-barked fever trees near the forest's heart, visible from miles away when the sun hits them right. The grove is considered neutral ground by some local traditions—a place where enemies might negotiate rather than fight.

**The Kariki Fords**: Three reliable crossing points on the Sha Kariki, each with a fortified camp nearby. During dry season, these are the most strategically valuable real estate in Atriik.

### Green Wilds

Tags: forest, geography, jungle

The Green Wilds are what the Ishnit Jungles become when they thin enough to walk through—still dangerous, still wild, but no longer the impenetrable deathscape of the deep jungle. The Dwelyn of Enapay claim this territory, but claiming and controlling are different things. Beyond the Ishtar River corridor where Lise sits, the Green Wilds belong to no one.

#### Character

The trees here still tower two hundred feet, but they stand far enough apart for a person to pass between them. Undergrowth chokes the forest floor—thick, tangled, but cuttable with effort. Rivers run clearer than in the Ishnit, and some game trails stay open long enough to follow. It's wilderness, not wasteland.

But it's empty wilderness. No villages. No roads. No patrols beyond the occasional Dwelyn hunting party that ventures in and—sometimes—ventures back out. The Green Wilds are the space between Enapay's claimed heartland and the Naruaghin territories to the east: a buffer zone that neither side truly holds.

Three rivers cut through the region: the Byzkus through the center, the Pino to the southwest, and the Morsuye marking the southern edge. Unlike the Ishtar—which flows past Lise and carries what little trade Enapay sees—these rivers run through territory no one has mapped and few have survived.

To the north, the forest thins into scrubland called the Royon, where jungle gives way to the Dunes of Kunagi. To the south, the canopy thickens until it becomes true Ishnit. East lies Naruaghin territory. West, eventually, the Ishtar and civilization.

#### The Rivers

Three rivers drain the Green Wilds into the Gulf of Norag. None are safe.

##### Byzkus River

The Byzkus cuts through the heart of the Wilds, flowing south from somewhere near the Royon scrublands. It's the largest of the three—wide enough for canoes, fast enough to be dangerous, and long enough that no one knows its full course. Dwelyn hunters sometimes follow it inland. Most turn back before they learn what lives in the deeper stretches.

Since Surrey Mahaila's sickness began, the few hunters who venture along the Byzkus report strange things. Waters that glow wrong colors at night. Game that moves against the current. The sense that something is watching from just beneath the surface. Whether the river is connected to the Faesong poisoning, or merely reflects it, no one has stayed long enough to find out.

##### Pino River

The Pino drains the southwestern Wilds, smaller and slower than the Byzkus. It flows through territory the Dwelyn nominally claim but have never actually occupied—too far from Lise, too close to Naruaghin raiding routes. The river eventually reaches the coast somewhere near the Gulf of Norag's contested waters.

No one lives along the Pino. Occasionally a Dwelyn hunting party will follow it for a few days before turning back. The forest here is quieter than it should be—fewer birds, fewer insects, fewer of the usual jungle sounds. Hunters call it "dead water" and avoid it when they can.

##### Morsuye River

The Morsuye marks the southern edge of anything that could be called the Green Wilds. Beyond it, the forest thickens into true Ishnit—Naruaghin territory, or worse. The river itself flows toward the cursed waters near Demortik Bay, and nothing good comes from that direction.

No Dwelyn has mapped the Morsuye. No Dwelyn has reason to. It's a boundary, not a pathway—the line where Enapay's theoretical claims end and the jungle's reality begins.

#### The Royon

Where the Green Wilds meet the Dunes of Kunagi, the forest thins into scrubland. The Royon stretches for perhaps thirty miles—trees growing shorter and sparser until they give way to thornbush, then to sand and heat shimmer.

Nothing lives here that doesn't have to. The scrub is too dry for jungle creatures, too vegetated for desert dwellers. Game animals pass through during seasonal migrations, and predators follow them. Otherwise, the Royon sits empty—a no-man's-land between two hostile ecosystems.

Scattered across the scrubland are stone foundations and toppled columns, remnants of some civilization that predated the Dwelyn. No one knows who built them or why. The ruins are picked clean of anything obviously valuable, but occasionally a sandstorm will uncover something new—a buried chamber, a sealed jar, a skeleton clutching something that glints.

#### Melera Skeyad

Deep in the Green Wilds, where the Byzkus River curves around an ancient hill, stand the ruins of Melera Skeyad—"Melera's Rest" in the old tongue.

The city is old. Older than the Dwelyn, older than the Naruaghin, older than anyone living can say. Its stones are wrong—too smooth, too precisely fitted, made of materials that don't exist in the surrounding jungle. Vines have consumed most of the structures, but enough remains visible to show that this was once a place of importance: temples, plazas, towers that must have risen higher than the canopy.

The Faesong runs strong here. Melera's imprisoned song pools in Melera Skeyad like water in a depression, resonating through the ruins with an intensity that's audible even to those with no magical sensitivity. The air hums. The stones vibrate at frequencies felt in the teeth. Those who stay too long report hearing voices in languages they don't recognize.

Or that's how it was.

Since Surrey Mahaila's sickness began, the song has changed. The harmony that once filled the ruins now carries a discordant note—subtle at first, then impossible to ignore. The vibrations feel wrong. The voices sound hungry. Visitors report headaches, nausea, and a persistent sense that something is watching from the empty doorways.

The Dwelyn believe Melera Skeyad is the epicenter of whatever poisoned the local Faesong. Queen Teyara has sent shamans to investigate. None have returned with answers. Some haven't returned at all. The ruins seem to resist examination—paths loop back on themselves, distances change between measurements, and those who push too deep find themselves expelled at the forest's edge with no memory of how they escaped.

Whatever is happening at Melera Skeyad, it's getting worse. The corruption spreads outward, following the rivers, seeping through the soil. If it isn't stopped, it may eventually reach Lise—and the Dragon's Roost.

#### Dangers

The Green Wilds are safer than the Ishnit Jungles, but that's a low bar. Everything here wants to eat you—the difference is that here you might see it coming.

**Fauna**: Blood Monkeys drop from the canopy onto exposed necks. Monkin set traps along game trails and wait. Great cats hunt at dawn and dusk, and some have learned that humans are easier prey than jungle deer. Serpents lurk in the undergrowth—most venomous, some large enough to crush a horse. The rivers hold things that grab from below and don't let go.

**Flora**: Singing Trees lure victims to sleep and implant their seeds. Certain vines strangle anything that brushes against them. Particular flowers poison by scent alone—you're dead before you realize you shouldn't have inhaled. The Dwelyn know which plants to avoid. Outsiders learn the hard way, if they learn at all.

**The Sickness**: Since the Faesong poisoning began, the Green Wilds have felt wrong. Animals behave strangely—predators that should flee from fire walk toward it instead. Plants grow in unsettling patterns, spiraling in directions that hurt to look at. Those who spend time in the deeper Wilds report troubled dreams, creative blocks, and a persistent sense that reality is slightly out of tune. Sensitive individuals—druids, bards, fae-touched—find the sensation nearly unbearable.

#### Player Hooks

**The Corrupted Ruins**: Whatever poisoned Melera Skeyad is killing Surrey Mahaila and threatening all of Enapay. Queen Teyara would give almost anything for answers—and she has the authority to grant land, titles, and dragon-favors to whoever provides them.

**River Mysteries**: The Byzkus shows signs of corruption—glowing waters, wrong-moving game, watchers beneath the surface. Following the river to its source might reveal what's happening to the Faesong. Or it might reveal something that doesn't want to be found.

**The Old Ruins**: The Royon's pre-Dwelyn foundations occasionally yield artifacts. Most are worthless. Some are dangerous. A few might be valuable enough to retire on—if you survive getting them out.

### Gyerekas

Tags: hills, geography

The southern boundary of the Dunes of Kunagi, where the sand sea breaks against a range of low, strange hills that aren't hills at all. Gyerekas is a fossilized reef—the remains of an ocean floor from an age when the desert was seafloor, now thrust up and exposed by geological forces older than human memory.

The Husakas call it the Bone Garden. They're not far wrong.

#### The Ancient Reef

Millions of years ago, a shallow sea covered what is now the Dunes of Kunagi. Coral grew in vast formations, shellfish the size of wagons burrowed in the muck, and creatures that left no descendants swam in warm, clear waters. When the sea retreated and the land rose, it left behind a graveyard frozen in stone.

The "hills" of Gyerekas are fossilized coral heads, some rising fifty feet above the surrounding sand. Wind erosion has carved them into fantastic shapes—spires, arches, hollow domes, and whorled formations that look disturbingly organic. The rock is pale gray-white, veined with darker mineral deposits, and rings hollow when struck.

Between the coral formations, the ancient seabed lies exposed: compressed layers of shell, bone, and sediment hardened into stone. Giant ammonite spirals jut from the ground. The ribcages of creatures with no modern name arc like the frames of sunken ships. Teeth the size of swords lie scattered like dropped coins.

#### Resources

The reef draws treasure seekers despite its dangers:

**Fossil Salt** — The ancient shells contain deposits of pure, crystallized salt from the vanished sea. This salt commands premium prices in desert trade—it's said to be more pure than any modern source, and some claim it has preservative properties beyond ordinary salt. The Husakas extract it carefully, knowing the formations that yield the best deposits.

**Memory Dust** — Certain fossils, when ground fine, produce a powder that desperate people believe can restore lost memories. It doesn't work—the Husakas have tested it extensively on their Twice-Born—but that doesn't stop outsiders from paying fortunes for it. The scorpion riders consider this trade distasteful but profitable. They never correct the buyers.

**Coral Stone** — The fossilized coral is surprisingly strong and takes a beautiful polish. Wealthy patrons in distant cities prize Gyerekas coral for decorative work. Extracting it is difficult and dangerous, but a single wagon-load can fund a caravan for years.

**Intact Specimens** — Scholars and collectors pay extraordinary sums for well-preserved fossils: complete ammonites, articulated skeletons, unusual formations. The reef has been picked over for generations, but new specimens still emerge as wind strips away covering sand.

#### The Bone Gardens

The central region of Gyerekas, where the fossil beds are densest and most exposed. Here, the ancient seabed creates a landscape like nothing else in Alaria—a forest of stone ribs and spiral shells, bleached white by countless suns, stretching for miles.

Walking through the Bone Gardens is disorienting. The formations create natural mazes, block sightlines, and play tricks with sound. Echoes bounce unpredictably. Winds moan through hollow coral like breath through a skull. The scorpion riders use it for training: if you can navigate the Gardens, you can navigate anywhere.

At the Gardens' heart lies the **Leviathan's Rest**—the nearly complete skeleton of something enormous. The skull alone is thirty feet long, filled with teeth like curved swords. The spine stretches back two hundred feet before disappearing into a dune. No one knows what it was. The Husakas leave offerings at its base and do not camp within sight of it.

#### The Coral Caves

The hollow coral formations create natural shelters throughout Gyerekas—cool in the day's heat, warm enough at night, protected from wind and sand. These caves have been used for generations:

**Clan Moots** — Several large coral formations contain chambers big enough for dozens of people. The Husakas clans use these as neutral meeting grounds, second only to the Gathering Stones in importance. The largest is the **Chamber of Echoes**, where words spoken at one end can be heard clearly at the other, a hundred feet away.

**Hermit Dens** — Smaller caves throughout the reef house those who've chosen solitude: outcasts, mystics, the grieving, and the mad. The Husakas respect their privacy but check on them periodically. Some hermits have lived in the reef for decades.

**The Deep Warrens** — Below the surface caves, a network of passages extends into darkness. These natural tunnels follow ancient water channels through the reef rock. Most are tight squeezes, but some open into larger chambers. What lies in the deepest warrens is unknown—exploration has been limited by the difficulty of navigation and the things that occasionally emerge from below. Pallid, eyeless creatures adapted to utter darkness. The Husakas seal known entrances when they can.

#### Dangers

**Collapse** — The coral formations are ancient and weathered. Hollow chambers can give way without warning, dropping climbers into the rubble or sealing cave entrances. The reef shifts constantly, grain by grain, and structures that stood for millennia can fall in an instant.

**The Dwellers Below** — Something lives in the deepest warrens. The Husakas don't know what—glimpses only, pale shapes retreating from torchlight, scratching sounds from sealed tunnels. They've learned which passages to avoid, which cave entrances to block with stone. Whatever dwells below has never emerged in force, but those who venture too deep don't always return.

**Sand Traps** — The spaces between coral formations fill with fine sand that can behave like quicksand during temperature shifts. Experienced travelers know to test their footing, especially at dawn and dusk when the sand is most unstable.

**Getting Lost** — The reef extends for roughly forty miles east to west, and navigation is treacherous. The formations all look similar, landmarks shift as sand moves, and the maze-like structure defeats simple direction-finding. Without a guide, travelers can wander for days within a few miles of safety.

#### Encountering Gyerekas

The reef serves as the primary meeting ground between the Husakas and outsiders. Caravans heading south toward the jungles, or north into the deep desert, often pause at Gyerekas to trade, hire guides, or simply rest in the coral caves' shade.

The scorpion riders maintain semi-permanent camps at several points along the reef's northern edge, where the sand gives way to fossil stone. These camps offer:
- Guides through the reef (expensive but essential)
- Trade in fossil salt, coral stone, and "memory dust"
- Information about conditions in Husakas proper
- Warnings about which caves and formations to avoid

The reef is considered neutral territory—clan feuds are suspended within Gyerekas, and violence against traders or travelers is punished severely. This makes it the safest place in the region to encounter the scorpion riders, if safety is a relative term.

### House of the Scorpion

Tags: poi, landmark

Half-buried in the northern reaches of Husakas, where the dunes pile highest against some invisible barrier, stands a palace of black chitin and sun-bleached stone. The House of the Scorpion rises from the sand like the carapace of something impossibly large, its towers curving like raised tails, its gates shaped like open claws.

This is the origin of all scorpions in the world, or so the Husakas believe. Here dwells the Prince of Scorpions, who has maintained the desert's children since before human memory. Here the scorpion riders make their bicentennial pilgrimage, trading memories for the continued existence of their bonded partners.

The House is not evil. The Prince is not a monster. But neither are they safe.

#### Exterior

The palace emerges from a massive dune that never shifts despite the endless desert winds. The structure is partially submerged—how much lies beneath the sand, no one knows. What's visible suggests something the size of a small fortress: three main towers, a central dome, connecting walls and passages that disappear into the dune at odd angles.

The architecture blends organic and constructed elements disturbingly well. Walls of fitted stone are reinforced with chitin plates. Pillars carved from rock are wrapped in what might be shed scorpion shells grown to impossible size. The black coloring comes from the chitin—the stone beneath is ordinary desert sandstone.

Scorpions are everywhere. They crawl across every surface: the walls, the sand, the rare visitors who approach. Most are ordinary-sized, but some are larger—dog-sized, pony-sized, one truly massive specimen that lies coiled around the main gate like a living portcullis. They don't attack unless provoked, but they watch. They always watch.

The entrance is through the great claw-gate, which opens only for those the Prince permits inside. Forcing entry is possible but unwise—the guardian scorpion is not merely large but ancient, and the walls themselves seem to crawl when threatened.

#### Interior

Inside, the House is larger than the exterior suggests. Chambers extend in directions that don't quite correspond to the building's visible footprint. The Husakas say the House exists partially in the scorpions' world, wherever that is, and its true size cannot be measured by human standards.

**The Receiving Hall** — The first chamber past the gates: a high-ceilinged space where sand has drifted into dunes against the walls. Chitin pillars support a dome that lets in diffuse light through amber panels. Visitors wait here until the Prince summons them deeper.

**The Gallery of Shells** — A corridor lined with mounted scorpion shells of every size and species, from thumbnail-tiny to larger than horses. These are not trophies—they're memorials, the shed or death-shells of every scorpion the Prince considered significant. Thousands of them, spanning millennia.

**The Memory Pool** — A circular chamber at the House's heart, containing a shallow pool of water that glows faintly amber. This is where the pilgrimage gift is given: visitors drink from the pool after telling the Prince something worth remembering. The water is connected to Husakas's cursed streams—same source, same effect. The Prince chose this punishment and this gift simultaneously, long ago.

**The Throne Chamber** — Beyond the Memory Pool, accessible only to those the Prince truly wishes to speak with. A room of living walls—the "stone" here is packed scorpions, thousands of them forming floor and ceiling and walls, shifting slowly, breathing as one. At the center, a raised dais where the Prince receives visitors.

**The Depths** — No visitor has seen what lies below the main level. The Husakas say tunnels extend deep beneath the desert, connecting to every scorpion nest in Husakas, perhaps every nest in the world. The Prince can feel every scorpion through these connections. Every birth, every death, every molt and mating.

#### The Prince of Scorpions

He was human once. The Husakas remember this, though they've forgotten his original name.

The Prince stands eight feet tall when he chooses to stand. His lower body is that of a giant scorpion—eight legs, heavy tail curving overhead, stinger dripping with venom that has never been tested on a willing subject. His upper body is humanoid but wrong: the skin has a chitinous sheen, the fingers end in hooked claws, and mandibles click beneath lips that still form human words.

His eyes are the worst part. He has too many—two large ones where human eyes should be, but also clusters of smaller eyes at his temples, on his forehead, along his jaw. They don't all focus on the same thing. When he looks at you, you're not sure which eyes are really looking.

**Speech** — The Prince speaks in riddles not because he enjoys them but because the transformation damaged his ability to communicate directly. Straightforward statements come out twisted, intentions inverted, meanings layered beneath meanings. He's been trying to say something clearly for longer than the Husakas have existed. He can't.

**Personality** — Beneath the monstrous form and broken speech, the Prince is lonely. He's been alone in the House for thousands of years, with only scorpions for company. Visitors are rare—the pilgrimage comes only twice a century. He wants to talk, to connect, to remember what it was like to be human. But everything he says comes out wrong, and most visitors are too terrified to try parsing his riddles.

He is not malicious. He does not enjoy fear or suffering. But he is deeply, fundamentally alien now, and his instincts don't always match human expectations. He might offer water to a guest without remembering what it does. He might ask a question that sounds like a threat. He might forget that humans need to sleep, or eat, or breathe.

**The Transformation** — The Prince doesn't remember becoming what he is. He remembers being human, then a long darkness, then waking as he is now with the knowledge that scorpions are his responsibility. He believes he chose this, but he can't remember why. Sometimes he wonders if he was tricked. Sometimes he wonders if he was always this way and the human memories are the lie.

#### The Pilgrimage

Every two hundred years, representatives from all Husakas clans gather at the House of the Scorpion. The pilgrimage serves two purposes: to renew the pact that keeps the desert's scorpions alive, and to give the Prince something no one else in the world possesses.

**The Approach** — Pilgrims travel together from the Gathering Stones, a journey of several days through the heart of Husakas. No clan feuds are permitted during the pilgrimage; this is sacred time. The scorpion mounts become agitated as they near the House, sensing something that draws and frightens them equally.

**The Gift** — Each pilgrim brings a memory. Something precious, something that would be a genuine loss to forget. They tell the Prince this memory in the Receiving Hall—not the Memory Pool, not yet—speaking it aloud while he listens with all his eyes. Small memories (a favorite meal, a childhood game) are accepted but unremarkable. Significant memories (a first love, a parent's death, a moment of perfect joy or perfect horror) please the Prince visibly.

**The Forgetting** — After telling their memory, pilgrims drink from the Memory Pool. The cursed water takes what they just gave. Now the Prince alone knows this thing; the pilgrim has forgotten they ever knew it. The Memory Keepers who witness the pilgrimage record what was given, but the pilgrims themselves leave with gaps they can never fill.

**The Renewal** — Once all gifts are given, the Prince descends to the Depths and does... something. The Husakas don't know what. They feel it, though—every bonded scorpion in the desert convulses briefly, then settles. The bond is renewed. The scorpions will survive another two centuries.

#### Why Killing the Prince Would Be Catastrophic

Outsiders sometimes hear about the House of the Scorpion and think: monster, lair, quest. Kill the half-scorpion abomination, free the desert from its curse, be heroes.

This would be a disaster.

The Prince is the keystone of every scorpion in the desert, possibly the world. His existence maintains theirs. If he dies, they die—all of them, everywhere, within days. The giant mounts would collapse. The ordinary scorpions would vanish. The ecosystem that depends on them would follow.

For the Husakas, this would be genocide. Their culture depends on the scorpion bond. Without the great scorpions, they cannot survive the desert. They would die or be forced to abandon their homeland entirely.

The curse on the water would likely end—the Prince seems to be its source—but the cost would be unimaginable.

The scorpion riders know this. They protect the House not out of worship but necessity. Anyone who threatens the Prince threatens their entire people, and they respond accordingly.

#### Visiting the House

Few outsiders ever see the House of the Scorpion. It's deep in the desert, far from any trade route, in territory the scorpion riders don't encourage visitors to enter. But it's not impossible to reach, and the Prince does receive guests between pilgrimages.

**Getting There** — Requires either a Husakas guide (expensive, requires trust) or exceptional desert survival skills. The House is visible from miles away once you're close enough—the dune that never moves is distinctive.

**Getting In** — The guardian scorpion judges visitors by criteria no one fully understands. It seems to respond to intent: those who come to harm the Prince are denied; those who come seeking something else may be admitted. Or not. The scorpion's judgment is not always explicable.

**Inside** — Visitors who enter are not prisoners but are strongly encouraged not to wander. The House is larger than it looks, the deeper chambers are dangerous, and the Prince dislikes uninvited exploration. Stay in the Receiving Hall until summoned. Accept the Prince's hospitality if offered—he can provide food, water (safe water, from outside Husakas), and shelter. Do not drink from any pool or fountain without explicit confirmation that it's safe.

**Conversation** — Speaking with the Prince requires patience. His riddles aren't games; they're the only way he can communicate. Listen for the meaning beneath the words. Ask clarifying questions. Don't assume threat where none is intended. He's been alone a very long time, and he's starved for connection more than anything else.

**Leaving** — The Prince does not hold visitors against their will. Anyone may leave at any time. But those who've seen the interior of the House sometimes find the desert changed afterward—or find themselves changed. The Prince's attention lingers.

#### Adventure Hooks

- **The Early Pilgrimage** — Something is wrong with the scorpions. They're dying, sickening, refusing to bond. The clans need to reach the House of the Scorpion immediately, but the pilgrimage isn't due for decades. Do they dare approach the Prince out of cycle? What will he demand in exchange for early renewal?

- **The Translation** — A scholar believes she can help the Prince communicate clearly, breaking the riddle-curse that traps his speech. She needs escorts to reach the House and protection while she works. But what if the Prince doesn't want to be "fixed"? What if the riddles hide something he can't bear to say directly?

- **The Pretender** — Someone is claiming to be the Prince of Scorpions' heir, demanding tribute from scorpion rider clans. The Prince has no heir. But the pretender can command scorpions in ways no ordinary person should be able to. What is their true connection to the House?

- **The Merciful Assassination** — A dying Twice-Born begs the party to kill the Prince—not out of hatred, but mercy. She remembers nothing of her former life, but she's had visions suggesting the Prince is in agony, trapped in a form he never truly chose, maintaining a pact he wants to escape. Is any of this true? Would ending his existence be kindness or catastrophe?

### Husakas

Tags: desert, geography, culture

The southwestern reaches of the Dunes of Kunagi, where the sand sea breaks against the ancient fossil hills of Gyerekas and thins toward the Spotted Forest. Husakas is both a place and a people—the scorpion riders who have claimed this unforgiving territory as home for longer than anyone can remember.

Which is fitting, given what the land does to memory.

#### The Cursed Streams

Husakas contains something rare in the deep desert: water. Seasonal streams and creeks flow during the rare rains, collecting in rocky pools and underground cisterns. Travelers dying of thirst have praised their fortune upon finding these waters.

Then they drink.

The water of Husakas carries a terrible curse. Those who drink from its streams suffer complete and permanent loss of long-term memory. Not a gradual fading—a clean severance. Victims forget their names, their families, their entire lives before that moment. They retain language, skills, and general knowledge, but every personal memory vanishes like morning dew.

The curse is bound to the region itself. Water transported beyond Husakas's borders becomes ordinary, harmless. But within this territory, every stream, every pool, every drop of rainfall that touches the ground carries the forgetting. Even the morning dew can steal pieces of you if you're not careful.

The scorpion riders say the curse came from the House of the Scorpion—a gift and a punishment from the Prince who dwells there. Whether this is true, no one remembers.

#### The Scorpion Riders

The Husakas people have adapted to their cursed homeland in ways that would kill outsiders. Their culture revolves around two pillars: the scorpions they bond with, and the memories they guard more jealously than water.

##### Scorpion Symbiosis

The giant scorpions of Husakas grow to the size of horses, with chitin ranging from rust-red to deep black. The riders do not tame them—they *bond* with them, in a ritual involving mutual venom exchange that leaves both partners permanently changed. A bonded rider can sense their scorpion's moods, location, and needs; the scorpion gains something harder to define, a connection that makes it more than animal.

Bonded scorpions provide survival advantages beyond mere transportation:
- Their venom, carefully extracted, can paralyze prey animals, allowing riders to drink blood for hydration
- Scorpions can locate underground water sources—though they cannot tell cursed from clean
- A scorpion's chitinous body provides shade, and they generate surprisingly little heat
- In emergencies, a rider can drink the hemolymph from a dying scorpion's body—a terrible sacrifice that severs the bond painfully

##### Memory as Wealth

In a land where memory can be stolen by a careless sip, the Husakas prize memory above all other possessions. A person's recollections are their wealth, their identity, their soul. This has shaped their entire culture:

**Memory Keepers** — Specialized individuals who dedicate their lives to memorization. They carry the lineages of every family, the laws and customs, the locations of safe water, the histories of feuds and alliances. A Memory Keeper never travels alone, never approaches water without three witnesses, and is protected by the entire community. Killing a Memory Keeper is the worst crime imaginable—worse than murder, because you've killed thousands of memories, not just one person.

**The Telling** — Nightly ritual where riders share memories aloud, ensuring that important knowledge exists in multiple minds. Even mundane memories are shared—what you ate, who you spoke to, what you saw. If one person forgets, others remember for them.

**Name Chains** — Every Husakas carries a chain of names: their own, their parents', their grandparents', back seven generations. They recite this chain daily. If you cannot recite your chain, something is wrong.

#### The Twice-Born

Not everyone who drinks the cursed water dies. Some survive as blank slates—the Twice-Born.

The community cares for them with surprising tenderness. A Twice-Born is not shunned but welcomed as someone reborn into the tribe. They're given a new name, taught the customs anew, assigned a new family from volunteers. Many Twice-Born become productive members of society, their old identities mourned but their new selves accepted.

Some people *choose* this fate. Those carrying unbearable grief, overwhelming guilt, or memories they cannot live with may drink deliberately—a form of death that leaves the body walking. The community does not judge this choice, but they mourn the person who existed before.

The ritual is called **The Forgetting**, and it requires witnesses who will remember what the drinker chose to lose.

#### Geography

Husakas stretches across approximately 200 miles of the southwestern Kunagi, bounded by:
- **North**: The deeper Dunes, including the approaches to Benshu's Promise
- **East**: The transition toward the Innerrim jungles, marked by the Spotted Forest
- **South**: The fossil hills of Gyerekas, and beyond them, the Ishnit Jungles
- **West**: The main Kunagi Hills, where Sandskull broods at the range's southern extent

The terrain is classic sand desert—dunes ranging from gentle swells to towering crescents, rocky outcrops, and the occasional seasonal waterway cutting through ancient channels. The cursed streams are scattered throughout, with no reliable way to distinguish them from the rare clean water sources (there are some—usually deep wells that tap water from beyond the cursed region's borders).

#### Notable Locations

##### The Gathering Stones

A circle of wind-carved pillars in central Husakas where the scorpion rider clans meet during the cool season. Neutral ground—no feuds may be prosecuted here, no blood spilled except in formal duel. The Memory Keepers maintain archives here: carved stone tablets recording the most critical information, backup copies of what their minds hold.

##### The Weeping Wells

A cluster of deep wells that tap clean water from beneath the cursed layer. Discovered generations ago, fiercely guarded by a coalition of clans. The wells produce limited water—enough for the riders' needs, not enough to share freely. Outsiders may purchase water here at outrageous prices, or trade knowledge that the Memory Keepers deem worth preserving.

##### The Bone Road

A trail marked by scorpion molts and the skeletons of those who died seeking water. Follows the seasonal stream channels, which means it's also the most dangerous path through Husakas. Traders sometimes use it anyway—the streams are easier to follow than the featureless dunes.

#### Encountering the Husakas

The scorpion riders are neither hostile nor welcoming to outsiders. They'll trade information, guide travelers for appropriate payment, and share their fires with those who approach correctly (always from downwind, with hands visible, announcing yourself loudly).

They will not share their water unless you're dying—and even then, they'll warn you what you're drinking. They consider it a kindness to let someone die of thirst rather than live as a Twice-Born without community to catch them.

What they want from outsiders:
- News from beyond the desert
- Metal goods (rare in the sands)
- Interesting memories—tell them a good story, something worth preserving
- Medicines, particularly those affecting memory (they've been trying to cure or control the curse for generations)

What angers them:
- Wasting water of any kind
- Lying about your identity or history
- Interfering with the pilgrimage to the House of the Scorpion
- Treating scorpions as mere animals

#### The Pilgrimage

Every two hundred years, representatives from all Husakas clans travel to the House of the Scorpion to renew their pact with the Prince. The ritual involves gifts of memory—pilgrims tell the Prince something they know, then drink cursed water to forget it, giving him knowledge that exists nowhere else in the world.

In exchange, the Prince maintains the scorpion population throughout the desert. Without him, the great scorpions would dwindle and die within a generation.

The next pilgrimage is due in 47 years. Some clans have already begun preparing their offerings—memories so precious that forgetting them is genuine sacrifice.

### Ishnit Jungles

Tags: forest, geography

Superduper fucking deadly unless your quite powerful. Lots of nasty monsters.

Home to Naruaghin.

#### Ekomorn

Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The Naruaghin who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.

#### Demonwatch

A large darkstone palace on the southern cape of the Ishnit Jungles, its towers now strangled by centuries of vine growth. What was once a wizard's sanctuary is now a prison—not for the wizard, but for what he summoned.

##### The Summoning

The wizard Veleth Korrandus built Demonwatch roughly three centuries ago, far from civilization and prying eyes. He was one of the few mortals who had acquired genuine Deoric knowledge—fragments of the god-language that can reshape reality when spoken with sufficient blood sacrifice.

Veleth's ambition was to summon servants from the Stalactites of Geth, the demon-haunted formations that hang from Malstaris down to the Wastes beneath the world. Deoric ritual magic can reach across planar boundaries—the same mechanism by which daemons grant miracles to their worshippers, reversed. With the right words and enough sacrifice, a sufficiently knowledgeable mage can call entities from nearly anywhere.

The blood sacrifice required was... substantial. The South Naruaghin still tell stories of entire villages that vanished during Veleth's years of preparation.

##### The Failure

The summoning worked. The binding did not.

Veleth called seven demons from the Stalactites—lesser lords by demon standards, but devastatingly powerful by any mortal measure. He intended to bind them as servants using Deoric commands inscribed in the palace's architecture. But demons are ancient, patient, and intimately familiar with the god-language. They found the flaws in his binding before he could correct them.

Veleth died badly. The demons, freed from his control, found themselves trapped by a different mechanism: the darkstone walls of the palace itself. Whether Veleth built this as a failsafe or whether the stone simply absorbed enough Deoric power during construction to become a prison, the demons cannot pass beyond the palace grounds. They have tried for three hundred years.

##### Current State

The seven demons remain confined within Demonwatch's walls. They are immortal—they cannot die of age, starvation, or boredom. They are powerful—each could devastate a small army. And they are patient—they have nothing but time.

The palace is decorated with stone gargoyles, leathery-winged figures with curling horns perched on every cornice and balcony. Sailors who pass the cape point to these and laugh nervously: "See? Just ugly statues. Nothing to fear." The gargoyles are indeed just statues. The demons within are not.

Occasionally, something wanders too close to Demonwatch. A Naruaghin hunting party that strays too far south. A shipwrecked sailor swimming toward what looks like shelter. A curious adventurer who doesn't believe the stories. None return. The demons cannot leave, but they can certainly receive visitors.

##### The Demortik Bay Connection

The waters of Demortik Bay, the inlet surrounding Demonwatch's cape, have been spiritually poisoned by three centuries of demonic presence. Fish avoid the bay. Ships that anchor there report nightmares and crew who walk into the water and don't return. Whether the demons can project some influence beyond their physical prison, or whether the corruption has simply seeped into the environment, the effect is real enough that no sane captain enters Demortik Bay after dark.

### Kunagi Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A transitional range of scrub-covered ridges and rocky outcrops marking the boundary between Atriik's settled lands and the Dunes of Kunagi proper. The hills run roughly north-south along Atriik's eastern edge, providing a natural barrier against the desert's encroachment—and a last opportunity for water before the true sands begin.

#### Character

The Kunagi Hills are not mountains—the highest elevations barely reach a thousand feet above the surrounding terrain. But in a land where the alternative is flat desert, any high ground matters. The hills catch what little moisture escapes the Dunes of Kunagi's rain shadow, supporting thornscrub, drought-adapted trees, and seasonal streams that flow only after the rare rains.

The terrain is broken and difficult: gullies, ridgelines, scattered boulders, and the remains of ancient erosion patterns. Good defensive ground if you know it; death traps if you don't. The Atriik city-state of Shinii has built its economy on this knowledge.

#### Shinii's Territory

The hills fall under Shinii's nominal control, though "control" means something different here than in the settled lands. Shinii maintains watch posts on the major ridgelines, tracks the movement of desert caravans, and collects tolls from traders moving between the Dunes and the Atriik interior. The hills themselves are too dry for permanent settlement beyond a few hardy shepherding families.

#### The Desert Margin

The eastern slope of the Kunagi Hills marks the true desert's edge. The transition is gradual:
- **Upper slopes**: Thornscrub and seasonal grass
- **Lower slopes**: Sparse vegetation, bare rock, increasingly sandy soil
- **Desert margin**: The last reliable water, the last shade, the last chance to turn back
- **Beyond**: The Dunes of Kunagi, sand and death and giant wurms

Caravans pause at the hills' eastern foot to rest, resupply, and nerve themselves for the crossing. A few semi-permanent camps serve this trade—not settlements exactly, but places where water, fodder, and supplies can be purchased at steep markups.

#### Notable Features

**Sandskull**: At the hills' southern extent, where the ridges flatten into desert plain, stands the ruin of Sandskull—a skull-shaped rock formation housing ancient structures of unknown origin. See [Atriik](Atriik.md#sandskull) for details.

**The Shinii Watchtowers**: A chain of signal towers running along the hills' spine, allowing Shinii to track caravan movements and respond to desert threats. The towers are manned in rotation by Shinii militia.

**The Last Water**: A cluster of springs at the hills' eastern base, the final reliable water source before the desert crossing. Control of these springs gives Shinii leverage over the caravan trade.

**Blitzling Territory**: The northern Kunagi Hills merge into the Shyaliviin range (also called Malasi Karkus), where Blitzling creatures are known to dwell. Shinii's northern patrols avoid this area.

### Kura

Tags: state, nation

A state in Westrim, occupying the western margins of the Dunes of Kunagi and the southeastern foothills of the mountains that separate Westrim from Tarkhon. Kura lies south of the Righteous Peaks, north of Atriik, and west of the Wyrm Teeth hills. The Ley Line of Fire bisects the nation from north to south, and the entire character of Kura—its government, its magic, its survival—is shaped by this elemental presence.

#### The Ley Line of Fire

The great Ley Line of Fire runs north-south through the heart of Kura, a river of elemental power visible only to those with magical sight. Along this line, fire burns hotter and faster, fire magic comes more easily, and the desert sun beats down with merciless intensity.

The ley line explains much about Kura. The dual monarchy exists in part because controlling territory that straddles the line requires both fire attunement (to thrive near it) and water attunement (to survive away from it). The midnight fire academy at Tul Azreitnok was built where it is specifically to study the ley line's effects. And the glass trade that sustains Kura's economy relies on the intense, reliable heat the ley line provides.

Crossing the ley line unprotected during the day can cause severe burns. At night, when fire's power wanes, the crossing is safer—but the desert cold that replaces the heat can be equally deadly.

#### Bani Bari

The capital of Kura sits at the heart of the nation, carefully positioned to straddle the Ley Line of Fire. The city is divided into two halves—the Sunward District to the east of the ley line, where fire-attuned Yngli predominate, and the Shadeward District to the west, home to most of the water-attuned Nuun.

The Twin Throne sits at the exact center, a palace of fused glass and sandstone built directly over the ley line. Here the blue-eyed Nuun king and the golden-born Yngli ruler hold court together, their combined attunements moderating the intense magical energies beneath them. The palace architecture channels ley line heat into the city's famous glass foundries while the water crown ensures drinking water flows in the central fountain.

**Population**: ~45,000

The city is famous for its glass—windows, vessels, lenses, and art pieces of extraordinary clarity and color. The foundries run day and night, drawing on the ley line's power. Glass caravans depart weekly for the coastal ports and the dwarven cities to the northwest.

#### Shalif Mulak

A village of perhaps two thousand souls, located half a day's travel from Bani Bari on the western side of the ley line. Shalif Mulak serves as the agricultural heart of central Kura—its underground aquifers, maintained by Nuun water-shapers, support date palms, hardy grains, and goat herds that would otherwise be impossible in the deep desert.

The village is known for its hospitality to travelers. Anyone heading into the deep dunes stops here for supplies and the last reliable water before Benshu's Promise.

#### Labakh

The northernmost city in Kura, Labakh sits in the foothills where the dunes give way to the mountains of the Eronia Range. The city serves as Kura's primary trading partner with the dwarven city-states of the First Brotherhood—Üod, Blvnird, and Melaia.

**Population**: ~12,000

Labakh is cooler than the rest of Kura, benefiting from mountain breezes and altitude. The city's markets trade Kuran glass and information for dwarven metalwork, tools, and the preserved foods that travel well across the desert. The architecture here shows dwarven influence—stone foundations, deeper cellars, and structures built to last centuries rather than generations.

A significant dwarven minority lives in Labakh, merchants and craftspeople who find the climate tolerable and the trade profitable. They maintain their own quarter with proper stone buildings and a small shrine to the First Brotherhood.

#### Shad Usk

The largest and most treacherous dune formation in central Kura, Shad Usk rises nearly three hundred feet at its peak and stretches for miles in a crescent shape. The dune moves—slowly, but perceptibly over years—and has swallowed more than one unwary settlement that built too close to its base.

Shad Usk is considered sacred by some Kurans, who believe the dune is alive in some sense, or that something sleeps beneath it. The sand wurms that plague the Dunes of Kunagi avoid Shad Usk entirely, which some take as confirmation of this belief.

Local guides know the safe paths around Shad Usk, but crossing over it is considered both dangerous (the sand is unstable) and disrespectful.

#### Fata M'darah

A trading post and waystation on the eastern edge of Kura, where the dunes begin to give way to the rocky terrain approaching the Wyrm Teeth. Fata M'darah marks the traditional boundary between Kura's settled territory and the wilder lands beyond.

The waystation is built around a natural rock formation that provides shade and shelter. A small permanent population maintains the wells and guesthouses, but most of those present at any time are travelers—merchants heading east toward the Mirrored Palace, scholars bound for the Wyrm Teeth ruins, or the occasional fool seeking fortune in the deep desert.

The name means "the daughter's rest" in old Kuran, though who the daughter was and why she rested here is lost to time.

#### Tul Azreitnok

In the southern hills and dunes region of Kura stands Tul Azreitnok—a fortress and specialized academy dedicated to the study of midnight fire, a rare and dangerous form of dark flame magic. The academy trains mages in the manipulation of fire that burns with darkness rather than light, flames that consume without illuminating.

The academy was built where it is for two reasons: proximity to the Ley Line of Fire, which provides raw elemental power for experimentation, and distance from Bani Bari, because midnight fire experiments have a tendency to go catastrophically wrong.

Tul Azreitnok accepts students from across Alaria, though most come from fire-touched peoples—Neferati, Yngli, and the occasional dwarven runesmith. The curriculum is dangerous; roughly one in five students dies or is permanently maimed during their training. Graduates are among the most feared battle-mages in the world.

### Lise

Tags: city, settlement

The capital of Enapay and seat of the Dragonbound Queen. Lise sprawls where the Ishtar River delta meets the Green Wilds, a city built to accommodate both its Dwelyn inhabitants and their ancient dragon protector.

#### Character

Lise is not a city of stone walls and paved streets. It's a settlement woven into the jungle itself—platforms built into massive trees, rope bridges connecting neighborhoods, ground-level structures raised on stilts above the wet delta soil. The Dwelyn have not conquered their environment; they've negotiated with it.

The city has grown organically over centuries, expanding outward and upward as the population increased. There is no grid, no central planning. Instead, clan territories merge and overlap, connected by paths that make sense to those who know them and bewilder anyone else.

Above it all, visible from anywhere in the city, rises the Dragon's Roost—a colossal jungle tree whose crown has been shaped into Surrey Mahaila's lair. The emerald dragon's presence has always been Lise's defining feature. Now her absence—she rarely emerges from the Roost anymore—defines it equally.

#### Districts

**The Canopy**: The oldest and most prestigious neighborhood, built into the highest branches of the ancient trees surrounding the Dragon's Roost. Clan chiefs and their households live here, their platforms connected by bridges decorated with the beads of generations. Status is measured in elevation—the higher you live, the more influential you are.

**River Market**: Where the Ishtar meets the delta, Dwelyn traders gather to exchange goods with the occasional merchant brave enough to travel upriver. The market operates on platforms just above the waterline, and during flood season, traders conduct business from boats. This is the only part of Lise that regularly sees outsiders.

**The Stilts**: Ground-level Lise, where common Dwelyn live in raised houses connected by boardwalks. The area floods regularly, and residents have adapted—everything of value stays above high-water mark. Warriors train here, children play in the shallows, and the business of daily life continues despite the mud.

**The Warrior's Rest**: A semi-permanent encampment on Lise's eastern edge, where warriors gather before departing for the front. Not technically part of the city, but always present. The camp grows and shrinks with the war's intensity.

#### The Dragon's Roost

Surrey Mahaila's lair dominates Lise's skyline. The tree that houses it—locals call it simply "the Roost"—is over three hundred feet tall, with a trunk wide enough to hold chambers carved into its living wood. The dragon herself nests in the crown, in a platform of woven branches large enough to hold her serpentine bulk.

In healthier times, Surrey Mahaila would descend regularly—to consult with the queen, to accept offerings, to remind Lise's residents of her protection. Now she stays in the crown, too weak or too sick to make the journey down. Smoke from medicinal fires rises constantly from the Roost as Dwelyn shamans attempt treatments that have so far failed.

The tree itself seems to be affected. Its leaves are yellowing on the side nearest the dragon. Some say the Faesong poisoning is spreading through the wood itself.

#### Governance

Queen Teyara Greenmantle rules from the Canopy, in a great hall built across three connected platforms. She holds court daily, mediating disputes between clans and directing the war effort. But her authority feels fragile—everyone knows it depends on the dragon bond, and the dragon is dying.

Clan chiefs increasingly make decisions without royal consultation. The queen's summons go unanswered. Some warriors openly wear more beads than their loyalty to the crown would traditionally allow. Lise is a city waiting to see what happens next.

#### Economy

Lise's markets trade in jungle products: feathers from birds found nowhere else, medicines distilled from rare plants, ironwood harvested from the Ishnit, and Dwelyn craftsmanship. The city exports more than it imports—the Dwelyn need little from the outside world and prefer it that way.

Trade happens slowly. The Ishtar River is the only reliable route in or out, and the journey is long and dangerous. Merchants who make the trip can name their prices for goods heading in either direction.

#### The Sickness in the Air

Visitors to Lise often report feeling... wrong. It's subtle—a sense of dissonance, of things being slightly off-key. Those sensitive to magical currents (druids, fae, bards) describe it as hearing a beautiful song with one persistent wrong note.

This is the poisoned Faesong that afflicts Surrey Mahaila. Whatever corrupted it affects the entire region, but Lise feels it most strongly—perhaps because the dragon concentrated Faesong here over centuries, and now that concentration has become a concentration of poison.

Some residents have begun experiencing symptoms: troubled sleep, inexplicable sadness, creative blocks for artisans. Nothing deadly, but the city's spirit has dimmed along with its dragon's.

#### Getting There

**By River**: The Ishtar flows from the jungle interior to the Gulf of Norag. Most traders approach from upstream, following established routes from other Westrim settlements. The journey downstream from Lise leads to Naruaghin territory and the cursed coast—not recommended.

**By Land**: Jungle trails connect Lise to other Dwelyn settlements in the Green Wilds. These paths are maintained and relatively safe, but outsiders require guides. The trails leading east, toward Naruaghin territory, are watched by both sides and should be avoided.

**By Air**: Surrey Mahaila once welcomed visitors who arrived by flying mount or spell. Now she responds to aerial approach with territorial aggression—the sickness has made her paranoid. Approach by air at your own risk.

### Lupuno

Tags: city, state

A Kor city-state in northwestern Atriik, built where the Sha Puniki emerges from the Milras Forest. Lupuno controls the timber trade and river commerce for the region.

See [Atriik](Atriik.md#lupuno) for full details.

### Melaia

### Milras Forest

Tags: forest, geography

A dense old-growth forest in southwestern Westrim, forming the northern boundary of Atriik. The Milras stretches from the Wyrm Teeth hills in the northeast toward Shark Bay in the west, separating the Atriik city-states from Kura and the northern desert margins.

The forest is ancient and deep—not as supernaturally disorienting as its distant cousin Milrar in the Westwilds, but old enough to discourage casual exploration. The Sha Puniki river flows from its eastern edge past Lupuno, and the timber trade from the forest's margins supports much of northwestern Atriik's economy.

#### Character

Milras is cooler and wetter than the savanna to the south, catching moisture from Shark Bay's sea breezes before it can reach the Kunagi. The canopy is thick but not impenetrable; game trails and old roads wind through the understory. Unlike Milrar, time flows normally here—the forest is merely old, not cursed.

The Kor of Lupuno maintain careful logging operations along the forest's southern edge, never cutting deeper than a day's walk from the treeline. The interior remains wild, home to megafauna that have vanished from the more settled lands: dire wolves, great cats, and the occasional rumors of something larger.

#### Milreun Palace

In the forest's northeastern depths, where the trees grow thickest and the Wyrm Teeth begin their rise, stands Milreun Palace—a structure that should not exist this far from the Westwilds, yet does.

The palace appears to be a fragment or echo of its namesake in the Milrar Forest of Clueanda. The architecture is identical: doorways twenty feet tall, staircases at inhuman angles, proportions wrong in ways that unsettle without being overtly threatening. Some scholars theorize the two palaces are connected across the continents; others believe they were built by the same unknown civilization during an age when geography was more... fluid.

Unlike its Westwilds counterpart, this Milreun shows no time distortion effects. Explorers enter and exit normally, reporting nothing stranger than architecture that makes them uncomfortable and the persistent sense of being watched. The palace has been picked over by generations of treasure hunters, but its deepest chambers remain uncharted—the stairs simply descend farther than anyone has been willing to follow.

#### Notable Features

**The Puniki Headwaters**: The Sha Puniki rises from springs at the forest's eastern edge, collecting smaller streams before emerging near Lupuno. The headwater region is sacred to Atriik's druidic tradition.

**The Timber Road**: A maintained track running from Lupuno into the forest's edge, used by logging operations. The road extends perhaps ten miles before becoming an unmaintained game trail.

**The Wyrm Teeth Border**: The northeastern forest gives way to rocky, thorn-scrub hills—the beginning of the Wyrm Teeth range. Urk Noulgas, the ruined wyrm-keeper fortress, stands visible on the hills above the treeline.

### Mirrored Palace

Tags: poi, ruins

A giant, scorching hot labrynth of mirrors, full of your clones who attack you. Guarded by Julrus the Fierce. At the center of the palace is the entrance to an even larger dungeon, which was built around... heart of gaea? Piece of heart of gaea? Titan slaying weapon? Largest soul vessel ever built? Fountain of youth?

Your double is created when you enter. Your double is single-mindedly focused on killing you. Your double knows your true name.

### Mueras Highlands

Tags: hills, geography

The elevated northwestern interior of Mueras, a region of rocky, wind-scoured hills separating the Hammer Coast from the approaches to Labyrinth Sound. The Highlands are the forgotten corner of Mueras—too poor to interest the merchant-kings, too harsh to support large populations, but stubbornly inhabited by those who value freedom over comfort.

The terrain rises from the coastal settlements to perhaps a thousand feet above sea level, then rolls in broken waves of rock and thin soil toward the Dustwind Plateau. Sparse vegetation clings to sheltered valleys; the exposed ridges are bare stone, polished by wind and time. Rain falls here more often than on the plateau below, but the rocky ground sheds water quickly, leaving little for human use.

#### The Commons

The Highlands are sometimes called "the commons"—the one part of Mueras no merchant-king has bothered to claim. The soil won't support farming, the harbors don't exist, and the mineral deposits are too scattered to monopolize profitably. What remains is grazing land for those hardy enough to work it and mines for those desperate enough to dig.

The commons folk owe allegiance to no house. They pay no harbor fees, swear no pilot oaths, and answer to no council. This makes them poor by coastal standards—they have no access to the trade networks that create Mueran wealth—but free in ways the city-dwellers aren't. A commons herder owns his flock, his time, and his choices.

#### Yngli Herders

The primary inhabitants of the Highlands are Yngli herding communities, tending small flocks of the hardy goats that can survive on scrub vegetation and rocky terrain. The Yngli presence here predates human settlement—these hills were among the first places the silent folk fled when they left the coastal cities generations ago.

The Highland Yngli maintain a semi-nomadic existence, moving their flocks between seasonal grazing areas. They've developed breeds of goat specifically suited to the terrain: small, agile animals that can climb near-vertical rock faces and survive on vegetation other livestock would reject. The wool and milk sustain the herders; surplus is traded at the plateau's edge.

Communication between Yngli communities relies on visual signals—patterns of colored cloth hung from prominent rocks, smoke signals, and the elaborate sign language all Yngli share. A message can cross the Highlands in hours, passing from community to community faster than any rider.

#### Mining Operations

Scattered through the Highlands are small mining operations extracting iron and copper from shallow deposits. The ore quality is mediocre, the working conditions harsh, and the profits thin—but the mines provide employment for humans who have no other options and metal for communities that can't afford imported goods.

Most mines are independent operations, family-owned and family-worked. A few larger operations have backing from minor merchant families hoping to establish a foothold outside the major houses' control. These backed mines produce slightly more efficiently but answer to distant masters who care only about output.

The relationship between miners and Yngli herders is complex. They share the Highlands, compete for water in dry seasons, and occasionally clash over grazing rights near mine tailings. But they also trade—Yngli wool and goat products for metal tools and hardware—and a rough mutual respect has developed over generations.

#### Highland Mercenaries

When the merchant-kings need expendable muscle, they recruit from the Highlands. Commons folk know the terrain, can survive on minimal supplies, and have few qualms about violence—life in the Highlands doesn't encourage gentleness. The pay for mercenary work is good by Highland standards; the survival rate is not.

Highland mercenaries serve as caravan raiders, scouts, irregular soldiers, and occasionally assassins. They're deployed against rival houses' interests, never against the recruiting house's own operations—a mercenary who attacks his employer's caravans won't find future work. The arrangement is understood by all parties, and a kind of professionalism has developed around it.

Veterans who survive their mercenary years sometimes return to the Highlands with enough coin to establish their own herds or mines. Others develop a taste for violence and coin that the Highlands can't satisfy. These become permanent mercenaries, hiring out to whoever pays, eventually dying in some distant conflict. Few grow old in this profession.

#### The Cave Networks

The Highlands are honeycombed with caves—some natural, carved by water through limestone; others artificial, remnants of old mining operations or deliberate excavation. Local legend claims the caves connect, forming a network that spans the entire Highland region and extends down to the coast.

The legends may have truth. Yngli communities use certain cave systems for shelter during storms, for storage, and for purposes they don't discuss with outsiders. Human explorers who've mapped portions of the network report extensive passages, some clearly worked by intelligent hands, leading in directions that would eventually reach Labyrinth Sound—or beneath it.

What lives in the deeper caves is unclear. The Yngli won't discuss it. Human miners who dig too deep sometimes break into existing passages and report strange sounds, odd air currents, and occasionally glimpses of movement in the darkness. Most seal these breaches immediately. The few who don't tend to have accidents shortly afterward.

#### Relations with the Coast

The Highlands exist in a strange relationship with coastal Mueras—ignored by the merchant-kings, yet essential to their operations. Highland timber (what little exists) supplements Taflex supplies. Highland ore provides metal for tools and ships. Highland mercenaries fight their proxy wars. Highland goat products feed workers too poor for better.

This relationship is entirely on coastal terms. The merchant-kings take what they need, pay as little as possible, and offer nothing in return except the negative: they don't claim the Highlands, don't tax the herders, don't regulate the mines. For the commons folk, this is enough. They've seen what merchant-king attention does to a place, and they prefer neglect.

The arrangement is stable but not permanent. As the Taflex timber grows scarcer and shadow-trade becomes more profitable, some houses are looking at the Highlands with new interest. Rich mineral deposits may lie deeper than current operations reach. The cave networks might offer alternative routes bypassing pilot-guild control. The commons' independence may be a luxury the merchant-kings eventually decide they can't afford.

### Mueras

Tags: state, nation, coastal

The westernmost state of Rimihuica, Mueras occupies a stretch of brutally fragmented coastline where the land seems to have shattered against the sea. Cliff-walled islands, treacherous channels, and hidden harbors define this region—geography that created the merchant-king oligarchy as surely as any political theory. Those who know the waters control the trade. Those who control the trade rule Mueras.

The coast runs roughly 400 miles north to south, from the Mueras Highlands and Hammer Coast in the north to the Beak of Mueras peninsula in the south. Inland, the arid Dustwind Plateau separates the wealthy coastal cities from the darker eastern reaches—the Taflex Forest, Grimreach, and the shadow-haunted Darkened Coast. The Agreben Sea lies to the south and west; North Agreben island marks the southern extent of Mueran influence.

What outsiders remember about Mueras: the cities carved into living cliff-face, the notorious difficulty of navigation, the wealth that flows through despite everything, and the persistent wrongness that clings to certain stretches of coast. King Kasper's death-curse, when the old tyrant fell, didn't merely haunt Kaspion—it cracked something in the region's relationship with death itself.

#### Labyrinth Sound

The defining feature of western Mueras: a maze of channels threading between cliff-walled islands, sea stacks, and submerged rock formations. Approximately sixty miles of coastline compressed into perhaps two hundred miles of navigable (barely) waterway. Strong tidal currents reverse twice daily, fog rolls in without warning, and the acoustic properties of the cliff walls make it impossible to judge distance by sound.

No captain unfamiliar with these waters attempts Labyrinth Sound without a licensed pilot. The pilot guilds are controlled by the merchant-kings—each house maintains pilots for their section of the Sound, and passage fees fund the oligarchy. Killing a rival's pilots is often more effective than killing the rival himself.

The major passages, from north to south:
- **Hammer Passage**: Northern entry, controlled by House Hammren from the twin fortress-ports
- **Kelwin Throat**: Central narrows, notoriously difficult, controlled from Kelwin
- **Hennipin Gate**: Southern passage into Corpse Bay, controlled from Hennipin

##### Cliff Beach

A rare stretch of accessible shoreline along the western edge of Labyrinth Sound—one of the few places small boats can land without a harbor. Used by smugglers, fishermen too poor for harbor fees, and occasionally by those fleeing merchant-king justice. The cliffs above are honeycombed with caves, some natural, some carved. Local legend claims the caves connect to older passages beneath the Mueras Highlands.

#### Corpse Bay

South of Labyrinth Sound, Corpse Bay earned its name honestly. The currents of the region converge here, depositing whatever the sea claims—shipwreck debris, drowned sailors, and things less identifiable. Bodies wash up on the black sand beaches with disturbing regularity. Locals won't fish the bay proper, though the surrounding waters remain productive.

The bay's morbid nature predates King Kasper's curse, but has intensified since. Some scholars theorize the curse found purchase here because death already had a foothold. Others note that Kasper chose to build his capital overlooking these waters, and wonder if the causality runs the other direction.

The major ports of Corpse Bay maintain crematoriums that burn constantly, disposing of whatever washes ashore before it can rise again. This is presented as civic duty and public health. The actual frequency of the rising dead is not discussed in polite company.

#### Walker Depths

The deep waters west of Labyrinth Sound, between Mueras and the Starfish Isles. Named for the "walkers"—drowned dead that sometimes walk the seabed rather than floating. On clear days, sailors in shallow-drafted vessels occasionally glimpse them through the water: humanoid figures trudging slowly across the sandy bottom, going somewhere.

No one knows where they're going. No one wants to find out. Ships avoid anchoring in Walker Depths; the walkers have been known to climb anchor chains.

#### The Hammer Coast

The northern shore of Mueras, running from Cursius in the northwest to the Tarns in the northeast. Named for the twin fortress-ports of North Hammer Point and South Hammer Point, which control the sea approaches from the north. This is the most defensible and least cursed section of Mueras—the Hammer family has maintained it for six generations.

##### North Hammer Point & South Hammer Point

Twin fortresses on opposing headlands, their ballistae and fire-catapults creating a kill zone across the northern sea approach. House Hammren controls both, making them the only merchant-king family with a true chokepoint monopoly rather than mere pilot-guild control. The Hammrens are the closest thing Mueras has to old nobility—they predate the merchant-king system, having held these fortresses since before Kasper's rise.

The fortresses themselves are carved into the cliffsides in the characteristic Mueran style, with harbor facilities at water level and living quarters ascending through the rock. Each fortress maintains a permanent garrison of two hundred, plus the pilot-guild personnel who guide ships through the northern approaches.

##### Fulon

A fishing town of perhaps three thousand souls, nestled in a protected cove between the Hammer Points. Exists primarily to supply the fortresses with fresh food and to house the families of garrison soldiers. Notable for its complete lack of merchant-king politics—House Hammren rules here with something approaching benevolence, and the townsfolk are loyal in return.

##### Cursius

The northwestern corner of Mueras, where the coast turns south toward Labyrinth Sound. A small port town, less important than it once was. Cursius was a significant trading post before Kasper centralized power at Kaspion; now it serves mainly as a waypoint for ships avoiding the Sound entirely by sailing around the north.

#### The Tarns

A region of highland lakes and pools in northeastern Mueras, fed by rainfall from the Mueras Highlands and streams descending from the Dustwind Plateau. The tarns provide the primary freshwater source for the northern settlements—a fact that has made them contested territory throughout Mueran history.

Currently, the tarns fall under the loose protection of House Hammren, though several smaller merchant families maintain estates here. The freshwater fisheries and the waterfowl hunting draw wealthy Muerans seeking respite from the salt air and political intrigue of the coast.

#### Mueras Highlands

The elevated northwestern interior, separating the Hammer Coast from the approaches to Labyrinth Sound. Rocky, wind-scoured hills with thin soil and sparse vegetation. Yngli herding communities maintain small flocks of the hardy goats that can survive here, and a few mining operations extract iron and copper from shallow deposits.

The Highlands are sometimes called "the commons"—the one part of Mueras no merchant-king has bothered to claim. The herders and miners who live here owe allegiance to no house, pay no harbor fees, and are correspondingly poor. When the merchant-kings need expendable soldiers or raiders to harass rivals' overland caravans, they recruit from the Highlands.

#### Dustwind Plateau

The arid interior of Mueras, a high tableland swept by constant winds that carry fine dust from the plateau's surface. The plateau separates the wealthy coast from the eastern reaches, serving as a buffer zone where few settlements survive. Caravans cross it to avoid the sea route around the Beak, but the journey is harsh—water sources are scarce, and the dust storms can strip flesh from bone.

The plateau's name comes from the wind, which rarely ceases. Locals claim the dust carries whispers from the dead of Kaspion, though scholars attribute the sounds to wind through rock formations. The two explanations are not mutually exclusive.

#### The Haunted Zone

The stretch of coast from Kaspion south to Port Perith, where King Kasper's death-curse fell heaviest. This region is not abandoned—commerce demands too much—but it is approached with caution, and no one lingers longer than necessary.

##### Kaspion

The old capital of Mueras, built on a dramatic headland overlooking Corpse Bay. King Kasper ruled from here for thirty-two years, centralizing power, eliminating rival merchant families, and executing anyone he deemed treasonous at Cliffdrop. His tyranny ended when a coalition of surviving merchant houses funded a rebellion—but Kasper had prepared for this possibility.

When the rebels breached his palace, Kasper triggered a death-curse of extraordinary power. Every living person in Kaspion—rebel, loyalist, servant, child—died in an instant. Estimates suggest twelve thousand souls. The curse bound them to the city, and they remain.

Kaspion is not empty. The dead walk its streets, reenact fragments of their final day, and occasionally interact with the living in unpredictable ways. Some scavengers and treasure-hunters brave the ruins; a few necromancers have established operations here, treating the ghost-city as a resource. The merchant-kings officially prohibit entry, but enforcement is minimal. Anyone foolish enough to enter Kaspion has already accepted the consequences.

##### Cliffdrop

The execution cliffs adjacent to Kaspion, where Kasper's "traitors" were thrown to their deaths. The cliffs are honeycombed with the broken bodies of victims—bones wedged in crevices, skulls grinning from alcoves. The ghosts here are angrier than those in Kaspion proper, their deaths more violent and more conscious.

Paradoxically, Cliffdrop has become a pilgrimage site. Death-cults send adherents to commune with the concentrated spiritual energy. Grieving families come to speak with ancestors (any ancestors—the ghosts are not picky about who they answer). Necromancers treat it as a training ground. The merchant-kings maintain a small guard post at the cliff-top, officially to prevent entry, actually to collect informal fees from pilgrims.

##### Port Perith

The last "normal" port before the haunted zone—normal being relative in Mueras. Port Perith exists because someone has to service the ships that trade with the cursed coast, and the sailors who work those routes need somewhere to drink that isn't actively haunted.

The town is tense, well-armed, and superstitious. Every building has iron fixtures at the doors and windows. Salt lines are refreshed daily. The local temple to the death-gods does excellent business. Port Perith's residents are not friendly to outsiders, but they're professional—if you have coin, they'll trade.

#### Bazz

The de facto capital of modern Mueras, built on a series of cliff-carved terraces overlooking the junction of Labyrinth Sound and Corpse Bay. Where Kaspion concentrated power in a single ruler, Bazz concentrates it in the Council—the assembly of merchant-kings who theoretically govern collectively.

The city holds perhaps forty thousand people, making it the largest settlement in Mueras by a significant margin. The waterfront terraces house the trading companies, warehouses, and pilot-guild headquarters. The middle terraces contain markets, craftsmen, and the homes of successful merchants. The upper terraces—carved deepest into the cliff—hold the estates of the merchant-king families and the Council chambers.

Bazz's architecture is vertical rather than horizontal. Streets are often stairs. Goods move by crane and pulley as often as by cart. The wealthy live highest, where sea-spray doesn't reach and the view encompasses the entire Sound. The poor cluster at water level, where flooding is regular and the damp never quite leaves the walls.

##### The Council Chambers

Carved into the highest point of Bazz's cliff-face, the Council Chambers are both meeting hall and fortress. Each of the seven major merchant-king families maintains a suite of rooms here, and the central chamber—a natural cavern expanded by generations of stonework—hosts the formal Council sessions.

Assassination within the Chambers is forbidden by ancient compact, enforced by mutually assured destruction: each family has deposited secrets and evidence that would destroy the others, to be released upon their own demise. This creates a peculiar peace. Merchant-kings who would happily poison each other in the city below sit across the Council table and negotiate like civilized beings.

#### Kelwin

Controls the central passage through Labyrinth Sound—the Kelwin Throat, the most technically demanding stretch of navigation in the region. House Vethros has held Kelwin for four generations, and their pilots are considered the finest in Mueras. Ships that can afford the premium pay Vethros rates; ships that can't take their chances with the cheaper (and riskier) northern or southern routes.

Kelwin itself is smaller than Bazz but wealthier per capita. The city is built into a narrow canyon where the Sound pinches tight, with structures climbing both walls. Bridges span the gap at multiple levels, creating a three-dimensional urban space that visitors find disorienting.

#### Hennipin

Controls the southern passage into Corpse Bay—the Hennipin Gate. House Marsova rules here, eternal rivals to House Vethros of Kelwin. The two families have competed for primacy for generations, their conflict playing out in price wars, pilot-guild disputes, and occasional outright sabotage.

Hennipin is built on a broader shelf than Kelwin, allowing for more conventional horizontal expansion. The city sprawls along the cliffside, with the characteristic Mueran carved-stone architecture but more breathing room between structures. House Marsova maintains extensive warehousing here, undercutting Bazz's storage monopoly by offering competitive rates to ships that pass through the Gate.

#### The Beak of Mueras

The southern peninsula, curving southwest toward North Agreben island. The Beak is the poorest region of Mueras—fishing villages, small-scale farming on the rare patches of arable soil, and ferry services to the southern islands. No merchant-king family has claimed the Beak; the margins are too thin to support their lifestyle.

##### Port Echo

The largest settlement on the Beak, named for the acoustic phenomenon in its harbor. The surrounding cliffs create a natural amphitheater that amplifies and echoes sounds from the water—a whispered conversation in a boat can sometimes be heard clearly on the docks. This makes Port Echo useless for clandestine meetings but excellent for public announcements.

Port Echo serves as the primary embarkation point for North Agreben and the Greenwater Isles beyond. Ferries run regularly, weather permitting, and the town has developed a modest shipbuilding industry using timber floated down from the Taflex Forest.

##### Watchkeep Isles

A small archipelago off the western coast of the Beak, comprising three inhabited islands and numerous rocks and shoals. The islands—home to Indus, Freed, and Giorga—were historically watchtowers guarding the southern approaches to Labyrinth Sound. The old stone keeps still stand, though they now serve as administrative centers rather than military posts.

**Indus**: The largest of the Watchkeep Isles, home to perhaps two thousand people. The old watchtower has been converted into a lighthouse, and Indus serves as the pilot station for ships approaching from the south. House Marsova of Hennipin technically claims authority here, but exercises it lightly.

**Freed**: Named for the freed slaves who settled here after Kasper's fall—Kasper had maintained slave galleys, and the rebellion liberated their crews. The descendants maintain a fierce independence and a deep hatred of anything resembling centralized authority. They fish, they trade, they emphatically do not pay taxes to any merchant-king.

**Giorga**: The smallest inhabited island, little more than a fishing village clustered around a natural harbor. Notable mainly for its shrine to the sea-gods, which draws occasional pilgrims.

##### Blof Point

The southernmost settlement in Mueras, a windswept village on the tip of the Beak. Ferry services to North Agreben depart from here when weather permits. The village exists in a state of perpetual salt-spray dampness; nothing stays dry, nothing stays rust-free, and the locals have developed a resigned acceptance of entropy.

#### Grimreach

The eastern frontier of Mueras, where the Taflex Forest gives way to the rocky, fog-shrouded coastline above the Darkened Coast. Grimreach is contested territory—nominally part of Mueras, but the merchant-kings' authority fades rapidly this far from the Sound. The settlements here deal with shadow-touched trade goods, monster parts, and dark magic components that the respectable ports won't handle openly.

##### Yorx

A frontier town at the edge of the Taflex Forest, serving as the gateway to Grimreach proper. Hunters, trappers, and monster-hunters use Yorx as a base of operations. The town maintains no permanent allegiance to any merchant-king, instead paying protection money to whichever house currently has forces in the area.

##### Saron

Deeper into Grimreach, Saron is the last settlement before the Darkened Coast. The town exists to process and trade the strange materials that come out of the shadow-touched regions: void-eel oil, shadow-ray leather, and darker things. Saron's merchants ask no questions about provenance and expect none about destination.

#### The Darkened Coast

East of the Taflex Forest and south of Grimreach, along the northwest coast of the Agreben Sea, lies the Darkened Coast—a stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow. The effect is not meteorological; clouds and fog play no part. The light simply fails to reach full strength here, as if something is drinking it.

The waters teem with dark-attuned sea creatures: shadow rays that glide beneath the waves, void eels that drain light from their surroundings, and worse things that rise from the lightless depths during moonless nights. Sailors avoid this coast when possible, as ships that venture too close risk being pulled under by creatures that exist more in shadow than flesh.

The Darkened Coast's nature predates King Kasper's curse, but scholars note the shadow has deepened since. Whether the curse awakened something already present, or whether the concentrated death-energy fed it, remains debated.

#### Brunas Inlet

An eastern inlet providing the main harbor access to Grimreach and the Darkened Coast trade. Ships that deal in shadow-touched goods anchor here rather than risking the Darkened Coast directly. A small trading post has grown up at the inlet's head—not quite a town, more a permanent camp of temporary residents who don't stay long enough to attract the attention of whatever lives in the deeper shadow.

#### Sal'emri Bay

The northeastern bay where the coast curves toward the Tarns, fed by seasonal rivers descending from the highlands. A cluster of settlements with distinctly different character from the rest of Mueras lines these waterways. The names here—Al Khamilah, Al Muqlib, Sha'ra, Am Batr, Al Harajah, Sirm al Banna—speak to Tarkhon influence, and indeed these are trading enclaves established by Tarkhon merchants generations ago.

The Sal'emri settlements maintain careful neutrality in merchant-king politics. They pay nominal fees to House Hammren for protection but answer to no Mueran authority. Their value lies in being outside the system—when merchant-kings need neutral ground for negotiation, when goods need to change hands without pilot-guild fees, when information needs to pass without observation, Sal'emri Bay provides.

The rivers feeding Sal'emri Bay are seasonal—torrents in the wet season, trickles in the dry. But even at their lowest, they provide irrigation for the date palms and grain fields that make these settlements self-sufficient in ways the coast cannot manage.

##### Al Khamilah

The largest of the Sal'emri settlements, a proper town of perhaps five thousand. Al Khamilah maintains a Tarkhon-style covered market, mosque-like temples to Tarkhon's fire-gods, and architecture that would not look out of place in Nektuna. The town serves as the informal capital of the Tarkhon enclave zone, positioned where the largest river meets the bay.

##### Sha'ra

A port town specializing in overland caravan trade—the route across the Dustwind Plateau to the Taflex Forest and beyond passes through here. Sha'ra maintains caravanserais, stables, and the guides necessary to survive the plateau crossing. The harbor serves coastal trade, but the real money flows through the caravan yards.

##### Am Batr

A smaller port town on the bay's northern shore, Am Batr handles the fishing trade and serves as a waypoint for coastal traffic moving between the Tarns and the main Mueran ports. The town maintains a small shipyard that repairs rather than builds—good enough for fishing boats and coastal traders.

##### Al Muqlib

Upriver from Al Khamilah, Al Muqlib sits where the river narrows enough to bridge. The town controls the only reliable crossing point for miles, collecting tolls from caravans that might otherwise bypass the coastal settlements entirely. A small but prosperous place, fiercely independent.

##### Al Harajah

The furthest upriver of the Sal'emri settlements, Al Harajah clings to the river's edge where the foothills begin to rise. The town serves as the last supply point before the highland crossing toward Kura. Merchants bringing Kuran glass to the coast stop here; those carrying coastal goods toward the desert interior depart from here.

##### Sirm al Banna

A village on a tributary stream, Sirm al Banna is known for its date palms—the finest in the Sal'emri region. The village processes and exports preserved dates, date wine, and date syrup throughout the settlements. Small, wealthy, and deeply uninterested in politics beyond its orchards.

#### Taflex Forest

The great forest of eastern Mueras, running from the Dustwind Plateau down to the approaches of Grimreach. The Taflex provides the timber that builds Mueran ships—a crucial resource in a nation that lives by maritime trade. Logging operations, mostly controlled by House Vethros of Kelwin, maintain camps throughout the accessible portions of the forest.

The deeper Taflex is Yngli territory. Silent communities of the one-eyed folk live here, descended from those who fled exploitation in the coastal cities. They maintain their own governance, communicate through an elaborate sign language, and trade forest products for goods they cannot make themselves. The logging companies have learned not to push too deep; the Yngli don't need to speak to make their displeasure clear.

##### Eddiwood

A lumber town at the forest's western edge, where the Taflex meets the plateau. Logs are processed here, then either floated down seasonal streams toward Port Echo or hauled overland to Bazz. The town is rough, practical, and absolutely uninterested in merchant-king politics—they sell to whoever pays.

##### Hickton

Deeper in the forest, Hickton serves the hunting and trapping trade. Furs, hides, and forest products flow through here. The town maintains better relations with the Yngli communities than most Mueran settlements, partly through necessity—Hickton cannot survive without forest access, and the Yngli control that access.

##### Sherly & Lieler

Small settlements deeper still, barely more than camps. These serve as waypoints for those trading with the Yngli communities or venturing toward Grimreach. Not places to linger.

### North Naruaghin Tribes

Tags: state, nation

The North Naruaghin occupy the jungle territories surrounding Ekomorn, the great rift that plunges to the center of the material plane. Living in proximity to this abyss has shaped them into the most spiritually focused—and most paranoid—of the three Naruaghin tribal confederations.

#### Territory

The northern tribes claim the jungle from Ekomorn's edge to the foothills where the Ishnit Jungles meet the Dunes of Kunagi. Their territory is smaller than their southern or eastern kin, but they defend it with desperate ferocity. The rift itself marks their sacred boundary—no North Naruaghin will willingly cross to its far side.

#### Culture

Where other Naruaghin tribes venerate their draconic heritage through warfare and conquest, the North Naruaghin have turned inward. They are ancestor-worshippers who believe the spirits of the dead stand between the living and what lurks in Ekomorn's depths.

**Shadow Vigils**: Warriors take rotating watches at the rift's edge, monitoring for emergence events. When shadows rise from the cracks—and they do, unpredictably—drums sound through the jungle to warn neighboring villages.

**Bone Temples**: North Naruaghin temples are built from the bones of their honored dead, arranged in intricate patterns believed to ward against the dark. These structures serve as both religious sites and defensive positions.

**The Marked**: Those who survive an encounter with something from Ekomorn are tattooed with black spirals and separated from their tribe. They become seers, consulted for warnings but never trusted. The North Naruaghin believe proximity to the rift's darkness leaves a stain that cannot be washed away.

#### Dragon Relations

Pythalomos, the constrictor dragon, terrorizes the North Naruaghin more than any other tribe. The dragon's territory overlaps significantly with their lands, and it treats their villages as hunting grounds. The North Naruaghin don't fight Pythalomos—they hide, scatter, and rebuild. They hate the dragon with cold, patient loathing, and their bone temples include effigies of the serpent that they ritually desecrate.

#### Relations with Other Tribes

The North Naruaghin are the most isolationist of their people. They rarely participate in the intertribal wars that occupy the South and East, preferring to husband their strength against the greater threat from below. Other Naruaghin consider them cowards. The North Naruaghin consider everyone else fools who don't understand what's coming.

#### Notable Locations

**Ekomorn's Edge**: The sacred/forbidden boundary. Warriors patrol here but never descend.

**Keth-Voram**: The largest North Naruaghin settlement, built into a system of caves three miles from the rift. The caves can be sealed with massive stone doors when shadows rise.

**The Watcher's Spine**: A ridgeline overlooking both the rift and Pythalomos's favorite hunting grounds. The tribe maintains permanent lookouts here.

### Sandskull

Tags: poi, ruin

A ruined fortress or temple at the southern extent of the Kunagi Hills, where the ridges flatten into the desert plain. The distinctive skull-shaped rock formation that gives it its name is visible for miles across the flat terrain.

Sandskull predates Atriik's founding by unknown centuries. The architecture shares some features with Urk Noulgas in the Wyrm Teeth—suggesting a connection to the ancient wyrm-keepers who once controlled the giant sand wurms of the Kunagi. However, no direct link has been established, and the ruins' true purpose remains unknown.

#### The Skull

The rock formation is natural—or mostly natural. Erosion has carved eye sockets, nasal cavity, and a gaping jaw into the sandstone bluff. But the symmetry is too perfect, the features too defined. Most scholars believe the original shape was natural, then enhanced by ancient hands for reasons lost to time.

The skull faces east, into the rising sun and the desert beyond. At dawn, light streams through the eye sockets in a way that seems designed rather than accidental.

#### The Ruins

Built into and around the skull formation, the ruins include:
- **The Cranium Chambers**: Rooms carved into the skull's interior, accessible through the eye sockets and a concealed entrance in the jaw
- **The Processional Way**: A sand-choked avenue leading from the skull toward the desert, lined with broken pillars
- **The Ossuary Cellars**: Underground chambers beneath the main structure, partially flooded with sand, containing what may be burial niches

Treasure hunters have explored Sandskull repeatedly over the centuries. Surface valuables were stripped long ago. The deeper chambers remain largely unexplored—those who venture too far into the Ossuary Cellars tend not to return, or return changed in ways they refuse to discuss.

#### Current State

Sandskull is too remote for permanent occupation but too interesting to ignore. Atriik considers it technically within Shinii's territory, but no one bothers to enforce that claim. Expeditions mount from Shinii every few years; traders passing through the Kunagi Hills sometimes camp in the skull's shade, though most prefer to keep their distance.

Something watches from the deeper chambers. The treasure hunters who return know this. They don't go back.

### Shark Bay

Tags: water, geography

A broad, shallow bay on Westrim's southwestern coast, providing Atriik's only maritime access. The bay takes its name from the shark populations that patrol its waters—a hazard for swimmers and small boats, but manageable for proper vessels.

#### Character

Shark Bay is protected water, sheltered from the open ocean's worst weather by headlands and offshore islands. The depth is modest—large ships must anchor in the outer bay and transfer cargo to shallow-draft vessels for the final approach to shore. This has shaped the bay's economy: local pilots who know the channels are essential, and the Kendor sea-folk of Watalina have built their influence on that expertise.

The water is warm, clear, and productive. Fishing villages dot the eastern shore where Sprenwood meets the coast. Shark Bay's catches supply protein to Atriik's interior settlements, traded upriver in exchange for forest products and goods from the desert caravans.

#### Watalina

The Kendor settlement of Watalina occupies a cluster of partially-submerged structures and floating platforms in the bay's southern reaches. The Kendor are a sea-dwelling people—not fully aquatic, but more comfortable in water than on land. Watalina serves as their trading interface with the land-based nations of Atriik.

Watalina controls:
- **Pilotage**: No ship enters or leaves the bay without a Kendor pilot, by longstanding agreement
- **Shipbuilding**: The best boats in Atriik are Kendor-made, built from Sprenwood timber to Kendor designs
- **Offshore fishing**: The deeper waters beyond the bay are Kendor territory
- **Pearl cultivation**: The bay's mollusk beds produce modest but consistent pearl harvests

The Kendor remain neutral in Atriik's internal politics. They trade with all four city-states equally and refuse to take sides in disputes. This neutrality is enforced by their ability to simply withdraw from trade—and no one in Atriik wants to lose access to the sea.

#### Notable Features

**The Outer Anchorage**: Where visiting ships moor while waiting for pilots and lighters. A small floating market operates here, trading in goods too perishable or too illicit for formal port channels.

**The Salt Marshes**: Where Sprenwood meets the bay, tidal flats and salt marshes support a distinct ecosystem. Salt harvesting here supplements Atriik's food preservation.

**Shark Shoals**: Shallow areas where shark populations congregate. Kendor hunters harvest sharks for meat, cartilage, and the teeth that feature in traditional jewelry. Outsiders are advised to stay clear.

**The Headlands**: Rocky promontories that shelter the bay from southwestern storms. The seaward sides are battered and dangerous; the landward slopes support scrubby forest and goat herds.

### Silwyn

Tags: state, nation, region

The grass sea. Miles of rolling plains rippling in the wind, broken only by the dark shapes of mammoth herds moving like storms across the horizon. This is Silwyn—homeland of the Silzar, the plains ogres who rose from hunted prey to regional terror in a single generation.

It's beautiful country, if you can ignore the war. The grass runs gold in autumn, green in spring, silver when the wind bends it flat. The sky stretches forever. At night, you can see the moons rise hours before they clear the horizon anywhere else. Travelers who cross Silwyn peacefully speak of it with something like reverence.

Travelers who cross it during a raid speak of it with nightmares.

#### Geography & Borders

Silwyn is a prison shaped like paradise.

**North — Eros**: The haunted forest. Home to the Nemo, the spectral remnants of elves who sought to become one with the trees and succeeded too well. The Silzar do not go north. They do not speak of what lies north. When children ask about the dark treeline on the horizon, parents change the subject.

**East — Iylovia**: The war front. Dense forest where the Gyv retreated after losing the plains. The treeline marks the limit of Silzar expansion—mammoths cannot fight among the trees, and the forest itself seems to resist invasion. Raids strike the forest edge constantly. No one goes deeper.

**South — The Desert**: Beyond the Silwyn River's headwaters, the land dries to sand and stone. Mammoths cannot survive there. The Silzar cannot follow. Traders come up from the desert routes bringing metal; they leave quickly.

**West — The Desert**: More of the same. The plains simply end where the water ends.

The Silzar dominate everything within these borders. They can reach nothing beyond them.

#### The Silwyn River

The lifeblood of the region. It rises from springs in the southern highlands, flows north through the heart of the plains, and crosses into Iylovia—where it becomes the water the Gyv depend on to survive.

The Silzar could dam it. They could end the war in a season.

They haven't. Not yet. The Mammoth Covenant holds water sacred, and the elders refuse to cross that line. But the younger generation is asking harder questions every year.

#### The Thundering Way

The ancient mammoth migration route. A vast loop through the plains that the herds have walked since before the Silzar existed—and that the Silzar now walk with them. The path is worn smooth in places, packed earth where countless feet have trod for countless generations.

Following the Thundering Way is the safest route through Silwyn. The Silzar expect travelers here and generally leave them alone, assuming they show proper respect to passing herds. Straying from the Way is more dangerous—not because the Silzar are hostile, but because getting lost on the plains is easy, and getting found by the wrong herd at the wrong time is worse.

#### Grandmother's Rest

A lone rocky hill rising from the flatness of the plains. According to Silzar tradition, the first mammoth to accept the Covenant died here of old age, surrounded by the people she had carried to freedom.

The Silzar leave offerings at Grandmother's Rest: carved bone, braided grass, small treasures. Warriors departing for raids stop here to ask for blessing. Families who lose members to the war come here to grieve. No one camps at the hill. No one hunts nearby. It is sacred ground.

Outsiders who show proper respect at Grandmother's Rest earn Silzar goodwill. Outsiders who desecrate it earn something else entirely.

#### Avil Lakes

A cluster of shallow lakes in the southern plains, fed by seasonal streams that flow down from the desert highlands before the land dries completely. The lakes expand in the wet season and shrink to muddy pools in the dry, but they never vanish entirely.

Avil Lakes mark the southern extent of reliable water—and therefore the southern extent of mammoth territory. The herds come here during migrations, and the Silzar have learned to read the lakes' water levels as omens for the season ahead. High water means good grazing; low water means hard times coming.

The lakes also serve as a neutral meeting point with the desert traders who bring metal up from the south. Neither side trusts the other enough to enter their territory, so they meet at Avil Lakes, conduct business quickly, and part ways.

#### The Scar

A burned strip along the Iylovia border—a no-man's-land perhaps a mile wide where neither grass nor trees grow. The Silzar burned it during the early assaults on the forest, trying to deny the Gyv cover. The Gyv burned sections in turn, trying to create firebreaks.

Now it's just dead ground. Neither side claims it. Both sides use it as a killing field. Silzar raiders cross it to strike at forest-edge settlements; Gyv ambushers lurk at its margins waiting for anyone foolish enough to approach.

The Scar is where most of the dying happens these days.

#### Seasonal Gathering Grounds

The Silzar have no cities, but they have places where the herds converge—and where the Silzar converge with them.

**The River Bend**: Where the Silwyn River turns sharply east before entering Iylovia. The largest gathering ground, used in summer when water is abundant. This is where the Council of Herd-Chiefs meets, where traders come to deal, where young Silzar from different herds meet future spouses.

**The South Springs**: Near the river's source, used in winter when the northern plains grow too cold. Smaller gatherings, more intimate. This is where disputes between herds are settled—or where they escalate.

**The Grandmother Circuit**: A three-day journey around Grandmother's Rest, undertaken during autumn as a sort of pilgrimage. Not all Silzar participate every year, but most try to make it at least once in their lives.

### South Naruaghin Tribes

Tags: state, nation

The South Naruaghin control the western reaches of the Ishnit Jungles, including the cursed coastline around Demortik Bay. Hardened by proximity to Demonwatch and hunted by Senwyn the Agonizer, they have become the most aggressive and expansionist of the three tribal confederations.

#### Territory

The southern tribes range from the jungle interior to the coast, claiming everything west of a rough line drawn from Ekomorn to Demortik Bay. Their territory includes some of the densest and most monster-infested jungle in the Ishnit, which they navigate with brutal expertise.

#### Culture

The South Naruaghin have internalized a philosophy of preemptive violence. Surrounded by demons to the south, a dragon overhead, and hostile tribes on all sides, they've concluded that the only way to survive is to strike first and strike hard.

**Demon-Scarred Traditions**: Living near Demonwatch has left its mark. South Naruaghin warriors undergo ritual scarification meant to make them "unpalatable" to demons—patterns cut into the scales that supposedly confuse infernal senses. Whether this works is debatable, but the scarification certainly intimidates enemies.

**War-Chiefs**: The South Naruaghin are led by war-chiefs who earn their position through successful raids. A chief who stops raiding loses authority. This creates constant pressure for expansion and conflict.

**Venom Craft**: In grim irony, the South Naruaghin have become master poisoners, harvesting venoms from jungle creatures to coat their weapons. They fight Senwyn the Agonizer with the tools of venomous snakes—a defiance the dragon finds either amusing or enraging depending on its mood.

#### Dragon Relations

Senwyn the Agonizer treats the South Naruaghin as prey and entertainment. The dragon doesn't just hunt them—it toys with them, poisoning water sources and watching villages die slowly, or striking hunting parties and leaving survivors to spread terror. The South Naruaghin hate Senwyn with burning intensity, and their shamans work constantly on poisons they hope might one day harm the dragon.

#### The Demonwatch Problem

The South Naruaghin don't approach Demonwatch, but they can't ignore it either. The demons confined within the darkstone palace are immortal and powerful—contained but not defeated. Tribal lore holds that the demons occasionally escape briefly during moonless nights, and anyone caught near the palace is taken.

The cursed reputation of Demortik Bay actually benefits the tribes somewhat—it keeps foreign ships away from their coast.

#### Relations with Other Tribes

The South Naruaghin are constantly raiding. They push against the East Naruaghin, compete with them for hunting grounds, and occasionally launch expeditions against the North (though the northern tribes' territory offers little worth taking). They view themselves as the true Naruaghin—the others have grown soft.

#### Notable Locations

**Venom's Rest**: The largest South Naruaghin settlement, located deep in the interior where Senwyn rarely hunts. Built around a natural hot spring with medicinal properties.

**The Scarring Grounds**: A ritual site where young warriors receive their demon-ward scars. Located uncomfortably close to Demonwatch—surviving the journey is part of the initiation.

**Demortik Coast**: The haunted shoreline. South Naruaghin fishing parties work these waters quickly and never after dark.

### Spotted Forest

Tags: forest, geography

Where the Dunes of Kunagi finally surrender to the savanna, the land doesn't transition cleanly. Instead, it fractures into a patchwork of oases—the Spotted Forest, a collection of verdant islands scattered across thinning sand and yellowing grass.

From above, it looks like green spots on a tan hide, a leopard's pelt stretched across the desert's edge. From the ground, it's a maze of life pockets separated by dry scrub, each centered on water that surfaces here and refuses to surface anywhere else.

#### The Oasis Clusters

Underground water from the Plains of Chule flows northwest toward the desert, where it strikes an impermeable layer of ancient rock and rises to the surface in scattered springs. Each spring creates a microclimate: trees cluster around the water, their shade reduces evaporation, fallen leaves enrich the soil, and a pocket of fertility develops amid the surrounding dry.

These oases range from tiny pools surrounded by a few palms to small lakes with proper forest canopy. The largest clusters support several hundred trees and undergrowth thick enough to hide in. The smallest are barely visible until you stumble into them.

The gaps between oases vary too. Some clusters sit within shouting distance of each other; others are separated by miles of dry scrub and stunted grass. The pattern seems random but isn't—the underlying geology dictates where water can rise, creating a consistent if chaotic distribution.

#### Ecology

The Spotted Forest hosts creatures adapted to island-hopping between wet and dry:

**Day-Travelers** — Many animals move between oases on a circuit, drinking at one pool, feeding in the scrub between, sleeping at another. Antelope, wild dogs, and small cats follow these routes. Predators learn the circuits and hunt the gaps.

**Oasis-Bound** — Some creatures never leave their home oasis: frogs, certain birds, insects dependent on specific plants. Each oasis develops its own micro-population, slightly different from its neighbors. Naturalists have identified dozens of subspecies found nowhere else.

**Opportunists** — Creatures from both the desert and the savanna venture into the Spotted Forest when conditions in their home range turn harsh. Desert foxes appear during droughts; savanna elephants wander in during dry season. This creates unpredictable encounters—animals that would never meet in their normal ranges cross paths here.

#### The Spotted Ones

For generations, the Spotted Forest has served as a contact zone between the Husakas scorpion riders and the Chule herders of the savanna. Trade, negotiation, and inevitable romance have produced a mixed community: the Spotted Ones, who belong fully to neither culture.

They number perhaps two thousand, scattered across the larger oases in extended family groups. Their lifestyle blends both parent cultures:
- They raise small herds of savanna cattle adapted to oasis life
- They keep a few scorpions—not the giant mounts of the Husakas, but smaller species useful for hunting and guard duty
- They speak both languages plus a creole that drives purists from both sides to distraction
- They observe the Telling (memory-sharing) but have never needed the extreme measures of the true desert-dwellers

The Spotted Ones are tolerated by both parent cultures as useful intermediaries but fully accepted by neither. The Husakas consider them soft—too much water access, too little discipline. The Chule consider them contaminated by the cursed desert. The Spotted Ones have learned not to care.

#### Trading Crossroads

The forest's primary value is its position: the last water before the desert, the first shade after the savanna, the meeting point between two worlds that would otherwise have no contact.

**Desert-to-Savanna Trade:**
- Fossil salt and coral stone from Gyerekas
- Scorpion venom (valuable for medicine and poison)
- Desert textiles and leatherwork
- Information about desert conditions and safe routes

**Savanna-to-Desert Trade:**
- Livestock (cattle don't survive the deep desert, but can be eaten at journey's start)
- Grain and preserved food
- Metal goods from southern smiths
- News from the jungles and coast

The largest oasis cluster, **Merkatta**, hosts a permanent trading post that swells during the cool season when travel is easiest. Merkatta's pool is large enough to water a small caravan, and the surrounding trees have been supplemented with planted gardens and semi-permanent structures.

#### Tensions

Everyone wants the Spotted Forest; no one can hold it.

**Husakas claims** — The scorpion riders consider the forest the eastern edge of their territory. They've been watering here since before the Spotted Ones existed. Some clans demand tribute from the oasis-dwellers; others consider them useful enough to leave alone.

**Chule claims** — The savanna herders point out that the water comes from their lands—the springs are fed by Chule aquifers. They've been grazing cattle at the forest's edge for generations. Some chiefs have tried to establish permanent control; none have succeeded for long.

**Spotted Ones' position** — They pay lip service to whoever's currently demanding it, play both sides against each other when they can, and focus on making themselves too useful to eliminate. They're the translators, the guides, the marriage brokers, the neutral ground. Remove them, and trade gets much harder for everyone.

**Periodic violence** — Every few decades, someone decides to force the issue. A Husakas clan pushes too hard for tribute; a Chule chief brings warriors instead of cattle. The fighting never lasts long—the forest is too scattered to hold, the prizes too small to die for—but it disrupts trade and leaves grudges that fester for generations.

Currently, tensions are elevated. A new Chule chief named Ombaka has been making noises about "reclaiming" the forest, and two Husakas clans have responded by increasing their presence at the western oases. The Spotted Ones are doing what they always do: staying friendly with everyone, hiding their valuables, and preparing to flee if necessary.

#### Notable Locations

##### Merkatta

The largest oasis cluster and primary trading hub. Features:
- A spring-fed pool covering nearly an acre
- The Trading Shade—a massive tree where deals are struck
- Semi-permanent structures including warehouses and a surprisingly good tavern
- A Spotted One elder named Kessemi who serves as informal arbitrator

##### The Painter's Pools

Three connected oases where mineral-rich water creates brilliant colors: rust-red, sulfur-yellow, and deep blue-green. Beautiful but undrinkable. Artists and dyers make pilgrimages here for the pigments that can be extracted from the pool edges.

##### Dry Sister

An oasis that failed. The spring dried up two generations ago, leaving dead trees and a haunted reputation. The Spotted Ones avoid it; they say the spirits of those who died when the water vanished still wait there, thirsty.

#### Encountering the Spotted Forest

Travelers passing between desert and savanna almost always stop here. The forest offers:
- Reliable water (the springs aren't cursed—they're fed from beyond Husakas)
- Rest and resupply at Merkatta
- Guides familiar with both desert and savanna routes
- Translation services for dealing with Husakas or Chule
- A chance to negotiate with either culture on neutral ground

The Spotted Ones are welcoming to travelers who pay fairly and don't take sides in local disputes. They're suspicious of anyone who seems too interested in their political situation—the last thing they need is outsiders stirring up trouble with either of their powerful neighbors.

### Sprenwood

Tags: forest, geography

A coastal forest stretching along Shark Bay's eastern shore, providing Byonowidi and western Atriik with timber, game, and a buffer against the salt winds. The Sha Ulokoni flows through its heart.

#### Character

Sprenwood is smaller and less ancient than Milras—more managed woodland than primeval forest. The trees here are hardwoods suited to the maritime climate: salt-tolerant species with dense grain prized for shipbuilding and furniture. The forest floor is relatively open, carpeted with ferns and low shrubs rather than the tangled undergrowth of deeper forests.

The Sharabha of Byonowidi have worked this forest for generations, developing a sustainable logging tradition that takes only what the forest can replace. This restraint is partly cultural, partly practical—the forest's health is Byonowidi's health, and the Sharabha monarchy cannot afford to exhaust its primary resource.

#### Economy

Sprenwood exports include:
- **Shipbuilding timber**: Dense, salt-resistant hardwoods traded to Watalina's Kendor shipwrights
- **Furniture wood**: Finished lumber for the urban markets of Kura and beyond
- **Furs and game**: Hunting rights in Sprenwood are controlled by the Byonowidi crown
- **Medicinal herbs**: Forest-floor plants used in Atriik's healing traditions

#### Notable Features

**The Ulokoni Mills**: Water-powered sawmills on the Sha Ulokoni, processing logs floated down from the interior. The mills are the industrial heart of Byonowidi's timber trade.

**The Salt Margin**: Where Sprenwood meets Shark Bay, the trees give way to salt marshes and tidal flats. This transitional zone supports a distinct ecology—wading birds, shellfish beds, and the occasional sea-going predator venturing inland.

**The Cavalry Grounds**: Open meadows in Sprenwood's southern reaches, used by Byonowidi's Sharabha cavalry for training. The combination of open ground, scattered trees, and varied terrain makes excellent practice for the mounted warfare the Sharabha are known for.

### Taflex Forest

Tags: forest, geography

The great forest of eastern Mueras, stretching from the windswept edge of the Dustwind Plateau down to the fog-shrouded approaches of Grimreach. The Taflex is the shipyard of Mueras—its timber builds the fleets that make the merchant-kings wealthy. But the forest is older than the merchant-kings, older than Kasper, older than human memory, and the deeper reaches answer to no Mueran authority.

The forest divides roughly into three zones. The western edge, where plateau meets treeline, hosts the logging operations—camps, sawmills, and the town of Eddiwood where raw timber becomes ship-worthy lumber. The middle belt belongs to hunters, trappers, and the small settlements that serve them. The deep interior is Yngli territory, where the silent folk maintain communities invisible to those who don't know what to look for.

#### The Logging Edge

House Vethros of Kelwin controls most logging rights in the Taflex, a monopoly nearly as valuable as their navigation privileges. The timber that builds Mueran ships must come from somewhere, and the Taflex provides. Logging camps dot the western forest edge, connected by rough tracks to Eddiwood and ultimately to the coast.

The work is hard and the camps are rough. Loggers come from the Mueras Highlands—poor folk willing to trade backbreaking labor for reliable pay. House Vethros treats them fairly by Mueran standards, which means they're fed, housed, and only occasionally cheated on their wages.

The camps push deeper into the forest each decade, following the valuable timber. This brings them closer to Yngli territory, and House Vethros has learned to be careful. Loggers who cut trees marked with Yngli symbols—three parallel scratches at eye height—tend to have accidents. Tools break, ropes fray, trees fall wrong. The Yngli can't speak, but they communicate clearly enough.

#### Eddiwood

The largest settlement in the forest, where the Taflex meets the plateau. Eddiwood exists to process timber: logs arrive from the camps, are milled into lumber, and shipped out toward the coast. The town is practical, utilitarian, and entirely uninterested in merchant-king politics. They sell to whoever pays, maintain no house allegiances, and keep their own counsel.

Population hovers around 2,500, swelling during cutting season and shrinking in winter. The town has a rough democracy—decisions are made by whoever shows up to the town meeting, and enforcement is handled by whoever volunteers. This works better than it should, largely because everyone in Eddiwood depends on the same industry and has identical interests.

#### The Hunting Belt

Beyond the logging edge, the middle forest supports a different economy. Hunters and trappers work these woods, taking furs, hides, and forest products. The game here is plentiful—deer, boar, various fowl—but the real prizes are the rarer creatures. Shadow-touched animals drift up from Grimreach; their pelts and organs command premium prices. Stranger things live deeper still, and hunters who venture too far sometimes don't return.

##### Hickton

A hunting town in the middle belt, smaller than Eddiwood but more established. Hickton has been here for generations, and its families know the forest intimately. The town maintains better relations with the Yngli than most Mueran settlements—partly necessity, partly genuine respect developed over decades of coexistence.

The Hickton hunters don't push into Yngli territory, and the Yngli occasionally trade with them: forest products, rare herbs, fungi with alchemical properties. The exchange is conducted in silence, through an elaborate system of gestures both communities have developed. Outsiders find it eerie; locals find it natural.

##### Sherly & Lieler

Barely more than camps, these small settlements serve as waypoints for those pushing deeper—toward Yngli communities, toward Grimreach, toward whatever lies beyond. Sherly caters to traders; Lieler to those whose business is better not discussed. Neither asks questions; neither expects answers.

#### The Deep Taflex

No human settlements exist in the forest's interior. This is Yngli territory.

The Yngli of the Taflex are descendants of those who fled exploitation in the coastal cities—generations of the silent folk who preferred forest hardship to urban servitude. They've built communities here, invisible to casual observation: settlements in the canopy, warrens beneath root systems, camps that leave no trace when abandoned.

The deep Taflex Yngli maintain their own governance. Without speech, they've developed other forms of coordination—sign language, written communication, and something that might be telepathy among their elders. They trade with the outside world when necessary, but they don't depend on it. The forest provides.

House Vethros officially claims the entire Taflex, but they've learned not to push the claim. Logging operations that venture too deep suffer mishaps. Surveyors who mark Yngli trees for cutting disappear. The Yngli can't declare war, but they wage it effectively nonetheless.

#### Forest Hazards

The Taflex is not safe. Beyond the normal dangers of wilderness—weather, terrain, wildlife—the forest holds stranger threats.

**Shadow Drift**: Creatures from the Darkened Coast occasionally wander up through Grimreach into the forest. These shadow-touched animals are dangerous and unpredictable, and their presence taints the local environment. Hunters prize them; wise hunters avoid them.

**The Old Growth**: In the deepest parts of the forest, trees grow to impossible size—trunks wider than houses, canopy blocking all sunlight. The Yngli revere these groves but don't explain why. Loggers who've seen them describe a sense of being watched, evaluated, and found wanting.

**Lost Camps**: Abandoned logging camps and hunting lodges dot the forest, some decades old, some centuries. Most are simply defunct; a few are haunted by whatever killed their inhabitants. The forest has a long memory.

#### The Timber Trade

Wood from the Taflex builds Mueran ships—a fact that gives the forest strategic importance far beyond its apparent value. House Vethros controls most of the supply, but other houses maintain small operations, and smuggling raw timber around Vethros oversight is a constant low-level conflict.

The best ship timber comes from trees two hundred years old or more. The Taflex has such trees in abundance—but the best stands are deeper, closer to Yngli territory. As the accessible timber is exhausted, House Vethros faces a choice: push deeper and risk Yngli retaliation, or watch their monopoly erode as timber quality declines.

So far, they've chosen caution. But the calculation changes with each passing year.

### Wyrm Teeth

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills in Westrim, east of Kura and north of the Milras Forest. The Wyrm Teeth earned their name from their jagged, tooth-like peaks and their historical connection to the wyrms that once roamed these lands.

#### Urk Noulgas

On the southwest point of the Wyrm Teeth stands Urk Noulgas—a ruined fortress that was once home to the Keeper of the Wyrms. In ancient times, wyrms were controlled by powerful mages in the Dunes of Kunagi, and Urk Noulgas served as a command post for these wyrm-keepers. The fortress now lies in ruins, abandoned after the fall of the wyrm-keeping tradition, though some say the echoes of old power still linger in the stones.

## Innerrim

### Geography

The Innerrim is the vast jungle basin at the heart of Rimihuica—a dark green sea of dense forest filling the continental interior. This is the "Godahi basin," a lowland region surrounded by mountains on multiple sides, where competing states carve out territory amid the endless canopy.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Middle Sea region and Ofrenia; Swampdeep (a saltwater swamp/bayou) lies to the northeast
- **East**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form an east-west barrier separating Innerrim from the Emerald Coast
- **South**: The Cloud Mountains run from southeast to northwest, separating the basin from the Shacklands (particularly Gorath)
- **West**: Transitions into Westrim; the Ishnit Jungles and Thunder Plains mark the western and southwestern edges

#### The Thunder Plains

A significant geographic feature—the open plains that form the gap between the Ishnit Jungles to the west and the main Innerrim jungle mass. South of the Thunder Plains lies the Sea of Selegos.

#### States of the Innerrim (Clockwise from West)

The basin is divided among several competing powers:

- **Qet Yemani** (West): Home to the Ulvsjael, wolf-people who have adapted to the jungle depths
- **Da Trang** (North): Territory of the Ix'Tyrann, ferocious lizard-people and deadly killers
- **New Chimea** (East): A colonial state extending from the old empire of Chimea. Unusually, it spans across the eastern mountain range, holding territory in both the Innerrim jungles and on the Emerald Coast
- **Vystrilik** (Southeast): Another state that crosses the mountain divide, with lands in both the jungle basin and coastal regions
- **Eoga** (South): The southernmost Innerrim state, bordering the Cloud Mountains

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: South of the Thunder Plains, separating mainland Rimihuica from Pesalolo island (Tamadrez)

### Aglip Scha

Tags: ruins, plague, pilgrimage, religion

A village abandoned during a plague called the Weeping Rot, now a pilgrimage site for death-cultists, plague-doctors, and those who seek to understand mortality. The dead remain where they fell, and the faithful come to sit among them.

#### History

Three centuries ago, Aglip Scha was an unremarkable village on the edge of the Plains of Chule—a few hundred souls who farmed the thin soil and traded with passing caravans. Then the Weeping Rot came.

The plague killed quickly and horribly. Victims wept blood as their organs liquefied, dying within days of the first symptoms. By the time the survivors realized what was happening, over half the village was dead. The remainder sealed the village—barricading doors, collapsing the well, burning what they could—and fled into the plains.

They never returned. No one did. The village sat empty, preserved by dry air and the fear of contagion, for decades. Then the pilgrims came.

#### The Pilgrimage

No one knows who first made the journey to Aglip Scha as an act of devotion rather than morbid curiosity. But word spread among certain religious communities—followers of death gods, scholars of entropy, those who believe that understanding mortality is the key to transcending it.

The pilgrims do not worship disease. They worship inevitability. The Weeping Rot is not sacred to them—the village is sacred because it is a perfect memorial to ending. Here, death came and was not cleaned up, not sanitized, not explained away. The bodies remain where they fell. The meals remain on tables, petrified. The doors remain barred from the inside, as if the dead are still trying to keep something out.

The pilgrims come to meditate on this. To sit among the dead and contemplate their own mortality. To collect soil they believe has spiritual properties. To perform rites of acceptance—acknowledging that they too will end, that all things end, and finding peace in that knowledge.

#### The Village Today

Aglip Scha is frozen in the moment of its death. The pilgrims maintain this deliberately, preserving the village as they found it:

- Skeletons lie in beds, at tables, in doorways. Some still clutch objects—a cup, a child's toy, a prayer written on rotting parchment. The pilgrims do not move them.
- Buildings stand exactly as they were, aside from natural decay. Roofs have collapsed in places. Walls have crumbled. But no one repairs them, and no one tears them down.
- The well remains collapsed, filled with rubble and sealed with ritual stones placed by generations of pilgrims.
- A perimeter of small shrines marks the village boundary. Pilgrims camp outside this line, living in tents that they erect and dismantle with each visit. No one sleeps within the village itself.

The site has an eerie stillness. Even birds rarely land here, and insects seem fewer than they should be. Whether this is lingering contamination, spiritual weight, or simply the pilgrims' careful maintenance is unclear.

#### The Pilgrims

Most who come to Aglip Scha are harmless. Priests of death gods seeking to understand their deity's domain. Philosophers grappling with mortality. The terminally ill looking for acceptance. Plague-doctors and scholars studying historical epidemics from a safe distance.

They are quiet, respectful, and welcoming to those who approach with genuine interest. Many stay for days or weeks, meditating among the dead. Some stay for years, becoming unofficial caretakers of the site. A few have died here—of natural causes—and their bodies have been added to the village with the same reverence given to the original victims.

The pilgrims follow simple rules:
- Nothing may be taken from the village (except soil from outside the perimeter)
- Nothing may be moved within the village
- No one may sleep within the village boundary
- No fire may be lit within the village (the dead must not be disturbed by smoke or heat)

#### The Danger

The Weeping Rot is not gone. It is dormant.

Something in the village still carries the plague—perhaps in the bones of the dead, perhaps in the soil, perhaps in the sealed well where victims were thrown in the plague's final days. The dry climate and the pilgrims' careful avoidance of the village interior have prevented reactivation. But occasionally, a pilgrim gets too curious. They enter a building they shouldn't. They touch something they shouldn't.

In the past century, there have been three minor outbreaks traced back to Aglip Scha. Each was contained—barely—through quarantine and fire. Each time, the pilgrims debated whether to finally burn the village and end the risk. Each time, they decided the site was too sacred to destroy.

The contamination's exact location remains unknown. Finding it would mean ending the danger forever—but also potentially releasing it.

#### Adventure Hooks

- **The Curious Pilgrim**: A pilgrim has entered the village interior and contracted something. The cult wants help finding a cure without destroying the shrine—and without the infected pilgrim leaving and spreading the plague.

- **Recovery Mission**: Something valuable is inside the village—a family heirloom, a historical document, an artifact buried with one of the dead. The pilgrims will not permit entry, but the party's patron doesn't care about permission.

- **The Source**: A plague-doctor believes they can identify and neutralize the Weeping Rot's source, ending the danger forever. They need protection while they work, and they need someone willing to enter the village with them.

- **Deliberate Release**: A faction within the pilgrim community has decided that the Weeping Rot is sacred—not just the village, but the plague itself. They intend to release it deliberately, as a "gift" to the world. They must be stopped, but violence within sight of the village is considered ultimate desecration.

- **The Sealed Well**: Something is moving in the collapsed well. The pilgrims insist it's just settling rubble. The sounds suggest otherwise.

### Casa Eleo

Tags: forest, geography

A forest in the Cloud Mountains, south of Eoga. Casa Eleo occupies a sheltered valley where the harsh mountain climate gives way to unexpected lushness. The forest is known for its unusual stillness—travelers report an eerie quiet, as if the normal sounds of wildlife are muted or absent entirely.

### Cherry Blossom River Valley

Tags: valley, foxborne

A beautiful valley and home to the Foxborne kingdom. Cliffs, pools of water, training grounds, watch towers, gardens, and butterflies abound.

### Cloud Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A mountain range forming the southern boundary of Eoga and the northern edge of the Innerrim highlands. The Cloud Mountains connect to the Myjornis Mountains in the west and the Tombrielle Mountains in the east, creating a continuous barrier between the Jungles of Godahi and the lands to the south.

The range is named for the perpetual cloud cover that blankets its peaks—moisture from the jungle below condenses as it rises, creating an environment of constant rain and fog. The passes through the Cloud Mountains are high, cold, and treacherous.

#### Notable Features

##### Casa Eleo

A forest in a sheltered valley. See [Casa Eleo](./Casa%20Eleo.md) for details.

##### Ondheil

A mountain lake in the eastern Cloud Mountains, fed by glacial melt and runoff. The waters are cold and remarkably clear.

##### Dreske Gemalis

A river or waterway in the southeastern Cloud Mountains. See [Dreske Gemalis](./Dreske%20Gemalis.md) for details.

### Dreske Gemalis

Tags: mountains, river, geography

A rugged mountain range marking the western border of Nashua, where the Inner Rim transitions from the highland territories to the toxic lowlands. The name applies both to the peaks themselves and to the cold, mineral-rich river that flows from them into Nashuan territory.

#### The Mountains

The Dreske Gemalis range forms a natural barrier between Nashua's marshlands and the broader Cloud Mountains system to the west. The peaks are not the tallest in the region—that distinction belongs to the Thunderdark Peaks to the north—but they're steep, heavily forested on the lower slopes, and largely impassable except through a handful of known passes.

The mountains shelter Nashua's western flank, funneling any overland approach from that direction into predictable routes. The Ix'Vasyla have made good use of this geography, fortifying the passes and maintaining watch posts along the ridgelines. No army has successfully crossed the Dreske Gemalis into Nashua; the terrain is simply too hostile, and the defenders know every approach.

The upper slopes are home to creatures rarely seen in the lowlands—highland predators, cliff-nesting birds, and things that prefer cold stone to warm marsh. The Ix'Vasyla send occasional hunting parties into the heights, but the mountains are not truly their territory.

#### The River

The Dreske Gemalis River rises from highland lakes fed by snowmelt, gathering strength as it descends the eastern slopes before entering Nashua's watershed. The water is notably cold and carries heavy mineral content—the name may derive from an old tongue meaning "dragon's tears" or "cold stream," though local stories vary.

Where the river enters the lowlands, its mineral-laden waters mix with organic decay to create the distinctive chemistry of Nashua's toxic marshlands. Scholars believe this confluence of highland minerals and lowland biology is responsible for the extraordinary toxicity of the central marshes—the Dreske Gemalis essentially seeds the poison that makes Nashua what it is.

The upper river is navigable only by small craft, and even then only by those who know the rapids and seasonal variations. It serves primarily as a water source and territorial marker rather than a trade route.

#### Strategic Importance

Control of the Dreske Gemalis passes would theoretically allow an enemy to bypass Nashua's marsh defenses entirely, striking directly at the river corridor from the highlands. Both Gorath and Trømgar have considered this approach; both have abandoned it as impractical.

The passes are few, narrow, and easily defended. The terrain favors ambush. And any force that successfully crossed would find itself deep in hostile territory with extended supply lines and enemies on all sides. The mountains defend Nashua as effectively as the marshes—just by different means.

### Elderran

Tags: city, ruins, magical-disaster, old-tolaria

The ruined capital of Old Tolaria, and the epicenter of one of the most catastrophic magical disasters in Alarian history. What remains is not merely a ruin—it is an ongoing unraveling of reality itself, where time, elements, and the fundamental nature of magic have been torn apart and left bleeding.

#### The Apparatus of Severance

The Tolarian mage-kings believed that magic was too entangled. Elemental forces bled into arcane formulae. Divine power contaminated leylines. The Faesong echoed through everything, impossible to isolate or control. They envisioned a world where each magical tradition could be harnessed in its pure form—separated, controlled, perfected.

They built the Apparatus of Severance: a city-spanning machine of crystalline towers, leyline conduits, and planar anchors designed to:

- **Sever the elemental planes** from the Prime, creating stable portals instead of chaotic bleed-through
- **Isolate divine power** from arcane magic, ending what they saw as "contamination" from the gods
- **Cage the Faesong** into specific geographic regions where it could be controlled and harvested
- **Anchor time itself** as a manipulable dimension rather than an immutable constant

The Apparatus required decades to construct and the concentrated magical knowledge of seven generations of mage-kings. When they finally activated it, everything went wrong simultaneously.

#### The Unraveling

The Apparatus partially succeeded—which was far worse than total failure.

The elemental planes were partially severed, creating permanent rifts and instabilities across Old Tolaria. The Faesong, compressed and caged, exploded outward from Elderran—where it landed, the Faewoods grew in minutes, ancient and twisted and wrong. Divine channels crossed and tangled, leaving clerics praying to something almost-but-not-quite their gods. And time itself fractured, creating pockets where past, present, and future bleed together.

At the center of it all, the Apparatus continues to run. The mage-kings designed it to be self-sustaining, and now it cannot be turned off without potentially making everything worse. For centuries, it has been slowly, incrementally completing the severance it was built to perform. The magical instability spreading across Alaria may be traced, in part, to Elderran's endless operation.

#### Velorax the Unfinished

A young dragon—barely a century old at the time—flew into Elderran at the moment of activation. Velorax was drawn by the magical chaos like a moth to flame. Dragons are inherently tied to multiple magical traditions (elemental, arcane, sometimes divine), and she felt the Apparatus pulling at her very essence.

She is frozen mid-transformation above the central spire. The Apparatus tried to separate her component magics and partially succeeded—distinct bands of elemental fire, arcane formulae, and raw temporal energy spiral around her body, each trying to fly in different directions. She has been like this for centuries, conscious, experiencing every moment of her own unraveling in slow motion.

See: Velorax (bestiary/dragons/)

#### Approaching Elderran

The temporal distortions intensify as one approaches the city center:

**At 5 miles**: The ruins appear frozen. Silent. Birds hang motionless in the air. Leaves suspended mid-fall. An oppressive stillness that feels wrong.

**At 1 mile**: Time begins to crawl. Your heartbeat sounds like drums. Each step takes effort. You can watch dust motes drift with glacial slowness.

**At 500 feet**: Time accelerates around you while you move through molasses. Velorax moves. Fire spreads from her jaws. Towers crack and reform. The catastrophe plays out at normal speed while you struggle to take a single step.

**At the center**: Decades pass in seconds. Anyone who reaches the Apparatus experiences the full collapse of Elderran compressed into moments—centuries of destruction, reconstruction by magical automatons, further destruction, reality tearing and healing, all in a cacophony of sensory overload. Those who survive (few do) emerge to find only minutes have passed outside.

#### The Regional Fallout

The Unraveling did not stay contained within Elderran's walls:

**The Faewoods**: Created instantly when the caged Faesong exploded outward. These forests are not natural—they are concentrated Faesong given physical form, still humming with magic that doesn't quite fit the world. The trees grow too fast, the animals behave strangely, and the boundaries between the material and fae realms are paper-thin.

**Elemental Rifts**: Scattered across Old Tolaria. Pockets where fire burns without fuel, water flows upward, stone breathes. Some are stable and valuable to those who know how to harvest them. Most are deadly.

**Divine Static**: Clerics within 50 miles of Elderran report their prayers going sideways. Not unanswered, but answered by something almost-but-not-quite their god. The divine channels are crossed, tangled. Some priests have gone mad from the wrongness of it.

**Time Fractures**: Beyond the main distortion zone, smaller fractures exist throughout the region—a grove where it's always twilight, a ruin where yesterday's rain is still falling, a road where travelers sometimes meet themselves coming the other way.

#### What Remains

Despite the catastrophe, Elderran was not empty when the Apparatus activated. Thousands lived in the capital. Some died instantly. Some are still dying, trapped in temporal loops. And some—transformed by the magical chaos—have become something else entirely.

Automatons built by the mage-kings still patrol the outer districts, following maintenance routines designed for a city that no longer exists. Elemental creatures, drawn through the rifts, have made the ruins their home. And deep in the time-dilated center, the mage-kings themselves may still be alive—frozen at the moment of their greatest triumph and greatest failure, waiting for someone to either save them or end them.

#### Adventure Hooks

- **The Apparatus Must Be Stopped**: Someone has calculated that in another century, the Apparatus will complete its work—and the results will be catastrophic for all of Alaria. But shutting it down requires reaching the center, and reaching the center requires surviving the time dilation.

- **Free Velorax**: The dragon has been conscious for centuries, watching her own destruction in slow motion. She may be grateful to be freed. She may be insane. She may complete her transformation into something terrible. Someone wants to find out.

- **The Mage-Kings' Notes**: The Tolarians understood what they were doing. Their research notes, if recovered, could explain how to undo the damage—or how to replicate the Apparatus elsewhere.

- **Lost in Time**: Someone's ancestor walked into Elderran fifty years ago and never came out. They might still be alive in there, experiencing an endless afternoon. A family wants them back—or at least wants to know what happened.

- **Harvest the Rifts**: The elemental rifts contain pure planar essence, invaluable to certain crafters and mages. The job sounds simple: go in, collect samples, come out. The job is never simple.

### Faewoods

Tags: forest, magical, faesong, old-tolaria

A forest in Old Tolaria that should not exist. The Faewoods were not grown—they were created in an instant when the Apparatus of Severance at Elderran attempted to cage the Faesong, and the Faesong exploded outward instead.

#### Origin

When the Tolarian mage-kings activated their Apparatus, one of its functions was to compress and contain the Faesong—the ambient magical resonance that connects the material world to the fae realms. They intended to cage it, control it, harvest it at will.

The Faesong did not cooperate.

The compressed energy exploded outward from Elderran in a wave of raw creative force. Where it landed with greatest intensity, forests erupted from bare ground in minutes. Trees that should take centuries to mature burst fully-formed from the soil. Underbrush tangled into being. Animals—or things that looked like animals—appeared from nothing.

The Faewoods are not natural growth. They are concentrated Faesong given physical form, frozen at the moment of creation but still humming with the magic that made them.

#### Nature

Walking in the Faewoods is disorienting. The forest feels too dense, too alive, too present. Colors are slightly wrong—greens too vivid, shadows too deep. Sounds echo strangely. The air tastes of lightning and honey.

The trees grow too fast. Cut one down, and saplings will sprout from the stump within hours. Clear a path, and it will be overgrown by morning. The forest actively resists being tamed, not through malevolence but through sheer fecundity—it simply grows faster than anything can be removed.

The boundary between the material world and the fae realms is paper-thin here. Travelers sometimes glimpse things that shouldn't be visible—fae creatures watching from just beyond perception, paths that lead to places that don't exist on any map, clearings that weren't there yesterday and won't be there tomorrow. Some who enter the Faewoods emerge somewhere else entirely. Some don't emerge at all.

#### Inhabitants

The Faewoods have attracted beings drawn to concentrated Faesong:

**Fae creatures** of all types consider the woods neutral territory—a place where the rules of their realm bleed into the material world. They are more visible here, more active, more willing to interact with mortals (for good or ill).

**Refugees** from Elderran's fall fled into the growing forest and never left. Their descendants have adapted to the Faewoods, becoming strange and fae-touched themselves. They do not welcome outsiders.

**Hermits, madmen, and seekers** come to the Faewoods looking for fae bargains, magical power, or escape from the world. Most find only death. A few find what they're looking for, which is often worse.

#### Sakatia

The ruined village of Sakatia lies somewhere in the Faewoods—a settlement of Old Tolaria that was swallowed when the forest erupted. Its people died or fled, but the buildings remain, slowly being consumed by growth that should not be possible.

See: Sakatia

#### Adventure Hooks

- **Fae Bargain**: Someone made a deal in the Faewoods and now regrets it. Breaking fae contracts is possible but dangerous—and the fae who made the deal won't appreciate interference.

- **The Growing**: The Faewoods have begun expanding again for the first time in centuries. Something has changed—perhaps connected to Elderran, perhaps something else entirely. Villages on the forest's edge are being swallowed.

- **Lost Tolarian Knowledge**: The mage-kings maintained research outposts throughout their territory. One was in the Faewoods, containing notes on the Apparatus's design. Finding it means navigating a forest that doesn't want to be navigated.

- **Harvest Season**: The concentrated Faesong in the woods can be harvested—with the right tools, the right knowledge, and complete disregard for safety. Someone's paying well for Faewoods essence, no questions asked.

Giants Cradle is a natural amphitheater carved by ancient glaciers, approximately fifteen miles across at its widest point. The valley floor sits several thousand feet below the surrounding peaks, creating a sheltered microclimate significantly warmer than the surrounding mountains.

Two lakes dominate the valley:

**Zetl Heski Voth** ("Lake of First Breath") occupies the valley's eastern basin. Fed by geothermal springs, its waters remain warm year-round, steaming in the cold mountain air. Giant legends claim this is where the first giant emerged from the earth, pulled from the hot stone by the world's own labor pains.

**Zetl Hesk Rou** ("Lake of Last Breath") fills the western basin. Cold, still, and impossibly deep—no one has ever found its bottom. Its surface rarely ripples, even in strong winds. Giants come here to die, walking into the water and never emerging. The lake accepts them without a sound.

Between the two lakes, a ridge of ancient stone rises from the valley floor, carved with petroglyphs so old that even the giants have forgotten their meaning. This is the Spine of Sleeping Giants, and the guardian community makes its home along its length.

#### The Guardian Giants

The giants who dwell in the Cradle are not like their Thunder Plains cousins. They are older, quieter, more contemplative. They do not herd mammoths or raid settlements. They tend the valley, maintain the ancient stone circles, and perform death-rites for giants who make the pilgrimage.

The guardians live simply, in stone shelters built into the Spine. They eat what the valley provides—fish from the warm lake, game from the surrounding slopes, roots and tubers that grow in the geothermal soil. They want nothing from the outside world except to be left alone with their sacred duty.

Their leader bears the title **Voice of the Cradle**—currently an ancient giantess named Morveth who has tended the valley for over three centuries. She speaks rarely, but when she does, even the most belligerent Thunder Plains giant falls silent.

#### The Pilgrimage

Giants from across Alaria make the journey to the Cradle at two points in their lives: birth and death.

**Birth**: Pregnant giants who can make the journey travel to Zetl Heski Voth to deliver their children. It is believed that giants born in the warm waters carry a blessing—longer life, greater wisdom, a connection to the ancestral spirits. Not all can make the journey, and giants born elsewhere are not considered lesser, but those born in the Cradle are marked as special.

**Death**: When a giant feels their end approaching, tradition demands they walk to Zetl Hesk Rou. The journey itself is considered part of the dying—the final act of will, the last demonstration of giant strength. Those who make it enter the cold water and are never seen again. The guardians believe they return to the stone from which the first giant emerged, completing the cycle.

Giants who die elsewhere—in battle, by accident, far from the Cradle—are mourned differently. Their spirits are considered "wandering," unable to complete the cycle. Some giants believe these spirits become the winds that howl through mountain passes. Others believe they simply cease to be.

#### The Schism

The Thunder Plains giants consider the Cradle their ancestral home, but they have forgotten the old ways. They see the guardian giants as weak, passive, wasting their strength on tending graves instead of claiming territory.

A growing faction among the Thunder Plains giants wants to "reclaim" the Cradle. They envision it not as a temple but as a stronghold—a fortress from which to project giant power across the region. They speak of "restoring" the Cradle to what they imagine it once was: a seat of giant dominion, not a place of quiet death.

The guardian giants will not fight to defend the valley. Violence is forbidden in the Cradle—this is perhaps the oldest and most sacred of giant laws. But they will not leave, either. If the Thunder Plains giants come with violence, the guardians will simply... stop. Stop eating. Stop performing the rites. Stop maintaining the sacred spaces. They will let themselves die in the valley they have tended for millennia, and curse the defilers with their last breaths.

This is not a bluff. The guardians have done it before, generations ago, when another faction tried to claim the Cradle. The curse that followed haunted those giants for seven generations.

#### Adventure Hooks

- **The Dying Giant**: A giant hires the party to escort them to the Cradle. They are dying and wish to complete the pilgrimage, but enemies—or family who don't want them to go—stand in the way.

- **Something Wrong in the Deep**: Giants who enter Zetl Hesk Rou have started coming back out. Changed. Wrong. They don't speak, don't respond to their names, and their eyes are empty. The guardians need help discovering what has corrupted the Lake of Last Breath without themselves entering its waters.

- **Preventing a War**: The Thunder Plains warband is coming. The guardians refuse to fight. Someone needs to stop the conflict without bloodshed—because if giant blood is spilled in the Cradle, the consequences will be felt across Alaria.

- **The First Giant's Bones**: A scholar believes the petroglyphs on the Spine of Sleeping Giants are a map—directions to the actual remains of the first giant, buried somewhere in the valley. The remains would be priceless to collectors, mages, or giant traditionalists. The guardians will not permit excavation. The scholar doesn't intend to ask permission.

- **A Birth in Danger**: A pregnant giant has made the pilgrimage to the Cradle, but complications have arisen. Giant midwifery is beyond the party's expertise, but the guardian giants need supplies, protection from something hunting the valley, or help reaching a healer who can assist.

### Nashua

Tags: region, marshland, lizardfolk

Two hundred miles of toxic marshland, tangled jungle, and patient death. Nashua is where invading armies go to disappear. The Ix'Vasyla who rule here have refined defensive warfare into something approaching art—a doctrine of poison, patience, and attrition that has held off both the Gorathi legions and the Strømgodden war-hosts for generations. Every stream hides an ambush. Every clearing is a killing ground. Every step deeper into Nashua is a step closer to a death you won't see coming.

The land itself fights for its people. Toxic fumes rise from stagnant pools. Venomous creatures infest every shadow. The water is undrinkable without treatment. Gorathi soldiers call it "the Poison Country" and speak of comrades who vanished without a trace, entire patrols swallowed by the marshes with nothing left but empty boots. The Ix'Vasyla call it home.

#### Overview

Nashua occupies the eastern Inner Rim, a roughly triangular territory bounded by:
- **West**: The Dreske Gemalis range, whose peaks mark the border with the Cloud Mountains
- **Northeast**: The Thunderdark Peaks and Trømgar, home of the Strømgodden dwarves
- **Southwest**: The Deserted Hills and contested borderlands with Gorath
- **East**: A long coastline opening to the eastern seas

The terrain divides into three zones:
1. **The Toxic Marshes**: Central and western Nashua, the heartland—flooded lowlands, mangrove forests, and the ancestral territory of the Ix'Vasyla
2. **The River Corridor**: Eastern Nashua, where the Jiji River and its tributaries support the major settlements
3. **The Southern Scrublands**: Drier, sparser terrain toward the coast—the most vulnerable to Gorathi incursion

At roughly 200 by 300 miles, Nashua is far smaller than its sprawling southern neighbor. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in lethality per square mile.

#### The Toxic Marshes

The heart of Nashua is poison.

The central marshlands formed over millennia as mineral-rich waters from the Dreske Gemalis mixed with organic decay in the lowland basins. The result is an ecosystem saturated with natural toxins: arsenic compounds in the soil, sulfurous gases bubbling from stagnant pools, and a food chain where nearly everything has evolved to be venomous, poisonous, or both.

The Ix'Vasyla didn't just adapt to this environment—they weaponized it. Their scales resist toxins that would kill most warm-blooded creatures within hours. They know which pools are merely unpleasant and which will dissolve flesh. They've cultivated the deadliest plants and bred the most venomous serpents. To invade the marshes is to fight not just the Ix'Vasyla but the land itself.

The marshes are navigable only by those who know them. Channels wind between islands of semi-solid ground, but the routes change with seasons and floods. The Ix'Vasyla travel by shallow-draft boats, by vine-rope bridges hidden in the canopy, or simply by swimming through waters that would poison their enemies. Outsiders who try to follow find their boats dissolving, their guides dead, and the way back vanished.

#### The River Corridor

Along the eastern edge of Nashua, where the toxic marshes give way to cleaner watershed, settlements cluster along the rivers. This is the closest thing Nashua has to civilized territory—"civilized" meaning "only moderately lethal to outsiders."

The **Jiji River** is the primary artery, flowing south from the highlands before curving east toward the coast. Major settlements line its banks, each positioned to control river traffic and defend against incursion. The **Torin Creek** branches west, providing access to the deeper marsh territories.

The river towns are where Nashua interfaces with the outside world. Trade happens here—carefully controlled, closely watched. Foreign merchants are permitted in designated areas of certain towns, never deeper. Those who try to venture beyond the permitted zones discover why Nashua's borders are so effectively closed.

#### The Southern Scrublands

South of the marshes and river settlements, the terrain transitions to drier scrubland and sparse forest. This is Nashua's most vulnerable flank—the terrain that Gorath could actually fight in, if they could reach it.

The scrublands are contested ground. Gorathi patrols probe north; Ix'Vasyla raiders strike south. Neither side holds territory permanently. The few settlements here are fortified positions rather than true towns, their populations as much garrison as civilian.

The coastline offers little refuge. Rocky shores, treacherous currents, and the Ix'Vasyla's small but vicious navy make amphibious assault impractical. The offshore islands—visible from the coast but rarely visited by outsiders—reportedly serve as Ix'Vasyla naval bases, though no foreign ship has confirmed this and returned.

#### Major Settlements

Nashua's population concentrates in the river corridor, with settlements positioned for defense, trade, and control of water routes.

##### Tirexonos

The capital, such as it is. Tirexonos sprawls across a cluster of islands where the Jiji River splits into multiple channels, its buildings raised on stilts above the floodwaters. This is the seat of whatever passes for central government in Nashua—the Council of Fang and Scale, where clan leaders gather to coordinate the endless war.

The city's architecture is distinctive: curving walls that echo serpentine movement, buildings that seem to grow organically from the terrain, and a maze-like layout that would trap invaders in killing zones. The central island holds the Temple of the Hunt, where the greatest Ix'Vasyla warriors are honored and where prisoners of particular importance are... processed.

Foreign visitors are rare but not unknown. Tirexonos maintains a small quarter for diplomats and merchants, heavily watched and easily isolated. The message is clear: you are here on sufferance.

##### Vosx

The second city, positioned where the Jiji River approaches the coast. Vosx handles most of Nashua's limited foreign trade—the exports of marsh-harvested alchemical ingredients, rare venoms, and the occasional ransom negotiation for captured enemies.

Vosx is also the center of the **Arcane Consortium of Nashua**, a scholarly institution that has somehow maintained academic pursuits despite the constant warfare. The Consortium studies the marshes' unique properties, develops new applications for local toxins, and maintains the only significant library in the region. They once placed a 50,000 gold bounty on information about Yegnoth—a planar anomaly in Gorathi territory—that remains unclaimed after two hundred years.

##### The River Towns

Between Tirexonos and Vosx, smaller settlements dot the Jiji and its tributaries:

**Hyobinii**: Northern town, positioned where highland streams join the main river. Guards the approaches from Trømgar.

**Sipokno**: A fortified position controlling a narrow point in the river. Any force moving by water must pass under Sipokno's watchful eyes—and its poison-dart batteries.

**Dolno Jelovce**: Market town serving the surrounding marsh territories. The largest concentration of Sylthik in Nashua, who maintain their own quarter and temple.

**Nikolici**: Fishing and river-transport hub. The boats built here are designed specifically for marsh navigation—shallow draft, easily hidden, and treated with compounds that resist the toxic waters.

**Poyux**: Southern river town, the last major settlement before the scrublands. Heavily militarized; this is where forces gather for raids into Gorath.

**Kisava, Lukshax**: Twin towns bracketing a river junction. Function as a defensive pair, each covering the other's approaches.

**Sviniste**: Western outpost at the edge of the deep marshes. The last "civilized" settlement before the true toxic heartland. Serves as staging point for clan warriors heading to the interior.

#### The Peoples

##### Ix'Vasyla (Dominant)

The black-scaled assassin-hunters rule Nashua. Their society has been shaped by generations of constant warfare into something lean, deadly, and deeply paranoid.

Ix'Vasyla culture values patience, cunning, and the kill. Their leaders are chosen not for strength but for tactical brilliance—the ability to outmaneuver enemies, to turn disadvantages into ambushes, to make every Gorathi advance cost more than it gains. The most respected warriors are not those with the most kills but those with the best efficiency: enemies eliminated per warrior lost.

Their venomous bite defines their military doctrine. Strike from hiding, deliver the poison, retreat. Let the venom work. Return to finish what's left. No glory in single combat, no honor in fair fights—only results. Gorathi soldiers have learned to fear any wound, however minor, knowing the Ix'Vasyla venom brings days of agony before death.

The Ix'Vasyla organize into clans, each controlling territory within the marshes. Clan loyalty is paramount, but the clans unite against external threats with surprising cohesion. The endless war has taught them that internal conflict is a luxury they cannot afford.

##### Sylthik (Minority)

The serpent-folk maintain a presence in Nashua, primarily in Dolno Jelovce and scattered settlements near the coast. Their relationship with the Ix'Vasyla is complicated—both peoples are scaled, both worship entities connected to serpents, and both share an instinctive understanding that the warm-blooded races are fundamentally different from themselves.

But the Sylthik's religious supremacism sits uneasily alongside Ix'Vasyla pragmatism. The Ix'Vasyla value results; the Sylthik value doctrine. The Ix'Vasyla respect cunning enemies; the Sylthik consider all non-Sylthik to be inferior vermin. Tensions exist beneath the surface cooperation.

The Sylthik primarily occupy religious and scholarly roles—their connection to serpents makes them valuable in certain rituals, and their literacy tradition has contributed to institutions like the Arcane Consortium. They are tolerated, even valued, but they will never rule in Nashua.

##### Humans (Integrated)

The Slavic-influenced names of many settlements reveal Nashua's history: before the Ix'Vasyla consolidated control, human communities dotted the river corridor. Some were destroyed. Some fled. But many were... absorbed.

Humans in Nashua occupy a subordinate but not enslaved position. They serve as craftspeople, traders, translators, and occasionally soldiers in auxiliary roles. They've developed their own traditions for surviving among the lizardfolk—knowing when to show throat, understanding the subtle cues of Ix'Vasyla body language, and never, ever making eye contact with a hunting party.

These river-humans have their own identity, distinct from both their warm-blooded kin elsewhere and their scaled overlords. They speak a creole mixing human tongues with Ix'Vasyla hisses. They've adopted some lizardfolk customs while maintaining others of their own. They're survivors, pragmatic about their circumstances, and often more useful to the Ix'Vasyla alive than dead.

#### Rivers and Waterways

##### Jiji River

The lifeline of Nashua. The Jiji rises in the Dreske Gemalis foothills, gathers tributaries from the marshlands, and flows southeast to the coast. It's navigable for most of its length, though hazards abound—rapids in the upper reaches, toxic side-channels in the middle stretch, and heavily defended checkpoints throughout.

Control of the Jiji means control of Nashua. Every major settlement sits on its banks or those of its tributaries. Every military campaign involves river access. The Ix'Vasyla maintain a fleet of war-boats—fast, shallow-draft vessels crewed by warriors who can fight on water or dive beneath it.

##### Torin Creek

A major tributary entering the Jiji from the west, Torin Creek provides access to the deep marsh territories. The upper reaches are navigable only by small craft and only by those who know the channels. This is where the most toxic, most dangerous, most Ix'Vasyla-controlled territory lies.

Invaders who push up Torin Creek don't come back. The marshes simply swallow them.

#### The Wars

Nashua fights on two fronts, and has for generations.

##### The Gorath Front (Southwest)

The Deserted Hills mark the contested border between Nashua and Gorath. Gorathi legions have tried repeatedly to push through, and repeatedly failed. Not through lack of trying—Gorath has committed significant forces to the Nashua campaign. But the terrain shifts from Gorathi jungle to Nashuan marsh, and the Ix'Vasyla's defensive doctrine is perfectly suited to attrition warfare.

Gorathi soldiers die to poison, to ambush, to disease, to the marshes themselves. Supply lines stretch impossibly thin. Reinforcements arrive sick and demoralized. The Ix'Vasyla never give battle when they can give plague. The front has barely moved in decades.

The Gorathi call it a "bleeding wound." The Ix'Vasyla call it victory.

##### The Trømgar Front (Northeast)

The Strømgodden dwarves of Trømgar are a different problem. They don't invade the marshes—they can't, really, given their physiological unsuitability for waterlogged terrain. Instead, they raid the highland approaches, strike at Nashua's northern settlements, and maintain constant pressure along the mountain passes.

The Ix'Vasyla respond with their own raids into Trømgar territory. Neither side can deliver a decisive blow. The dwarves are too fortified in their mountains; the lizardfolk too entrenched in their marshes. The conflict has become almost ritualized—seasonal campaigns, predictable targets, casualties that both sides consider acceptable.

Some in both nations have suggested peace. Neither side's culture permits it.

#### For Adventurers

Nashua offers grim opportunities:

**Against Gorath**: Anyone willing to fight the slave-empire will find allies here, though the Ix'Vasyla's definition of "ally" may differ from expectations. They'll use you; the question is whether you can use them back.

**The Arcane Consortium**: Scholars interested in toxicology, planar phenomena, or unusual magical applications may find patrons in Vosx. The Consortium pays well for information and specimens—and asks few questions about how they were obtained.

**The Marshes**: The toxic heartland contains ruins older than the Ix'Vasyla, remnants of civilizations that flourished and died in the poison country. What they left behind is unknown, because almost no one has reached those ruins and returned.

**Escape Routes**: Nashua's hostility to Gorath makes it a theoretical refuge for escaped slaves. In practice, surviving the crossing from Gorathi territory to Nashuan protection is nearly impossible—but "nearly" isn't "completely."

The Ix'Vasyla don't trust outsiders. They've learned, through centuries of war, that trust is a vulnerability. But they're pragmatic enough to use tools that present themselves. Whether you can remain a tool rather than becoming a victim is up to you.

### Old Tolaria

Tags: region, geography, fallen-state

The ruins of what was once one of the most magically advanced civilizations in Alaria. Old Tolaria fell in a single catastrophic moment when its mage-kings attempted to unweave the fundamental nature of magic itself. What remains is a blighted landscape of magical instability, haunted forests, and the slowly-decaying remnants of a once-great nation.

#### The Fall

Old Tolaria's mage-kings pursued magical knowledge without restraint. They believed magic was too entangled—elemental, arcane, divine, and fae energies all bleeding into each other, impossible to isolate or perfect. They built the Apparatus of Severance in their capital of Elderran to separate these magical traditions into pure, controllable forms.

The activation of the Apparatus was the end of Old Tolaria as a functioning nation. The magical backlash created the Faewoods in an instant, tore holes in reality across the region, and left Elderran itself trapped in a temporal catastrophe that continues to this day. The mage-kings who survived scattered. The population fled or died. Within a generation, Old Tolaria existed only in memory and ruin.

#### Elderran

The former capital, now a frozen apocalypse. Time itself was shattered by the Apparatus, creating a zone of temporal distortion where the catastrophe is eternally ongoing. A young dragon named Velorax hangs frozen above the central spire, caught in the moment of her own unmaking. The Apparatus continues to run, slowly completing the work the mage-kings began.

See: Elderran

#### Gnarwood Forest

A forest in the northern reaches of Old Tolaria, one of the few regions relatively unaffected by the Apparatus's backlash. The Gnarwood's trees are ancient and twisted, growing in strange spirals that some scholars attribute to mild magical contamination predating the fall. Small communities of woodcutters and hunters eke out a living here, carefully avoiding the more unstable areas to the south.

#### Lodrian Hills

Rolling hills in the western portion of Old Tolaria, now largely depopulated. The hills are dotted with the ruins of estate houses and small fortifications—the country retreats of Tolarian nobility, abandoned when their owners died or fled. Treasure hunters pick through these ruins regularly, though the most valuable finds were claimed generations ago.

#### Grailwood Forest

A smaller forest south of the Gnarwood, notable for the quality of its timber before the fall. Now the Grailwood is strange—trees grow in geometric patterns, undergrowth arranges itself in spirals, and animals behave with uncanny coordination. Scholars believe the Apparatus's effects created some form of collective consciousness in the forest, though whether this makes the Grailwood dangerous or merely unsettling is debated.

#### Elaphant Groves

Once famous orchards that supplied fruit to the Tolarian elite. The groves still produce—the trees still flower, still bear fruit—but eating the produce is unwise. Those who do report strange dreams, prophetic visions, and in some cases permanent alterations to their perception of time. The fruit fetches high prices among certain mages and mystics despite (or because of) these effects.

#### Faewoods

The most dramatic result of the Apparatus's activation. When the mage-kings attempted to cage the Faesong, it exploded outward and created a forest in minutes. The Faewoods are concentrated fae energy given physical form—beautiful, deadly, and utterly unnatural. The boundary between the material world and the fae realms is dangerously thin throughout the forest.

See: Faewoods

##### Sakatia

A village of Old Tolaria swallowed by the Faewoods when they erupted. The ruins remain, slowly being consumed by impossible growth. Some of the villagers were absorbed into the forest itself, their faces visible in bark, their hands reaching from root systems.

See: Sakatia

#### Mount Tolaria

The peak that gave Old Tolaria its name, visible from most of the region on clear days. Mount Tolaria was sacred to the nation's founders, believed to be the site where the first Tolarian mages received their gifts. The mountain itself is relatively stable magically, protected by ancient wards that predate the mage-kings' hubris. A few hermits and refugees live in caves on its slopes, avoiding the chaos below.

#### Fylereün

A secondary peak in the Mount Tolaria range, once home to an astronomical observatory operated by the mage-kings. The observatory was studying the relationship between celestial movements and magical flows when the Apparatus activated. The building still stands, its instruments still aligned, but the astronomers are long dead and their notes are written in ciphers no one has cracked.

#### Ekadriel

A fortified monastery built into a cliff face on Mount Tolaria's eastern slope. The monks who lived here practiced a form of magical meditation designed to harmonize different magical traditions—the opposite of what the mage-kings attempted. When the Apparatus activated, Ekadriel was protected by its wards and its philosophy. The monastery still stands, still inhabited by the descendants of its original monks, who maintain their practice and occasionally offer shelter to travelers who can find them.

### Raric Bay

Tags: bay, water, geography

A large crescent bay along the southern Innerrim coast where the fish are already dead when you catch them.

#### The Dead Catch

Fishermen learned centuries ago not to work Raric Bay. Nets come up full—the waters are abundant—but every fish is already dead. Not killed by the net, not suffocated on the way up. Dead before capture. The flesh is fresh, unspoiled, perfectly edible. But the eyes are clouded, the gills still, the hearts stopped. Dissection shows no cause of death.

Fish swimming into the bay are alive. Fish caught in the bay are dead. The transition happens somewhere between, at a depth of roughly sixty feet. Divers who've crossed that threshold report nothing unusual—no temperature change, no pressure difference, no visible boundary. But everything below that line is corpse.

The dead fish still swim. Their bodies move with the currents, fins adjusting, maintaining depth and direction. Schools of dead fish circle the bay in patterns that would suggest intention if they weren't, by every measurable standard, deceased. Fishermen call them "the swimmers" and won't eat anything caught here regardless of the coin offered.

#### The Depth

Below sixty feet, Raric Bay becomes something else.

The seafloor at the bay's center—roughly ninety feet down—is covered in bones. Not fish bones. The bones of everything that has ever died in or near the bay: fish, birds, seals, dolphins, the occasional whale. And human bones. Thousands of human skeletons, accumulated over millennia, all facing the same direction. Southwest. Toward something beyond the bay's mouth that no chart has ever shown.

The bones don't decay. A skeleton from the bay's first recorded drowning, over two thousand years ago, was recovered last century by a mage using telekinesis. The bones were pristine, white as fresh-cleaned ivory, with no sign of age or degradation.

Three ships have sunk in Raric Bay throughout recorded history. The wrecks are visible from the surface on clear days. The crews are still aboard—skeletons at their posts, hands on tillers and lines, jaws open in expressions that might be screams or might be something else. They face southwest, like everything else.

#### The Settlement Attempts

Twelve attempts have been made to establish permanent settlements on Raric Bay's shores. The chronicle is consistent:

**Year one**: Settlers report unease, bad dreams, a persistent sense of being watched from the water. Attributed to superstition.

**Year two**: Livestock begin dying. No disease, no predation—animals simply stop living. Found in the morning, eyes open, bodies unmarked. Always facing southwest.

**Year three**: The children stop speaking. Not traumatized, not ill—they simply have nothing to say. They spend hours staring at the bay. When asked what they see, they smile.

**Year four**: Settlers leave. Those who remain past year four do not leave. Their bones join the others on the seafloor.

The Shacklands Trading Company attempted the most recent settlement in 423 AR. They lasted three years and two months. The company's records from that period are sealed in Gorath's archives, classified by order of the Warlord himself. The clerk who catalogued them was found dead in his office, facing southwest, with no cause of death the healers could determine.

#### Tugon's Castle

A partially-submerged fortress stands at the bay's center, directly above the deepest concentration of bones. It is the only structure to survive in Raric Bay for more than four years.

See: Tugon's Castle

#### What Lies Beyond

Southwest of Raric Bay, past the mouth, the open sea continues for three hundred miles to the Shacklands coast. Charts show nothing unusual. Ships cross that water regularly without incident.

But ships that sail directly southwest from the bay's center—following the line the bones are facing—report their compasses spinning, their navigators becoming confused, their crews developing sudden and irrational fear. Most turn back. Those that don't find nothing. They return, eventually, and they don't speak of what they saw.

One captain, dying of unrelated causes decades later, described it in his final letter: "There's a place out there that isn't on any map. I saw its shadow on the water. The fish in Raric Bay are swimming toward it. They're waiting for it to open."

#### The Unfallen

Approximately forty miles southwest of Raric Bay's mouth, buried beneath three hundred feet of water and sixty feet of sediment, lies the body of something that died before death worked the way it does now.

When Lyzaria died 235 million years ago—the first death in creation—her passing established the system: soul to Astraeva, shadow to Malstaris, spirit fading in Celestia. Every death since has followed that template. But the Unfallen predates Lyzaria. It comes from the primordial era, before Azus built the Planar Stack, before the titans were born, before positive and negative energy had names. When it ended, there was no Astraeva to receive a soul, no Malstaris to receive a shadow, no Celestia to hold a spirit. There was only Ezz—undifferentiated chaos—and Ezz does not recognize endings.

The entity has no name in any living language. Scholars who have pieced together fragments from pre-titan texts call it the Unfallen—not because it cannot fall, but because it fell before the concept of "fallen" had been established. Its death created a *template* that doesn't match the current system. Soul, shadow, and spirit never separated. They remain fused in a state the planar machinery cannot process—not alive, not properly dead, simply *persisting* in primordial stasis.

The Unfallen's body is vast—estimates based on the spread of its influence suggest a mass comparable to a small mountain range. It resembles nothing living: a tangle of geometric shapes that don't quite connect properly, angles that hurt to perceive, surfaces that reflect things that aren't there. Divers who have seen fragments of it protruding from the sediment describe it as "a skeleton of mathematics" or "frozen screaming" or simply refuse to describe it at all.

#### The Mechanism

The current death system requires separation: soul goes one way, shadow another, spirit fades. The Unfallen's influence *prevents* that separation. Everything within its range dies, but the components remain fused—soul, shadow, and spirit locked together in the primordial configuration, unable to move on because there's nowhere for an undivided being to go.

The sixty-foot threshold marks where this influence becomes strong enough to override normal planar mechanics. Above that line, Astraeva and Malstaris can still claim their due. Below it, the Unfallen's template takes precedence. Creatures that cross the threshold die instantly—heart stops, brain ceases—but with nowhere for their components to separate to, the body continues. The soul can't leave for the Astral because it's still bound to the shadow. The shadow can't sink to Malstaris because it's still bound to the soul. The spirit can't fade because it's still anchored to both.

The result: dead things that don't stop moving. Not undead in the necromantic sense—no trapped soul, no bound shadow. Something older. Something the system wasn't built to handle.

The bones face southwest because they are being *called*. The Unfallen has no consciousness—it ended before consciousness meant anything—but it has a kind of gravity, a pull that draws similarly-stuck beings toward it. The fused soul-shadow-spirits of the bay's dead recognize kinship in the Unfallen's mass. Given enough time, every bone in Raric Bay would migrate across the seafloor to join it. The process is slow, measurable in inches per century, but it is inexorable.

The fish swim in patterns because their fused components are trying to *solve* themselves. The geometric precision mirrors the Unfallen's structure—primordial mathematics from before Azus imposed order on chaos. The dead creatures unconsciously arrange themselves according to that structure, forming diagrams of something the current planar system has no category for.

#### Tugon's Role

Tugon var Seleth did not discover the Unfallen. The Unfallen discovered him.

His journals, in the restricted sections, describe dreams that began after his first voyage into the bay—dreams of shapes that taught him things, geometries that whispered instructions, a voice that wasn't a voice explaining what needed to be built and why. Tugon believed he was receiving divine revelation. He was receiving something, but "divine" isn't the right word.

The specifications for Tugon's Castle came from the Unfallen—transmitted through Tugon's dead hand, filtered through a mind that had crossed the sixty-foot threshold and returned changed. The castle is built to the Unfallen's geometry, using the Unfallen's stone (vothrakalin is not native to the Myjornis Mountains; it is a fragment of the Unfallen's body, surfaced through geological pressure millennia ago).

Whether the castle is meant to contain the Unfallen or awaken it is a matter of interpretation. The Nashua scholars believe it's a lock—that the Unfallen itself, in some pre-conscious way, recognized the danger it posed and guided Tugon to build a barrier. The more pessimistic view is that the castle is a beacon, a focusing lens, a way for the Unfallen to concentrate its influence until it can finally complete the death it started before death existed.

The final line of the specifications—"When it wakes, this will not be enough. Build more."—suggests that whoever or whatever wrote them expected the Unfallen to eventually overcome a single castle. No one has built more. No one knows where they would build them, or what shape they would take.

#### What Happens If It Spreads

The Unfallen cannot wake in the conventional sense. It has no consciousness to activate, no awareness to achieve. But it can *expand*.

Currently, the Unfallen's influence is contained to Raric Bay and a cone of ocean extending southwest. The sixty-foot threshold represents equilibrium—the point where its primordial death-template and Lyzaria's death-template reach equal strength. But that equilibrium isn't static. Every creature that dies in the bay adds mass to the Unfallen's pattern. Every fused soul-shadow-spirit that migrates toward its body strengthens its claim.

If the influence expands—if the castle fails, or if the castle was always meant to help it expand—the sixty-foot line would rise. Forty feet. Twenty feet. The surface. Then the shore. Eventually, the Unfallen's template would override Lyzaria's entirely. Astraeva would receive no more souls. Malstaris would receive no more shadows. Celestia would hold no more spirits. Everything that died would simply... continue. Fused. Unprocessed. Moving through existence without the release that death is supposed to provide.

The Vyko elves of Vykus have a prophecy about this. They call it the Stillness—a time when the planar machinery grinds to a halt, when Aurus and Nydus receive nothing, when the cycle of souls stops turning. They believe the Unfallen is a remnant of primordial Ezz that survived Azus's ordering of creation—a fragment of chaos that never accepted the rules the Planar Stack imposed. Its "death" wasn't death. It was *refusal*. And that refusal is slowly teaching reality that the current system is optional.

Yegnoth, they say, is another such wound. The black stone—vothrakalin—is the same substance: primordial matter that predates the separation of positive and negative energy. The Vyko have watched both sites for three thousand years. The patterns match. The math is identical. If they're right, Raric Bay and Yegnoth are not isolated problems. They're pressure points where Ezz is still pushing against the walls Azus built, trying to dissolve the order that makes death—and life—function the way they're supposed to.

### Sakatia

Tags: ruins, village, faewoods, old-tolaria

A ruined village of Old Tolaria, swallowed by the Faewoods when the forest erupted from nothing. Now half-consumed by impossible growth, it serves as a warning about what the Faewoods do to things that stay too long.

#### History

Sakatia was a small settlement on the outskirts of Old Tolaria's heartland—a farming village of perhaps two hundred souls, unremarkable in every way. When the Apparatus of Severance activated in Elderran, Sakatia was directly in the path of the exploding Faesong.

The villagers watched a forest grow around them in minutes. Trees burst from the ground beneath their feet. Vines crawled up walls faster than people could run. Some fled and survived. Some didn't flee fast enough. Some were simply... absorbed.

The village has been part of the Faewoods for centuries now, and the Faewoods have been slowly making it their own.

#### The Ruins Today

Finding Sakatia is difficult—the Faewoods don't keep consistent geography, and the village seems to move relative to the forest's edge. Those who do find it discover a settlement caught mid-transformation.

**The outer buildings** are almost unrecognizable—walls collapsed under the weight of growth, roofs burst open by trees growing through them, foundations cracked by root systems older than the ruin itself. These structures are more forest than building.

**The village center** is better preserved, though "preserved" is relative. Buildings still stand, but they're wrapped in vines, covered in moss, infiltrated by roots that have cracked stone and warped wood. Doorways lead into darkness choked with foliage. Windows frame views of nothing but green.

**The village well** stands at the center, miraculously clear. The Faewoods have not touched it. No one knows why. Drinking the water is probably a terrible idea, but the well itself seems to mark a boundary—a small circle of normalcy in the overwhelming growth.

#### The Absorbed

Not everyone escaped Sakatia. Some villagers were caught in the eruption—trapped, engulfed, incorporated into the forest's sudden growth. Their fate is visible throughout the ruins.

A face in the bark of a tree. A hand reaching from a root system. A silhouette visible in the grain of a massive trunk. They are not alive, exactly, but they're not entirely dead either. The Faesong preserved them, transformed them, made them part of the forest's existence.

Some visitors report hearing whispers near these absorbed figures—fragments of conversations from centuries ago, echoing through wood and leaf. Others report being watched by eyes that aren't there. Whether the absorbed are conscious, whether they can be freed, whether they want to be freed—no one has successfully determined.

#### Adventure Hooks

- **Recovery**: Something valuable was in Sakatia when it was swallowed—a family heirloom, a historical document, a magical item. The current owner wants it back. The Faewoods want to keep it.

- **The Absorbed**: A descendant of Sakatia's villagers believes their ancestor is still alive, incorporated into the forest, and wants to free them. Whether this is possible, and what the freed individual would be after centuries as a tree, is unknown.

- **The Clear Well**: Scholars want to know why the Faewoods haven't touched the village well. The answer might reveal something important about the Faesong's nature—or about what lies beneath the well.

- **Sanctuary**: Someone is using Sakatia as a hideout, exploiting the Faewoods' disorienting nature to avoid pursuit. Finding them means navigating a forest that actively resists navigation, then searching a ruin that's half plant-matter.

### Scar

Tags: dragon, creature

A brownish dragon laired in the Myjornis Mountains. Scar is named for the distinctive marking across its flank—whether from an old wound or natural coloration, none can say. The dragon is territorial but not particularly aggressive by draconic standards, content to extract tribute from travelers crossing the mountain passes rather than hunting them outright.

Scar's presence has shaped travel patterns through the Myjornis range for generations. Caravans factor "dragon tax" into their costs, and experienced guides know which routes are within Scar's claimed territory.

### Thunder Plains

Tags: plains

Named after the giants whose heavy footsteps give the plains its namesake. They herd the mammoths across the region and live off the land. Very hostile towards Gorath.

### Thunderdark Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography

A rugged mountain range in the eastern Inner Rim, home to the Strømgodden dwarves of Trømgar. The peaks are named for the violent thunderstorms that gather around them with eerie regularity—lightning flashes illuminate the dark granite ridges, and thunder echoes through the valleys like the war-drums of ancient gods.

#### Character

The Thunderdark Peaks are not Alaria's highest mountains, but they're among the most defensible. Sharp granite ridges, narrow passes, and deep gorges create natural chokepoints that channel any invading force into killing grounds. The Strømgodden have fortified these positions over generations, making the range essentially impregnable.

The peaks are rich in iron, copper, and the rare alloys that the Strømgodden use in their famous spiked armor. Mining operations have honeycombed the mountains, creating an extensive tunnel network that connects the fortress-cities underground and provides alternate routes when surface travel is blocked.

#### The Storms

The storms that give the range its name are both natural and something more. The peaks' elevation and position create atmospheric conditions that generate thunderstorms with unusual frequency—but the Strømgodden believe the gods of war send these storms as blessing and test.

Lightning strikes are common. The dwarves have learned to work with this, positioning metal structures to attract strikes toward defensive positions and away from settlements. Some Strømgodden warriors, called Storm-Riders, specifically train to fight during thunderstorms, using the chaos and lightning as tactical advantages.

#### Major Features

**Central Spine**: The highest peaks, running roughly north-south through the heart of the range. Levke, the capital, is carved into these mountains.

**Southern Foothills**: Where the peaks descend toward the Nashua marshlands. Kavnendal guards this approach; beyond lies contested territory.

**Eastern Slopes**: Descending toward the Duskwood Forest and eventually the coast. The terrain transitions from bare rock to forested hills before meeting the Croaking Briars.

**Northern Highlands**: Rising toward colder regions, with Traut as the northernmost settlement.

#### The Tunnel Network

Beneath the surface, the Thunderdark Peaks contain hundreds of miles of tunnels—mines, passages connecting fortress-cities, defensive positions, and older excavations whose origins predate Strømgodden settlement.

The dwarves maintain and patrol the upper tunnels, but the deepest levels are sealed. Something lives down there, in passages that connect to places no map shows. The Strømgodden have lost expeditions to those depths and learned to leave certain doors closed.

#### Wildlife

Mountain goats, snow bears, cliff-nesting raptors, and hardy mountain predators inhabit the peaks. Most avoid the fortress-cities; those that don't become training targets for young warriors.

The upper peaks host creatures found nowhere else—things adapted to the thin air, the lightning, and the cold. The Strømgodden hunt these beasts as tests of courage, and their pelts and bones are valued craft materials.

### Trømgar

Tags: region, mountains, dwarves

Stone, steel, and blood. Trømgar rises from the Thunderdark Peaks like a clenched fist—a nation of fortress-cities carved into mountainsides, inhabited by dwarves who have made warfare itself into religion. The Strømgodden do not merely fight; they worship through combat, offering every battle as sacrifice to their war-gods and measuring a life's worth by the glory of its ending.

Every settlement here is a fortress. Every citizen is a warrior. Every piece of armor bristles with spikes designed to turn the wearer's body into a weapon. The Strømgodden have held these mountains against lizardfolk from the south and whatever lurks in the briars to the east for generations, and they will hold them until the mountains themselves crumble—or until they die gloriously trying.

#### Overview

Trømgar occupies the Thunderdark Peaks in the eastern Inner Rim, a compact but fiercely defended territory roughly 200 miles across. The borders are defined by:
- **Southwest**: Nashua and the toxic marshlands of the Ix'Vasyla
- **East**: The Croaking Briars, a living thorn-barrier separating Trømgar from Phirexes
- **Southeast**: The Duskwood Forest and Whispering Mangroves, edge territories claimed but lightly held
- **North**: Highland wilderness stretching toward colder regions

The terrain is predominantly mountainous—steep peaks, deep valleys, and the carved fortress-settlements that make Trømgar nearly impossible to conquer. The eastern slopes descend into forested foothills before meeting the supernatural barriers of the Croaking Briars.

#### The Thunderdark Peaks

The mountain range that gives Trømgar its spine. The Thunderdark Peaks are not the highest mountains in Alaria, but they're among the most rugged—sharp granite ridges, narrow passes, and deep gorges that channel any invading force into killing grounds.

The name comes from the storms that gather around the peaks, thunder echoing through the valleys with such regularity that the Strømgodden consider it the war-drums of their gods. Lightning strikes are common; the dwarves have learned to use this, positioning metal structures to attract strikes away from settlements and toward defensive positions.

The mountains are rich in iron, copper, and the rare ores needed for Strømgodden armor-smithing. Mining operations honeycomb the peaks, providing both resources and an extensive tunnel network that connects the fortress-cities underground. An enemy who takes a surface position has accomplished nothing—the dwarves simply retreat into the tunnels and counterattack from unexpected directions.

#### Major Settlements

Every Strømgodden settlement is a fortress first and a city second. Architecture prioritizes defense: thick walls, multiple fallback positions, and integration with the tunnel network beneath.

##### Levke

The capital, carved into the heart of the central Thunderdark range. Levke is less a city than a mountain made habitable—halls cut deep into living rock, forges burning perpetually in the depths, and defensive positions that have never been breached.

The **Hall of Glorious Ends** dominates Levke's center, a vast chamber where the names and deeds of honored dead are carved into the walls. Every Strømgodden aspires to have their death recorded here—not their life, their *death*, because how one dies defines one's worth. The most spectacular, most sacrificial, most glorious endings receive the most elaborate carvings.

The **High Forge** of Levke produces the finest spiked armor in Trømgar, crafted by master smiths who have spent decades perfecting the art. A suit of Levke armor is a status symbol, a sacred object, and a lethal weapon all in one.

The ruling **Warcouncil** meets in Levke's deepest chambers, where decisions affecting all Trømgar are made by the most battle-proven leaders.

##### Andvik

South of Levke, Andvik guards the approaches from Nashua. This fortress-city has seen more combat than any other Strømgodden settlement, its walls scarred by generations of skirmishes with Ix'Vasyla raiders.

Andvik's warriors specialize in anti-lizardfolk tactics—fighting in the mountain passes where the cold-blooded Ix'Vasyla are at disadvantage, striking at dawn when the lizardfolk are sluggish, and maintaining the vigilance that has kept Nashua's forces from ever reaching Levke.

The city's **Venom-Scarred** regiment consists entirely of warriors who have survived Ix'Vasyla bites—a badge of honor that marks them as tested against Trømgar's most persistent enemy.

##### Kavnendal

The southernmost major settlement, positioned where the mountains give way to foothills. Kavnendal serves as Trømgar's forward operating base for offensive operations into Nashua territory—the staging point for raids that have been conducted, with ritualistic regularity, for generations.

Unlike the other fortress-cities, Kavnendal has significant surface construction—barracks, training grounds, and the facilities needed to support expeditionary forces. It's the most "normal" Strømgodden city, and also the most frequently attacked.

##### Traut

The northern outpost, positioned near the Croaking Briars. Traut watches the living thorn-barrier that separates Trømgar from Phirexes, though "watches" may be optimistic—the briars are effectively impassable, and no significant threat has emerged from that direction.

Traut's warriors have attempted to breach the Croaking Briars repeatedly, seeking glory in being first through. None have succeeded. The briars regenerate overnight, growing faster where blood is spilled, and the Strømgodden have learned that some obstacles cannot be overcome through fury alone.

The settlement maintains a wary relationship with the few traders who know safe passages through the briars—paths that change weekly and are never shared freely.

#### The Eastern Territories

Beyond the mountain core, Trømgar claims territory extending to the coast—though "claims" and "controls" are different things.

##### Duskwood Forest

A dense forest with permanent twilight beneath its canopy, technically within Trømgar's borders but practically ungoverned. The Strømgodden send occasional patrols but have little interest in forest territory. Their culture is stone and steel, not wood and shadow.

The Duskwood's valuable resources—bioluminescent fungi, medicinal mosses, rare flowers—are harvested by others, including Phirexan subjects operating under their queen's authority. This jurisdictional ambiguity has never quite risen to conflict, partly because the Strømgodden don't care enough about forest products to fight for them.

##### Whispering Mangroves

The coastal mangroves mark Trømgar's theoretical southeastern extent, though no Strømgodden settlement exists there. The mangroves are unsuitable for dwarven habitation—wet, confusing, and haunted by whispers that the superstitious find unsettling.

Smugglers and refugees use the mangroves as transit routes, moving between Phirexes and the open sea. The Strømgodden are vaguely aware of this traffic but consider it beneath their concern. Chasing humans through swamps is not how glory is won.

#### Rivers

Several rivers flow from the Thunderdark Peaks, fed by snowmelt and mountain springs. The largest flows east toward the coast, providing water for the lower settlements and eventually losing itself in the Duskwood and mangroves.

The rivers are not navigable in the mountain reaches—too many rapids, waterfalls, and narrow gorges. They serve primarily as water sources and, occasionally, as defensive obstacles.

#### The Croaking Briars

The living thorn-barrier separating Trømgar from Phirexes deserves special mention. This is not natural vegetation—the briars are responsive, aggressive, and seemingly intelligent. They grow toward warmth and blood, their hooked thorns designed to catch and hold.

The Strømgodden have attacked the briars many times, seeking passage to whatever lies beyond. Each assault fails. The briars regenerate overnight, growing thicker and more tangled where blood has been spilled. Older dwarves speak of a time before the briars existed, when traffic between the regions was possible, but that time is generations past.

Safe passages through the briars exist, but they shift weekly and are known only to those with local knowledge—traders, smugglers, and people who have made accommodations the Strømgodden consider dishonorable.

#### Climate and Conditions

The Thunderdark Peaks experience harsh mountain weather: cold winters, brief summers, and storms that roll through with little warning. The Strømgodden have adapted completely—their fortress-cities are designed to withstand any weather, their forges burn year-round for warmth, and they consider the harsh conditions part of what makes their people strong.

The lower elevations toward the coast are warmer and wetter, transitioning from mountain climate to the subtropical conditions of the Duskwood and mangroves. Few Strømgodden venture into these lowlands by choice.

#### For Adventurers

Trømgar offers opportunities for those who can earn Strømgodden respect—which means proving themselves in combat.

**The Nashua Front**: The endless war with the Ix'Vasyla always needs warriors. Outsiders who fight well against the lizardfolk earn grudging acceptance; those who die gloriously earn honor.

**The Briars**: Anyone who could find a reliable path through the Croaking Briars would become valuable indeed. The Strømgodden's failed attempts suggest that brute force won't work—but perhaps cunning might.

**The Tunnels**: The tunnel network beneath the Thunderdark Peaks extends further than any map shows. Old passages lead to old places—abandoned mines, forgotten holds, and things that have lived in darkness for a very long time.

**The Drasnian Question**: Trømgar's cold war with Gorath over the enslavement of Drasnian dwarves is heating up. Anyone willing to strike at Gorathi interests would find sympathetic ears in Levke—and the Strømgodden definition of "strike" tends toward the spectacular.

The Strømgodden don't trust outsiders easily. But they respect courage, honor combat prowess, and remember those who fight beside them. Prove yourself in battle, and doors open. Fail, and you're simply another soft lowlander who couldn't handle the mountains.

### Tugon's Castle

Tags: ruins, fortress, poi

A fortress in Raric Bay that has stood for six centuries despite being built by a man who died before laying the first stone.

#### Tugon's Commission

Tugon var Seleth was a merchant prince of the Shacklands who made his fortune in the slave trade, lost it in a shipwreck, and spent his final years obsessed with Raric Bay. His journals—held in Gorath's restricted archives—document seventeen voyages into the bay between 187 and 203 AR, each one deeper, each one longer, each one leaving him more convinced that something beneath the water was trying to communicate with him.

He drowned in 203 AR during his eighteenth voyage. His body was recovered from the sixty-foot line, eyes open, facing southwest.

His will, notarized three days before his death, commissioned the construction of "a fortress at the heart of Raric Bay, built to specifications that will be delivered posthumously." The specifications arrived at his architect's door two weeks after the funeral, written in Tugon's hand, the ink still wet.

The architect built it anyway. He was found dead four years later, facing southwest, having completed his work.

#### The Structure

Tugon's Castle rises from a natural rock formation at the bay's center, directly above the deepest concentration of bones on the seafloor. The fortress is built from black stone quarried in the Myjornis Mountains—the same glassy material found in Yegnoth's walls, though no one has explained how Tugon knew where to find it or how his workers survived extracting it.

The castle's layout follows no military logic. Doors open onto walls. Staircases lead to ceilings. Windows face inward, toward lightless interior chambers. The great hall's floor is a mosaic depicting Raric Bay as seen from above, with the bone-field rendered in white tiles and something at the southwest edge that the artist left deliberately incomplete—a shape suggested by negative space, defined by what isn't there.

The basement levels descend below the waterline. The first three are flooded but accessible. The fourth is sealed by a door of the same black stone as the walls, with no handle, no hinges, no visible mechanism. The door is warm to the touch. It vibrates at a frequency felt in the teeth rather than heard.

No one has opened it. Several have tried. Their tools broke. Their magic failed. One mage attempted to teleport past it and arrived on the other side in pieces—not cut, not torn, but *separated*, as if the spaces between his atoms had been gently widened until he was no longer contiguous.

#### The Preservation

Tugon's Castle does not decay. Salt water has surrounded it for six centuries, and the mortar is as sound as the day it was laid. The black stone shows no wear. The wooden doors—there are three, inexplicably preserved—are solid and free of rot.

More notably: the castle does not attract the death that pervades Raric Bay. Fish swim past its walls and remain alive. Birds nest in its towers without dying. The three ships that sank in the bay all went down within a mile of the castle, but their crews did not reach its stone. The castle seems to exist in a bubble of normalcy—or perhaps a bubble of *different* abnormality.

Scholars from Nashua theorize that the castle is a lock. The thing beneath Raric Bay is a door. Tugon's Castle sits on top of it, and as long as the castle stands, the door stays shut.

What the thing on the other side might be, why the bones face toward something southwest, and how a dead merchant knew to build the lock before he died—these questions have no answers.

#### The Garrison

Gorath maintains a small presence in Tugon's Castle: four soldiers rotated every thirty days, tasked with preventing unauthorized entry and documenting any changes. The posting is considered punishment duty. Soldiers who serve it report no supernatural experiences—the castle's bubble seems to protect them—but they universally describe a sense of *pressure*, as if something vast is leaning against the walls from below.

One guard, in a report that was meant to be routine, wrote: "The door in the basement is louder tonight. I think it's learning to speak."

He was reassigned to desk duty. He faced southwest when he slept for the rest of his life.

#### The Specifications

Tugon's posthumous instructions for the castle's construction have never been fully released. What's known: they were written in a language that doesn't match any known tongue, yet the architect understood them perfectly. They included mathematical formulae that, when examined by Nashua's theorists, described geometries that shouldn't exist in three-dimensional space. They specified the black stone by name: *vothrakalin*, "the bones of refusal."

The final page of the specifications was blank except for a single sentence in common trade tongue: "When it wakes, this will not be enough. Build more."

No one knows what Tugon meant. No more castles have been built.

### Valley of Echos

Tags: valley, geography

### Vykus

Tags: city, state, nation

A city-state in the Innerrim.

TODO

### Yegnoth

Tags: poi, landmark, megadungeon

A vertical shaft forty miles across, punched clean through the Myjornis Mountains into the earth below. The walls are smooth as glass—no ledges, no handholds, no erosion despite millennia of rain. Standing at the rim, the far side is lost in haze. The bottom has never been seen, though estimates based on dropped objects (and their failure to produce audible impact) suggest a depth of at least fifteen miles.

#### The Walls

The shaft walls aren't natural stone. They're a dark, glassy substance that resists all attempts at sampling—chisels skate off, picks shatter, and magic slides away like water off oil. The material is warm to the touch regardless of weather. At night, faint luminescent veins pulse deep within the glass, following patterns that repeat on a 23-day cycle matching Nyxara's orbit.

#### The Rim

A permanent updraft rises from Yegnoth, carrying warm air and an acrid mineral smell. The wind is strong enough to make approaching the edge dangerous—several expeditions have lost members to unexpected gusts. The rim itself is barren for a quarter-mile back; nothing grows in the thin soil, and animals avoid the area entirely.

Three watchtowers ring the pit at cardinal points, maintained by Gorath's military. The garrison rotates every thirty days. Soldiers who serve longer begin reporting shared nightmares—always the same dream of descending, of being welcomed, of finally understanding. The military doesn't discuss this publicly.

#### The Descent

At least a dozen expeditions have attempted to descend Yegnoth using magical flight, levitation, or elaborate rope-and-pulley systems. None have returned. Scrying spells fail below the rim. Sending spells reach their targets but receive no response. One expedition maintained a speaking stone connection for eleven hours of descent before transmission cut off mid-sentence. The last words recorded were "there are lights down here, thousands of—"

The Arcane Consortium of Nashua has placed a 50,000 gold bounty on verifiable information about Yegnoth's depths. It has gone unclaimed for two centuries.

#### Origin Theories

The Gorathi believe Yegnoth is a wound left by a god's spear thrust into the world during the God War. Academic circles in Nashua theorize it's a collapsed planar boundary—a place where reality wore thin and simply gave way. The Vyko elves of nearby Vykus have older stories: that Yegnoth was here before the mountains, that the Myjornis range grew around it like scar tissue around a splinter, that whatever made it is still down there, waiting with infinite patience.

The Vyko don't go near the rim. They've lived in these mountains for three thousand years. They know something.

### Zetl Hesk Rou

Tags: lake, giants-cradle, sacred-site, geography

"The Lake of Last Breath" in the giant tongue. A cold, impossibly deep lake in the western basin of Giants Cradle where giants come to die, walking into the dark water and never emerging.

#### Geography

Zetl Hesk Rou is the opposite of its sister lake in nearly every way. Where Zetl Heski Voth steams with geothermal warmth, Hesk Rou is cold—not freezing, but a deep, penetrating chill that seems to reach past flesh into bone. Where Voth is mineral-blue and clear, Hesk Rou is dark, its depths swallowing light.

The lake is roughly circular, perhaps two miles across, with shores of grey stone that slope steeply into the water. There are no shallows—the lake drops immediately to depth. No one has ever found the bottom. Weighted lines have been lowered for hundreds of feet without touching anything. Some divers have tried to explore; none have returned.

The surface is eerily still. Even strong winds rarely raise more than a gentle ripple. Sounds seem muted near the water—voices don't carry, footsteps are absorbed, even the wind sounds distant. Giants say the lake is always listening.

#### Significance

Giant tradition holds that the spirits of the dead return to the earth through Zetl Hesk Rou, completing the cycle that began when the Firstborn emerged from its sister lake. To walk into the Lake of Last Breath is to rejoin the stone from which giantkind was born.

Giants who feel death approaching make the pilgrimage to the Cradle. The journey itself is considered part of the dying—a final act of will, a last demonstration of giant strength. Those too weak to walk are sometimes carried by younger kin, but this is considered less honorable. To crawl the final miles on one's belly is preferable to being carried.

Upon arrival, the dying giant is received by the guardians, who prepare them for the final walk. There are rites, songs, and time for farewells if family has accompanied them. Then, at a moment of their choosing, the giant walks into the lake. They do not stop. They do not look back. They walk until the water closes over their head, and they do not emerge.

#### What Lies Below

No one knows what happens to giants who enter Zetl Hesk Rou. The bodies are never recovered—not floating, not washed ashore, not found by any means. The guardians believe the dead return to stone, their physical forms transformed back into the earth-stuff that made the Firstborn.

Scholars have proposed other explanations: underwater caves, chemical dissolution, magical transport to another plane. Some have suggested the lake is a mouth—that something below consumes the dead. The guardians find such speculation offensive and refuse to discuss it.

What is certain is that the lake accepts only the willing dead. On several occasions throughout history, murderers have tried to dispose of bodies in Hesk Rou. In each case, the bodies were found the next morning, lying on the shore, unmarked but very clearly rejected. The guardians consider this proof of the lake's sacred nature.

#### The Disturbance

Recently, something has changed.

Giants who enter Zetl Hesk Rou have begun coming back out.

They emerge from the water hours or days after they entered—walking out of the lake exactly as they walked in, but changed. They don't speak. They don't respond to their names or recognize their families. Their eyes are empty, fixed on something no one else can see. They move purposefully, walking away from the lake toward destinations only they know, and they do not stop for anything.

The guardians are deeply troubled. They have contained the returned dead within the Cradle so far, preventing them from leaving the valley, but they do not know what is causing this or how to stop it. They fear the lake itself has been corrupted—or that something has gotten into it.

They need help, but they are reluctant to involve outsiders in sacred giant matters. The situation grows worse with each giant who enters the lake, and the guardians are running out of options.

### Zetl Heski Voth

Tags: lake, giants-cradle, sacred-site, geography

"The Lake of First Breath" in the giant tongue. A geothermally-heated lake in the eastern basin of Giants Cradle where giant tradition holds the first of their kind emerged from the earth.

#### Geography

Zetl Heski Voth is fed by geothermal springs that keep its waters warm year-round, steaming in the cold mountain air of Giants Cradle. The lake is roughly oval, perhaps three miles across at its widest point, with a depth that varies significantly—shallow near the shores but dropping sharply toward the center where the thermal vents lie.

The water is clear but tinged slightly mineral-blue from dissolved minerals. It smells faintly of sulfur, though not unpleasantly so. The lake bottom is visible in the shallows, revealing smooth stones and the occasional glint of offerings left by pilgrims.

The shores are lined with smooth, heat-polished stones and low-growing vegetation that thrives in the warmth. Steam rises constantly from the surface, creating a perpetual mist that clings to the valley floor on cold mornings.

#### Significance

Giant creation myths hold that the first giant—called various names in different traditions, but most commonly "the Firstborn"—emerged from this lake in the earliest days of the world. The hot springs were the world's labor pains, and the Firstborn climbed from the mineral waters fully formed, the first of a race born from stone and heat.

Giants who can make the journey travel to Zetl Heski Voth to give birth, believing that children born in these waters carry a blessing: longer life, greater wisdom, and a connection to the ancestral spirits that other giants lack. The warm water also makes labor easier, which may be the tradition's practical origin.

Not all giant children are born here—the journey is long and difficult, especially for pregnant giants—but those who are carry a mark of distinction throughout their lives. They are called "Vothborn" and are often expected to become leaders, shamans, or guardians.

#### The Birthing Rites

When a pregnant giant arrives at the Cradle, she is received by the guardian giants and led to prepared shelters near the lake's shore. The final weeks of pregnancy are spent in meditation and preparation, attended by guardian midwives who have assisted hundreds of births.

Labor takes place in the shallows of the lake itself, surrounded by guardian giants who chant the old songs—hymns to the Firstborn, to the earth, to the continuity of giantkind. The child is delivered into the warm water and raised above the surface for their first breath, an echo of the Firstborn's emergence.

The afterbirth is offered to the lake. The mother rests in the warm shallows. The child is presented to the Voice of the Cradle, who speaks their name for the first time—a name chosen by the guardians based on signs and omens observed during the birth.

#### Current State

Zetl Heski Voth remains active and sacred. Giants still make the pilgrimage, though in smaller numbers than in ancient times. The guardian giants maintain the birthing shelters and perform the old rites with careful precision.

The lake itself shows no signs of diminishing—the geothermal activity that feeds it has continued unabated for as long as giants have recorded history. Some scholars suggest the thermal system extends deep into the earth, possibly connecting to volcanic activity far below. The guardians consider such speculation irrelevant; the lake is sacred regardless of its geology.

## Emerald Coast

### Geography

The Emerald Coast occupies the eastern seaboard of Rimihuica, a verdant strip of jungle and coastline running from south of Ofrenia all the way to Phirexes in the southeast. True to its name, this region is deep, lush green—dense rainforest benefiting from ocean moisture, creating fertile territory where life thrives in abundance.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Begins south of Ofrenia (the island in the Middle Sea), with Micah Inlet marking the northern coast and Swampdeep beyond
- **West**: The Myjornis Mountains and western highlands separate the coast from the Gulf of Tears region and the United Free Nations
- **South**: Extends to Phirexes (a misty swamp) and borders Kyagos (the mountainous southeastern peninsula) via the Cloud Mountains
- **East**: Faces the open ocean; the permanent storm Oblivion churns offshore to the northeast

#### Geographic Extent

The Emerald Coast stretches along the entire eastern shoreline of Rimihuica's jungle regions. It includes:
- The **Jungles of Godahi**: The great interior basin containing five distinct nations (Da Trang, New Chimea, Qet Yemani, Vystrilik, Eoga)
- The coastal portions of **New Chimea** and **Vystrilik**, states that span across the mountain divide from the Innerrim
- **Phirexes**: A misty, fog-shrouded swamp marking the southeastern extent of the coast, positioned north of the mountainous Kyagos peninsula

#### Major Mountain Ranges

- **Green Mountains**: Northern range separating the Jungles of Godahi from the Micah Inlet coast; filled with trolls and wyverns
- **Seawatch Mountains**: Interior range running through New Chimea, separating the coastal nation from the deep jungle
- **Tambrielle Mountains**: Southeastern range on the border of Vystrilik, containing passes to the Innerrim
- **Cloud Mountains**: Southern boundary separating Eoga from Phirexes and the routes to Kyagos
- **Myjornis Mountains**: Southwestern range marking the edge of the Emerald Coast region

#### Major Rivers

Three river systems drain the Jungles of Godahi:

- **Silver River**: Originates in the Green Mountains and flows south through Da Trang, cascading over the famous Cascades of Ygg before continuing into Qet Yemani. The primary trade artery for the western Jungles.
- **Vortek River**: Flows east through Vystrilik to the sea at Garum. The main route connecting the interior jungle to the eastern coast.
- **Elite Creek**: A secondary waterway winding through central Qet Yemani, connecting the Tora Mazîl forest to the broader river network.

#### Coastal Waters

- **Micah Inlet**: A large inlet on the northern coast, bounded by the Green Mountains to the south. The ports of Gherdikhisar, Kalemeydani, and Donokasi serve as Da Trang's connection to sea trade.
- **Sea of Seven Snakes**: The body of water between Phirexes and Kyagos/Gorath to the south
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm northeast of the coast, between the Middle Sea and open ocean. Anyone who enters forgets everything they know and sails out in confusion.

### Political Climate

The Emerald Coast is dominated by the five nations of the Jungles of Godahi, each controlling a portion of the interior basin:

- **New Chimea**: The most powerful, controlling the best harbors and the bulk of ocean trade
- **Vystrilik**: Strategic control of mountain passes gives it leverage over trans-regional commerce
- **Da Trang**: Controls the northern approaches and the routes through the Green Mountains
- **Qet Yemani**: Largest territory but mostly deep jungle; wealthy from timber and rare plants
- **Eoga**: The smallest and poorest, surviving through cunning and control of southern passes

Beyond the Jungles, **Phirexes** controls the southeastern swamps, maintaining an independent character distinct from the jungle nations.

### What Makes It Interesting

The Emerald Coast offers:
- **Political complexity**: Five nations in close proximity, constantly maneuvering for advantage
- **Treacherous terrain**: Dense jungle, vast swamps, and dangerous wildlife make travel an adventure
- **Valuable resources**: Rare hardwoods, exotic spices, medicinal plants, and the legendary Crystal Caverns
- **Cultural isolation**: Cut off by mountains and ocean, the Jungles have developed unique traditions

### What Will Go Wrong

TODO

### Notable Locations

#### Crystal Caverns

Deep beneath the coastal waters of the Emerald Coast lie the Crystal Caverns—submarine cave systems filled with brilliant, extraordinarily potent force-attuned crystals. These crystals pulse with concentrated magical energy, glowing with an inner light that illuminates the dark waters.

The crystals possess formidable powers of force magic, making them highly valuable to mages and artificers. However, they are also extremely volatile—when shattered, they release their stored energy in a massive explosion capable of collapsing entire cave sections or sinking ships above. Harvesting the crystals requires expert technique and extreme caution, as a single mistake can trigger a cascading chain reaction throughout the cavern system.

#### Cascades of Ygg

See [Jungles of Godahi](./Jungles%20of%20Godahi.md) for details on this sacred waterfall site.

#### Hell's Paradise

A notorious stretch of jungle between New Chimea and Vystrilik. See [New Chimea](./New%20Chimea.md) for details.

#### The Drift

A treacherous region of unstable terrain in Eoga. See [Eoga](./Eoga.md) for details.

### Crocodile Coast

Tags: coast, geography, emerald coast

The eastern shore of Phirexes, where the Whispering Mangroves give way to open water and the mists finally thin enough to see the horizon. The name is not metaphorical—the waters here teem with saltwater crocodiles of monstrous size, some fog-touched into something worse than mere predators, all of them hungry.

The Crocodile Coast is technically unclaimed territory. Queen Phendexelas considers it part of her domain but has never bothered to enforce control over waters that kill anyone who enters them. The jungle nations to the north avoid it. Even the pirates of the Sea of Seven Snakes give this coastline a wide berth. It is a no-man's-land of fog and scales and bones.

#### The Waters

The sea along the Crocodile Coast is shallow for miles out—a maze of sandbars, submerged rocks, and channels that shift with the tides. Navigation is treacherous even without the wildlife. Ships that run aground here are found months later as scattered timbers, their crews reduced to picked-clean skeletons tangled in the mangrove roots.

The crocodiles that give the coast its name range from merely enormous (fifteen feet, large enough to take a man whole) to fog-touched nightmares that defy natural law. Some have grown so large they're mistaken for sandbars until they move. Others have developed the ability to breathe fog, creating localized mist banks that blind their prey. A few are said to be intelligent—or at least cunning enough to coordinate attacks and remember the faces of those who've escaped them.

#### Shipwrecks and Salvage

The Crocodile Coast is a graveyard of ships. Vessels blown off course, smugglers who miscalculated the tides, would-be escapees from Phirexes who didn't know the waters—all of them end up here eventually. The wrecks pile up in the shallows, slowly sinking into the mud, their cargoes rotting or rusting or sometimes perfectly preserved by the salt and fog.

Salvage operations are theoretically possible. The wrecks contain trade goods, weapons, occasionally treasures from distant lands. But any salvage attempt must contend with the crocodiles, the shifting channels, and the fog that rolls in without warning. Those who've successfully salvaged from the Crocodile Coast speak of it in the same tone soldiers use for survived battles.

#### The Smuggler's Routes

Despite the danger—or because of it—the Crocodile Coast is the only reliable way to move goods in and out of Phirexes without the queen's knowledge. A network of smugglers, mostly operating from Vystrilik and the Greenwater Isles, have mapped passages through the waters that are merely suicidal rather than certain death.

These smugglers supply the Dengar refugees hiding in Old One's Wood with medicine, food, and news of the outside world. They also extract the occasional escapee who's made it through the Whispering Mangroves—usually sick with fog-binding withdrawal, always traumatized, but alive. The smugglers charge exorbitant fees, but they're the only game in town.

The routes change constantly. What was safe passage last month might be a crocodile breeding ground this month. The smugglers maintain their knowledge through a combination of magical scrying, bribed spirits, and sheer bloody-minded experience. They lose ships regularly. They keep coming back because the profits are worth it, and because some of them have personal reasons to hate Queen Phendexelas.

#### The Bone Beaches

Along certain stretches of the coast, the tides wash up the remains of the crocodiles' meals—bones picked clean and bleached white by sun and salt. These bone beaches are eerie landscapes of skulls and ribcages, the remains of animals, monsters, and people alike jumbled together in drifts that can reach waist-height.

The Dengar consider the bone beaches sacred in a grim sort of way. Before the queen came, they would make pilgrimages here to honor those taken by the sea. Now, the beaches are where refugees sometimes hold funerals for those who didn't survive the escape attempt—burning effigies when they have no bodies to bury.

Some say the bones whisper at night, adding their voices to the Whispering Mangroves' chorus. Others say that's just the wind through empty skulls. The distinction may not matter.

### Da Trang

Tags: state, nation

Da Trang controls the northern reaches of the Jungles of Godahi, a territory defined by its position between the Green Mountains and the deeper jungle to the south. The nation commands the jungle interior and the vital mountain passes connecting the Godahi basin to the coastal settlements around Micah Inlet.

#### Geography

Da Trang's territory stretches roughly 80 miles east to west and 70 miles north to south. Its defining features:

- **North**: The Green Mountains form Da Trang's northern boundary, rising dramatically from the jungle floor
- **West**: Borders Qet Yemani, where the Darkwater Swamp lies just across the frontier
- **East**: Shares a border with New Chimea, meeting at the Hell's Paradise region
- **South**: The jungle continues into the territories of Qet Yemani and Vystrilik

The **Nuodyak River** flows south through the heart of Da Trang, providing the primary route through the dense jungle interior. This river is Da Trang's lifeline—nearly all settlements cluster along its banks or tributaries.

#### Green Mountains

The Green Mountains rise 6,000-8,000 feet along Da Trang's northern frontier, forming a natural wall between the jungle basin and the coastal lowlands around Micah Inlet. Despite their name (derived from the dense vegetation on their lower slopes), the higher peaks are bare granite, often shrouded in clouds.

The mountains are notorious for their dangerous inhabitants. **Trolls** lair in the caves and ravines, emerging at night to hunt. **Wyverns** nest on the upper cliffs, and their territorial flights are a constant hazard for travelers. The mountain passes are few and well-guarded—controlling them gives Da Trang significant leverage over trade between the coast and the interior.

#### Major Settlements

##### Tunrrus

A fortified town in the northern jungle, positioned near the approaches to the Green Mountain passes. Tunrrus serves as Da Trang's gateway to the north—caravans heading to or from the coastal regions gather here before attempting the mountain crossing. The town maintains a garrison experienced in mountain warfare and troll-hunting.

##### Gjetlak

A settlement on the upper Nuodyak River, Gjetlak functions as a waypoint between Tunrrus and the interior. The town handles the first sorting of goods coming up from the south before they continue toward the mountain passes.

##### Tygoss

A mountain settlement in the Green Mountains themselves, Tygoss occupies a defensible position along one of the main passes. The town is smaller and harsher than the lowland settlements, home to miners, hunters, and the soldiers who guard the pass. Tygoss has a reputation for independence—the mountain folk here consider themselves Da Trang citizens only when convenient.

##### Nyuonaw

The largest settlement in Da Trang, Nyuonaw sits in a clearing in the central jungle along the Nuodyak. The town serves as the administrative center of the nation, where Da Trang's rulers hold court. Nyuonaw is more refined than the frontier settlements, with stone buildings and established institutions.

##### Evurcluuh

A southern town on the lower Nuodyak, near Da Trang's borders with Qet Yemani and New Chimea. Evurcluuh is a crossroads settlement, handling traffic between the three nations. The town has a mixed population and a reputation for neutral ground where traders from rival nations can meet.

#### Relations with the Coast

The settlements north of the Green Mountains—Gherdikhisar, Kalemeydani, and others along Micah Inlet—are not part of Da Trang proper. While Da Trang controls the passes and extracts tolls from trade, the coastal towns maintain their own governance. This arrangement creates tension: the coast depends on mountain trade but resents Da Trang's tariffs, while Da Trang covets direct sea access but lacks the strength to hold territory beyond the mountains.

### Eoga

Tags: state, nation

Eoga controls the southern reaches of the Jungles of Godahi, a territory defined by its wetlands and its position at the edge of the mountain barriers. Of the five jungle nations, Eoga is the most isolated—hemmed in by the Cloud Mountains to the south and surrounded by the territories of larger, more powerful neighbors. This isolation has bred a fiercely independent culture and a reputation for treachery.

#### Geography

Eoga's territory extends roughly 80 miles east to west and 70 miles north to south. Much of this area is marginal land—swamps, marshes, and jungle too wet for easy settlement:

- **North**: Borders Qet Yemani through the Jungles of Godahi
- **East**: Borders Vystrilik
- **South**: The Cloud Mountains rise abruptly from the jungle floor
- **West**: The Misty Marsh and The Drift dominate the western territory

The **Ellis Cozwa** river winds through Eoga, providing the primary water route through the territory.

#### Misty Marsh

A vast expanse of shallow water, reed beds, and floating vegetation in western Eoga. The marsh is perpetually shrouded in fog—warm water meeting cooler air creates mist that rarely lifts completely, even at midday. Visibility is often less than 100 feet.

The Misty Marsh is not impassable, but travel requires specialized knowledge. A network of channels connects scattered dry hummocks where small communities survive on fishing, trapping, and harvesting marsh plants. These marsh-dwellers navigate by sound, smell, and an intimate knowledge of the waterways impossible for outsiders to replicate.

The marsh is home to dangerous fauna—giant leeches, poisonous frogs, water serpents, and worse things that hunt in the fog. It also harbors fugitives from all the jungle nations, who disappear into its channels and are never seen again.

#### The Drift

The most treacherous terrain in the Jungles of Godahi. The Drift is not a swamp in the traditional sense but a region where the land itself seems unstable—floating islands of matted vegetation drift on deeper water, channels appear and disappear, and the boundary between solid ground and drowning-depth liquid is impossible to determine.

The Drift earned its name from the constant motion of its surface. A path that exists in the morning may be gone by afternoon. Travelers who survive the crossing describe a surreal landscape where the horizon shifts and the ground moves beneath their feet.

Despite its dangers, The Drift must be crossed to reach certain passes through the Cloud Mountains. Those seeking to travel south have few alternatives—the routes around The Drift add weeks to the journey.

#### Cloud Mountains

The Cloud Mountains form Eoga's southern boundary, rising 8,000-10,000 feet in a dramatic escarpment. The range is named for the perpetual cloud cover that blankets its peaks—moisture from the jungle below condenses as it rises, creating an environment of constant rain and fog.

The mountains contain passes leading to:
- **Phirexes**: The swamp-nation to the southeast
- **Kyagos**: The mountainous peninsula far to the south

These passes are high, cold, and dangerous, crossing through terrain utterly different from the jungle below.

#### Major Settlements

##### Dylania

The capital and largest city in Eoga. Dylania occupies one of the few large areas of solid ground in the nation, a rocky outcrop rising above the southern jungle near the Cloud Mountain foothills. The city is built vertically, climbing the slopes of its foundation rock in tiers of wooden buildings connected by stairs and rope bridges.

Dylania controls access to the Cloud Mountain passes and extracts tolls from all traffic heading south. This geographic chokepoint is the primary source of Eoga's revenue and political relevance.

##### Eddletress

A northern settlement near the border with Qet Yemani. Eddletress serves as Eoga's gateway to the other jungle nations, handling trade and traffic coming from the north.

##### Gozwana

A town in northern Eoga along the Ellis Cozwa river. Gozwana is positioned where the river enters Eoga's territory, making it a natural waypoint for river traffic.

##### Lyfus

A central-western settlement at the edge of the Misty Marsh. Lyfus serves the marsh communities and handles the unique products harvested from the wetlands—fish, marsh plants, and goods that can only be found in the fog-shrouded waters.

#### Political Character

Eoga's rulers have a reputation across the Jungles for duplicity. Surrounded by more powerful neighbors and controlling land that others consider worthless, Eoga has survived through cunning rather than strength. The nation frequently plays its neighbors against each other, sells information to all sides, and breaks agreements when advantageous.

This reputation is partly deserved and partly cultivated—Eoga's leaders find it useful when others expect treachery. A nation everyone distrusts is a nation no one bothers to conquer.

### Gulf of Tears

Tags: sea, bay, geography, emerald coast

The body of water separating Phirexes from the broader Emerald Coast region to the northwest, where the Sweet Water River empties into the sea and the fogs of the swamp finally release their hold. The gulf is named for the tears of Dengar refugees who have made it this far—close enough to smell freedom, to see the fog-free horizons—only to realize they cannot go further.

#### The Fog Line

The most striking feature of the Gulf of Tears is where the fog ends. Sailing northwest from Phirexes, there comes a point—usually about five miles from shore, though it varies with the queen's moods—where the mist simply stops. One moment you're in the perpetual grey; the next, you can see blue sky and distant shores.

For those without fog-binding, this is merely a geographical curiosity. For the Dengar who've lived in Phirexes long enough, it's a wall more impenetrable than any stone. The fog-binding sickness hits hard at the boundary. Symptoms that were manageable in the mist become unbearable in clear air: splitting headaches, vertigo so severe victims cannot stand, a bone-deep wrongness that only grows worse with distance.

Most refugees who make it to the fog line turn back. They have no choice. The few who push through—powered by desperation, medication, or sheer stubborn will—often collapse on the other side and have to be carried the rest of the way by smugglers. Some don't survive the crossing. Their bodies are typically found washed up on the bone beaches, having drifted back toward the land that killed them.

#### Waters and Currents

The gulf itself is unremarkable by Emerald Coast standards—warm tropical waters, moderate depths, seasonal storms that can turn nasty but rarely catastrophic. The currents flow generally northward along the coast, which makes escape from Phirexes slightly easier (sailing with the current) and return slightly harder (sailing against it).

The Sweet Water River's outflow creates a freshwater lens near the shore, where the river water floats atop the denser seawater. This layered zone has unusual properties—the fog seems to have trouble maintaining coherence here, and some refugees report that swimming in the mixed waters eases their withdrawal symptoms. Whether this is true or merely wishful thinking, the river mouth has become a gathering point for those trying to build up tolerance before attempting the crossing.

#### The Watching Ships

Queen Phendexelas cannot control the gulf, but she can watch it. Her agents maintain a small fleet of shallow-draft vessels that patrol the waters, officially to "protect Dengar travelers from the dangers of the sea." In practice, they intercept anyone trying to leave and escort them firmly back to Maurevelious.

The watching ships don't pursue past the fog line—their crews are fog-bound too, and the queen won't risk losing them. But within the mist, they're relentless. They know the waters, they know the smuggler routes, and they have standing orders to sink any vessel that refuses to heave to.

The smugglers play a constant cat-and-mouse game with the watching ships, using the fog itself as cover, timing their runs for when the patrols are elsewhere, occasionally sacrificing a decoy vessel to draw pursuit away from the real cargo. It's dangerous work, but the alternative—leaving the refugees without supply lines—is unthinkable.

#### The Name

"Gulf of Tears" is a Dengar name, predating the queen by centuries. The original meaning has been lost—perhaps it referred to some ancient tragedy, some long-forgotten sorrow. But the modern Dengar have reinterpreted it. They say the gulf is fed by the tears of everyone who's ever had to choose between freedom and life, between escape and survival.

The refugees who gather at the river mouth, working up courage for the crossing they might not survive, say you can taste salt in the water that isn't from the sea.

### Jungles of Godahi

Tags: jungle, region, geography

The Jungles of Godahi form the vast interior basin of the northern Emerald Coast—a sea of green canopy stretching roughly 300 miles east to west and 200 miles north to south. This is the heart of jungle civilization on Rimihuica's eastern seaboard, home to five distinct nations that have carved domains from the endless green.

#### Geography

The Jungles occupy a natural basin bounded by mountain ranges on three sides:
- **North**: The Green Mountains separate the jungle interior from the coastal lowlands around Micah Inlet
- **Southeast**: The Tambrielle Mountains mark the boundary with the coastal territories
- **Southwest**: The Cloud Mountains and Mylornir Mountains define the southern and western edges

The basin drains through several river systems: the **Nuodyak River** flowing through Da Trang, the **Vorlek River** and **Siber River** running through Vystrilik and New Chimea toward the coast, the **Hekat River** draining western Qet Yemani, and the **Ellis Cozwa** winding through Eoga.

#### Climate and Terrain

The jungle receives abundant rainfall from ocean moisture carried over the eastern mountains. The canopy is dense and multi-layered, with emergent trees reaching 150 feet or more. Visibility at ground level rarely exceeds 50 feet except along rivers and in cultivated clearings.

Scattered throughout the jungle are extensive marshlands where drainage is poor—the Dreamroot Marsh, Darkwater Swamp, Deadwood Swamp, and Misty Marsh being the largest. These wetlands are often more dangerous than the jungle itself.

#### The Five Nations

The Jungles of Godahi are divided among five states, each controlling a portion of the basin:

- **Da Trang** (north): Controls the northern jungle and the approaches to the Green Mountains
- **Qet Yemani** (west): The largest territory, encompassing the Tora Mazîl forest and the western swamplands
- **New Chimea** (northeast): A coastal power with territory extending from the jungle to the eastern sea
- **Vystrilik** (east): Controls the eastern interior and access to the Tambrielle Mountain passes
- **Eoga** (south): The southern reaches, including the Misty Marsh and the treacherous Drift

#### Cascades of Ygg

The most sacred site in the Jungles—a series of massive waterfalls where the Silver River drops over 400 feet in a series of cascades before entering the lowland jungle. The falls mark the traditional boundary between Da Trang and Qet Yemani. Ancient shrines dot the cliffsides, and the spray creates a perpetual rainbow visible for miles. Pilgrims from all five nations travel here, and by ancient compact, no army may approach within ten miles.

#### Travel and Trade

Overland travel through the Jungles is arduous—thick undergrowth, dangerous fauna, and hostile terrain slow even experienced jungle travelers to 10-15 miles per day. The rivers serve as the primary highways, with canoe and barge traffic carrying most goods between the nations.

The jungle produces valuable exports: rare hardwoods, exotic spices, medicinal plants, dyes, and jungle animal products (feathers, pelts, venoms). These flow down the rivers to coastal ports and onward to markets across Alaria.

### New Chimea

Tags: state, nation

New Chimea occupies the northeastern corner of the Jungles of Godahi, unique among the five jungle nations for its extensive coastline and direct access to ocean trade. The nation spans the Seawatch Mountains, with settlements scattered across both the jungle interior and the coastal lowlands.

#### Geography

New Chimea's territory covers roughly 120 miles of coastline and extends 80 miles inland across the Seawatch Mountains. Its position gives it natural advantages:

- **North**: Coastal territory and the Green Mountains (shared with Da Trang)
- **West**: Jungle border with Da Trang
- **Southwest**: Borders Vystrilik at Hell's Paradise
- **South**: Shares the Smokestack volcano with Vystrilik
- **East**: The open ocean, with rich fishing grounds and sea trade routes

The **Seawatch Mountains** form the spine of New Chimea, running roughly north-south through the nation. Unlike most jungle nations confined to lowlands, New Chimea's settlements spread across these mountains.

The **Siber River** marks part of New Chimea's southwestern boundary.

#### Seawatch Mountains

A substantial mountain range running through the heart of New Chimea, the Seawatch Mountains rise 4,000-6,000 feet above the coastal plain. The range earned its name from the watchtowers and signal stations built along its peaks, allowing rapid communication between the coast and interior.

The mountains are heavily settled compared to other ranges in the region. Fertile valleys, defensible positions, and mineral resources have drawn population into the highlands. Trails and passes crisscross the range, connecting the coastal settlements to the jungle interior.

#### Smokestack

The volcanic peak at New Chimea's southern border, shared with Vystrilik. Smokestack perpetually vents steam and sulfurous gases—on clear days, the plume is visible from 50 miles at sea, serving as a navigation landmark for ships approaching the coast.

The volcano is active but not violently so—minor eruptions occur every few decades, producing lava flows that rarely threaten settled areas. The volcanic soil in the surrounding lowlands is extraordinarily fertile. A settlement of the same name clings to the mountain's slopes, processing sulfur and volcanic minerals.

#### Hell's Paradise

A notorious stretch of jungle at New Chimea's southwestern border with Vystrilik. The region earned its name from the combination of exceptional natural beauty and extreme danger—crystalline streams, flowering trees, and abundant wildlife exist alongside venomous creatures, carnivorous plants, and quicksand bogs. Travelers who survive the crossing speak of it as the most beautiful and terrifying landscape in the Jungles.

#### Major Settlements

##### Coastal Settlements

###### New Chimus

The capital and largest city in New Chimea, built around a natural harbor on the eastern coast. New Chimus is the commercial heart of the entire Emerald Coast—goods from all five jungle nations eventually flow through its markets and docks. The city sprawls along the waterfront, with older stone buildings near the harbor giving way to wooden structures as you move inland.

The harbor can accommodate ocean-going vessels, making New Chimus the primary point of contact between the Jungles of Godahi and the wider world. Merchants from across Alaria maintain trading houses here.

###### Cayor

A coastal settlement south of New Chimus. Cayor serves fishing communities and handles overflow trade from the capital.

###### Greenhook

A northern coastal town, positioned where a hooked peninsula provides natural harbor shelter. Greenhook handles coastal traffic from the north.

###### Blorvus

The northernmost coastal settlement, near where New Chimea's territory meets the open sea. Blorvus serves as a waypoint for ships traveling along the coast.

##### Mountain Settlements

###### Meddleton

A central town in the Seawatch Mountains, positioned at a major crossroads where several mountain trails converge. Meddleton is the commercial hub of the highlands.

###### Domri's Pass

A settlement controlling one of the primary passes through the Seawatch Mountains. Domri's Pass handles traffic moving between the coast and the jungle interior.

###### Widdleto

A northern mountain town in the upper Seawatch range. Widdleto serves mining operations and highland communities.

###### Bumla

A northwestern settlement in the foothills where the Seawatch Mountains meet the Green Mountains. Bumla watches the approaches from Da Trang.

###### Firstiddle

An eastern mountain town on the coastal side of the Seawatch range, serving as a waypoint between the highlands and the coast.

##### Interior Settlements

###### Oswald

A western settlement in the jungle lowlands, near the border with Da Trang and Vystrilik. Oswald handles trade coming from the other jungle nations.

###### Daphnia

A southern town near the Smokestack volcano. Daphnia processes volcanic minerals and jungle products, with a rougher, more industrial character than the coastal settlements.

###### Smokestack

A settlement on the slopes of the Smokestack volcano, specializing in sulfur extraction and mineral processing. The town serves as a waystation for travelers crossing between New Chimea and Vystrilik.

### Phirexes

Tags: state, nation, swamp, emerald coast

A fog-shrouded swampland at the southeastern edge of the Emerald Coast, Phirexes is a place of creeping dread disguised as salvation. For sixty years, the gorgon queen Phendexelas the Beautiful has ruled over the Dengar halflings from her city of Maurevelious, having "saved" them from a catastrophe she herself created. The perpetual fogs that blanket the marshes don't just obscure vision—they bind those who stay too long, creating a magical dependency that makes escape nearly impossible.

The landscape is a maze of stagnant pools, thorn-choked wetlands, and forests where the trees seem to watch. What was once a dangerous but livable swamp has become something worse: a prison without walls, where the inmates thank their jailer nightly for keeping them safe from the horrors she unleashed.

#### The Fogs

The defining feature of Phirexes is not its swamps but its mists. The Fogs of Phirexes are semi-sentient, responding to Queen Phendexelas's mood and will. On days when she is pleased, they thin to a silvery haze through which the pale sun occasionally breaks. When she is angry, they thicken until visibility drops to arm's length and the air itself seems to press against the skin.

The Dengar have developed an elaborate system of reading fog density to predict royal temperament. Thick fog on a festival day means cancelled celebrations. Thin fog before the queen's nightly walk means she may be feeling generous. Children learn fog-reading before they learn to swim.

But the fogs do more than obscure. Prolonged exposure—months, then years—creates a dependency that the Dengar call "fog-binding." Those who have lived in Phirexes long enough cannot leave for extended periods without suffering withdrawal: disorientation, memory gaps, a creeping paranoia that the swamp is calling them back. The fog becomes a need, like water or air. This is the queen's true hold over her subjects—not fear of her gaze, but the simple biological fact that they can no longer survive without her mists.

#### Misty Marshes

The heartland of Phirexes, a vast expanse of fog-shrouded wetland stretching from the Croaking Briars in the west to the Crocodile Coast in the east. The marshes are not uniform—some areas are relatively solid ground covered in pale grasses, others are treacherous bogs that can swallow a person in minutes. The Dengar have mapped safe paths through generations of trial and fatal error, but the fogs make navigation treacherous even for natives.

The wildlife here has adapted to the perpetual mist. Insects grow large and slow, their compound eyes useless in the murk. Fish have developed lateral lines so sensitive they can navigate by pressure changes alone. The birds have mostly fled or died; those that remain are silent, having learned that calls attract predators they cannot see coming.

##### Cragwood Swamp

The poisoned heart of the Misty Marshes, where the catastrophe began. When Phendexelas first arrived and the fogs descended, this is where the swamp beasts went mad. Now, sixty years later, Cragwood is a nightmare zone that even the queen approaches with caution.

The creatures here are fog-touched—warped by decades of concentrated exposure into something between animal and aberration. Fog Crocodiles breathe mist instead of air and can phase partially through solid matter, their jaws materializing inside a victim's chest. Marsh Stalkers were once deer-like grazers; now they hunt in packs on too many legs, fog leaking from eyes that glow with dim intelligence. And in the deepest pools lurk the Old Ones—what the swamp's apex predators became when the madness took them. Massive, patient, and intelligent in ways they should not be, the Old Ones remember what they were before and hate what they've become.

The queen built Maurevelious deliberately close to Cragwood's edge. She wants her subjects to see the horrors beyond the walls, to understand viscerally what waits for them outside her protection. Occasionally, she sends dissidents into Cragwood for "meditation." None have returned sane.

##### Groaning Creek

A waterway that winds through the northern Misty Marshes, named for the constant low groan that emanates from its waters. The Dengar insist this is merely wind through hollow reeds, but the groan grows louder when the fogs thicken, and sometimes—especially on Hollownights when both moons are dark—it sounds almost like words.

The creek's source has never been found. It emerges from the fog fully formed, groaning, and flows southeast toward Cragwood before disappearing into the marshes. Some refugees claim the creek is trying to warn them about something. Others say it's mourning. The queen has forbidden any organized expedition to find its source.

##### Hag's Pasture

A clearing in the northern marshes where nothing grows but pale, knee-high grass that sways even when there's no wind. The fog is thinner here—not absent, but reduced, as if something else has claimed this territory and the queen's power cannot fully penetrate it.

The name comes from old Dengar legend: hags supposedly tend this "pasture" for livestock no one has ever seen. The grass is always cropped short, as if grazed, but no animal tracks mark the soft earth. Sometimes, at night, lights bob in the distance—too steady for will-o'-wisps, too purposeful for swamp gas.

The Dengar avoid Hag's Pasture. Even the queen's soldiers won't camp here. Whatever arrangement exists between Phendexelas and the pasture's owners, it is not spoken of.

#### Maurevelious

The capital of Phirexes rises from the swamp on stilts and floating platforms, a city that seems grown rather than built. Queen Phendexelas constructed it in a single impossible year after her arrival, and the architecture reflects her alien aesthetics: organic curves, living wood that still grows and must be trimmed like hedges, windows of smoky glass that seem to watch passersby. The streets are raised boardwalks connecting platform-neighborhoods, and beneath them the swamp water laps eternally at the foundations.

Thirty thousand Dengar live here, the vast majority of Phirexes' population. They are not slaves—they own businesses, raise families, practice their ancestral craft of swamp alchemy. But they are not free either. The Fog Gates at each city entrance "recognize" those who have lived here long enough; attempting to leave triggers the fog-binding sickness. And every evening, without exception, they line the Queen's Walk to prostrate themselves before their savior.

The Dengar's cultural philosophy—"the worse it gets, the better it was"—has curdled here into something like mass Stockholm syndrome. They survived the catastrophe, so this must be good. They have homes and work, so they should be grateful. The worse life was before the queen saved them, the better life is now by comparison. This self-gaslighting is the queen's most insidious weapon; she barely needs to oppress them when their own culture does it for her.

##### The Queen's Walk

A raised boardwalk of polished blackwood that circuits the city's central district. Every evening at dusk, Queen Phendexelas emerges from her palace and walks this path, her gorgon form draped in silks that hide everything but her beautiful, terrible face. The citizens line the walk, kneeling with heads bowed—to look upon her directly is death, but more than that, it would be ungrateful.

She speaks to them as she walks, her voice carrying supernaturally to every ear. She tells them how much she loves them. How hard she works to keep them safe. How the fogs are a blessing, not a curse. By the end of her circuit, many are weeping with devotion.

Those who fail to attend the Queen's Walk are noted. Those who fail repeatedly are visited.

##### The Cauldron District

The industrial heart of Maurevelious, where the Dengar practice their ancestral art of swamp alchemy. Hundreds of still-houses crowd this district, their copper pipes and glass vessels gleaming through the fog. The air here smells of fermentation, sulfur, and stranger things.

The Dengar produce medicines that no other culture can match—salves that cure infections, elixirs that dull pain, compounds that can purge poisons from the blood. They also produce "swamp spirits," a violently alcoholic brew that doubles as paint stripper, wound cleanser, and (according to the Dengar) a perfectly acceptable breakfast drink. These exports are Phirexes' primary source of outside wealth.

The queen controls this district carefully. All rare ingredients must be harvested with her permission, and her agents monitor what the alchemists produce. Any formula that might counteract fog-binding is immediately confiscated, and its creator disappears.

##### The Gratitude Plaza

The central square of Maurevelious, dominated by a statue of Queen Phendexelas in her most benevolent aspect—arms spread wide, face serene, as if embracing the entire city. Public thanksgivings are held here weekly, mandatory assemblies where citizens compete to express their devotion most eloquently.

The plaza's stones are etched with the names of the "Remembered"—Dengar who died in the catastrophe before the queen built the city. It is presented as a memorial. The refugees outside the walls know the truth: many of those names belong to people the queen killed herself, dissidents erased and rewritten as martyrs.

##### The Fog Gates

At each entrance to Maurevelious stands a gate of twisted iron and living wood, wreathed in concentrated fog. These are not merely checkpoints—they are magical constructs that sense the fog-binding in those who pass through. Citizens may come and go freely for short trips, but attempting to leave permanently triggers the gates' true purpose: they mark the would-be escapee, ensuring the fog-binding sickness strikes with full force within hours.

Some have tried to destroy the gates. The fog simply flows around the damage and rebuilds them overnight. Some have tried to sneak past. The gates have no guards because they need none—they see through the fog itself.

#### Old One's Wood

A primordial forest in southern Phirexes that predates the fogs by millennia. The trees here are ancient beyond reckoning, their trunks wider than houses, their canopy so thick that perpetual twilight reigns below. The Dengar called it Old One's Wood long before Phendexelas arrived, named for the spirits and creatures that dwelt here—beings the halflings negotiated with carefully, offering respect in exchange for safe passage.

When the fogs came, Old One's Wood changed differently than the rest of Phirexes. It did not go mad like Cragwood. It became *calculating*. Trees that move when you're not looking, repositioning themselves to close off paths or open new ones. Roots that trip those the forest dislikes and steady those it favors. Something in the heart of the wood—no one knows what—has made a decision about the queen, and that decision was hatred.

Phendexelas has never been able to subjugate Old One's Wood. Her fogs penetrate it but do not control it; her creatures enter but do not return. This is where the Dengar refugees hide—the few hundred who escaped Maurevelious and refused to return. The forest tolerates them because they share a common enemy.

The refugees live in camps scattered through the wood, moving frequently, sustained by the Sweet Water River that flows along the forest's edge. They are sick, all of them—the fog-binding withdrawal is a constant companion—but they endure. Some say they've found ways to manage the sickness using the forest's own plants. Others say the forest itself is healing them, slowly, as payment for their defiance.

#### Grove of Migwam

"Migwam" in the old Dengar tongue means "grandmother" or "wise mother." Before the queen came, this grove in the northern reaches of Old One's Wood was the Dengar's holiest site—a ring of ancient grandmother-trees where ancestors' ashes were scattered and their spirits were said to linger. Dengar would make pilgrimages here to seek guidance, and the ancestors would answer through rustling leaves and prophetic dreams.

Now the queen has claimed the grove as a shrine to herself. She visits monthly, performing rituals she claims channel the ancestors' blessing upon her reign. The grandmother-trees have been hung with silk banners bearing her image, and an altar of white stone stands at the grove's center where she receives "the ancestors' wisdom."

But the ancestors have gone silent. Since the fogs came, no pilgrim has received a true vision at Migwam. The leaves do not rustle with messages. The dreams are empty. The refugees believe the ancestors have withdrawn in disgust—or that the queen's presence has driven them away entirely. Some fear something worse: that the fogs have trapped the ancestors too, binding them as they bind the living.

#### Sweetwoods

The northernmost forest in Phirexes, a relatively mundane woodland of sweetgum and cypress that provides most of Maurevelious's timber. Dengar woodcutters work here in rotating crews, harvesting lumber for construction and fuel.

"Relatively mundane" is a low bar in Phirexes. Even here, the fog has seeped in. Workers report hearing voices in the trees—conversations just below the threshold of comprehension, as if the forest were gossiping about them. Shadows move wrong, lingering a moment after their casters have passed. Tools go missing and reappear in strange places.

The queen maintains a logging camp at Sweetwoods' edge, more for surveillance than efficiency. Any woodcutter who spends too long in the forest alone is quietly reassigned. Whatever the trees are saying, Phendexelas doesn't want her subjects to hear it.

#### Croaking Briars

A vast expanse of thorn-covered wetland forming Phirexes' western border, separating the swamps from the Thunderdark Peaks where the Strømgodden of Trømgar dwell. The briars are alive in an uncomfortable way—they grow toward warmth, toward blood, their thorns hooked and barbed to catch and hold.

The Dengar say Phendexelas planted the briars as a living wall against invasion, but older halflings remember: the briars were always here. The queen didn't create them. She woke them up.

The Strømgodden battle dwarves have tried to cut through many times—they war constantly with everyone, and Phirexes' weakness seems like easy conquest. But the briars grow back overnight, faster where blood has been spilled. A Strømgodden war party that breaches the barrier at dawn finds it whole again by dusk, often with their fallen comrades' bones already tangled in the thorns.

The briars do not attack the Dengar who live near them, but they don't welcome them either. Passage through the Croaking Briars is possible for those who know the safe paths, but those paths change weekly, and the briars seem to delight in trapping the unwary.

#### Duskwood Forest

A dense forest in southwestern Phirexes named for the permanent twilight under its canopy. This is not a fog effect—the trees here grow so thick, their leaves so broad and overlapping, that sunlight simply cannot penetrate. The forest floor exists in eternal dusk, cool and dim and silent.

This darkness nurtures things that grow nowhere else. Fungi that glow with bioluminescence in colors the Dengar have names for but other languages don't. Mosses that can be processed into medicines for ailments other healers cannot touch. Flowers that bloom only in absolute darkness, their petals worth their weight in gold to alchemists who know their uses.

Before the queen came, Duskwood was where the Dengar's greatest alchemists gathered their rarest ingredients. Now, entry requires royal permission. Phendexelas controls the medicine supply by controlling access to what makes it. Petitions to harvest in Duskwood are granted sparingly, and always with a price—usually information about one's neighbors.

#### Whispering Mangroves

The eastern edge of Phirexes, where the swamps meet the Crocodile Coast. Here the mangrove trees grow in the brackish water, their roots forming an impenetrable maze that extends for miles along the shore. The mangroves whisper constantly—a susurrus of voices just below comprehension, thousands of speakers saying things that almost make sense.

Old Dengar say these are the voices of those who tried to escape by sea and drowned, their spirits caught in the roots, forever trying to warn others away. The queen says they're singing her praises, the gratitude of the saved echoing through the wood. Neither explanation is comforting.

The mangroves are the last barrier for anyone trying to flee Phirexes by water. Beyond them lies the Crocodile Coast with its monster-infested waters, but the mangroves themselves are danger enough. Their roots grab at boats, pulling them into dead-end channels. The whispers grow louder the deeper you go, until it sounds like screaming. Few who enter unprepared ever find their way out.

Smugglers who supply the refugees have learned the safe passages—routes that the mangroves seem to tolerate, perhaps because they too hate the queen. These smugglers are the only lifeline between the refugees and the outside world.

#### Ogzwad Swamp

The southeastern corner of Phirexes, a remote marshland where the queen's control is weakest. Technically within her borders, Ogzwad has become a kind of neutral territory since the dragon Pfustias claimed it as her domain.

The swamp here is much like the rest of Phirexes—foggy, treacherous, full of things that want to kill you—but it lacks the queen's direct attention. Creatures here are fog-touched but not directed. The mists respond to weather rather than royal moods. It feels almost natural, in a horrible sort of way.

Pfustias permits no large settlements in her territory, but she tolerates the occasional Dengar who wanders in, provided they pay appropriate tribute (usually information, sometimes alchemical compounds, occasionally something stranger). Some refugees have tried to shelter here, but the dragon's idea of "hospitality" is unpredictable.

##### Pfustias' Lair

Somewhere in the depths of Ogzwad Swamp, Pfustias has made her home. No one knows exactly where—those who've been summoned there describe being led through fog so thick they couldn't track the path, arriving at a hummock of solid ground that shouldn't exist in this waterlogged terrain.

The lair itself is said to be surprisingly comfortable: dry ground, a cave system in rock that has no business being here, and a collection of treasures that makes no conventional sense. Pfustias hoards information more than gold—books, letters, maps, the written confessions of dying men. Her nest is lined with secrets.

#### Sweet Water River

The only freshwater river in Phirexes, flowing from the Cloud Mountains in the south through Old One's Wood and the Misty Marshes before emptying into the Gulf of Tears. The name is literal—this water is clean and sweet, untainted by the brackishness that afflicts most of the swamp.

The Sweet Water River predates the fogs and seems partially resistant to them. The water is clearer along its banks, the fog thinner, the creatures less warped. Queen Phendexelas has tried and failed to corrupt it fully; something in the river's nature—perhaps its mountain origin, perhaps something older—refuses her influence.

This makes the river the refugees' lifeline. Their camps cluster along its banks where the fog-binding sickness is weakest. The water itself seems to ease withdrawal symptoms, and plants that grow only along the river's edge have properties that help manage the addiction. The queen knows this and has tried to dam or divert the river multiple times. Each attempt has failed—the water finds new channels, sometimes overnight, as if the river itself is fighting back.

#### Mud Run

A sluggish, turbid waterway that feeds the Misty Marshes from the northwest, the dark twin of the Sweet Water River. Where the Sweet Water resists the fogs, Mud Run embraces them. The water itself is foggy—not just clouded with sediment but literally infused with the same magical mist that blankets the land.

Drinking from Mud Run causes hallucinations: visions of the swamp as it was before the queen came, or as it might be after she falls, or as it exists in some parallel Phirexes where everything went differently. Some visions are beautiful. Most are terrifying. A few have been prophetic.

The Dengar alchemists prize Mud Run water for certain rituals and formulas—it's a key ingredient in several compounds that can only be made in Phirexes. The queen monitors its harvest carefully, as she does all valuable resources, but she cannot fully control access to a river.

Refugees avoid Mud Run. The hallucinations it causes tend to show them what they've lost, what they can never have again. That's a cruelty they don't need.

### Qet Yemani

Tags: state, nation

Qet Yemani is the largest of the five jungle nations, controlling the western reaches of the Jungles of Godahi. Its vast territory encompasses the great Tora Mazîl forest, extensive swamplands, and the western highlands where the jungle meets the mountains. Where other jungle nations measure their domains in tens of miles, Qet Yemani spans over 120 miles from its eastern borders to the Hekat Valley in the west.

#### Geography

Qet Yemani's territory is defined by three major terrain types: the elevated forest of Tora Mazîl, the treacherous swamplands scattered throughout, and the western valleys and hills.

- **North**: Borders Da Trang, with Darkwater Swamp and the Greenflow river marking the frontier
- **East**: Jungle frontiers with New Chimea and Vystrilik, with Deadwood Swamp in the eastern interior
- **South**: Borders Eoga, where the Misty Marsh begins
- **West**: The Hills of Anaotki and Hekat Valley mark the transition to the western highlands

The **Hekat River** flows south through the western portion of Qet Yemani, draining the Hekat Valley. The **Greenflow** runs along the northeastern border with Da Trang.

#### Tora Mazîl

The heart of Qet Yemani—a vast elevated forest covering the central and northern portions of the nation. Tora Mazîl sits on a subtle plateau above the surrounding jungle, creating a distinct ecosystem. The trees here grow even taller than elsewhere in the Jungles, with some specimens exceeding 200 feet. The forest floor is more open than typical jungle, allowing easier travel but also harboring different dangers.

Tora Mazîl is sacred to the people of Qet Yemani. Ancient groves within the forest are sites of religious significance, and the harvest of certain tree species is strictly regulated by traditional law. The forest produces some of the most valuable hardwoods in Alaria—dense, beautifully grained timber that commands premium prices in distant markets.

#### Hills of Anaotki

A range of forested hills in northwestern Qet Yemani, marking the transition between the jungle lowlands and the western highlands. The hills are less densely vegetated than the deep jungle, with rocky outcrops and small clearings. They serve as a natural defensive barrier and contain several minor passes leading west.

#### Valleys

##### Hekat Valley

The western lowland along the Hekat River, a relatively open area compared to the dense jungle elsewhere. The valley supports some agriculture and serves as Qet Yemani's connection to the western regions beyond the jungle.

##### Oskwatch Valley

A southern valley in the foothills, containing the settlement of Dy. The valley watches the approaches from the south and west.

#### Swamps and Marshes

Qet Yemani's territory includes four major wetlands:

##### Oto Q'Azadi

A northern marsh in the upper reaches of Tora Mazîl. The village of Iyalmr sits at its southern edge.

##### Darkwater Swamp

Located in northeastern Qet Yemani, at the border with Da Trang. The swamp takes its name from the tea-colored water stained by tannins from decaying vegetation. Darkwater is navigable by experienced guides who can pole flat-bottomed boats through the channels, providing routes between Qet Yemani and Da Trang.

##### Dreamroot Marsh

A haunted expanse in the central-southern lowlands of Qet Yemani. The marsh is named for the dreamroot plant that grows abundantly in its shallow waters—a sedge whose roots, when prepared properly, induce prophetic visions. Less properly prepared, they induce madness and death. The marsh is home to isolated communities of root-gatherers who have developed immunity to the plant's ambient toxins. Outsiders who spend more than a few days in Dreamroot Marsh begin experiencing vivid hallucinations.

##### Deadwood Swamp

Located in east-central Qet Yemani. Unlike the living swamps elsewhere, Deadwood is a place of death—the trees stand skeletal and gray, killed by some ancient blight that persists to this day. Nothing grows in the black water except mats of pale fungus. The swamp is shunned by locals, who believe it to be cursed. Those who venture in report that wounds taken there do not heal properly, and sickness follows survivors for months.

#### Major Settlements

##### Iyalmr

A settlement in the northern part of Tora Mazîl, at the edge of the Oto Q'Azadi marsh. Iyalmr serves as one of Qet Yemani's primary trading centers, positioned where the forest meets the wetland.

##### Uchaelv

A western settlement on the Hekat River, serving as Qet Yemani's gateway to the western highlands. Uchaelv handles trade coming through the Hills of Anaotki and down the Hekat Valley.

##### Uvedr

An eastern settlement near Deadwood Swamp. Despite its proximity to the cursed swamp, Uvedr persists as a trading post for goods moving between Qet Yemani and the eastern nations. The town's residents have learned to avoid the swamp and profit from travelers who need guidance around it.

##### Chemuva

A central-southern town at the edge of Dreamroot Marsh. Chemuva is the center of the dreamroot trade—harvesters bring their carefully gathered roots here for processing and sale. The town has a strange atmosphere, its permanent residents showing the subtle signs of long-term dreamroot exposure.

##### Dy

A small settlement in Oskwatch Valley, in the southwestern part of Qet Yemani. Dy watches the southern and western approaches and serves the scattered communities of the highland frontier.

##### Tel Askati

A settlement in southwestern Qet Yemani, near the Kos Askati river and the approaches to the Myjornis Mountains. Tel Askati marks the edge of jungle civilization, where the lowland forests give way to mountain terrain.

### Vystrilik

Tags: state, nation

Vystrilik occupies the eastern interior of the Jungles of Godahi, controlling vital territory between the coastal nations and the deep jungle. Uniquely among the jungle nations, Vystrilik's domain extends across the Tambrielle Mountains—the nation holds territory on both the jungle side and the eastern coastal lowlands, giving it strategic importance as a crossroads between regions.

#### Geography

Vystrilik's territory spans from dense jungle in the west to coastal lowlands in the east, divided by the massive Tambrielle Mountains running through its heart. This trans-mountain position defines the nation:

- **North**: Borders New Chimea, sharing the Smokestack volcano at the frontier
- **West**: Jungle borders with Qet Yemani, Da Trang, and Eoga
- **South**: The Tambrielle Mountains continue southward
- **East**: Coastal territory facing the open ocean

The **Siber River** and **Vorlek River** drain the western jungle portions of Vystrilik, providing water routes through the interior.

#### Tambrielle Mountains

The Tambrielle Mountains form the spine of Vystrilik, rising 5,000-7,000 feet where the jungle meets the highland. These mountains divide the nation into two distinct regions—the jungle west and the coastal east. Several passes cut through the range, all controlled by Vystrilik.

Control of these passes gives Vystrilik leverage over trade between the Emerald Coast and the eastern seaboard. Caravans crossing between regions must use Vystrilik's routes or take longer, more dangerous paths. This geographic advantage has made Vystrilik wealthy despite having less coastline than New Chimea.

#### Smokestack

The volcanic peak marking Vystrilik's northern border with New Chimea. Smokestack perpetually vents steam and sulfurous gases, its plume visible for miles. The volcano is shared territory—both nations claim it, and both profit from the sulfur and mineral deposits on its slopes. The uneasy joint administration of Smokestack is a constant source of diplomatic tension.

#### Major Settlements

##### Western Settlements (Jungle Side)

###### Vystril

The capital of Vystrilik, situated in the central-western jungle at the base of the Tambrielle Mountains. Vystril is a prosperous trading city controlling the primary mountain passes. The city's architecture reflects its role as a crossroads—influences from the coast, the jungle interior, and the eastern seaboard blend in its buildings and marketplaces.

The city maintains extensive warehouses where goods are sorted, taxed, and transferred between jungle canoes and the pack trains that cross the mountains.

###### Oklyüne

A northwestern town near the borders with New Chimea and Da Trang. Oklyüne sits along the Vorlek River and handles traffic coming from the northern jungle nations.

###### Dywea

A western settlement in the jungle interior, serving as a waypoint for goods moving between the deep jungle and Vystril.

###### Klovuk

A west-central town positioned between the jungle and the mountain foothills. Klovuk serves travelers preparing to cross the Tambrielle passes.

###### Shyonn

A southwestern settlement near the border with Eoga. Shyonn has historically been contested territory—relations between Vystrilik and Eoga are complicated, and the town has changed hands multiple times.

###### Alezre

A northern settlement in the foothills, near the approaches to Smokestack and the New Chimea border.

###### Zure

A small northern town serving the communities around the Smokestack region.

###### Gli

A central settlement near Vystril, functioning as an extension of the capital's commercial activity.

##### Eastern Settlements (Coastal Side)

###### Garum

The primary port on Vystrilik's eastern coast. Garum handles goods that have crossed the Tambrielle passes, loading them onto ships for transport along the coast or across the sea. The town is a working harbor—efficient at moving cargo but less refined than the ports of New Chimea.

###### Chîtakee

An inland town on the eastern side of the mountains, positioned along the routes descending from the passes toward the coast.

###### Elbow

A coastal settlement south of Garum, serving fishing communities and providing an alternate port for coastal traffic.

#### Shambling Forest

On the eastern slopes of the Tambrielle Mountains lies the Shambling Forest, a dense woodland with an unsettling reputation. The forest earned its name from travelers' reports of trees that seem to move when unobserved—paths shift, landmarks relocate, and those who enter often emerge miles from where they expected. Whether this is natural disorientation, magical influence, or something stranger remains disputed.

#### Trans-Mountain Character

Vystrilik's control of both sides of the Tambrielle Mountains creates a unique dual identity. The western jungle settlements share culture and trade patterns with the other Godahi nations, while the eastern coastal towns look outward to sea trade. Vystril, at the center, bridges both worlds—its merchants are equally comfortable negotiating jungle timber prices and coastal shipping rates.

This position makes Vystrilik indispensable to regional commerce but also creates internal tensions. Eastern and western Vystrilik sometimes have competing interests, and the capital must constantly balance the needs of its divided population.

## Shacklands

### Geography

The Shacklands are not a single contiguous territory but rather a collection of southern regions united by their participation in the slave trade. The name comes from the shackles worn by enslaved dwarves—a grim legacy that defines the region's character. These scattered territories stretch across the southern reaches of Rimihuica, from the mainland jungles to distant island chains.

#### The Concept

Unlike other regions defined by geography, the Shacklands are defined by economy and practice. States belong to the Shacklands not because they share borders but because they share in the brutal commerce of slavery. This makes the region's boundaries fluid and political rather than natural.

The slave trade provides the economic glue holding these disparate territories together. Tamadrez supplies the labor—primarily Drasnian dwarves, though other peoples are caught in the system too. Gorath provides the demand, the military muscle, and the infrastructure. Smaller states participate as middlemen, suppliers, or simply beneficiaries of the wealth that flows through the region.

#### Major Territories

##### Gorath

The dominant power of the Shacklands and the largest territorial state on Alaria. Six hundred miles of jungle, three great rivers, and over a million souls organized into a militaristic empire that has spent three centuries conquering its neighbors and shows no sign of stopping.

Gorath occupies the southeastern mainland, bounded by:
- **North**: The Myjornis Mountains, beyond which lies Nashua and the Inner Rim
- **West**: The Moon Wilds—Gorath's most dangerous frontier
- **South**: The Divinity Passage and the Sea of Selegos
- **East**: Contested borderlands with Nashua

Key features include:
- **Jungles of Titania**: The settled heartland between the Lucenia and Droaz rivers
- **Moon Wilds**: A haunted jungle that has defeated every attempt at conquest
- **Divinity Passage**: The maritime highway connecting Gorath to the slave trade
- **Azantir**: The capital, largest city in the Shacklands

Gorath operates as a military republic with elected emperors chosen from successful generals. The empire's core values—glory, conquest, discipline, assimilation—have created a state that grows stronger with every victory, absorbing conquered armies into its own legions.

##### Kyagos

A mountainous, cloud-shrouded peninsula in the far southeast—almost island-like in its isolation. Kyagos is covered in peaks and perpetual mist, containing numerous city-states (Tekos, Syvlius, Sy, Vassum) and jungle territories. It lies south of Phirexes, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes.

##### Tamadrez

The source of the slave trade. Tamadrez covers Pesalolo, a large island in the far south separated from the mainland by the Sea of Selegos. The island's Drasnian dwarves have become the primary commodity of the Shacklands economy—a grim distinction that has shaped their entire society.

The relationship between Tamadrez and Gorath is exploitative but stable: Gorath operates the Slaver's Coast on Pesalolo's southern shores, taking slaves while leaving the north nominally independent. This arrangement persists only because Gorath finds it more profitable than outright conquest—for now.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: Separates the mainland from Pesalolo, crossed regularly by slave ships
- **Divinity Passage**: The main maritime corridor connecting Gorath to the outside world
- **Deaddorf Strait**: A passage within the Shacklands region
- **Cindrak Sea**: Southern waters

### Political Climate

The Shacklands lack unified governance—they're defined by participation in slavery, not political allegiance. However, Gorath's dominance creates a de facto hierarchy:

**Gorath** sets the terms. Their military power, economic might, and willingness to use both give them effective control over the slave trade and significant influence over neighboring states. They don't rule the Shacklands, but they shape it.

**Tamadrez** provides the supply. Their relationship with Gorath is unequal but stable—cooperation keeps them independent, and the threat of Gorath's military ensures compliance.

**Smaller participants** fill specialized roles: brokers, transporters, secondary markets. They profit from the system while lacking the power to challenge it.

The result is an economic zone masquerading as a region. States that have nothing else in common share the taint of slavery—and the wealth it generates.

### What Makes It Interesting

The Shacklands offer moral complexity that most fantasy settings avoid. This is not a simple evil empire to be defeated; it's a system with participants at every level, from the emperors who profit most to the merchants who profit enough to look away to the slaves who sometimes cooperate for survival. Heroes here face hard choices:

- **Opposing slavery means opposing prosperity.** Gorath's economy would collapse without slave labor. What happens to the people who depend on that economy?
- **Freeing slaves means endangering them.** Escaped slaves face the jungle, the sea, or recapture. Where do they go? Who helps them?
- **Justice requires violence.** The system won't reform peacefully. Is revolution better than stability?

The Shacklands are also intensely physical places—massive jungles, dangerous waters, fortress-cities rising from impossible terrain. Adventure here means facing environments as hostile as any enemy.

### What Will Go Wrong

The system is stable but not static. Several pressure points threaten to destabilize the Shacklands:

**The Moon Wilds are stirring.** Something is organizing the Vexlings, transforming scattered predators into coordinated threats. If they break through the Myublin line, Gorath faces a war on yet another front.

**Emperor Veramus is aging.** He's sixty-three and has held power longer than any recent predecessor. When he dies, the succession crisis will be spectacular—and bloody.

**External powers are watching.** The dwarves of Trømgar object to Gorath's treatment of their Drasnian kin. The Nashua conflict drags on. Somewhere, someone is planning to disrupt the slave trade.

**The enslaved remember.** Three centuries of slavery have not broken the Drasnian spirit. Escape networks operate despite Slavewatch. Resistance movements simmer. One day, something will ignite.

The Shacklands are a powder keg. The only question is what—or who—provides the spark.

The name of the strait comes from a misspelling of a description of the strait: dead-dwarves.

### Divinity Passage

Tags: strait, waterway, trade route

The main maritime highway connecting Gorath to the outside world—and the primary route for the Tamadrez slave trade. The Passage cuts between the Gorathi mainland and the scattered islands to the south, providing sheltered waters for the endless traffic of merchant vessels, slave ships, and naval patrols that keep the empire's economy moving.

The name is ancient, predating Gorath itself. Local legend claims the passage was carved by a god fleeing some primordial catastrophe, though which god and what catastrophe varies by telling. The Gorathi have adopted the name without the mythology—to them, it simply describes the route that brings divine favor in the form of endless labor.

#### Geography

The Divinity Passage runs roughly east-west, connecting the Sea of Selegos in the south to the open waters leading toward the Western Isles. At its narrowest point, the passage spans approximately fifteen miles; at its widest, nearly forty. The waters are generally calm compared to the open ocean, protected by the mainland to the north and island chains to the south.

Several features define the passage:

**The Narrows**: The tightest stretch, where Gorath maintains permanent naval presence. Any ship passing through submits to inspection—pirates, smugglers, and unauthorized slavers are dealt with harshly. The Narrows also serve as the empire's first line of naval defense; enemy fleets would have to force this chokepoint to threaten Azantir directly.

**Azantir Roads**: The broad anchorage at the passage's northern shore, where the Lucenia River empties into the strait. Hundreds of vessels anchor here at any given time—more during trading season. The docks of Azantir extend into the Roads, creating a maze of piers, floating markets, and moored ships that never truly sleeps.

**The Southern Shallows**: A hazardous stretch near the passage's western mouth, where sandbars and submerged rocks have claimed countless ships. Pilots who know the safe channels charge premium fees; those who try to navigate alone often join the wrecks.

#### The Slave Route

Every week, slave ships make the crossing from the Slaver's Coast on Pesalolo to the markets of Azantir. The journey takes three to five days depending on weather and cargo. The ships are purpose-built for their grim trade: shallow draft for navigating coastal waters, multiple decks configured to pack human cargo efficiently, and holds designed to be hosed clean between voyages.

The conditions below decks are precisely calculated: enough space to prevent the enslaved from dying en masse (dead cargo earns nothing), but not an inch more. Drasnian dwarves, being shorter than humans, are packed even more densely. Mortality rates run between five and fifteen percent per voyage, considered acceptable by the slavers' brutal arithmetic.

At peak season, as many as thirty slave ships work the passage simultaneously. The traffic is so regular that the sound of chains has become background noise for Azantir's dockworkers.

#### Other Traffic

Slavery dominates the passage, but it's not the only trade:

**Timber**: Log rafts and lumber barges heading south for export, processed wood returning as finished goods.

**Exotic Goods**: The rare resources of the Gorathi jungle—bloodwood, witchbark, azure orchids, alchemical ingredients—flow out through the passage to markets across Alaria.

**Military Logistics**: Troops, supplies, and equipment moving to and from the Slaver's Coast operations, or heading toward the naval patrols that keep the passage secure.

**Legitimate Commerce**: Despite its reputation, the passage also carries ordinary trade. Merchants from the Western Isles, the Middle Sea, and beyond bring goods to Azantir's markets, drawn by Gorath's immense purchasing power.

#### The Passage Patrol

Gorath maintains a permanent naval squadron in the Divinity Passage, headquartered at **Fort Selegos**, a island fortress commanding the Narrows. The Passage Patrol's responsibilities include:

- Inspecting vessels for contraband (primarily unauthorized slaves—Gorath tolerates no competition in its core industry)
- Suppressing piracy (though some pirates operate with tacit Gorathi approval, preying on rival nations' shipping)
- Preventing slave escapes (boats fleeing north from Tamadrez are hunted ruthlessly)
- Defending against naval incursions (no enemy fleet has forced the Narrows in living memory)

Patrol captains wield significant authority within the passage. A captain who decides a ship is suspicious can impound it, interrogate its crew, and confiscate cargo without appeal. This power invites corruption—bribes to overlook questionable cargo are a regular cost of doing business—but the patrol remains effective enough to maintain Gorath's control over the strait.

#### What the Name Means

To Gorathi merchants and sailors, the Divinity Passage is simply the route to wealth. The name is traditional, unremarked, like a street called "King's Road" long after anyone remembers which king.

To the enslaved who cross it in chains, the name is bitter irony. Some call it "Divinity's Mockery" or "the Gods' Shame." Drasnian dwarves have another name entirely in their own tongue, one that translates roughly to "the Drowning Path"—a reference both to the passage's waters and to the death of hope that the crossing represents.

To abolitionists and those who oppose the slave trade, the passage represents everything wrong with Gorath: the systematic, industrialized evil that the empire has built its prosperity upon. Disrupting the passage—whether through piracy, sabotage, or somehow convincing other powers to blockade it—remains a dream for those who would see the trade ended.

#### Navigation

The passage is well-charted but not without hazards:

- **Seasonal storms** can make the western approaches dangerous, particularly during the wet season
- **The Southern Shallows** claim several ships yearly despite the best efforts of pilots
- **Currents** at the Narrows run fast and unpredictably; sailing against them requires expert handling
- **Traffic congestion** at Azantir Roads creates its own dangers, as ships jostle for anchorage and dock space

Most captains consider the passage routine sailing compared to open ocean crossings. The real dangers are political, not nautical: getting on the wrong side of the Passage Patrol can end a career—or a life—faster than any storm.

### Gorath

Tags: region, jungle, empire

Six hundred miles of jungle. Three great rivers. A million souls. Gorath sprawls across southern Rimihuica like a green stain on the map, the largest territorial state on Alaria and one of the most aggressive. The jungle canopy stretches unbroken for hundreds of miles in places, punctuated by hill country, river valleys carved through dense vegetation, and the scattered stone cities of the Gorathi empire.

This is not wilderness in the classical sense—much of Gorath is claimed, mapped, and theoretically controlled by the empire. But "controlled" is relative when the jungle grows back faster than you can cut it. Outside the river corridors and fortress-cities, Gorath remains profoundly wild. A hundred miles of untamed canopy separates many settlements. Creatures that have never seen a human hunt in the deep green. And in the Moon Wilds, even the empire fears to tread.

#### Overview

Gorath occupies the southeastern portion of Rimihuica's mainland, bounded by:
- **North**: The Myjornis Mountains, beyond which lies Nashua and the Inner Rim
- **West**: The Moon Wilds and the open water leading to the Western Isles
- **South**: The Divinity Passage and the Sea of Selegos, beyond which lies Pesalolo
- **East**: The Deserted Hills and contested borderlands with Nashua

The terrain divides roughly into three zones:
1. **The River Corridors**: Settled, civilized, economically productive
2. **The Hill Country**: Partially tamed, resource-rich, strategically important
3. **The Deep Jungle**: Wild, dangerous, and largely unexplored

#### The Three Rivers

Gorath's civilization follows its rivers. The jungle is simply too dense, too hostile, and too quick to reclaim cleared land for overland travel at scale. Everything moves by water.

##### Lucenia River

The Lucenia is Gorath's spine. It flows south from the Myjornis Mountains, emerging into the jungle at Esteves and winding through the heart of the Jungles of Titania before emptying into the Divinity Passage at Azantir. This is the empire's primary artery—the route connecting the northern frontier to the capital, the highway for troops moving to the Nashua front, and the conduit for much of Gorath's internal trade.

The river is navigable for most of its length, though rapids near Pereiro require portage. During the wet season, the Lucenia swells dramatically, flooding low-lying areas and making travel faster but more dangerous.

**Major settlements along the Lucenia**: Esteves (north), Pereiro (upper-middle), numerous smaller towns, Azantir (mouth)

##### Droaz River

The Droaz runs roughly parallel to the Lucenia, further east. It drains the Purlin Hills and the central Jungles of Titania, flowing south through increasingly settled territory before reaching the coast. The Droaz valley is Gorath's logging heartland—the great bloodwood and ironwood groves that supply the empire's construction and export industries cluster along its banks.

Carvalhais, the empire's timber capital, sits on the upper Droaz. From there, log rafts float downstream to coastal mills and export docks.

**Major settlements along the Droaz**: Carvalhais (upper), Pombares, Velorasa, Bougado, Ranholas, coastal outlet

##### Torga River

The youngest of Gorath's river civilizations, the Torga drains the southeastern jungle between the Bata Nujo Hills and the Deserted Hills. It empties at Ageito, a growing port city that has become the staging ground for Gorath's push toward Nashua.

The Torga valley was largely unsettled until three generations ago, when the empire's expansion eastward demanded new supply lines. Now it bustles with military traffic, colonist barges, and the constant movement of a frontier being actively conquered.

**Major settlements along the Torga**: Ageito (mouth), numerous military outposts, scattered colonial towns

#### The Hill Regions

Five distinct hill regions break up Gorath's jungle lowlands, each with its own character.

##### Poison Hills

The Poison Hills run north-south through western-central Gorath, separating the Moon Wilds from the Jungles of Titania proper. The name comes from the region's extraordinary biodiversity of toxic flora and fauna—venomous snakes, poison-dart frogs, contact-toxic plants, and flowers whose pollen induces hallucinations or worse.

Paradoxically, this makes the Poison Hills valuable. Gorathi alchemists and poisoners prize the region's resources. The cities of **Fresta** and **Recarei** in the northern hills have become centers of the poison trade, supplying everything from medicinal antidotes to assassination tools. The locals have developed partial immunities over generations—outsiders are advised to touch nothing and watch where they step.

The hills themselves are lower and more rolling than true mountains, heavily forested but with enough elevation to break the jungle canopy in places. Travel is possible but unpleasant; the locals know the safe paths.

##### Purlin Hills

The Purlin Hills occupy the center of the Jungles of Titania, running north-south between the Lucenia and Droaz rivers. These are Gorath's most civilized hills—well-mapped, crisscrossed with trails, and dotted with logging camps and small settlements.

The Purlin lumber industry supplies much of Gorath's construction needs. Slaves work the camps, felling trees under legion guard, while Gorathi overseers manage the operations. It's brutal work in brutal conditions, but the empire's appetite for timber is endless.

##### Bata Nujo Hills

East of the Droaz River, the Bata Nujo Hills mark the transition from core Gorathi territory to the expanding frontier. These hills are more rugged than the Purlins, with deeper valleys and denser vegetation. Several mid-sized towns dot the region, serving as waypoints between the Droaz and Torga watersheds.

The Bata Nujo are known for mineral wealth—iron, copper, and occasional silver deposits that the empire exploits through mining operations. Slave labor, again, does the dangerous underground work.

##### Deserted Hills

The Deserted Hills run along Gorath's eastern edge, forming a natural buffer between the empire and Nashua. The name is misleading—they're not empty, but they are sparsely populated compared to the rest of Gorath. The combination of difficult terrain, proximity to the Nashua front, and lack of major rivers has discouraged settlement.

Military outposts dot the hills, watching for Ix'Vasyla incursions. The few civilians who live here are either too stubborn to leave or engaged in activities that benefit from the lack of imperial attention—smuggling, primarily, but also refuge for escaped slaves making their way toward Nashua.

#### Major Cities

Gorathi cities rise from the jungle like stone monuments to conquest. Architecture favors massive stepped pyramids, broad stone plazas, and walls thick enough to resist both siege engines and the jungle's relentless growth. Every city maintains its Pillar of Conquest at the center, a slave market, and military barracks sized to house the legions.

##### Azantir

The capital. Where the Lucenia River empties into the Divinity Passage, Azantir sprawls across both banks in a maze of pyramids, canals, and markets. This is the largest city in the Shacklands—estimates put the population at over 200,000, though accurate counts are impossible given the Skaag warrens below and the constant flow of slaves through the markets.

The Emperor's Palace crowns the city's highest pyramid, offering views across the entire urban expanse. Below it, the Imperial Plaza can hold fifty thousand for speeches, festivals, or public executions. The great Pillar of Conquest here stands over two hundred feet tall, covered in names too numerous to read.

Azantir's docks never sleep. Slave ships arrive from Tamadrez. Timber rafts float down from upriver. Trade goods flow in from across Alaria, drawn by Gorath's colossal economy. If it can be bought or sold, Azantir has a market for it.

##### Esteves

The northern gateway. Esteves guards the point where the Lucenia River emerges from the Myjornis Mountains, controlling access to the passes beyond. This is a fortress-city first and a population center second—soldiers outnumber civilians, and the entire urban plan is designed for defense.

The Esteves garrison maintains watch over three separate threats: giants from the northwest, potential Nashua flanking maneuvers, and whatever might come through the mountain passes from the Inner Rim. Emperor Veramus earned his epithet here, holding the Esteves Pass against a giant assault for forty-three days without reinforcement.

##### Carvalhais

The timber capital. Carvalhais sprawls along the upper Droaz, a city that smells of sawdust, industry, and the sweat of slaves. The great lumber mills here process logs floated down from camps throughout the Purlin Hills, cutting and treating wood for construction, shipbuilding, and export.

This is a working city, without the grandeur of Azantir or the martial pride of Esteves. The wealthy timber merchants who run Carvalhais care more about board-feet than glory. But their wealth funds legions, and that makes them powerful.

##### Ageito

The eastern anchor. Ageito sits where the Torga River meets the sea, a newer city that has grown rapidly as Gorath pushes toward Nashua. The docks here handle military supplies for the eastern front; the barracks house troops rotating to and from the fighting.

Ageito has a frontier energy that older Gorathi cities lack—fortunes being made and lost, opportunities for the ambitious, and a willingness to overlook questions about one's past. It's also the most diverse city in Gorath, with significant populations of assimilated peoples from the empire's various conquests.

##### Interior Cities

**Pereiro**: Upper Lucenia, below the rapids. A transfer point where river cargo must be portaged around dangerous waters. Smaller than the coastal cities but strategically vital.

**Pombares**: Central Droaz valley. A market town serving the logging camps and mining operations of the Purlin and Bata Nujo Hills.

**Velorasa**: Lower Droaz. Known for its shipyards, which build the river craft that keep Gorath's economy moving.

**Bougado**: Junction town where overland routes from the Poison Hills meet the Droaz River trade.

**Ranholas**: Southern Droaz, near the coast. A secondary port handling overflow from Azantir's crowded docks.

**Fresta**: Northern Poison Hills. Center of the poison and alchemical trade.

**Recarei**: Poison Hills. Sister city to Fresta, specializing in antidotes and medicinal applications of the region's toxic bounty.

#### The Wilds Between

Between the river corridors and fortress-cities, between the hill towns and logging camps, stretches the jungle. Hundreds of miles of it. This is not the tamed forest of civilized lands—this is primordial growth that has never been cleared, home to creatures that have never seen a human, and pathways that exist only in the memories of those who've walked them.

Travel through the deep jungle is measured in weeks, not days. Trails exist, but they're narrow, prone to flooding, and require constant maintenance against the vegetation's relentless advance. Most Gorathi never venture more than a day's walk from the rivers. Those who do are soldiers, scouts, escaped slaves with nowhere else to go, or fools who will become food for something.

The jungle sustains Gorath—its timber, its exotic resources, its very identity as a people who conquered the unconquerable. But the jungle also defines Gorath's limits. The empire can claim six hundred miles of canopy. Actually controlling it remains another matter entirely.

#### Myublin River

A smaller river flowing through the Moon Wilds, the Myublin is notable primarily as a boundary marker. East of the Myublin, you're in Gorathi territory. West of it, you're in the Wilds proper. The distinction matters to the soldiers who patrol the river's edge, watching for Vexling incursions. It matters less to the creatures who don't recognize borders.

### Jungles of Titania

Tags: jungle, biome, heartland

The green heart of Gorath. The Jungles of Titania sprawl across central Gorath between the Lucenia and Droaz rivers, stretching from the Myjornis Mountains in the north to the coastal lowlands in the south. This is where Gorath was born, where the empire's wealth grows, and where most of its million citizens live.

Despite centuries of settlement, the jungle remains dominant. Gorathi civilization exists in clearings carved from the green—along rivers, around fortress-cities, in the logged-over hills—while the forest surrounds everything, always pushing back, always ready to reclaim what has been taken. This is not a tamed land. It is a land under perpetual siege from the vegetation, and the Gorathi are winning only because they never stop fighting.

#### Character

The Jungles of Titania represent tropical rainforest at its most aggressive. The canopy rises a hundred feet or more, filtering sunlight into green twilight on the forest floor. Undergrowth chokes every open space. Vines hang from every branch. The air is thick with humidity, alive with insects, and carries the constant noise of birds, monkeys, and things less identifiable.

Three seasons define the year:
- **The Wet** (roughly four months): Daily torrential rains flood low-lying areas, swell rivers to dangerous levels, and make overland travel nearly impossible. Most military campaigns halt. Commerce slows. The jungle grows explosively.
- **The Dry** (roughly five months): Rain becomes sporadic, rivers recede, and the jungle becomes merely difficult rather than impassable. This is campaign season, harvest season, logging season—when Gorath gets things done.
- **The Transition** (roughly three months total, split between seasons): Unpredictable weather, rapid changes, and the periods when jungle creatures are most active. Hunting season for those who prey, dangerous season for those who are prey.

#### The Settled Jungle

Along the river corridors and around major cities, the jungle has been beaten back. Not defeated—never defeated—but pushed far enough that civilization can function.

**Plantation zones** extend from every major settlement, cleared areas where slaves cultivate the crops that feed the empire: rice in the wetter areas, maize and vegetables on higher ground, orchards of tropical fruits, and the cash crops—cacao, coffee, spices—that add to Gorath's exports. The plantations require constant maintenance; left alone for even a few months, the jungle reclaims them.

**Logging operations** move through the Purlin Hills and other timber-rich areas, crews of slaves felling trees under legion guard while overseers select the valuable species: bloodwood for construction and furniture, ironwood for shipbuilding, witchbark for the alchemical trade. Logging camps are temporary by necessity—once an area is stripped, they move on, and the jungle flows back into the gaps.

**River towns** dot the waterways every twenty to thirty miles, providing services to river traffic: portage around rapids, resupply for long journeys, markets for local trade. These are small settlements, rarely more than a few hundred permanent residents, but vital links in Gorath's internal commerce.

#### The Wild Jungle

Between the settlements stretches wilderness. Vast swaths of the Jungles of Titania have never been logged, never been mapped, never been claimed by anything other than the creatures that live there. A hundred miles of unbroken canopy separates some settlements from their nearest neighbors.

This is where the jungle's true character shows. Predators rule the darkness beneath the canopy: great cats that can take down armored soldiers, constrictors long enough to coil around a boat, packs of hunting dogs that have learned humans are easy prey. Poisonous creatures abound—snakes, spiders, frogs, plants that kill at a touch. Disease rises from every swamp, carried by mosquitoes that swarm in clouds.

And there are older things. The jungle predates humanity by epochs. Ruins of unknown origin dot the interior, overgrown and half-buried, remnants of civilizations that flourished and fell long before Gorath existed. The Skaag whisper of tunnel networks beneath the jungle floor, ancient passages that connect sites across the region. Occasionally, something emerges from the deep jungle that defies explanation—creatures that shouldn't exist, phenomena that no scholar can categorize.

The Gorathi tell themselves they've conquered the Jungles of Titania. The jungle tells a different story to those who venture too far from the rivers.

#### The Purlin Hills

Running north-south through the heart of Titania, the Purlin Hills provide the closest thing the jungle has to highlands. The terrain rises a few hundred feet above the lowland average—not mountains by any measure, but enough elevation to break the endless canopy and allow some respite from the crushing humidity.

The hills are Gorath's most productive logging region. The slopes grow slower-growing, harder wood than the lowlands, and the slightly drier conditions make year-round operations possible. Logging camps cluster throughout the Purlins, connected by trails that require constant clearing to remain passable.

The hills also serve as rough territory for anything trying to move overland. Gorathi criminals, escaped slaves, and others fleeing authority often head for the Purlins, where the broken terrain and dense forest make pursuit difficult. The legions maintain bounty hunters who specialize in tracking through the hills—a dangerous and profitable profession.

#### Resources

The Jungles of Titania produce the resources that make Gorath wealthy:

**Bloodwood**: The signature product. This deep red hardwood is naturally resistant to rot, insects, and even fire. It takes dye and polish beautifully, making it prized for furniture, construction, and decorative work across Alaria. A single bloodwood log can be worth more than a common laborer earns in a decade.

**Ironwood**: Dense enough to sink in water, hard enough to turn aside blades, ironwood is the premier material for shipbuilding, weapon handles, and construction that must last. Cutting it is brutal work—the wood dulls tools rapidly and requires slave crews working in shifts.

**Witchbark**: Harvested from a specific tree species found only in the deep jungle, witchbark is an essential ingredient in dozens of alchemical processes. The harvesting is dangerous—the trees grow in Vexling-adjacent territory, and the bark itself causes skin reactions in unprotected handlers.

**Azure Orchids**: These luminescent flowers grow in specific microenvironments scattered through the jungle. Their essence is a key component in high-end perfumes, certain poisons, and several magical processes. Orchid hunters are a specialized profession, part botanist and part jungle scout.

**Medicinal Plants**: The jungle contains cures for diseases that haven't been named yet. Gorathi herbalists have catalogued thousands of useful species, and more are discovered regularly. This knowledge is jealously guarded—Gorath's pharmaceutical exports are a significant economic sector.

#### Travel

Moving through the Jungles of Titania is always difficult and often dangerous:

**By River**: The preferred method. The Lucenia, Droaz, and their tributaries provide relatively safe highways through the jungle. Travel times are measured in days rather than weeks, and the river towns offer regular resupply. Downriver is faster (obviously); upriver requires poling, rowing, or animal power.

**By Trail**: Maintained paths connect major settlements overland, but "maintained" means "cleared three times a year." Between clearings, the jungle reclaims trails quickly. A path that was walkable last month might require machetes this month. Travel times are measured in weeks, not days.

**By Jungle**: Off-trail travel is reserved for the desperate, the expert, or the suicidal. Without experienced guides, parties get lost within hours. With experienced guides, they merely face the normal dangers: predators, disease, poisonous everything, and the certainty of hardship.

#### Wildlife

The Jungles of Titania support an ecosystem of staggering biodiversity and significant danger:

**Predators**: Jungle cats ranging from leopard-sized to tiger-sized, packs of wild dogs, crocodiles in every waterway, constrictors capable of taking down cattle. Most avoid humans when possible; some have learned that humans are profitable prey.

**Poisonous Species**: Snakes (dozens of venomous species), spiders (several lethal varieties), frogs (contact poison on skin), plants (irritants, paralyzers, and killers). The locals know which to avoid. Outsiders learn quickly or die.

**Insects**: Mosquitoes carry malaria and worse. Ants can strip a body to bone overnight. Various flies, beetles, and crawling things make life unpleasant in ways ranging from irritating to fatal.

**Primates**: Several monkey species, generally not dangerous but known for stealing anything not secured. One larger species—resembling gorillas but more aggressive—has been known to kill isolated travelers.

**The Unknown**: Every year, expeditions encounter creatures not in any bestiary, species apparently unknown to scholarship. Most are simply rare; some are genuinely inexplicable. The deep jungle keeps its secrets.

#### For Adventurers

The Jungles of Titania offer conventional adventure opportunities layered over Gorath's darker realities:

**Exploration**: Ruins dot the deep jungle, unexplored and presumably full of whatever civilizations leave behind. Getting there is the challenge; getting back is harder.

**Bounty Hunting**: Escaped slaves, deserters, and criminals hide in the jungle. The empire pays for their return—or their heads.

**Resource Extraction**: Specialty harvesting (orchids, witchbark, rare specimens) pays well but requires venturing into dangerous territory.

**Resistance**: Those opposing Gorath find the jungle a useful ally. The empire struggles to project power beyond the rivers. Guerrilla operations, escape networks, and hidden camps all thrive in the spaces between Gorathi control.

The jungle is dangerous, but it's honest danger—predators hunt because they're hungry, not because of ideology. For some, that makes it preferable to the civilization that surrounds it.

### Kosko

Tags: state, nation

A state on Agorf Island.

TODO

### Kyagos

Tags: island, state, nation

A mountainous island roughly 400 miles across, Kyagos rises from the waters between the Sea of Seven Snakes and the Alrock Ocean like a clenched fist of stone. The Aktarvkus Mountains dominate the interior—an impassable tangle of peaks, ravines, and wind-scoured passes that effectively divides the island into isolated coastal territories. This geography explains why Kyagos never unified into a single nation: four city-states emerged independently around the island's rim, each controlling its own slice of coast and whatever mountain approaches it could defend.

The Sylthik who rule these city-states measure worth in scars. Cheek-scars mark rank—one for minor distinction, five for the highest lords. Outsiders receive handkerchiefs around their necks marking them as rightless visitors. The economy runs on mining, the mines run on slaves, and for three centuries the Drasnian dwarves shipped from Gorath's Slaver's Coast have extracted Kyagos's legendary gems and metals from the deep shafts beneath the mountains.

That arrangement shattered recently. Syvlius, the largest and wealthiest city-state, burned. Slaves rose, a trade tower fell, and the Dead Moon Tribe swept down from Moonwood to finish what the uprising started. The other three city-states now face an island transformed—one quarter in chaotic ruin, the native humans emboldened, and every remaining slave watching to see what happens next.

#### The Aktarvkus Mountains

The spine of Kyagos—a brutal mountain range that defeats casual crossing. Peaks here reach above the treeline into permanent snow, with passes that close entirely during storm season. The range runs roughly northeast to southwest, creating a natural barrier between the northern forests and the southern jungles.

The mountains hold Kyagos's true wealth: veins of silver, copper, and iron laced through the stone, pockets of gemstones that made the island's reputation, and deeper deposits that Drasnian miners have barely begun to tap. Mining operations cluster around the more accessible valleys, with the most lucrative shafts controlled by whichever city-state can hold them.

Travel through the Aktarvkus requires either expensive guides who know the passes, or acceptance that you're probably going to die. The Sylthik city-states maintain a few fortified routes between them, but these are jealously guarded and subject to tolls that make sea travel look economical despite Kyagos's dangerous coasts.

##### Mount Syvlia

The mountain that gave Syvlius its name—a distinctive peak visible from much of northwestern Kyagos. The city sprawled across its lower slopes before the revolution. Now smoke still rises from the ruins on clear days.

##### Mount Essel

Western peak near Vassum, notable for the road that winds around its base connecting the city to the interior passes. Vassum's guards patrol this route heavily; it's their primary overland connection to the rest of Kyagos.

##### Mount Laska

Central peak marking the rough geographic heart of the Aktarvkus. No settlements here—too remote, too difficult to supply. Local Sylthik legends claim something lives in the caves beneath Laska, something that predates their arrival on the island. The miners avoid the area.

##### Skyreach

A fortress carved into a high mountain saddle, built in a style that predates the Sylthik city-states by centuries. No one knows who constructed it or why they chose such an inaccessible location. The structure is largely intact but abandoned—reaching it requires days of climbing through treacherous terrain, and whatever value it once held apparently wasn't worth the effort of maintaining supply lines.

Scholars have noted that Skyreach sits almost exactly where multiple mountain passes converge, suggesting it once controlled movement through the Aktarvkus. Some speculate it was a toll fortress from an earlier civilization; others think it served as a watchtower or signal station. The Sylthik occasionally use it as a neutral meeting ground for inter-city negotiations, precisely because no single city-state can easily garrison it.

##### Valley of Whispers

A high mountain valley deep in the Aktarvkus, marked on maps but rarely visited. The valley earned its name from an acoustic phenomenon—sounds carry strangely here, bouncing between the surrounding peaks in ways that make distant conversations audible and nearby ones incoherent. Whispers from one end of the valley reach the other with unsettling clarity. Shouts fragment into meaningless noise.

The Sylthik consider the place cursed. The Dead Moon Tribe considers it sacred. Neither group spends much time there, but for different reasons.

Some scholars theorize the effect is purely natural—a quirk of the valley's shape and the persistent winds. Others note that the valley sits at the intersection of several minor leylines, suggesting the acoustic distortion might be a symptom of deeper planar interference. A few claim the whispers sometimes carry words that no one present actually spoke.

During the recent revolution, escaped slaves used the valley as a staging ground. The acoustic properties that unnerved their Sylthik pursuers became a tactical advantage—the rebels could coordinate across the valley floor while their enemies stumbled around unable to communicate effectively.

##### Eskagon Hills

A region of broken highlands northeast of the central peaks, where the Aktarvkus begins to descend toward the eastern coast. The terrain here is more navigable than the true mountains but still difficult—a maze of ridges, box canyons, and seasonal streams that make travel unpredictable. Sy uses the Eskagon Hills as a buffer zone against both the mountain interior and the Traevluong werewolves to the south.

#### Moonwood

The great northern forest of Kyagos, stretching from the Sea of Seven Snakes coast inland to the mountain foothills. Dense canopy, ancient trees, and undergrowth thick enough to swallow armies. The Sylthik city-states never successfully colonized Moonwood—every attempt ended in disaster, ambush, or simple disappearance.

This is Dead Moon Tribe territory.

##### The Dead Moon Tribe

The humans who ruled Kyagos before the Sylthik arrived—and who never accepted their displacement. For generations they've maintained a fighting retreat into Moonwood, trading open warfare for guerrilla resistance. The Sylthik called them weakened, broken, finished. The smoking ruins of Syvlius suggest otherwise.

The tribe takes its name from Nyxara, the dark moon. Their shamans claim a special connection to Nyxara's cycles, drawing power from the nights when the dark moon dominates the sky. Their healing abilities are legendary—wounds that should kill close within hours, poisons that should be fatal become mere illness. The shamans say Nyxara accepts their pain so they may continue fighting.

Whether this is Psy magic, some form of shadow-aspected Kethic work, or something older remains unclear. What's clear is that Dead Moon warriors fight with unsettling fearlessness, knowing their healers can pull them back from injuries that would end other soldiers.

The revolution revealed what decades of low-intensity conflict obscured: the Dead Moon Tribe was never as weak as they pretended. They were waiting. When a band of outsiders arrived with a plan to free the Drasnian slaves, the tribe saw their opportunity. Dead Moon warriors poured out of Moonwood, joined the slave uprising, and helped reduce Syvlius to rubble.

Now they've retreated back to the forest, nominally. But their warriors patrol further south than they have in decades, and their shamans have been seen meeting with Drasnian leaders in the ruins. Something is being negotiated. The remaining Sylthik city-states are terrified to find out what.

##### Juniper Swamp

A fetid wetland in the heart of Moonwood, where the forest floor drops into permanent marsh. The Dead Moon Tribe uses it as a defensive barrier—outsiders who try to penetrate deep into Moonwood inevitably end up in the swamp, where they sink, sicken, or simply never emerge. The tribe knows the safe paths through. No one else does.

Local legend claims the swamp was created deliberately, flooded by Dead Moon shamans to deny the Sylthik a route into their territory. If true, it suggests capabilities the tribe has been careful to hide.

##### Xyrionn

In the northeastern edges of Moonwood, north and east of Juniper Swamp, stands Xyrionn—a giant tree stump with a maze leading to its center. The stump is all one piece of living wood, resistant to many forms of magic. A druid lives within the maze, and they will be furious if anyone attempts to burn or harm the sacred tree.

Dense overbrush prevents people from passing through the top of the maze, forcing them to navigate the deadly traps within. Only those who successfully reach the center prove themselves worthy of the druid's mentorship.

The druid's relationship with the Dead Moon Tribe is unclear. They share the forest but seem to operate independently, tolerating each other's presence without alliance or conflict.

##### Deathmarsh

Where Moonwood meets Jungula Serpentine, the terrain collapses into a stretch of poisoned wetland. The water here is discolored, the plants twisted, and the few creatures that survive are aggressive and wrong-looking. Neither the Dead Moon Tribe nor the Sylthik claim Deathmarsh—both avoid it.

Something is buried there. The corruption seeps from a central point, spreading slowly outward over centuries. Whatever it is, the Dead Moon shamans know about it and refuse to discuss it with outsiders.

#### Jungula Serpentine

The northwestern peninsula, a finger of jungle extending toward the Sea of Seven Snakes. Named for the serpents that infest its waterways—some venomous, some constrictors large enough to take a man, and rumors of something larger still in the deep interior.

Vassum nominally controls Jungula Serpentine, but "control" means they patrol the coast and maintain a few logging camps. The interior belongs to the snakes and whatever else lives there. Pirates from the Sea of Seven Snakes sometimes use the peninsula's hidden coves as anchorages, and Vassum's navy—such as it is—plays an eternal game of cat and mouse with smugglers running contraband through the serpent-infested waters.

#### Traevluong

The eastern coastal jungle, running from the Eskagon Hills down to the southern waters. Dense rainforest, heavy with moisture from the Alrock Ocean, where the canopy grows so thick that twilight reigns even at midday.

This is werewolf territory.

##### The Ulvsjael

The werewolves of Traevluong are not the cursed monsters of northern legend. The Ulvsjael are something older—werewolves who never transform to human form, remaining always in wolf form. They were born this way, their parents were born this way, and their ancestors have hunted these jungles since before human memory.

They are somewhat feral but not evil, living in harmony with the deep jungle. The Ulvsjael tolerate human presence at the jungle's edge but kill anyone who penetrates too deep into their territory. They don't negotiate, don't trade, don't communicate in ways the Sylthik understand. They simply enforce their borders with casual, efficient violence.

Sy has the misfortune of sharing a border with them. The city-state maintains a perpetual defensive posture along the Traevluong boundary, rotating patrols and watching for incursions. The werewolves rarely attack in force, but individual packs probe the defenses regularly, picking off isolated travelers and small parties who stray too close to the trees.

Silver helps. Sy's economy has pivoted toward silver extraction partly for this reason—a silver-bearing soldier stands a better chance against an Ulvsjael raider. But there are many werewolves in Traevluong, and even silver can't save you if you're outnumbered in the dark.

#### Mythlias

The southern jungle, stretching from the Killing Hills down to the coast. Less dense than Traevluong, more varied in terrain—patches of open savanna interrupt the forest, and rivers cut navigable channels toward the sea.

Tekos draws much of its agricultural base from Mythlias. The jungle provides timber, exotic plants, and game that supplements the city-state's mine-focused economy. Farming settlements dot the northern edges where the trees thin out, though they're fortified against raids from the Killing Hills.

The Kuru live here—beast-warriors who've adapted to jungle warfare in ways that make even the Sylthik nervous. They're not numerous enough to threaten the city-states directly, but they make Mythlias dangerous for anyone traveling without armed escort.

#### Killing Hills

The southern highlands between the Aktarvkus and Mythlias, where the mountains break down into a chaotic landscape of steep ridges and narrow valleys. The name is earned: these hills have killed more travelers, soldiers, and would-be settlers than any other region of Kyagos.

The Kuru beast-warriors treat the Killing Hills as sacred ground. Their warriors come here to prove themselves, hunting each other and anything else that enters. Surviving a solo journey through the Killing Hills marks a Kuru as an adult; dying there is considered an honorable fate.

For everyone else, the Killing Hills are simply an obstacle—one of several reasons why overland travel between Tekos and the western city-states rarely happens. Better to take a ship around the coast, despite the dangers, than to cross terrain where everything is trying to kill you.

#### Avakus Forest

A stretch of dense woodland west of Syvlius, climbing into the mountain foothills. Before the revolution, Syvlius used Avakus Forest as a buffer zone—patrols maintained order, logging operations extracted timber, and escaped slaves who fled this direction were hunted down.

Now Avakus is contested ground. Dead Moon warriors pass through heading south. Drasnian refugees hide in its depths. Sylthik survivors from Syvlius shelter in abandoned logging camps. And the Kuru, sensing weakness, have begun probing north from the Killing Hills.

#### The City-States

##### Syvlius

**Status: Destroyed**

What was the largest and wealthiest city-state on Kyagos is now a smoking ruin. The revolution didn't just overthrow the Sylthik rulers—it demolished the city itself. Buildings burned, walls were torn down, and the great trade tower that connected Syvlius to the astral current was toppled in a final act of destruction.

The city had grown around the lower slopes of Mount Syvlia, expanding outward from the original mining camps that first exploited the region's wealth. Lake Shikaya provided fresh water and a scenic centerpiece; the mines provided gems and precious metals that funded centuries of expansion. At its height, Syvlius controlled the best access to the astral current that passes roughly 35 miles east of the Aktarvkus peaks—close enough for profitable sky trade, far enough to require substantial infrastructure.

That infrastructure is gone. The trade tower's wreckage blocks what used to be the main approach to the city. The slave camps that once processed thousands of Drasnian workers have been torn apart, their materials repurposed for barricades and makeshift shelters. The mines still operate—someone is extracting wealth—but under whose authority and for whose benefit changes weekly.

###### Current State

Syvlius is controlled by Drasnians and gangs. Not a government, not even a coalition—just a chaotic patchwork of factions occupying different districts, controlling different resources, fighting each other as often as any external threat.

The heroes who led the revolution—Xe, Alice, Bryce, Woof, Bordrick, and Snuffles—have moved on. They lit the fire and left others to deal with the aftermath. Some Drasnians curse them for it; others consider them liberators regardless of what came next.

The Dead Moon Tribe maintains a presence, but they haven't occupied the city. Their warriors come and go, meeting with various Drasnian leaders, but they've retreated to Moonwood rather than trying to hold urban terrain. What they want from the alliance remains unclear.

###### Lake Shikaya

The lake still exists, now surrounded by ruins rather than palatial estates. Drasnian refugees have established camps along its shores, using the water access as a foundation for their attempts at rebuilding something functional. The lake's fish provide food; its position provides defensibility. If any organized settlement emerges from Syvlius's chaos, it will probably center here.

##### Vassum

The northwestern city-state, positioned where Moonwood meets Jungula Serpentine. Vassum has always been Kyagos's window to the outside world—the city-state most engaged with foreign trade, most tolerant of outsiders, most willing to bend the rigid Sylthik social codes when profit was involved.

The trade tower in Syvlius connected to the astral current, but goods still had to reach Syvlius somehow. Vassum controlled the sea routes, the overland passes, the warehouses where foreign cargo accumulated before the mountain crossing. This made them wealthy. It also made them dependent on Syvlius's infrastructure.

Now that infrastructure is gone, and Vassum is scrambling to adapt.

###### Post-Revolution Vassum

The city is flooded with refugees—Sylthik fleeing Syvlius, merchants whose businesses collapsed with the trade tower, opportunists hoping to profit from chaos. Vassum's traditional social order is straining under the pressure. The scar-ranking system feels increasingly absurd when five-scarred nobles sleep in warehouses alongside unscarred laborers.

Some in Vassum see opportunity. If they could establish their own connection to the astral current—build their own trade tower, find their own route through the mountains to the current's path—they could inherit Syvlius's economic position. The investment would be staggering, the engineering challenges severe, but the potential payoff enormous.

Others argue for intervention. Retake Syvlius, crush the rebellion, restore order. But Vassum's military was never strong, and the prospect of fighting through Dead Moon warriors and desperate Drasnians terrifies a population that hasn't seen real warfare in generations.

For now, Vassum waits, negotiates, and tries to maintain what trade it can through increasingly dangerous waters.

##### Tekos

The southern city-state, built on the shores of Lake Teklan where the mountains give way to Mythlias jungle. Tekos was always the most traditional of the four city-states—conservative, hierarchical, deeply invested in the scar-ranking system and the social order it represented.

The city sits roughly 35 miles from the astral current, on the opposite side of the mountains from Syvlius. Before the revolution, this was a disadvantage—Tekos had to route its exports through Syvlius's infrastructure, paying tolls and accepting dependency. Now that dependency is severed, and Tekos faces a choice: build its own connection to the astral trade, or accept permanent economic decline.

###### Post-Revolution Tekos

The city has adopted a fortress mentality. Walls are being strengthened. Slave populations are being watched more carefully than ever—any hint of unrest is crushed immediately and publicly. The Tekosi lords refuse to acknowledge that their social order might be vulnerable; instead, they double down, increasing the brutality of their rule in hopes of preventing their own Syvlius.

This is probably making things worse. The Drasnian slaves of Tekos have heard what happened in the north. They've heard that their kin now control the mines they once worked as property. Every execution, every public punishment, every reminder of their status feeds resentment that the Tekosi seem determined to ignore.

The city-state is also dealing with increased Kuru activity from the Killing Hills. The beast-warriors have noticed Kyagos's instability and are testing boundaries. Tekos can't afford to fight a two-front conflict—slaves within, Kuru without—but they may not have a choice.

###### Lake Teklan

A large freshwater lake providing Tekos with water, fish, and a natural defensive barrier on one flank. The city sprawls along its northern shore, with the wealthiest estates claiming waterfront positions and the slave quarters pushed to the margins. Boats cross the lake regularly, carrying ore from mountain mines to city refineries.

##### Sy

The eastern city-state, smallest of the four, perched between the Eskagon Hills and the Traevluong werewolf territory. Sy has always been embattled—the Ulvsjael don't recognize borders, don't negotiate truces, and don't stop probing for weakness.

This perpetual siege has shaped Sy's character. The city is militarized in ways the other city-states never needed to be. Service in the border patrols carries respect that military service elsewhere on Kyagos lacks. Silver is everywhere—weapons, jewelry, architectural details—both for practical defense and as cultural symbol.

###### Post-Revolution Sy

The chaos in Syvlius has left Sy isolated. The western route through the mountains is now contested ground; the southern route through Tekos is longer and more expensive; the sea route around the island means passing either the pirate-infested Sea of Seven Snakes or the Ulvsjael-haunted Traevluong coast.

Sy's response has been pragmatic rather than ideological. They've sent envoys to the Drasnian factions in Syvlius, not to demand restoration of the old order, but to establish trade relationships with whoever ends up in charge. They've even made cautious overtures to the Dead Moon Tribe, though those negotiations are proceeding slowly.

The Tekosi consider this treasonous. Vassum considers it premature. Sy considers it survival.

###### Kessus Lake

Eastern lake providing Sy with water and a secondary food source. Smaller than Teklan or Shikaya, but positioned to catch runoff from the Eskagon Hills. The Ulvsjael avoid the lake's immediate shores—one of the few reliable safe zones in the border region.

#### Towns & Villages

The city-states don't exist in isolation. Smaller settlements dot the coasts and mountain approaches—mining camps grown into permanent towns, fishing villages that supply the cities, waypoints on the few safe routes through the interior. Most owe allegiance to whichever city-state controls their region, though that control has always been lighter than the city-states pretend.

##### Vassum's Sphere

**Eleza** — A mining town in the foothills southeast of Vassum, positioned where the road toward Mount Essel begins its climb. Before the revolution, Eleza processed ore coming down from smaller mountain operations before it continued to Vassum's warehouses. Now it's swollen with refugees who couldn't afford passage into Vassum proper.

**Eko** — Fishing village on the western coast, technically under Vassum's protection but practically independent. The villagers pay nominal tribute and otherwise ignore the city-state's existence. Their boats work the Sea of Seven Snakes despite the pirate risk—the fishing is good, and they know the coastal waters better than any raider.

**Tissen** — Southwestern coastal town near where the Jungula Serpentine peninsula meets the main island. Vassum uses Tissen as a naval outpost, such as it is—a few patrol boats watching for smugglers and pirates. The posting is considered punishment duty.

##### Syvlius's Ruins

**Shaz** — A waypoint town on the mountain roads between Vassum and Syvlius. Before the revolution, merchant caravans rested here; guards rotated through on patrol duty. Now Shaz is caught between factions—Drasnian refugees fleeing the chaos, Dead Moon patrols pushing south, and Vassum interests trying to maintain the trade route. No one's in charge.

**Eiv** — Small settlement on the approaches to Syvlius, close enough that the smoke from the burning city was visible for days. Most residents fled during the revolution. Those who remained are now under the loose authority of whatever Drasnian faction controls the nearby district of the ruined city.

**Shia** — Village on the shores of Lake Shikaya, now absorbed into the refugee camps that ring the lake. The distinction between "Shia village" and "Shikaya camps" has blurred—it's all one sprawling, chaotic settlement of freed slaves trying to build something new.

##### Tekos's Territory

**Kilum** — Town in the southern foothills where the Tyatach River emerges from the Killing Hills. Kilum exists in a state of permanent tension—Kuru raiders come down from the hills regularly, and the town's militia has more combat experience than Tekos's actual army. The Tekosi lords resent this competence.

**Vim** — Eastern town near Lake Teklan, primarily agricultural. Vim's farms feed Tekos; Tekos's guards theoretically protect Vim. Since the revolution, those guards have been pulled back to the city, leaving Vim increasingly exposed to Kuru probing from the west.

**Lus** — Southeastern settlement in the Mythlias jungle, as far from Tekos's direct control as you can get while still nominally being part of the city-state. Lus survives by trading with anyone—Tekosi merchants, Kuru hunters, even the occasional Ulvsjael who wanders out of Traevluong. The Tekosi consider this treasonous flexibility; the Lusians consider it survival.

##### Sy's Border

**Sygosa** — The largest settlement outside the four city-states, positioned on the southeastern coast where the Sygum River meets the sea. Sygosa serves as Sy's primary port—the city itself sits inland, away from the werewolf-haunted coast, so Sygosa handles maritime trade. It's a tense place, with silver worn openly and weapons never far from hand.

##### The Unaffiliated

**Istriv** — A fishing village on the far southwestern coast, in the no-man's-land between Vassum's reach and the Sea of Sighs. Istriv owes allegiance to no city-state and pays tribute to none. The villagers are poor, isolated, and stubbornly independent. They fish the dangerous waters near Viper Rapids and sell their catch to whoever shows up with coin.

#### Rivers

##### Deadman's River

Flows from the western Aktarvkus down through Moonwood toward the Sea of Seven Snakes coast. Named for the bodies that occasionally wash downstream—casualties of mountain crossings, Dead Moon Tribe justice, or simple misadventure. Vassum monitors the river mouth but makes no attempt to control its upper reaches.

##### Merthcant River

Eastern drainage flowing from the Eskagon Hills through Traevluong to the Alrock Ocean. The Ulvsjael use it as a highway; Sy's patrols avoid it. Anyone traveling the Merthcant is in werewolf territory whether they acknowledge it or not.

##### Sygum River

Southeastern river connecting Kessus Lake to the coast. Sy maintains watchtowers along its length, the closest thing to a safe corridor through the eastern jungle. Even so, Ulvsjael raids hit the river settlements regularly.

##### Tyatach River

Southern river flowing through the Killing Hills to the coast west of Tekos. Theoretically navigable; practically suicidal. The Kuru consider the Tyatach theirs.

##### Mysik River

Drains the southern Aktarvkus through Mythlias to the sea. Tekos uses its lower reaches for timber transport, but the upper river passes through territory no one controls.

##### Viper Rapids

Not a river but a section of whitewater where western mountain drainage drops toward the Sea of Sighs coast. Named for the water serpents that congregate in the pools below the rapids, waiting for anything the current delivers.

### Lethos

Tags: state, nation, jungle, shacklands

A waterlogged jungle peninsula extending south into the Sea of Sighs, Lethos is one of the smallest and strangest states in the Shacklands. Its five thousand inhabitants—Faeja, Darklings, druids, and the changed folk of Qlyp Augo—live scattered across seven villages in a land that is as much water as earth. The jungle here grows from standing pools; the trees rise from brackish floods; the paths between villages are more canoe routes than roads.

Travelers from Gorath speak of Lethos with a particular silence. The empire's archives note it as "tribute-exempt, do not garrison," and no Gorathi soldier has set foot past the border in three hundred years. The official explanation is that Lethos has nothing worth taking—no farmland, no ore, no population worth assimilating. The unofficial explanation is older, stranger, and spoken only in certain taverns after too much wine: *the jungle remembers*.

#### The Binding of Qlyp Augo

Three centuries ago, Gorath did conquer Lethos.

The Fourth Legion crossed the border in the dry season of 412 PR, meeting little resistance. The Faeja melted into the deep jungle; the Darklings retreated into caves and ruins. Within two years, the empire had established a provincial capital at what is now Qlyp Augo—stone towers rising from filled swampland, administrative buildings, a garrison of three thousand, and the families and merchants who followed any Gorathi occupation.

For forty years, the occupation held. The jungle was difficult, the natives elusive, but the province was stable enough. Reports to Azantir mentioned minor incidents: soldiers who wandered off patrol and weren't found, strange sounds at night, a persistent sense of being watched. Nothing actionable.

The druids changed that.

The Faeja and Darklings couldn't win a conventional war—they were too few, too scattered, too poorly armed. But the druids who lived among them remembered older ways. They proposed a ritual that would bind the souls of the dying to the land itself. Every Gorathi who died in Lethos would not pass on. They would become part of the jungle—their hatred, their fear, their final moments woven into the trees and water and darkness.

The Faeja elders agreed. The Darklings provided the darkness. The druids began the Binding.

It took forty years because that's how long it took for enough soldiers to die.

The change was gradual. Patrols reported that the jungle felt *wrong*—trees in different positions than yesterday, familiar paths leading to unfamiliar places. Soldiers woke screaming from dreams of drowning, of being pulled into the earth, of faces they recognized pressed against the inside of bark. The darkness the Darklings commanded grew deeper, and things moved in it that weren't Darklings.

Then came the Night of Roots.

The provincial records end on the 15th of Third Quarter, 452 PR. The next morning, Gorathi scouts from a border outpost found Qlyp Augo silent. Every building stood intact. Every door was closed. Inside, nothing—no bodies, no blood, no signs of violence. Three thousand people simply *gone*. The only trace was the roots. Roots had grown up through the stone floors overnight, threading through every room, and when the scouts looked closely, they found the roots had shapes. Hands. Faces. The impression of screaming mouths.

The survivors—a few hundred who'd somehow been changed rather than taken—emerged from the swamps days later. They were no longer fully human. The jungle had accepted them as its own. They became the Gillykin.

Gorath does not speak of what happened at Qlyp Augo. The provincial records were sealed, then lost, then deliberately destroyed. But somewhere in the military archives in Azantir, there is a single standing order: *Lethos is forbidden.*

#### The Watching Council

Lethos is governed by what outsiders call an "open council," but the locals call the Vigil. Representatives from each of the seven villages meet at Xyrionn twice yearly—more often in times of crisis—to coordinate the ongoing maintenance of the Binding.

The Binding requires tending. The souls woven into the jungle strain against their imprisonment, especially during the double-new moons of Hollownight. The seven villages are positioned at key points along the peninsula where the Binding's weave is thinnest, and each village maintains shrines, rituals, and boundary-walks that keep the dead quiescent. The Vigil coordinates these efforts, resolves disputes between villages, and makes decisions about contact with the outside world.

There is no single leader. Decisions require consensus from at least five villages. This makes Lethos slow to act but almost impossible to subvert—there is no king to assassinate, no capital to conquer.

#### The Seven Villages

The villages of Lethos are small, rarely exceeding a few hundred residents. They are built on stilts or floating platforms, designed to move with the seasonal floods. Each has a character shaped by its position and role in maintaining the Binding.

**Tanekala** — The southernmost village, perched where the jungle meets the Sea of Sighs. Tanekala's residents are primarily Faeja fishers who venture into waters other sailors avoid. They report that the Binding extends into the sea around the peninsula—ships that approach too closely find their crews plagued by nightmares of drowning soldiers, and some captains swear they've seen Gorathi legionnaires marching beneath the waves.

**Altimarloch** — The largest village, closest to what passes for a road to Gorath. Altimarloch handles the rare legitimate contact with the outside world—traders brave enough to enter Lethos, the occasional Gorathi official delivering tribute-exemption notices (they never stay overnight), and the even rarer traveler seeking something in the jungle. The Darklings here are the most comfortable with outsiders, though "comfortable" is relative.

**Mangaone** — A Faeja village deep in the flooded interior, accessible only by canoe. Mangaone's residents are herbalists and poison-crafters, tending gardens of the toxic plants that flourish in Lethos's unique soil. They supply the other villages with medicines, ceremonial compounds, and the specific toxins used in certain Binding rituals.

**Erua** — Perched on one of the few areas of solid high ground in eastern Lethos, Erua is the village of the druids. Or rather, what remains of them. The druids who performed the Binding three centuries ago are still here, still alive, still dying. The ritual requires living anchors, and they have been unable to fully die ever since. Erua is part village, part hospice, part shrine. The other villagers bring them food and comfort; in return, the druids maintain the deepest layer of the Binding's magic.

**Ohoka** — A Darkling village in the deep jungle, where the canopy is so thick that true daylight never reaches the forest floor. Ohoka's residents are the keepers of the darkness, the specialists who ensure that the supernatural shadow blanketing Lethos remains deep enough to hide and strong enough to trap. They are also the closest thing Lethos has to a military—when threats arise, Ohoka's hunters move through the darkness to eliminate them.

**Mintai** — Built around a freshwater spring that somehow remains clear despite the brackish swamp surrounding it, Mintai is the village of memory. Its residents—a mix of Faeja, Darklings, and a few Gillykin—maintain the oral histories of Lethos, including the true account of the Binding and the Night of Roots. They are the only ones who speak the names of the Gorathi dead, because someone must remember them to keep them bound.

**Eptos** — The newest village, established only a century ago near the ruins of Qlyp Augo. Eptos serves as a buffer between the ruins and the living jungle, monitoring the Gillykin and ensuring that whatever sleeps in the drowned towers stays sleeping. Its residents are grim, fatalistic, and drink more than the other villages consider healthy.

#### Qlyp Augo

The ruins of the Gorathi provincial capital rise from the mangrove swamps of northeast Lethos—massive stone towers still standing after three centuries, their foundations drowned in brackish water, their windows dark and empty. Crocodiles nest in the flooded plazas. Birds refuse to roost on the walls.

The Gillykin live here.

They are the descendants of those Gorathi who survived the Night of Roots by accepting the jungle's terms. No one knows exactly what that means—the Gillykin don't speak of it, and the other peoples of Lethos don't ask. Physically, they no longer resemble the Gorathi of three centuries ago. Their skin has taken on greenish or grayish tones; their eyes have adapted to the permanent twilight of the ruins; their movements are too fluid, too quiet, as if they've learned to move like the water itself.

The Gillykin keep to Qlyp Augo. They harvest fish and crabs from the flooded streets, tend small gardens on the upper floors of the towers, and maintain a cold, careful distance from the other peoples of Lethos. They attend Vigil meetings but rarely speak. Their representative votes according to some internal logic the other villages have learned not to question.

What the Gillykin do in the ruins—what they remember, what they worship, what they guard—is their own business. The other villages are content to leave it that way.

#### Xyrionn

In the hills at the center of Lethos stands a tree stump the size of a castle.

The tree that once grew here must have been ancient beyond reckoning—the stump is a quarter-mile across, and the wood, though dead, refuses to rot. Paths wind through the exposed root system, creating a natural maze that leads to the hollow center. At the heart of the maze lives a druid named Veleth.

Veleth is old. How old, no one knows—certainly older than the Binding, possibly older than Gorath itself. They tend the maze, grow things in the hollow center, and react with violent fury to anyone who attempts to harm the sacred wood. The stump is resistant to most forms of magic, as if the tree's death somehow concentrated its essence into impenetrability.

The Vigil meets here because Xyrionn is the heart of the Binding. The roots that spread from this stump connect to every part of Lethos, and the souls of the Gorathi dead are woven through them. Veleth doesn't control the Binding—no one does, not anymore—but they understand it better than anyone. When the villages have questions about the dead, about the jungle's behavior, about signs and portents, they come to Veleth.

The maze is not just difficult to navigate. The root-paths shift, especially at night, especially during Hollownight. Those who enter without permission find themselves walking the same paths forever, or emerging days later with no memory of the intervening time, or not emerging at all. The dead do not like visitors.

#### The Jungle That Remembers

Lethos is dangerous to outsiders in ways that have nothing to do with conventional threats.

The Binding did what it was designed to do—it wove the souls of three thousand dead Gorathi into the land itself. But souls are not passive things. They strain. They hate. They *remember*. A traveler walking the jungle paths might feel watched, might hear whispers in languages they don't speak, might wake from sleep convinced someone was standing over them. These are the dead, pressing against the boundaries of their prison.

Worse things happen to those who stay too long.

The darkness in Lethos is unnatural. Even at noon, even in clearings, the light feels thin, filtered through something that isn't just canopy. At night, the darkness is absolute—thick enough to feel against your skin, deep enough that even magical light seems muted. The Darklings command this darkness, shape it, move through it freely. Outsiders are not so lucky.

The water cannot be trusted. Pools that look shallow go down forever. Rivers run in directions that change between visits. Thirst becomes dangerous—not because there's no water, but because the wrong water kills slowly, filling the drinker's dreams with the last moments of soldiers who drowned three centuries ago.

And then there are the roots.

They grow everywhere in Lethos—through the soil, up through the water, along the surfaces of trees. Most are ordinary. Some are not. The roots that carry pieces of the Binding are subtle, almost invisible, and they reach for the living. Not to kill—not usually—but to incorporate. To *remember*. A traveler who sleeps too close to the wrong roots might wake to find them growing through their blanket, their clothing, their flesh. The villages know how to treat this. Outsiders don't.

#### Relations with Gorath

Lethos exists because Gorath allows it to.

This is both more and less true than it appears. Gorath's standing orders forbid military operations in Lethos, and the institutional memory of the Night of Roots—however distorted and denied—ensures that no ambitious general proposes changing this. But the empire could still make Lethos's existence difficult through economic pressure, border enforcement, or simply encouraging bandits and raiders.

Instead, Gorath does none of these things. Lethos receives a "tribute exemption"—a bureaucratic category that officially recognizes it as too poor to be worth taxing. Gorathi border patrols stay on their side of the line. Merchants who trade with Lethos face no official sanctions.

Some in Lethos believe this is fear. Others believe it's calculation—better to have someone watching the Sea of Sighs than to garrison the peninsula yourself. A few whisper that someone in Azantir knows the truth about the Binding and understands that a war with Lethos would not end with Lethos defeated. It would end with the dead finally released.

#### Player Hooks

**The Binding Weakens** — The druids of Erua report that the Binding has been weakening for decades. The maintenance rituals require more effort each year; the dead are more restless; the roots grow more aggressively. Someone needs to find out why—and whether it can be reversed.

**Gillykin Secrets** — A Gillykin has contacted outsiders for the first time in living memory, claiming to have information about something buried beneath Qlyp Augo. Something the original Gorathi found. Something that might be why the druids chose this particular place for the Binding.

**Veleth's Heir** — The druid at Xyrionn is finally dying—truly dying, after centuries of maintaining their vigil. They need a successor, someone willing to learn the maze, the Binding, and the names of three thousand dead. They're looking beyond Lethos, because everyone in Lethos knows what the job actually requires.

**Gorathi Descendants** — Somewhere in Azantir, an old family keeps records of the Fourth Legion. They know their ancestors disappeared in Lethos three centuries ago. They've hired adventurers to enter Qlyp Augo and find proof of what happened—or, perhaps, to find survivors.

**The Sea Remembers** — Ships near Lethos have been disappearing with increasing frequency. The Faeja of Tanekala believe the Binding is spreading—that the dead are no longer content with the jungle, that they're reaching into the Sea of Sighs. If this continues, the major shipping lanes around the peninsula will become impassable.

### Lucenia River

### Lyoki Ingi Ingi

Tags: jungle, geography, mudzwiti, shacklands

A dense rainforest peninsula stretching south from the Shacklands interior, where the Mudzwiti goblins have built a civilization around death, dinosaurs, and the slow accumulation of glory. The jungle canopy blocks most sunlight, creating a perpetual green twilight beneath where utahraptors hunt in packs and goblin tribes compete for territory, hunting grounds, and the honor of the grandest tombs.

Lyoki Ingi Ingi runs approximately 150 miles from its northern roots to the southern tip, averaging 40-50 miles wide. The terrain is unforgiving—dense undergrowth, sudden ravines, rivers that flood without warning, and megafauna that views humanoids as convenient protein. Outsiders who enter without guides rarely return. The Mudzwiti do not offer guides.

Eight major villages dot the peninsula, each ruled by a tribal king whose lifespan stretches across centuries thanks to rare jungle plants that the Mudzwiti guard jealously. These kings accumulate wealth, followers, and elaborate tomb preparations over generations, competing not for territory but for legacy—who will be remembered longest, whose tomb will stand grandest, whose name will echo through the ages.

#### The Mudzwiti Way

The Mudzwiti are tribal goblins who have formed a symbiotic relationship with the utahraptors that roam their jungle home. Each tribe maintains raptor bloodlines spanning generations, with individual goblins bonding to specific animals in rituals that leave both parties marked. The goblins ride their raptors into battle and hunt, wearing the skulls of fallen dinosaurs as helmets and adorning their bodies with elaborate bone piercings and ritualistic scarification.

Death defines Mudzwiti culture. Not death as ending—death as legacy. A Mudzwiti's life is preparation for the tomb they will leave behind. The grandest tombs contain buried servants (volunteers who achieve honor through service), accumulated treasures, and murals depicting the deceased's greatest achievements. The quality of one's tomb determines one's status in whatever comes after.

The kings consume rare jungle plants that extend their lives dramatically—some have ruled for three or four centuries, accumulating vast wealth and elaborate tomb preparations. These plants grow only in specific locations, and knowledge of them is the kings' most guarded secret.

#### Villages

**Chikowe** — The northernmost village, closest to the mainland Shacklands. Chikowe serves as the reluctant point of contact for the rare outsiders who seek trade or passage. The village maintains a neutral ground at its northern edge where such interactions occur—foreigners do not enter the village proper.

**Gondowe** — A village built around an ancient stone structure that predates Mudzwiti settlement. The current inhabitants use it as a communal tomb for their kings, adding chambers and decorations with each generation. The oldest sections are no longer entered.

**Chriunda** — Known for its raptor breeders, who have cultivated the most aggressive and intelligent utahraptor bloodlines in the peninsula. Warriors from across Lyoki Ingi Ingi seek Chriunda-bred mounts.

**Mpakati** — A central village that controls access to one of the rare plant groves that extend goblin lifespans. The current king, rumored to be over 400 years old, maintains strict protocols about who may harvest and how much.

**Kadivivire** — Perched on elevated ground above the flood line, Kadivivire has never been submerged in the seasonal deluges. The village considers this evidence of divine favor and maintains an unusually elaborate religious practice centered on elevation and ascension.

**Nanda** — A village of craftsgoblins who specialize in bone-working, creating the intricate piercings, helmet-skulls, and decorative elements that define Mudzwiti aesthetics. Nanda work commands high trade value throughout the peninsula.

**Baswi** — The easternmost village, positioned where the jungle meets coastal waters. Baswi Mudzwiti have developed limited fishing traditions unusual for their people, and their tomb architecture incorporates shells and coral alongside the traditional bone.

**Matsikiti** — The southernmost village at the peninsula's tip, isolated and insular even by Mudzwiti standards. Matsikiti goblins maintain the oldest unbroken king-lineage in the peninsula, with oral histories stretching back over a thousand years. They consider the other villages upstarts.

#### Geography

The jungle interior defies easy mapping. Rivers shift course seasonally, trails become impassable within weeks, and the canopy blocks celestial navigation. The Mudzwiti navigate by raptor-scent, landmark trees, and generational memory—knowledge that cannot be extracted or easily shared.

Several ruins dot the deep jungle—structures that predate the Mudzwiti by unknown millennia, built by hands that were not goblin and perhaps not humanoid. The Mudzwiti use some as tomb foundations but do not claim to understand them. The deepest jungle, beyond where even hunting parties venture, contains things the Mudzwiti acknowledge exist but do not discuss with outsiders.

#### Relations

**Shykasas**: Neutral non-interference. The Alekroin swamps border Lyoki Ingi Ingi to the west at Molleres. Both peoples are fiercely territorial, which paradoxically makes them good neighbors—neither has any interest in the other's land, and both respect clearly marked boundaries.

**The Shacklands**: Minimal contact. The Mudzwiti do not participate in the slave trade and have no interest in Shacklands politics. Occasionally, escaped slaves find their way into the jungle. Those who survive the journey and prove useful are sometimes adopted into villages. Most do not survive the journey.

**Outsiders**: Deeply unwelcome. The Mudzwiti have nothing they want from the outside world and see no reason to accommodate visitors. Explorers, treasure hunters, and would-be colonizers enter the jungle periodically. The jungle tends to resolve such incursions without Mudzwiti intervention, but when necessary, the tribes cooperate with unusual efficiency.

### Moon Wilds

Tags: jungle, dangerous, frontier

The Moon Wilds are where Gorath's conquest ends. West of the Poison Hills, beyond the Myublin River, stretches a jungle that has defeated every attempt to tame it. The legions that march in rarely march out. The settlers who try to establish outposts are found weeks later—or never found at all. Something lives in the Moon Wilds that Gorath cannot conquer, cannot assimilate, and barely understands.

The empire claims this territory on maps. The territory disagrees.

#### Geography

The Moon Wilds occupy Gorath's western interior, a vast stretch of jungle running from the Poison Hills to the coast. The terrain is similar to the Jungles of Titania in composition—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, seasonal flooding—but somehow *worse*. The trees grow taller here, blocking more light. The vegetation is denser, more aggressive. And the wildlife... the wildlife is a problem.

The Myublin River serves as the practical border between controlled Gorath and the Wilds. East of the Myublin, the empire maintains patrols and outposts. West of it, they maintain prayers and a healthy respect for what they cannot defeat.

The jungle floor is perpetually dark, even at midday. Bioluminescent fungi and insects provide the only light in many areas, casting everything in pale blues and greens that give the region its name. When the actual moons are full, their light sometimes penetrates the canopy in scattered patches—the only times the forest floor sees natural illumination.

#### The Vexlings

The Moon Wilds' most dangerous inhabitants are neither animal nor humanoid in any conventional sense. The Gorathi call them **Vexlings**—a name that captures their most terrifying ability without describing what they actually are.

##### Appearance

Vexlings roughly resemble a grotesque fusion of goblin and spider. They stand three to four feet tall on six multi-jointed legs, with two smaller manipulator limbs near what might be called a head. Their bodies are covered in coarse, dark hair that blends perfectly with the jungle shadows. But it's the face—or what serves as one—that soldiers remember in their nightmares.

Six eyes arranged in two rows of three, each eye a different size and seeming to focus independently. The eyes glow faintly in darkness, a pale silver-white that's often the first—and last—warning of a Vexling's presence. Below the eyes, mandibles frame a mouth full of needle-like teeth, constantly working even when the creature is still.

They move with unsettling fluidity, equally comfortable on the ground, climbing trees, or hanging inverted from branches. They make almost no sound when they want to be silent.

##### The Trance

What makes Vexlings uniquely dangerous is their gaze. Meeting the eyes of a Vexling—all six of them—induces a hypnotic state that soldiers describe as "falling into silver." The victim stops moving, stops resisting, stops doing anything except staring as the Vexling approaches.

The trance isn't instantaneous; it takes several seconds of eye contact to take hold. But in the dense jungle, where Vexlings can appear suddenly from any direction, those seconds are hard to find. Veterans learn to fight with eyes averted, focusing on peripheral vision, but this dramatically reduces combat effectiveness.

The trance breaks when eye contact breaks—if a companion physically shoves a victim, if the Vexling looks away, or if the victim somehow finds the will to wrench their gaze aside. The latter is rare; most victims report feeling peaceful, even welcomed, as the trance deepens.

Those who fall fully into the trance and aren't rescued simply... follow. The Vexlings lead them deeper into the jungle. What happens after that, no one has returned to report.

##### The Blood

Vexlings bleed silver-white ichor that is catastrophically corrosive. A single drop on exposed skin causes severe chemical burns. A splash can eat through leather armor in seconds. Saturating contact—falling into a pool of it, being sprayed by a dying Vexling—is typically fatal.

This makes killing Vexlings almost as dangerous as fighting them. Soldiers have learned to use spears and polearms, keeping distance when striking, and to never, ever finish a Vexling with a blade at close range. The victory over a Vexling has cost more than one soldier their hands, their face, or their life.

The blood remains corrosive for approximately an hour after leaving the body, then neutralizes into a harmless silvery residue. Some alchemists have tried to collect and preserve it—results have been universally disastrous.

##### Behavior and Intelligence

Vexlings were once thought to be animalistic—dangerous predators, but predators nonetheless, operating on instinct. Recent encounters have challenged this assessment.

They now hunt in coordinated groups, with individuals taking specific roles: scouts, flankers, trance-inducers, and strikers. They set ambushes in locations soldiers must pass. They target officers and mages first. They retreat when outmatched, regroup, and attack again at a more advantageous moment.

Something is organizing them. Whether one of their kind has risen to unusual intelligence, some external force is directing them, or they've always been this smart and simply chose to reveal it now—no one knows. The empire's scholars argue; the soldiers who face them don't care about the explanation, only the result.

Some reports suggest the Vexlings have a language—chittering vocalizations that seem to carry meaning, repeated patterns that coordinate behavior. Other reports describe strange structures deep in the Wilds: webbed domes, tunnel systems, what might be nests or might be something more deliberate. No expedition sent to investigate these sites has returned.

#### The Campaign

Emperor Veramus has committed three legions to conquering the Moon Wilds over the past decade. The campaign has been, by any honest assessment, a disaster.

The jungle negates Gorath's tactical advantages. Legions can't maintain formation in dense vegetation. Supply lines stretch impossibly thin. The Vexlings don't hold territory that can be conquered—they fade into the jungle, wait for the legions to establish camps, then attack at night when the trance is hardest to avoid.

Casualty rates exceed thirty percent per deployment. Worse, many "casualties" aren't confirmed dead—they simply vanish, tranced and led away to unknown fates. This damages morale more than straightforward death; soldiers fear the Wilds in a way they don't fear enemy armies.

Current strategy focuses on containment rather than conquest. Outposts along the Myublin maintain watch for Vexling incursions into "civilized" Gorath. Patrols respond to sightings. The deep Wilds themselves are effectively ceded.

This represents an unacceptable failure by Gorathi standards—the Eternal March is supposed to advance, not stall. Veramus faces growing pressure to either achieve a breakthrough or acknowledge defeat. Neither option appeals.

#### The Myublin River

The Myublin winds through the Moon Wilds before crossing into Gorathi territory, eventually joining the larger river system that drains toward the coast. Along the border stretch, the empire maintains a string of watchtowers and small forts.

The river itself is dangerous to navigate—rapids, submerged obstacles, and the ever-present threat of Vexling attack from the banks. Few Gorathi willingly travel the Myublin deeper into the Wilds. Those who must typically travel by night, hoping darkness and quiet passage will let them slip past unnoticed.

The river serves as a practical boundary not because it's impassable—Vexlings cross it regularly—but because it provides a defensible line where the empire can concentrate forces. Fighting Vexlings in the Wilds is suicide. Fighting them on cleared ground near the river is merely dangerous.

#### Mysteries

The Moon Wilds hold secrets that Gorath has never uncovered:

**The Source**: Where do Vexlings come from? Are they natural creatures, magical constructs, or something else entirely? Their complete absence from any other region of Alaria suggests they're native to the Wilds specifically—but why here and nowhere else?

**The Purpose**: Why do Vexlings take tranced victims rather than simply killing them? Where do they go? Some theorize the victims are food; others suggest something darker. The lack of bodies supports neither theory.

**The Intelligence**: What changed? Why have the Vexlings become coordinated only in recent decades? Is there a leader, a hive mind, or something directing them from outside?

**The Ruins**: Deep in the Wilds, multiple expeditions have reported glimpsing structures that aren't Vexling nests—stone ruins of clearly humanoid construction, overgrown but unmistakable. Who built them? What connection do they have to the Vexlings? No one has gotten close enough to investigate and returned.

**The Light**: On certain nights, observers at the Myublin outposts report seeing lights deep in the Wilds—not the bioluminescence of the jungle or the eye-glow of Vexlings, but steady lights like fires or torches. They never move. They never go out. And they're always in different places.

#### For Adventurers

The Moon Wilds offer something rare in Gorath: genuine mystery. The empire that has conquered so much knows almost nothing about what lives in its own western territories. Anyone who could venture into the Wilds, survive, and return with information would find grateful—and wealthy—patrons in Azantir.

Of course, survival is the challenge. The Vexlings kill most who enter. The jungle claims many of the rest. And whatever lies at the heart of the Wilds—whatever explains the lights, the ruins, the sudden intelligence—may be worse than all of it combined.

Heroes looking to strike at Gorath might find unlikely allies in the Wilds. The Vexlings don't distinguish between the empire's soldiers and anyone else, but they also don't pursue escaped slaves or refugees who stumble through their territory. Some whisper that the underground railroad helping slaves escape passes through the Moon Wilds—that the most dangerous route is paradoxically the safest, because even Gorath won't follow you there.

### Pesalolo

Tags: island, geography, shacklands

A thousand-mile island running northeast to southwest, split in half by geography and politics alike. The Freedom Mountains form an unbroken spine from one end to the other, dividing Pesalolo into two coasts that rarely interact overland. The southern coast belongs to Gorath in all but name—the Slaver's Coast, where ships collect their human cargo for the crossing to Azantir. The northern coast is nominally independent Tamadrez, a scattering of villages and towns that survive by being too poor to conquer and too useful to destroy.

The island is dominated by jungle in the lowlands and dense highland forest along the mountain slopes. Rivers drain from the central peaks toward both coasts, creating the only practical routes through otherwise impassable terrain.

#### The Freedom Mountains

The central mountain range bisecting Pesalolo, running the full length of the island. The name is bitterly ironic or desperately hopeful depending on who uses it—the mountains are both the barrier that prevents Gorath from simply conquering the north, and the escape route for slaves fleeing the southern coast.

The range comprises several named sections:
- **Apuindi Mountains** — The eastern section, rising from the coast near Divinity Passage
- **Gesichi Mountains** — The central section, where Slavewatch fortress commands the major passes
- **Tishkung Mountains** — The southwestern section, descending toward the Ryujilin Hills

The mountains are high enough to catch clouds, keeping the slopes perpetually damp and the passes frequently fogged. Gorathi military expeditions have repeatedly failed to establish permanent control of the highland routes—the terrain favors those who know it, and the Drasnian dwarves have known it for millennia.

#### Slaver's Coast

The southern coast of Pesalolo, stretching from Divinity Passage in the east to the Tishkung foothills in the west. Gorath has occupied this coast for three centuries, extracting Drasnian dwarves for the empire's labor needs. There was no treaty, no negotiation—Gorath simply took what it wanted and announced the terms.

Dozens of small ports dot this coast, each little more than a dock, a holding pen, and a few permanent structures for the slavers who manage the trade. Ships run a regular circuit from port to port, collecting captives until their holds are full, then crossing through the Torgan Passage or around Agorf Island to reach Divinity Passage and the journey north to Azantir.

The shipping lanes are visible from the highlands—a constant procession of vessels, predictable as tides.

#### Yava

The largest city on Pesalolo, at the island's southwestern tip where the Ryujilin Hills meet the sea. Yava exists because everyone needs it to exist.

The city is the only major deepwater port between Screamstrait and the Slave Coast—a geographic necessity for any vessel crossing the Gindrik Sea. Ships from Ethadia, Shir Island, Windori, and points beyond require Yava for resupply, repair, and shelter from the storms that sweep through Screamstrait seasonally. Merchants from a dozen nations use the port as neutral ground.

This makes Yava untouchable.

Gorath could reach it. The imperial navy is more than capable of sailing around Pesalolo and burning the city to the waterline. But doing so would destabilize trade across the entire region—including Gorath's own legitimate commerce. Every major trading power has made clear, through diplomatic channels, that destroying Yava would have consequences.

So Gorath pretends Yava is a minor fishing town beneath imperial notice. Yava pretends it doesn't shelter escapees from the Slave Coast. Everyone maintains the fiction because the alternative hurts everyone's bottom line.

**Population**: Large by Tamadrezan standards—perhaps thirty thousand permanent residents, with thousands more transients at any given time. The majority are Drasnian dwarves, but foreign sailors, traders, and people who don't ask questions have made Yava genuinely cosmopolitan.

**Character**: Yava is not a resistance headquarters or a utopia. It is a grubby, pragmatic port city that survives by being useful to people who could destroy it. The docks smell of fish and tar. The taverns serve anyone with coin. The city watch takes bribes but maintains enough order to keep merchants coming back.

The closest thing Tamadrez has to a capital, though no one would call it that officially. When Tamadrezan leaders need to coordinate—which is rarely—they meet in Yava. When escaped slaves make it through the mountains and need to disappear, many end up here. When Gorathi deserters want a new life, Yava doesn't ask about their past.

The city faces southwest, toward Screamstrait and the wider world, deliberately turning its back on the Slave Coast hundreds of miles to the east. This orientation is architectural and philosophical. Yava wants nothing to do with Gorath's business—as long as Gorath leaves it alone.

#### Ryujilin Hills

Low, rolling highlands at Pesalolo's southwestern tip, where the Freedom Mountains finally descend to the sea. Less dramatic than the central peaks but equally important—the hills provide defensible terrain around Yava and make any overland approach to the city costly.

The hills are drier than the rest of Pesalolo, catching less rainfall in the mountain shadow. Scrubland and scattered forest rather than dense jungle. Goatherds and farmers work the slopes, supplying Yava's markets.

#### Scream Strait

The waters off Pesalolo's southwestern tip, between the island and Shir to the south. Named for the winds that howl through during storm season, Screamstrait is notoriously dangerous for navigation. The currents are treacherous, the weather unpredictable, and the rocky approaches to Yava have claimed dozens of ships over the centuries.

Local pilots make good money guiding vessels through. Captains who try to save the fee often regret it.

#### The Northern Archipelago

A cluster of islands north of Pesalolo, between the mainland and Pukot Island. The largest is Shinori Island, lair of the dragon Agtakkeri. The archipelago also includes Liki Forest island to the south of Shinori—a densely wooded island that takes its name from the forest covering its entire surface.

The islands are largely uninhabited due to Agtakkeri's presence. Fishermen from the Tamadrezan coast give them wide berth. The waters between the archipelago and Pesalolo are called the Skinning Grounds by Gorathi sailors, who refuse to enter them.

See [Agtakkeri](../../bestiary/dragons/Agtakkeri.md) for details on the dragon's territory and behavior.

#### Torgan Passage

The strait between Pesalolo and Agorf Island to the south. Slave ships use this passage to reach the eastern Slave Coast ports, though the route is longer than sailing around Agorf. The passage is relatively calm and well-charted, making it preferred by captains who value predictability over speed.

#### Divinity Passage

The major maritime corridor separating Pesalolo from Gorath's mainland. All slave traffic ultimately flows through Divinity Passage on its way to Azantir. The passage is heavily traveled, well-patrolled by Gorathi naval vessels, and—for the enslaved—the last sight of home they will ever see.

See [Divinity Passage](Divinity%20Passage.md) for full details.

### Shinori Island

Tags: island, geography, shacklands, dragon

The largest island in the northern Pesalolo archipelago, and the lair of Agtakkeri the Flayed Banner. Shinori sits between Pukot Island to the north and the Liki Forest island to the south, commanding the waters that Gorathi ships must traverse to reach the northern Tamadrezan coast.

No one lives on Shinori by choice.

#### Geography

Shinori is roughly fifteen miles long and eight miles wide, a volcanic remnant rising steeply from the sea. The western face slopes gradually toward a rocky beach; the eastern face drops in sheer cliffs to the water. Dense jungle covers the interior, fed by rainfall that the island's central peak wrings from passing clouds.

The coastline is mostly inaccessible—cliffs, rocks, and violent surf make landing difficult everywhere except a few protected coves on the western shore. These coves are where Agtakkeri brings its prey.

#### The Lair

Agtakkeri's lair occupies a network of sea caves on the eastern cliff face. The caves are accessible only at low tide by swimming through flooded tunnels, or by approaching from the air—neither option practical for most visitors. The cave system extends deep into the island's volcanic core, with chambers above and below the waterline.

The dragon has occupied this lair for at least six centuries, possibly longer. The caves show signs of deliberate modification—passages widened, chambers smoothed, defensive chokepoints created. Agtakkeri has made the lair specifically defensible against the dragonslaying expeditions it knows will continue coming.

The main chamber, by the accounts of the few who have seen it and survived, contains Agtakkeri's ledger: the physical record of its centuries-long vendetta against Gorath. Ship figureheads line the walls. Preserved banners hang from the ceiling. Bones—some arranged, some scattered—cover the floor in drifts. The dragon knows the origin of every trophy.

#### The Western Shores

The coves on Shinori's western coast are killing grounds.

When Agtakkeri takes prisoners from Gorathi ships, it brings them here. The rocky beaches show evidence of prolonged occupation: fire pits, restraint points carved into the stone, dark stains that the tide never quite washes away. Fishermen from Pukot Island have heard screaming carry across the water for days after an attack.

The dragon asks its prisoners questions. Names. Ranks. Family connections. It particularly wants to know if any are descended from the Veryx bloodline—the dragonslayer dynasty that scarred its eye. Those prisoners receive special attention.

#### Survivors

Occasionally, escaped slaves wash up on Shinori after surviving one of Agtakkeri's attacks on slave ships. They jumped overboard before the dragon's arrival and swam until they hit land.

These survivors find themselves in a strange situation. Agtakkeri ignores them completely. They are not Gorathi. They are not interesting. The dragon's territorial instincts apparently don't extend to shipwrecked individuals crawling up its beaches.

But surviving on Shinori is difficult. The jungle provides food and water, but the island offers no easy escape. Building a raft capable of reaching Pukot Island—visible on clear days to the north—takes time and materials. Some survivors have spent weeks on Shinori before escaping, hiding in the interior whenever Agtakkeri returns from a hunt, listening to the screaming from the western coves.

Those who make it to Pukot tell stories that spread through the underground railroad networks. Shinori has become an accidental waystation for the desperate—terrible to endure, but better than the alternative.

#### The Skinning Grounds

The waters around Shinori, extending south toward the Tamadrezan coast and east toward Divinity Passage, are called the Skinning Grounds by Gorathi sailors. Naval maps mark the area with a simple skull. Vessels flying Gorathi colors do not enter this zone except under direct imperial orders—and those orders come rarely.

This creates a de facto safe corridor for small boats fleeing north from the Slave Coast. Gorathi patrol vessels won't follow into the Skinning Grounds. If escapees can make it past Slavewatch and reach the northern coast, they can sail for the archipelago knowing the dragon will ignore them while hunting their pursuers.

The irony is not lost on anyone. Agtakkeri has saved more escaped slaves than any underground railroad—not because it cares about them, but because killing Gorathi is more important.

#### Pukot and Liki Forest

The other major islands in the archipelago maintain a careful distance from Shinori.

**Pukot Island** lies to the north, separated from Shinori by a strait roughly five miles wide. A small fishing community lives there, descendants of Tamadrezans who settled the island centuries ago. They keep their boats small, their profile low, and their relationship with the mainland minimal. When survivors from Shinori arrive on makeshift rafts, Pukot's fishermen take them in without asking questions. The dragon has never attacked them. They intend to keep it that way.

**Liki Forest island** lies to the south, named for the dense woodland covering its entire surface. The island is uninhabited and largely unexplored. Fishermen avoid it—not because of the dragon, but because the currents around Liki are unpredictable, and the forest has a reputation. What that reputation involves, the fishermen don't specify. They just don't go there.

#### Hooks

- **The Survivor's Tale**: A Drasnian dwarf survived weeks on Shinori before escaping to Pukot. They know the island's layout, Agtakkeri's patterns, and the location of something they saw in the jungle—something that predates the dragon. They want help retrieving it.

- **Into the Lair**: Someone needs something from Agtakkeri's trophy collection—a ship's log, a specific banner, evidence of what happened to a particular vessel. Getting in and out without disturbing the dragon will require perfect timing and significant luck.

- **Liki Forest**: The fishermen's warnings about Liki are vague but consistent. Something lives in that forest. With Agtakkeri's territory so close, investigating seems suicidal—which is exactly why no one has done it.

- **The Pukot Question**: The fishing community has survived near Agtakkeri for generations. How? The dragon ignores them, but why? Some suspect an old arrangement. Others think the community has been compromised. The truth might be simpler—or much more complicated.

### Shir

Tags: island, geography

TODO

### Shykasas

Tags: state, nation, shacklands, alekroin

A saltwater swamp kingdom sprawling across a broken archipelago southwest of Kyagos, where the Alekroin have ruled as apex predators for millennia. The landscape is a maze of tidal channels, mangrove thickets, and flooded grasslands—terrain that would swallow armies but yields its secrets to those who evolved within it. Outsiders call it inhospitable. The Alekroin call it home.

Shykasas occupies roughly 400 miles of coastline and island chains between the Sea of Sighs to the north and the open waters to the south. The climate runs hot and humid year-round, with monsoon seasons that raise water levels by several feet and transform the interior into a vast shallow lake. During dry months, the waters recede to expose mudflats teeming with shellfish, waterfowl, and the unfortunate.

The Alekroin do not participate in the Shacklands slave trade. They have no interest in it. Their isolation is not political neutrality—it is the simple indifference of apex predators toward the squabbling of prey. Gorath's slavers give Shykasas waters a wide berth. The few who didn't learned why.

#### Vila Bonsa

The capital rises from the central archipelago on wooden platforms and stone foundations driven deep into the muck. Buildings stand on stilts, connected by walkways that flood predictably with the tides. The Alekroin designed it this way. What looks like poor planning to visitors is actually architecture optimized for ambush—the water beneath the walkways is never empty.

The Palace of the Six Jaws dominates the city center, a sprawling complex where the King and the six noble houses conduct their slow, deliberate politics. Royal succession follows an ancient ritual: an egg is selected from the King's brood, incubated at precise temperatures in isolation, watched by keepers who will never see it hatch. The chosen heir grows larger, stronger, and more cunning than any other Alekroin—a process the Alekroin do not explain and outsiders do not understand.

Vila Bonsa's markets trade in swamp goods: cured hides, medicinal plants, bioluminescent algae harvested from the deeper channels, and shellfish in varieties found nowhere else. Metal is the primary import—the swamps offer little ore. Merchants who trade here learn quickly that the Alekroin do not haggle. They state a price. You accept it or you leave.

#### Turiik Forest

The northern reaches of Shykasas transition from saltwater marsh to dense coastal forest where the tides still reach but the canopy blocks the sun. Turiik Forest marks the boundary between Alekroin territory and the lands beyond—a buffer zone of mangroves, strangler figs, and root systems that rise from the water like wooden cathedrals.

The Alekroin hunt here but do not settle. The forest belongs to older things—massive crocodilians that even the Alekroin treat with wary respect, and stranger creatures that surface only at night. Outsiders sometimes attempt to use Turiik as a route into Shykasas, reasoning that forest offers more cover than open water. The Alekroin find this amusing.

Several of the noble houses maintain hunting lodges at the forest's edge, where young Alekroin prove themselves against increasingly dangerous prey. Returning with a crocodilian skull larger than one's own head is considered a respectable coming-of-age achievement.

#### Soso Mari

The great tidal bay that defines Shykasas's southern coast, where the archipelago opens into deeper waters. Soso Mari runs roughly 60 miles across at its widest point, shallow enough that low tide exposes vast mudflats but deep enough at high tide for ocean-going vessels—if any dared enter.

Gorath has made overtures about establishing shipping lanes through Soso Mari, which would cut travel time between the central Shacklands and the western reaches. The Alekroin have not responded to these diplomatic inquiries. Three Gorathi survey vessels have entered the bay over the past century. None returned. Gorath has not pressed the issue.

The bay teems with life. Shellfish beds cover the shallows. Schools of fish enter with the tide and become trapped in pools as the water retreats. The Alekroin harvest methodically, taking only what they need, maintaining the abundance that has fed them for generations. Foreign fishing vessels are not tolerated.

#### Settlements

**Sornas** — A fishing village on the western islands, known for its shell-divers who harvest rare specimens from deeper waters. The village supplies Vila Bonsa with most of its decorative shells and pearls.

**Bixesarri** — A town on the outer archipelago where the few foreign traders permitted in Shykasas conduct their business. Alekroin rarely enter the trading posts themselves; intermediaries handle the actual exchanges.

**Erez** — A southern settlement near the mouth of Soso Mari, functioning as an informal coastwatch. The Alekroin stationed here track all vessel movements in the surrounding waters.

**Ansalonga** — A town at the edge of Turiik Forest, serving as a staging ground for hunting expeditions. Young Alekroin from across Shykasas travel here to prove themselves.

**Molleres** — An eastern settlement near the border with Lyoki Ingi Ingi. Relations with the Mudzwiti goblins of the jungle are neither friendly nor hostile—both peoples respect territorial boundaries and leave each other alone.

**Arinsal** — A central town in the archipelago's interior, notable for its extensive aquaculture pools where the Alekroin cultivate shellfish and certain medicinal plants.

#### Thizun

A ruined temple complex on a small island northwest of the main archipelago, visible only at low tide. The stone architecture predates the Alekroin settlement by unknown millennia—the construction style matches no known civilization, and the carvings depict creatures that do not exist in any bestiary.

The Alekroin consider Thizun taboo. Not from fear, exactly—they simply do not go there, following a custom so old that no one remembers its origin. When asked, they say only that "the old ones told us not to." Whether this refers to their ancestors or something else entirely remains unclear.

Treasure hunters occasionally attempt to explore the ruins. Some return with strange artifacts—geometric stones that hum faintly, metal tablets inscribed with unknown scripts. Most don't return at all. The Alekroin do not interfere with these expeditions. They also do not help.

Rumors persist of something that moves in the submerged chambers when the tide rises. The Alekroin do not confirm or deny these stories. They simply don't discuss Thizun at all.

### Slaver's Coast

Tags: coast, geography, shacklands

See [Pesalolo](Pesalolo.md#slavers-coast) for full details.

The southern coast of Pesalolo, where Gorath operates its slave extraction operation. Ships run port-to-port collecting Drasnian dwarves for transport through Divinity Passage to Azantir.

### Slavewatch

Tags: fortress, poi, tamadrez, shacklands

A Gorathi fortress carved into the central Freedom Mountains, overlooking the Slaver's Coast and the shipping lanes that connect the slave ports to Divinity Passage. Slavewatch was built to monitor the mountain passes and prevent escaped slaves from reaching the northern coast. After two centuries, it has become something else entirely: a corrupt institution that profits from both sides of the trade it ostensibly polices.

#### Purpose

Officially, Slavewatch exists to:
- Monitor the mountain passes connecting north and south Tamadrez
- Intercept escaped slaves attempting to flee through the highlands
- Report escape network activity to Gorathi authorities
- Provide a Gorathi military presence deep in Tamadrezan territory

In practice, Slavewatch does all of these things—inconsistently, selectively, and for a price.

#### The Arrangement

The fortress garrison has been stationed here for generations. Soldiers rotate in from Gorath, but the command structure has become hereditary in all but name. The current commander, **Tribune Kassander Volso**, inherited the post from his father, who inherited it from his.

Kassander understands something his distant superiors in Azantir do not: Slavewatch's power comes from being *necessary* to everyone.

**For Gorath**: Slavewatch reports enough captured escapees to justify its existence. It identifies enough underground railroad contacts to demonstrate vigilance. It never catches *all* the escapees, of course—that would end the problem and end the posting.

**For the northern villages**: Slavewatch looks the other way for the right price. A village can pay a "navigation fee" and Kassander's patrols will coincidentally be elsewhere when escaped slaves move through. The fortress takes bribes in coin, goods, and information.

**For the slavers**: Slavewatch provides intelligence on which coastal towns are accepting new cargo and which are temporarily "full." Captains who donate generously to the garrison's "comfort fund" receive favorable docking assignments and advance warning of inspection schedules.

**For the escapees themselves**: Some make it through the passes because Slavewatch was bribed. Others are captured because someone paid more. The system is arbitrary, cruel, and—from Kassander's perspective—beautifully profitable.

#### The Fortress

Slavewatch occupies a spur of the Gesichi Mountains where three major passes converge. The original structure was Drasnian—a watchtower from before the Gorathi arrival—but two centuries of expansion have transformed it into a substantial fortification. Walls of local stone blend into the mountainside. The main keep commands views of all three passes and the coastal lowlands beyond.

The garrison numbers approximately two hundred soldiers, though this fluctuates. Most are Gorathi regulars on extended "frontier posting"—a punishment detail in theory, a profit opportunity in practice. Veterans request assignment here. Kassander only accepts soldiers he can trust to keep their mouths shut.

Beneath the fortress, the Drasnian tunnels remain partially intact. These passages predate Gorathi occupation and extend deep into the mountain. The garrison uses them for storage, but older sections have been sealed. What the original builders were doing inside the mountain, the current occupants prefer not to investigate.

#### Commander Volso

Tribune Kassander Volso is fifty-three years old, heavyset, and smarter than he appears. He speaks fluent Drasnian (unusual for a Gorathi officer) and has lived on Pesalolo for his entire adult life. His wife was a Tamadrezan woman who died in childbirth; his son serves in the garrison.

Kassander's loyalty is to Kassander. He wears Gorathi colors because Gorath pays his salary and could crush him if sufficiently motivated. He takes bribes from northerners because they pay well and he genuinely finds the slave trade distasteful—not morally, just aesthetically. He's seen what the ships look like inside.

He has no intention of ending the system. He has every intention of dying rich.

Emperor Veramus suspects Slavewatch is corrupt but lacks proof and—more importantly—lacks a better alternative. Replacing Kassander would require finding someone both competent enough to manage the passes and incorruptible enough to actually do the job. Such people exist, but they tend to die of "mountain fever" before their first year ends.

#### The View

From Slavewatch's upper battlements, on a clear day, you can see the Slaver's Coast stretching east toward Divinity Passage. The shipping lanes are visible as a dark thread across the water—the constant traffic of vessels moving between the coastal ports and Azantir.

Looking north, the Freedom Mountains continue their spine-like march across the island. The passes disappear into highland jungle. Somewhere in those passes, at any given moment, someone is fleeing for their life.

The garrison watches both directions. They place bets on which ships will make it through Agtakkeri's territory. They speculate about which villages will be next to receive a "navigation fee" request. They do their jobs, more or less, and they go home rich.

#### Hooks

- **The Honest Officer**: A new sub-commander arrives from Azantir with orders to clean up Slavewatch. Kassander needs the problem solved quietly. The party could help either side—or play them against each other.

- **The Sealed Tunnels**: Something is moving in the old Drasnian passages. The garrison has heard sounds. Kassander wants it investigated before he has to report it to anyone official.

- **The Price of Passage**: The party needs to move escaped slaves through the mountains. Kassander will deal—but his price isn't gold. He wants information about the underground railroad's network. Giving it to him means selling out future escapees.

- **The Emperor's Spy**: Veramus has finally sent someone to investigate Slavewatch properly. The spy's cover is convincing. The party might be hired to protect them—or to expose them before they report back.

- **Kassander's Insurance**: The commander has kept records of every bribe, every looked-the-other-way, every Gorathi official who took money to ignore what Slavewatch really does. If he dies, those records go public. Someone wants to find and destroy them before that happens.

### Strymün Island

Tags: island, geography

The Strymün Isles rise from the Gindrik Sea like green jewels set in blue-gray water—a cluster of volcanic islands whose peaks remain visible for miles in clear weather. The main island, simply called Strymün, is the largest landmass between the Salt Flats and the distant Free Isles, making it a natural waypoint for maritime traffic.

#### Geography

The archipelago consists of one major island and several smaller satellites:

- **Strymün** (the main island): Approximately eighty miles long and forty wide at its broadest point, dominated by twin volcanic peaks and heavily forested lower slopes
- **The Strymün Isles** (smaller satellites): A dozen inhabited islets plus countless rocks and shoals, scattered in a rough arc northeast of the main island

The main island's terrain divides naturally into three zones:

**The Highlands**: The volcanic interior, where twin peaks—Mount Aldris and Mount Brevani—rise above the treeline. Aldris is dormant; Brevani vents steam and occasional ash, a reminder that the island's fires have not entirely died.

**The Greenwood**: Temperate forest covering the mid-slopes, fed by reliable rainfall and volcanic soil. This is Ethadia's breadbasket—farms, orchards, and hunting grounds that support the population.

**The Coast**: Rocky cliffs on the windward side, gentler harbors on the leeward. Most settlements cluster along the southern and western shores, sheltered from the worst of the Gindrik storms.

#### Climate

Maritime and mild. Winters are wet rather than cold; summers are warm but rarely brutal. The volcanoes generate their own weather patterns—morning fog rolling down the slopes, afternoon thermals carrying seabirds to improbable heights. The northern coast catches the full force of Gindrik storms, limiting development there.

#### Resources

The Strymün Isles lack the mineral wealth of continental territories. Their value lies in position and productivity:

**Agriculture**: Volcanic soil supports intensive farming. The Greenwood produces grain, fruit, timber, and game sufficient to feed the islands' population with surplus for export.

**Fisheries**: The surrounding waters teem with life. Ethadian fishing fleets range across the Gindrik, and smoked fish is a significant export.

**Harbor Access**: The main island offers multiple natural harbors suitable for deep-water vessels—rare in this region of the Gindrik. This geography made Ethadia's commercial success possible.

### Ethadia

Tags: state, nation

Ethadia is what remains when ambition meets geography. A maritime trading state that has survived for centuries by making itself useful to everyone and threatening to no one, Ethadia occupies the Strymün Isles and maintains commercial relationships with powers that would destroy each other given the opportunity.

#### Character

The Ethadians pride themselves on neutrality, discretion, and the ability to conduct business with anyone. Their ships carry Kuzagt salt to markets that would never trade directly with Bonnetaz. Their banks hold deposits from Gorathi merchants and escaped slaves alike. Their diplomats speak every language, follow every custom, and commit to nothing.

This flexibility has a cost. Ethadia's hands are perpetually dirty. They profit from the slave trade without owning slaves. They facilitate atrocities they would never commit. They watch their trading partners brutalize each other and calculate their margins.

The older generation considers this wisdom—survival through accommodation. The younger generation increasingly calls it cowardice.

#### History

Ethadia was founded roughly eight centuries ago by refugees from a mainland conflict whose details have been deliberately obscured. The founders established Regina as a trading post, built relationships with the Kuzagt (then a minor power), and gradually accumulated the wealth to buy independence.

For most of its history, Ethadia has avoided the wars that consume its neighbors. When Gorath rose, Ethadia offered tribute and trade agreements. When Bonnetaz expanded its slave operations, Ethadia provided shipping services. When the Free Isles declared independence from various powers, Ethadia recognized all of them and none, maintaining relationships without commitments.

This strategy has worked. Ethadia has never been conquered. But it has also never been respected. Other powers view Ethadians as useful parasites—tolerated for their services, despised for their flexibility.

#### Government

Ethadia operates as an aristocratic republic. The Crown is hereditary within the Aldric dynasty, currently worn by Queen Morvena III (age 67, ruling for 31 years). The Crown's powers are substantial but checked by the Council of Families—representatives of the twelve oldest noble houses, each holding their seat by hereditary right.

In practice, power resides with whoever controls the shipping revenues. The Crown controls the royal fleet and harbor fees. The Families control the merchant houses that generate most of the kingdom's wealth. Conflict between them is constant, bitter, and carefully constrained—no one wants to damage the commercial system that enriches both sides.

The common population has no formal political voice but enjoys significant practical freedoms. Ethadia needs skilled sailors, competent clerks, and reliable workers. Oppressing them would be economically foolish.

#### Economy

Trade is everything. Ethadia produces enough food to survive but not enough to thrive. Its wealth comes from moving other peoples' goods:

**Transshipment**: Goods pass through Ethadian ports to reach markets that won't deal with their origins. Kuzagt salt becomes "Ethadian salt." Gorathi timber becomes "Gindrik lumber." The markup is substantial.

**Banking**: The major houses offer financial services with legendary discretion. Deposits are secure, loans are available, and no one asks where the money came from.

**Information**: Ethadian merchants hear things. This information has value, carefully commodified and sold to interested parties.

**Neutral Ground**: Enemies meet in Ethadian territory to negotiate truces, exchange prisoners, or conduct business that would be impossible elsewhere. Ethadia charges for this privilege.

#### Military

Ethadia maintains a defensive navy of approximately forty vessels—enough to discourage casual piracy, insufficient to threaten any major power. The fleet's primary purpose is escort duty: protecting Ethadian merchants from the hazards of the Gindrik Sea.

Land forces are minimal. The islands' geography makes invasion difficult, and Ethadia relies on diplomatic relationships rather than walls. A small professional guard maintains order in the cities; beyond that, the population is expected to arm itself if circumstances require.

This military weakness is deliberate. An armed Ethadia would threaten its neighbors and invite the very conflicts it seeks to avoid.

#### Society

Ethadian society stratifies by wealth rather than birth, though the two often coincide. The aristocracy—the Aldric crown and the twelve Families—control most significant assets. A prosperous merchant class operates in their shadow, wealthy enough for comfort but not powerful enough to challenge the established order. Below them, sailors, craftspeople, and laborers work for wages or shares.

Slavery is technically legal but practically extinct. The Ethadians discovered early that free workers are more productive and less troublesome. The handful of slaves in the kingdom are foreign-owned, passing through Ethadian ports en route to destinations that don't share these scruples.

This technicality enables Ethadian hypocrisy. They don't own slaves. They merely transport them, insure them, and bank the proceeds of their sale.

#### Religion

Ethadia observes standard Alarian religious practices without distinctive local traditions. Temples to major deities operate in both cities. The population is conventionally pious without notable fervor.

One exception: mariners throughout the kingdom venerate Pelagos, a local spirit or minor deity associated with safe passage. Offerings to Pelagos are made before every voyage—fish blood poured into the harbor, coins tossed into the sea. Whether Pelagos exists, and whether these offerings accomplish anything, remains a matter of faith.

### Regina

The capital of Ethadia sprawls across the southern shore of Strymün's main harbor—a natural bay so perfect for shipping that the city's founding was essentially inevitable. Approximately fifty thousand people live here, making it the largest settlement in the Gindrik Sea region.

#### The City

Regina grew organically around its harbor rather than following any planned design. The oldest districts cluster near the waterfront: warehouses, counting houses, taverns, chandleries, and the other businesses that serve maritime commerce. The Aldric Palace occupies a promontory at the harbor's eastern edge, positioned to observe all arrivals.

Wealthier neighborhoods climb the slopes behind the waterfront, arranged roughly by age and status. The twelve Family compounds form a loose ring around the palace—each a walled estate containing the main residence, offices, and quarters for household staff and guards. Beyond them, prosperous merchant homes give way to artisan quarters and eventually to workers' housing on the city's outskirts.

The city has no walls. Like Bonnetaz, Regina relies on water for defense—though here the calculation is maritime rather than environmental. Enemy fleets would need to enter the harbor to threaten the city, and Ethadian defenses focus on the harbor approaches.

#### Architecture

Ethadian building favors stone foundations with timber upper stories—practical in an earthquake-prone volcanic region. Roofs are typically tile, imported or locally made from clay deposits in the Greenwood. The overall effect is Mediterranean: white and pale yellow walls, terra-cotta roofs, narrow streets climbing steep slopes.

The palace and Family compounds are more elaborate, featuring carved stonework, imported marble, and elaborate gardens. These displays of wealth are competitive; each Family strives to outdo its rivals without crossing the line into ostentation that might invite Crown intervention.

#### The Waterfront

Regina's commercial heart stretches along two miles of harbor frontage. Wharves extend into the bay, capable of servicing a hundred vessels simultaneously. Behind them, warehouses store goods awaiting transshipment—everything from Kuzagt salt to Gorathi timber to items whose origins the harbormaster doesn't record.

The Merchant's Exchange dominates the waterfront district: a massive building where traders conduct business, banks maintain offices, and information changes hands. Membership in the Exchange requires substantial fees and Family sponsorship, limiting access to established merchants. Those excluded conduct business in the surrounding streets, legal but less reputable.

#### Districts of Note

**Palace Hill**: The Aldric compound and administrative center. Access is restricted but not forbidden; petitioners can approach the palace gates during daylight hours.

**The Ring**: The twelve Family compounds, each a small fortress in its own right. Social invitations here are political currency.

**Temple Row**: Major temples clustered along a single thoroughfare, convenient for the pious and the superstitious alike.

**Sailor's Rest**: Entertainment district catering to maritime workers. Taverns, brothels, gambling houses, and establishments that combine all three. Surprisingly orderly—the Families have investments here and maintain security accordingly.

**The Gutters**: Worker housing on the city's western edge. Not dangerous, merely poor. The population here works the industries that wealth enables: shipbuilding, rope-making, sail-lofting, and the hundred other trades that keep Ethadia's fleet operational.

#### Politics

Regina is Ethadia writ small. Crown and Families maneuver constantly, each seeking advantage without destabilizing the system that enriches everyone. The current queen is aging, her heir is young, and the succession is not as secure as the palace claims. Several Families smell opportunity.

This internal competition has external implications. Each major foreign power has cultivated relationships with specific Families, hoping to gain influence in Ethadian affairs. The Kuzagt favor House Valdren, which handles most Bonnetaz trade. Gorath has connections to House Mircalis, despite their mutual distaste. Even the Free Isles have their preferred partners among the aristocracy.

Queen Morvena has maintained balance for three decades. When she dies, that balance will be tested.

### Sivirine

The second city of Ethadia occupies the archipelago's northwest coast, facing the open Gindrik rather than the sheltered waters of the main harbor. Approximately fifteen thousand people live here—sailors, fishers, and those who prefer distance from Regina's politics.

#### Character

Where Regina is commercial and cosmopolitan, Sivirine is working-class and Ethadian. The population here traces its ancestry to the original founders rather than the merchants who came later. They speak older dialects, observe older customs, and maintain older grudges against the capital that has overshadowed their city.

Sivirine's economy depends on fishing rather than trade. The Gindrik's richest waters lie northeast of the Strymün Isles, and Sivirine's fleets work them year-round. The catch is processed here—smoked, salted, dried—and shipped to markets throughout the region. It's honest work, the locals say. Unlike Regina.

#### Layout

Sivirine occupies a rocky peninsula with minimal natural harbor—a disadvantage for trade, an advantage for fishing boats that can beach on any shore. The town sprawls along the peninsula's spine, with processing facilities on the windward side (where the smell blows out to sea) and residential areas on the leeward.

No noble Families maintain compounds here. A few minor houses operate fishing operations, but political power resides in the Fisher's Council—an elected body representing the major fishing cooperatives. The Crown appoints a governor to represent royal interests, but wise governors listen more than they command.

#### Tensions

Sivirine resents Regina. This resentment focuses on taxation (Regina takes more than its share), representation (the Council of Families ignores Sivirine's interests), and cultural contamination (Regina has forgotten what it means to be truly Ethadian).

These complaints are as old as the division between the cities. Usually, they remain complaints. Occasionally—when Regina's attention wanders or a particularly charismatic leader emerges—Sivirine pushes back. Tax refusals, work stoppages, and once (two centuries ago) an outright rebellion that lasted three months before the Families offered acceptable terms.

The current mood is sullen but stable. Governor Aldric Thorne (a distant cousin of the Queen, exiled here for unspecified failures in Regina) has learned to work with the Fisher's Council rather than against it. But the underlying tensions persist, waiting for a spark.

#### Significance

For outsiders, Sivirine matters primarily as an alternative entry point. Ships approaching from the northwest can reach Sivirine without passing Regina's watchers. Some cargoes—and some passengers—prefer this discretion. The Fisher's Council officially opposes smuggling but lacks the resources to prevent it.

For players, Sivirine offers a different Ethadia: rougher, poorer, more honest about its grievances. People here will talk about things Regina prefers to ignore.
