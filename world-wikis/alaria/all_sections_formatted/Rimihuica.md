# Rimihuica

Rimihuica dominates the center of Alaria. The Tarkhon-controlled strait guards its northern approach, which then spills into the Dunes of Kunagi and other desert badlands. Farther south the land rapidly shifts into lethal jungles, cloud-wrapped mountain chains, and the volatile Emerald Coast. The continent ends in the lawless Shacklands, where slave markets and pirate kings hold sway. Rimihuica is a study in contrasts—deserts, jungles, and frontier states separated by mountain walls and storm-lashed coastlines.

## Featured Regions

- **Westrim** – The arid northwest, home to the Dunes of Kunagi and Ishnit Jungles.
- **Innerrim** – The central jungle basin divided by the Cloud Mountains.
- **Emerald Coast** – Tropical coastlines south of the mountain ranges.
- **Shacklands** – Southern territories ruled by the slave trade and criminal powers.
- **Tarkhon Empire** – The strait-spanning empire that controls the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the western oceans.

## Tarkhon

### Geography

The Tarkhon Empire straddles the critical strait between Clueanda and Rimihuica, controlling territory on both continents and dominating the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. This strategic position has made Tarkhon one of the most powerful political entities in the region.

#### Position and Extent

##### On Rimihuica (Southern Holdings)
- Extends from the strait southward to the northern shoreline of the Eronia Range
- Controls the coastal lands north of the great mountains that separate it from Westrim and the Dunes of Kunagi

##### On Clueanda (Northern Holdings)
- Controls the states of **Kerwin**, **Enymu**, and **Nektuna** along the southern coast
- These territories lie west of the Middle Sea proper, along the strait

##### Southwestern Holdings (Western Isles Frontier)
- **Sheîr**: Juts westward into the Shattered Sea
- **Kabir**: Northeastern territory facing the Sea of Merchants
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: Southernmost of the western holdings

#### The Tarkhon Strait

The empire's lifeblood—a narrow, due-west passage connecting the Middle Sea to the open ocean beyond the Western Isles. This chokepoint means all maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world must pass through Tarkhon-controlled waters.

#### Terrain

The Tarkhon heartlands are temperate and green—rolling hills and fertile plains with easy access to the ocean. This is hospitable land that supports both civilization and agriculture, a stark contrast to the desert and jungle that lies south of the Eronia Range.

#### Stone Forest

On the border between Enymu and Nektuna stands the Stone Forest—an entire forest made of stone, including all of its wildlife. Every tree, every leaf, every creature within has been turned to stone by ancient magic.

Entry to the forest is forbidden by a pact long forgotten, agreed to by both Enymu and Nektuna. In the roots of the stone trees lie strange crystals known as titan crystals. When touched by sentient beings, these crystals ring out at a frequency only titans can hear—a sound that may cause Hykravones (slumbering titans) to stir. The pact exists to ensure no one disturbs the forest and risks waking these ancient powers.

## Westrim

### Geography

Westrim occupies the northwestern quadrant of Rimihuica, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert and ringed by mountains and deadly jungles. This is a land of extremes—scorching desert sands, impenetrable jungle, and the mountain fortresses of dwarven city-states.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eronia Range forms the northern boundary, separating Westrim from the Tarkhon Empire. This mountain range includes several smaller ranges home to dwarven city-states.
- **East**: Transitions into the Innerrim jungle basin
- **South**: The Ishnit Jungles wrap around the southern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi
- **Southwest**: The Agreben Sea and the Greenwater Isles
- **West**: The Western Isles lie offshore; the state of Mueras occupies the western coastal region

#### Major Features

##### Dunes of Kunagi

The dominant feature of Westrim—a vast, kidney-shaped desert of golden sand stretching across the interior. Home to giant sand wurms reminiscent of *Dune*. The only reliable water source for hundreds of miles is Benshu's Promise, an oasis guarded by a deadly sphinx who demands riddles be answered before any may drink.

##### Ishnit Jungles

Covering the entire southern side of the Dunes of Kunagi, the Ishnit Jungles are among the most dangerous wilderness areas in Alaria. Home to the Naruaghin people and countless deadly monsters. Notable locations include:
- **Ekomorn**: A rift extending to the center of the material plane, feared by all
- **Demonwatch**: A darkstone palace on the southern cape, overrun by confined but immortal demons

##### Eronia Range

The northern mountain barrier, home to multiple dwarven city-states nestled among the peaks. These mountains catch moisture from the north, contributing to the rain shadow that creates the Dunes of Kunagi.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Agreben Sea**: Southwest of Westrim, south of Mueras, west of the Ishnit Jungles
- **Gulf of Norag**: South of the Ishnit Jungles

### Notable Locations

#### Dunes of Kunagi

##### Husakas

A desert region in the southwest Dunes of Kunagi, roamed by scorpion riders who have adapted to the harsh conditions. Husakas contains one of the few sources of water in this part of the dunes—a network of seasonal streams and creeks that flow during rare rains.

However, the water carries a terrible curse: drinking from these streams causes complete loss of long-term memory. Victims forget their past, their identity, everything except the immediate present. The water's power is bound to the region—if transported away from Husakas, it becomes ordinary water. This creates a grim trap: travelers dying of thirst must choose between death and losing themselves entirely.

The scorpion riders who patrol Husakas have developed techniques to survive on minimal water, avoiding the cursed streams except in the direst emergencies.

#### Mueras

The western coastal state of Westrim, positioned between the Taflex Forest and Grimreach in the southwest, overlooking the Agreben Sea.

##### Darkened Coast

East of the Taflex Forest and south of Grimreach, along the northwest coast of the Agreben Sea, lies the Darkened Coast—a stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow. The waters teem with dark-attuned sea creatures: shadow rays that glide beneath the waves, void eels that drain light from their surroundings, and worse things that rise from the lightless depths during moonless nights.

Sailors avoid this coast when possible, as ships that venture too close risk being pulled under by creatures that exist more in shadow than flesh.

#### Benshu's Promise

This oasis is located in the Dunes of Kunagi, and is the only source of freshwater for hundreds of miles. It is guarded by Benshu, a large, incredibly deadly sphinx. To drink from the water, you must answer at least one of the sphinx's three questions correctly. If you drink from the oasis before asking the sphinx for permission, the sphinx captures you (all your muscles go limp) and gives you choice for doing maze or being eaten.

#### Shyalaviin (Malasi Karkus)

Hills just south of the Eronia range that poke into the northern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi. This region, also known as Malasi Karkus, is home to the Blitzling—creatures that inhabit these transitional hills between the mountains and the desert sands.

### Ishnit Jungles

Home to Naruaghin.

#### Ekomorn

Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The Naruaghin who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.

#### Demonwatch

Large, darkstone palace on the southern cape of the Ishnit Jungles, vines growing up over all of it. Overrun when a demon-summoning wizard lost control over his subjects. The demons are confined to the tower, but they're quite powerful, and immortal. Decorated with large, leathery-winged gargoyles with curling horns perched on guard.

Sailors are incredibly superstitious of the place, won't go near it. Others make fun of them for it—"the stone gargoyles just look scary, they aren't real." They aren't, but the demons within are.

#### Tul Azreitnok

In the southern hills and dunes region of Kura stands Tul Azreitnok—a fortress and specialized academy dedicated to the study of midnight fire, a rare and dangerous form of dark flame magic. The academy trains mages in the manipulation of fire that burns with darkness rather than light, flames that consume without illuminating.

The fortress now lies in ruins, abandoned after the fall of the wyrm-keeping tradition, though some say the echoes of old power still linger in the stones.

## Innerrim

### Geography

The Innerrim is the vast jungle basin at the heart of Rimihuica—a dark green sea of dense forest filling the continental interior. This is the "Godahi basin," a lowland region surrounded by mountains on multiple sides, where competing states carve out territory amid the endless canopy.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Middle Sea region and Ofrenia; Swampdeep (a saltwater swamp/bayou) lies to the northeast
- **East**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form an east-west barrier separating Innerrim from the Emerald Coast
- **South**: The Cloud Mountains run from southeast to northwest, separating the basin from the Shacklands (particularly Gorath)
- **West**: Transitions into Westrim; the Ishnit Jungles and Thunder Plains mark the western and southwestern edges

#### The Thunder Plains

A significant geographic feature—the open plains that form the gap between the Ishnit Jungles to the west and the main Innerrim jungle mass. South of the Thunder Plains lies the Sea of Selegos.

#### States of the Innerrim (Clockwise from West)

The basin is divided among several competing powers:

- **Qet Yemani** (West): Home to the Ulvsjael, wolf-people who have adapted to the jungle depths
- **Da Trang** (North): Territory of the Ix'Tyrann, ferocious lizard-people and deadly killers
- **New Chimea** (East): A colonial state extending from the old empire of Chimea. Unusually, it spans across the eastern mountain range, holding territory in both the Innerrim jungles and on the Emerald Coast
- **Vystrilik** (Southeast): Another state that crosses the mountain divide, with lands in both the jungle basin and coastal regions
- **Eoga** (South): The southernmost Innerrim state, bordering the Cloud Mountains

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: South of the Thunder Plains, separating mainland Rimihuica from Pesalolo island (Tamadrez)

## Emerald Coast

### Geography

The Emerald Coast occupies the eastern seaboard of Rimihuica, a verdant strip of jungle and coastline running from south of Ofrenia all the way to Phyrexes in the southeast. True to its name, this region is deep, lush green—dense rainforest benefiting from ocean moisture, creating fertile territory where life thrives in abundance.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Begins south of Ofrenia (the island in the Middle Sea) and Swampdeep
- **West**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form the western boundary, separating the coast from the Innerrim basin
- **South**: Extends to Phyrexes (a misty swamp) and borders Kyagos (the mountainous southeastern peninsula)
- **East**: Faces the open ocean; the permanent storm Oblivion churns offshore to the northeast

#### Geographic Extent

The Emerald Coast stretches along the entire eastern shoreline of Rimihuica's jungle regions. It includes:
- The coastal portions of **New Chimea** and **Vystrilik**, states that span across the mountain divide from the Innerrim
- **Phyrexes**: A misty, fog-shrouded swamp marking the southeastern extent of the coast, positioned north of the mountainous Kyagos peninsula

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Seven Snakes**: The body of water between Phyrexes and Kyagos/Gorath to the south
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm northeast of the coast, between the Middle Sea and open ocean. Anyone who enters forgets everything they know and sails out in confusion.

#### Crystal Caverns

Deep beneath the coastal waters of the Emerald Coast lie the Crystal Caverns—submarine cave systems filled with brilliant, extraordinarily potent force-attuned crystals. These crystals pulse with concentrated magical energy, glowing with an inner light that illuminates the dark waters.

The crystals possess formidable powers of force magic, making them highly valuable to mages and artificers. However, they are also extremely volatile—when shattered, they release their stored energy in a massive explosion capable of collapsing entire cave sections or sinking ships above. Harvesting the crystals requires expert technique and extreme caution, as a single mistake can trigger a cascading chain reaction throughout the cavern system.

## Shacklands

### Geography

The Shacklands are not a single contiguous territory but rather a collection of southern regions united by their participation in the slave trade. The name comes from the shackles worn by enslaved dwarves—a grim legacy that defines the region's character. These scattered territories stretch across the southern reaches of Rimihuica, from the mainland jungles to distant island chains.

#### The Concept

Unlike other regions defined by geography, the Shacklands are defined by economy and practice. States belong to the Shacklands not because they share borders but because they share in the brutal commerce of slavery. This makes the region's boundaries fluid and political rather than natural.

#### Major Territories

##### Gorath

The largest Shacklands state on the mainland, covering the Jungles of Titania and surrounding territories. Gorath lies:
- South of the Cloud Mountains
- East of the Thunder Plains
- Contains the Moon Wilds, home to six-eyed goblin-spider creatures with corrosive blood

##### Kyagos

A mountainous, cloud-shrouded peninsula in the far southeast—almost island-like in its isolation. Kyagos is covered in peaks and perpetual mist, containing numerous city-states (Tekos, Syvlius, Sy, Vassum) and jungle territories. It lies south of Phyrexes, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes.

##### Tamadrez

The state covering Pesalolo, a large island in the far south separated from the mainland by the Sea of Selegos. This island marks the southern extent of the Shacklands' reach.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: Separates the mainland from Pesalolo island
- **Deaddorf Strait**: A passage within the Shacklands region
- **Cindrak Sea**: Southern waters

The name of the strait comes from a misspelling of a description of the strait: dead-dwarves. This strait sees the most dwarven deaths while in transport to Kyagos, and their bodies are thrown overboard. On occasion, the bodies can be thick enough to cause mile long stretches of open sea to smell of rotten flesh.

#### Moonwood

A jungle/forest on the north side of Kyagos.

##### Juniper Swamp

A swamp within the Moonwood.

##### Xyrionn

In the northeast edges of Moonwood, north and east of Juniper Swamp, stands Xyrionn—a giant tree stump with a maze leading to its center. The stump is all one piece of living wood, resistant to many forms of magic. A druid lives within the maze, and they will be furious if anyone attempts to burn or harm the sacred tree.

Dense overbrush prevents people from passing through the top of the maze, forcing them to navigate the deadly traps within. Only those who successfully reach the center prove themselves worthy of the druid's mentorship.

#### Jungula Serpentine

A jungle forest in the northwest of Kyagos, sharing a coast with the Sea of Seven Snakes.

##### Melera Skeyad

Translating to "Melera's Rest," this ancient city was dedicated to the deity Melera. The music of Melera still flows through the ruins, keeping the city supernaturally alive—a very powerful and sacred place. However, the city's power has attracted the attention of Elnir, making it both a site of wonder and danger.

#### Traevluong

A jungle forest on the southeast side of Kyagos, home to the Ulvsjael—werewolves who never transform to human form, remaining always in wolf form. They are somewhat feral but not evil, living in harmony with the deep jungle.
