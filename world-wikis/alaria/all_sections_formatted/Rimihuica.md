# Rimihuica

Rimihuica dominates the center of Alaria. The Tarkhon-controlled strait guards its northern approach, which then spills into the Dunes of Kunagi and other desert badlands. Farther south the land rapidly shifts into lethal jungles, cloud-wrapped mountain chains, and the volatile Emerald Coast. The continent ends in the lawless Shacklands, where slave markets and pirate kings hold sway. Rimihuica is a study in contrasts—deserts, jungles, and frontier states separated by mountain walls and storm-lashed coastlines.

## Featured Regions

- **Westrim** – The arid northwest, home to the Dunes of Kunagi and Ishnit Jungles.
- **Innerrim** – The central jungle basin divided by the Cloud Mountains.
- **Emerald Coast** – Tropical coastlines south of the mountain ranges.
- **Shacklands** – Southern territories ruled by the slave trade and criminal powers.
- **Tarkhon Empire** – The strait-spanning empire that controls the only sea route between the Middle Sea and the western oceans.

## Tarkhon

### Geography

The Tarkhon Empire straddles the critical strait between Clueanda and Rimihuica, controlling territory on both continents and dominating the only sea passage between the Middle Sea and the open western ocean. This strategic position has made Tarkhon one of the most powerful—and most resented—political entities in the region.

#### Position and Extent

##### On Clueanda (Northern Holdings)
- **Nektuna**: The imperial heartland, controlling the northern shore of the strait
- **Enymu**: Agricultural state east of Nektuna
- **Kerwin**: Halfling kingdom in the far northeast, nominally tributary
- **Astrelle**: Vassal state of Nektuna

##### On Rimihuica (Southern Holdings)
- Extends from the strait southward to the northern shoreline of the Eronia Range
- Controls the coastal lands north of the great mountains that separate it from Westrim and the Dunes of Kunagi

##### Southwestern Holdings (Kingdoms of Fire)
- **Kabir**: Northeastern Neferati kingdom facing the Sea of Merchants
- **Gissemari**: South of Kabir
- **Wadiyah**: Southernmost of the western holdings
- **Yaif**: Western Neferati kingdom

#### The Tarkhon Strait

The empire's lifeblood—a narrow passage connecting the Middle Sea to the open ocean beyond. This chokepoint means all maritime trade between the Middle Sea kingdoms and the wider world must pass through Tarkhon-controlled waters.

Tarkhetan, the capital, sits directly on the strait. Its massive navy and fire-mage garrison ensure that every ship pays tribute. Those who refuse are burned.

#### Terrain

The Tarkhon heartlands are temperate and green—rolling hills and fertile plains with easy access to the ocean. This is hospitable land that supports both civilization and agriculture, a stark contrast to the desert and jungle that lies south of the Eronia Range.

To the north, the land grows drier as it approaches Kerwin and the volcanic Fireknife Mountains. To the south, the Eronia Range marks the boundary between Tarkhon territory and the lands beyond—mountains that were cleared of hostile inhabitants two centuries ago by Klor the Blood Lord.

### Political Climate

Tarkhon is an empire held together by profit rather than loyalty. Subsidiary states receive preferential trade terms in exchange for fealty, tribute, and cooperation. This arrangement works as long as Tarkhon remains wealthy and powerful—but it means every member is constantly calculating whether the benefits still outweigh the costs.

The current ruler, **King Selron II**, governs from Tarkhetan. His authority is absolute in the core territories but fades rapidly with distance. The Kingdoms of Fire act as a bloc. The dwarven city-states answer to the First Brotherhood as much as to Tarkhon. And Kerwin's immortal king has outlived every emperor for five centuries.

The empire's great symbol is the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame in Tarkhetan's cathedral. The torch was originally lit in Tarkha (now Kerwin's capital) before being moved when the seat of power shifted. This transfer remains controversial.

### What Makes It Interesting

- **The Chokepoint Empire**: Tarkhon's entire economy depends on controlling the strait. If an alternative route opened—overland, magical, or otherwise—the empire would collapse. This makes Tarkhon both desperate to maintain control and paranoid about anything that might threaten it.

- **The Immortal Witness**: King Ulyas of Kerwin remembers when Tarkha was the capital, when the Evertorch burned in his city, when Tarkhon was a land empire rather than a naval one. His existence is an embarrassment to imperial narratives and a reminder that some things are older than the empire's current form.

- **The Necessary Monster**: Klor the Blood Lord cleared the southern mountains through systematic genocide. Tarkhon honors him as a hero. The descendants of those he killed—scattered across neighboring lands—remember differently.

- **The Conditional Loyalty**: Every subsidiary state is one bad trade deal away from reconsidering membership. The Kingdoms of Fire negotiate as a bloc. The dwarven cities have their own allegiances. Even loyal Enymu could be turned with the right pressure.

### What Will Go Wrong

- **The Evertorch Schism**: The movement to return the torch to Tarkha is growing. If it gains enough support, it could split the empire between those who see Tarkhetan as the rightful capital and those who believe the move was illegitimate.

- **The Kingdoms of Fire Departure**: If the four Neferati monarchies decided to leave together, Tarkhon would struggle to stop them. Something might push them over the edge—a new trade deal, an insult from Tarkhetan, a better offer from elsewhere.

- **The Alternative Route**: Someone could discover (or create) a way around the strait. A canal, a portal, a mountain pass, a magical transport network. The moment trade can bypass Tarkhon, the empire dies.

- **Ulyas's Choice**: The immortal king has been playing along for five centuries because it was convenient. If he decided to stop—if he actively opposed the empire—Kerwin's strategic position and his personal power could cause real problems.

### Astrelle

Tags: state, nation

A vassal state of Nektuna, occupying the southern shore of the Tarkhon Passage directly across from the imperial capital. Astrelle's strategic position—hosting two of the empire's most critical fortresses—gives it leverage far beyond its size.

#### Position and Borders

Astrelle occupies the northern coast of the Rimihuica continent, facing Nektuna across the strait:
- **North**: The Tarkhon Passage (water)
- **South**: The Eronia Range foothills
- **West**: Territories leading toward the Kingdoms of Fire
- **East**: The passage widening toward the Middle Sea

The state is essentially a coastal strip, its importance entirely derived from its position across from Tarkhetan.

#### Political Status

Astrelle was absorbed into Nektuna's orbit roughly two centuries ago through a combination of marriage alliances and economic pressure. The absorption was peaceful—Astrelle's rulers recognized they couldn't resist Tarkhon's power and negotiated the best terms they could.

The current arrangement makes Astrelle a vassal state:
- Self-governing in internal matters
- Subordinate to Tarkhetan in foreign policy
- Required to host and support imperial fortresses
- Required to provide troops for imperial defense

In exchange, Astrelle receives preferential trade terms and protection. Whether this is a fair bargain depends on who you ask.

#### Duchess Ysmera

The current ruler of Astrelle is **Duchess Ysmera**, a shrewd woman in her sixties who has navigated vassal politics for three decades.

Ysmera's niece, **Vethira**, is married to King Selron II—making the duchess both vassal and family to the crown. This creates awkward dynamics. Is she representing Astrelle's interests at court, or is she there to keep Astrelle in line? Both, probably.

Ysmera walks a careful path: loyal enough to avoid imperial displeasure, independent enough to maintain Astrelle's dignity. She advocates for her people where she can and accepts what she cannot change.

#### Torsnerhun Fortress

The most prestigious military posting in Tarkhon, directly across the Needle from Tarkhetan itself.

Torsnerhun and Tarkhetan together control the Needle—the narrowest point of the strait. Firemages on both shores can burn any ship attempting to run the passage without permission. The two fortresses work in coordination, their fires overlapping to create an impassable barrier.

**Garrison**: ~500 elite soldiers, including a significant firemage detachment. The best equipment, the best training, the best officers.

**Posting**: Torsnerhun is where careers are made. Officers assigned here are on the rise—they've distinguished themselves and are being groomed for higher command. The competition for posting is fierce.

**Commander**: **General Halric Vance**, a decorated veteran in his fifties. Loyal to the crown, respected by his troops, and aware that his position makes him a political figure whether he likes it or not.

#### Sharvatunis Fortress

The eastern guardian of the Tarkhon Passage, watching the approaches from the Middle Sea.

Sharvatunis sits on Astrelle's eastern coast, positioned to intercept any fleet approaching from the east before it reaches the Needle. It's the first line of defense against naval threats from the Middle Sea kingdoms.

**Garrison**: ~300 soldiers, professional but not elite. Adequate equipment, adequate training. Good enough for a posting that rarely sees action.

**Posting**: Sharvatunis is neither prestigious nor punishing—it's simply a solid, respectable assignment. Officers serve their terms, do their jobs, and move on. Nothing exciting happens, but nothing terrible either.

**Commander**: **Captain Mira Solent**, a career officer in her forties. Competent, unambitious, and content to run a well-maintained fortress until retirement.

#### Terrain and Climate

Similar to Nektuna—warm Mediterranean climate, rocky coastline, olive groves and vineyards on the hillsides. The land rises toward the Eronia Range in the south, becoming rougher and less populated as elevation increases.

#### Population

Astrelle is primarily human, with smaller populations of Craven and others. The people are culturally similar to Nektuna—same language, same customs, same religion centered on the Evertorch—but they maintain a distinct identity as Astrellans rather than Nektunans.

There's a quiet resentment of vassal status among some Astrellans, particularly the old noble families who remember independence. But most have adapted. The trade benefits are real. The alternative—defiance—would be catastrophic.

#### Economy

Astrelle's economy is largely agricultural—olives, wine, grain—supplemented by fishing and minor trade. The fortresses bring some economic activity, but the real money flows through Tarkhetan across the water.

Astrellans complain that they do the work while Nektuna takes the profit. This is largely true. But they also acknowledge that without Nektuna's protection, someone else would take both the work and the profit.

#### The Awkward Position

Astrelle hosts two of the empire's most critical fortresses. This gives Duchess Ysmera leverage—Tarkhon needs Astrelle's cooperation to maintain control of the strait.

But it also makes Astrelle a permanent military zone. Imperial troops are always present. Imperial officers report to Tarkhetan, not to the duchess. In theory, Astrelle governs itself. In practice, the fortresses are imperial territory that happens to be surrounded by Astrellan land.

If Astrelle ever seriously considered independence, those fortresses would turn inward very quickly.

### Chykum

Tags: city, state, nation

A city-state in Tarkhon.

TODO

### Copper Hills

Tags: hills, geography

Low, scrubby hills in western Kerwin, rich with copper ore. The hills provide Kerwin's modest mining industry and contain mysteries older than the halflings who work them.

#### Geography

The Copper Hills rise gently from the farmland surrounding Tarkha, their ruddy soil giving them their name. They're not dramatic—more rumpled than mountainous—but they extend for miles, dotted with mine shafts, quarries, and the occasional hardy farm.

The hills mark the transition between Kerwin's agricultural heartland and the wilder territories to the west. Beyond the Copper Hills, the land grows rougher and less settled.

#### Mining

The town of **Chykum** serves as the center of Kerwin's mining industry. Halflings and a smattering of dwarven advisors extract copper from the earth, producing enough to meet Kerwin's needs and trade surplus to Tarkhon merchants.

The mining is modest by Tarkhon standards—no great industrial operations, no slave labor, no environmental devastation. The halflings dig what they need, trade what they don't, and leave the rest in the ground for future generations.

#### The Old Workings

The Copper Hills are older than the halflings—older than Tarkhon, older than recorded history. Ancient mine shafts riddle the deeper hills, their origins unknown. These workings were here when the halflings arrived. Whoever dug them is long gone.

Halfling miners occasionally break through into these old tunnels. They find:
- Strange tools made of materials that resist identification
- Carvings in languages no one recognizes
- Chambers that should have collapsed centuries ago but haven't
- Sometimes, things that move in the darkness

A sensible miner seals such discoveries and moves on. The old workings are bad luck. Everyone knows this. No one asks why.

#### Chykum

The largest settlement in the Copper Hills, serving as both mining center and market town for the surrounding area. Chykum has a population of perhaps two thousand—large by Kerwin standards—and maintains the only real metalworking facilities in the kingdom.

Dwarven advisors from the First Brotherhood maintain a small presence here, ostensibly to help with technical mining questions. Whether they're also keeping an eye on Kerwin for the Brotherhood is a matter of speculation.

### Ekfusy

Tags: fortress, poi

A functional but miserable fortress on Midton Island, watching the eastern approaches to the Tarkhon Passage.

#### Position

Midton Island sits south of Enymu, in the eastern portion of the passage where the strait begins to widen toward the Middle Sea. Ekfusy fortress guards this approach—any ship entering the passage from the east passes within sight of its walls.

#### Strategic Value

Ekfusy is the eastern counterpart to Fort Tenze in the west—a secondary checkpoint to catch anything that might slip past the Needle. In theory, it's vital to the empire's defense.

In practice, nothing ever happens at Ekfusy. The Needle catches everything. Ships that make it past Tarkhetan are already taxed and documented. The eastern fortress exists mostly as insurance against scenarios that never occur.

#### The Worst Posting in Tarkhon

Ekfusy is where careers go to die.

The island has nothing. No city, no town, barely any villages—just the fortress, its garrison, and miles of rocky coastline. The nearest entertainment is a fishing hamlet where the locals resent the soldiers. Supply ships come once a month if the weather cooperates.

Soldiers assigned to Ekfusy are either being punished, have offended someone powerful, or drew the shortest straw in their regiment. Officers posted here have usually done something to deserve it—though sometimes it's just bad luck.

#### Conditions

The fortress itself is adequate—maintained, defensible, properly supplied. The crown hasn't neglected its physical structure.

Everything else is miserable:
- No women (the fishing hamlet's daughters learned long ago to stay away from the garrison)
- No entertainment beyond gambling and drinking
- No advancement opportunities (nothing happens, so there's nothing to distinguish oneself)
- Months of boredom punctuated by inspections from officers who clearly don't want to be there either

Discipline has... relaxed. The garrison does its job—watches the strait, maintains the fortress, reports to Tarkhetan—but initiative died years ago. Officers look the other way at minor infractions. Smugglers have been known to pay Ekfusy's commanders to report "nothing unusual" about certain ships.

#### The Garrison

Roughly 200 soldiers, mostly conscripts and punishment postings. A handful of career soldiers who've resigned themselves to mediocrity. One or two officers hoping to serve their time and escape.

The current commander, **Captain Theras Vold**, is a competent man who made enemies in Tarkhetan. He does his job, keeps the fortress functional, and drinks more than is healthy. He'll serve his term and retire, assuming he doesn't drink himself to death first.

#### The One Advantage

Ekfusy is far from politics. No one watches, no one cares, no one interferes. For soldiers who just want to be left alone—for whatever reason—it's oddly peaceful.

Some say there are men at Ekfusy with pasts they're running from. The fortress asks no questions. Do your job, keep your head down, and no one from the mainland will bother you.

### Enymu

Tags: state, nation

A state in Tarkhon, bordering Nektuna to the east.

#### Stone Forest

On the border between Enymu and Nektuna stands the Stone Forest—an entire forest made of stone, including all of its wildlife. Every tree, every leaf, every creature within has been turned to stone by ancient magic.

Entry to the forest is forbidden by a pact long forgotten, agreed to by both Enymu and Nektuna. In the roots of the stone trees lie strange crystals known as titan crystals. When touched by sentient beings, these crystals ring out at a frequency only titans can hear—a sound that may cause Hykravones (slumbering titans) to stir. The pact exists to ensure no one disturbs the forest and risks waking these ancient powers.

### Eronia Range

Tags: mountains, geography

TODO

### Fireknife Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A volcanic range along the northwestern border of Kerwin, marking the boundary between settled Tarkhon territory and the wild lands beyond. The Fireknife is dangerous, unstable, and largely avoided by sensible travelers.

#### Geography

The Fireknife range rises sharply from the rolling farmland of Kerwin, its peaks jagged and asymmetrical—the result of volcanic activity that has never fully ceased. The mountains smoke constantly, venting sulfurous gases from countless fissures. At night, the peaks sometimes glow red where magma approaches the surface.

The range is not as tall as some mountain chains, but what it lacks in height it makes up for in hostility. The rock is unstable, prone to sudden collapses and rockslides. Hot springs bubble in unexpected places, sometimes scalding and sometimes merely warm. Paths that were safe last month may be impassable now.

#### Climate and Hazards

The Fireknife creates its own weather. Warm air rising from volcanic vents meets cooler air from the surrounding lands, producing unpredictable fog, sudden rainstorms, and occasionally ash falls when a vent becomes particularly active.

Known hazards include:
- **Sudden venting**: Fissures can open without warning, releasing superheated gas or magma
- **Unstable ground**: What looks like solid rock may be thin crust over hollow chambers
- **Toxic air**: Some valleys collect poisonous gases in concentrations that kill without warning
- **Hot springs**: Range from pleasantly warm to instantly lethal, often indistinguishable until tested

#### The Shrine

Somewhere deep in the Fireknife is a shrine—old, hidden, and hungry. King Ulyas of Kerwin travels there once a year with prisoners and criminals. He returns alone.

No one else has found the shrine and returned to speak of it. Whether this is because the shrine is well-hidden or because it doesn't allow witnesses is unclear.

The halflings of Kerwin tell stories about the shrine, though they're careful about when and where. Something waits there. Something that predates Tarkhon, predates Kerwin, predates perhaps the halflings themselves. It requires blood to continue existing. Ulyas has been paying that price for nearly nine centuries.

#### Wildlife

The Fireknife supports a harsh ecosystem of creatures adapted to volcanic conditions. Fire-resistant insects, heat-tolerant reptiles, and occasional fire elementals can be found on the slopes. Nothing large survives here—the environment is too hostile for creatures that can't find shelter from sudden venting.

#### Travel

Travel through the Fireknife is possible but inadvisable. A few passes exist that are relatively stable, but "relatively" is doing heavy lifting. Guides who know the current state of the paths can be hired in Kerwin, though they charge substantial fees and refuse to go too deep.

No roads cross the Fireknife. Anyone who needs to reach the lands beyond goes around.

#### Relationship to Other Volcanic Ranges

The Fireknife is sometimes confused with the Fleimrut Mountains to the south, which share some volcanic characteristics. However, the Fleimrut is fed by an unstable Yolus leyline and has experienced recent catastrophic eruptions (the Fleimrut Awakening). The Fireknife has no known leyline connection and maintains a more consistent—if still dangerous—level of activity.

### Fleimrut Mountains

Tags: mountains

Extremely treacherous. Underground fire-geysers are all over the place. Lots of caves, equally treacherous.

#### The Fleimrut Awakening

The fire-geysers that dominate the mountain range are fed by a Yolus leyline that has never achieved stability. This volatile magical current has made the Fleimrut a zone of perpetual fire hazard, but in 2500 SD, the situation escalated catastrophically.

In what scholars and locals call "The Fleimrut Awakening," the geysers erupted with unprecedented violence. Since then, Emberlords and Cinder Swarms pour from the vents with alarming frequency, turning the mountains into an active war zone between the physical and elemental planes. The eruptions continue with unpredictable intensity, making travel through the region increasingly dangerous.

#### Fire-Trolls & Elemental Symbiosis

Home to a large population of fire-trolls—trolls attuned to fire and shaped by the mountain's hostile environment. Over generations, these creatures have developed a strange symbiosis with the fire elementals that emerge from the unstable Yolus leyline.

Rather than being destroyed by these entities, fire-trolls have learned to coexist with them, developing an unusual cultural and biological relationship. They function as intermediaries between the physical and elemental realms, brokering uneasy peace in the mountain's violent landscape. However, this symbiosis has also made them valuable—and dangerous—as both allies and weapons in the hands of those who understand how to negotiate with them.

### Fort Tenze

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi

The cursed ruins of a once-vital fortress on Pyris Island's eastern coast.

#### Position

Fort Tenze guards a secondary chokepoint west of the Needle—not as critical as the main strait, but significant. Ships attempting to bypass Tarkhetan's tariffs by hugging the western coast would pass within range of Fort Tenze's walls.

Or they would, if the fortress still functioned.

#### History

Fort Tenze was built during the Neferati era, one of several fortresses securing Tarkhon's control of the passage. For centuries it functioned as intended—garrisoned, maintained, watching the western approaches.

During the **Severance** (~300 years ago), the civil war that ended Neferati rule, Fort Tenze's garrison chose the losing side. They held for the Neferati claimant while the human faction took Tarkhetan itself.

When the victors came to take the fortress, something went wrong.

The details are disputed. Some historical accounts say the garrison's firemages lost control during the final assault, consuming themselves and the fortress in magical backlash. Others say the Neferati commander performed a desperate ritual—a curse, a summoning, a final act of spite. What's certain is that Fort Tenze burned with unnatural fire.

The flames were eventually extinguished, but the wrongness remained.

#### The Curse

Fort Tenze's stones are twisted in ways that shouldn't be possible. Walls that were straight now curve. Stairs lead to nowhere. Rooms that should connect don't. The geometry is subtly, persistently wrong.

More disturbing are the effects on people who stay too long:
- Workers report whispers in languages they don't understand
- Figures appear in peripheral vision—never when looked at directly
- Dreams of burning, of being trapped in walls, of fire that doesn't consume but doesn't stop
- Equipment fails at critical moments. Stones won't set. Mortar cracks overnight.
- People disappear. Not often, but enough.

Three times the crown has ordered Fort Tenze rebuilt. Three times the attempt has been abandoned after casualties and failures. The current policy is to ignore it.

#### Current State

The fortress is empty of official presence. The Pyrisi avoid it—they tell stories to keep children away.

Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, taking advantage of the unguarded chokepoint. But even they don't stay long. A few hours to transfer cargo, then gone before nightfall. Nobody sleeps in Fort Tenze.

Some say there's a presence in the deepest ruins—where the Neferati commander made his last stand. Treasure hunters occasionally go looking. They rarely come back.

#### Strategic Implications

The absence of Fort Tenze creates a gap in Tarkhon's defenses. Smugglers exploit it. Fast ships can slip through the western passage without paying tariffs.

This costs the crown money, but not enough to justify another attempt at rebuilding. Some on the royal council want to try anyway—with priests, exorcists, whatever it takes. Others say the risk isn't worth it.

And some whisper that certain parties—smugglers, merchants who profit from contraband, even foreign powers—would prefer Fort Tenze stay ruined. Perhaps some of them are ensuring it stays that way.

### Gissemari

Tags: state, nation

A Neferati kingdom in Tarkhon. One of the four Kingdoms of Fire—adjacent Neferati monarchies that frequently work together and make decisions together. The Kingdoms of Fire consist of Wadiyah, Gissemari, Yaif, and Kabir.

### Kabir

### Kerwin

Tags: state, nation

The northeastern territory of the Tarkhon Empire—though "territory" implies more control than Tarkhon actually exercises. Kerwin is a land of rolling farmland and quiet villages, ruled by an immortal halfling king who predates the empire by centuries.

#### Position and Borders

Kerwin occupies the northeastern corner of Tarkhon's claimed territory, bounded by:
- **West**: Enymu and the broader Tarkhon heartland
- **Northwest**: The Fireknife Mountains (volcanic, dangerous)
- **East and South**: Sparsely populated frontier lands

The region sits at the edge of imperial attention—far enough from the strait to be strategically unimportant, close enough to be claimed.

#### Terrain and Climate

Kerwin is semi-arid but fertile enough for farming. The land rolls gently from the Fireknife foothills in the northwest down toward the coastal lowlands. Summers are hot and dry; winters are cold but brief. Rain comes in spring and autumn, enough to sustain wheat, barley, and extensive sheep pastures.

The landscape has a faded grandeur—roads too wide for their traffic, bridges built for armies that never came, the bones of imperial ambition overgrown with wildflowers.

#### Tarkha

The capital of Kerwin and former capital of the entire Tarkhon Empire.

Tarkha was built for greatness. Its avenues were designed for imperial processions, its plazas for crowds of thousands, its palace for an emperor who would rule the world. The Evertorch burned here, symbol of eternal Tarkhon dominion.

That was centuries ago. The torch was moved to Tarkhetan. The processions stopped. The crowds dispersed. Now Tarkha is a provincial capital, its grand architecture inhabited by halflings who use the old throne room for village meetings and the imperial gardens for growing vegetables.

The palace still functions as seat of government—King Ulyas rules from a modest chamber in one wing while the rest of the building gathers dust. Visitors from Nektuna find Tarkha either heartbreaking or infuriating, depending on their politics. The halflings find it perfectly comfortable.

#### The Fireknife Mountains

A volcanic range along Kerwin's northwestern border, marking the boundary between settled land and wilderness. The Fireknife peaks smoke constantly, their slopes scarred by ancient lava flows and dotted with hot springs. Travel through the mountains is possible but dangerous—paths shift, vents open without warning, and the rock itself is unstable.

The halflings avoid the Fireknife. They tell stories of spirits in the peaks, of travelers who entered and never returned, of lights that move against the wind. These stories are probably exaggerated.

King Ulyas travels into the Fireknife once a year. He takes prisoners and criminals with him. He returns alone. The halflings have learned not to ask questions.

#### The Copper Hills

Low hills west of Tarkha, their ruddy soil rich with copper ore. The mining town of **Chykum** extracts enough copper to supply Kerwin's modest needs and trade surplus to Tarkhon merchants.

The hills are older than the halflings—older than Tarkhon. Ancient mine shafts riddle the deeper hills, their origins unknown. Halfling miners occasionally break through into these old workings. They find strange tools, stranger carvings, and sometimes things best left undisturbed. A sensible miner seals such discoveries and moves on.

#### Da Sharma

The southern region of Kerwin, where farmland gives way to sheep pastures and the influence of Tarkha fades. Da Sharma is insular, traditional, and faintly suspicious of outsiders—including halflings from northern Kerwin.

The people here maintain old shrines to spirits that predate Tarkhon, predate Kerwin, predate perhaps the halflings themselves. They light candles on certain nights, leave offerings at certain stones, and speak certain names only in whispers. When asked about these practices, they smile and change the subject.

#### Settlements

Kerwin's towns are modest affairs—farming communities, market villages, waypoints on roads that once carried imperial traffic. Notable settlements include:

- **Sharmatenu**: The largest town after Tarkha, a market center for the central farmlands
- **Chykum**: Mining town in the Copper Hills
- **Hebbythus**, **Nehemiter**, **Hebmu**: Agricultural villages along the main road
- **Clynisi**, **Ankbalen**: Eastern frontier settlements
- **Dlesy**, **Cuntzam**: Da Sharma communities
- **Kastorbekt**, **Akhzubdet**: Southern towns near the border with wilder lands

#### Relationship to Tarkhon

Kerwin is nominally part of the Tarkhon Empire. In practice, this means:
- Kerwin pays modest tribute to Tarkhetan
- Tarkhon merchants travel freely through Kerwin
- Kerwin acknowledges the emperor's theoretical sovereignty

What it does not mean:
- Tarkhon troops garrison Kerwin
- Tarkhon laws supersede Kerwin customs
- Tarkhon has any real say in Kerwin's governance

King Ulyas agreed to this arrangement five centuries ago. He has outlived every emperor since. Periodically, ambitious officials in Nektuna suggest bringing Kerwin more firmly under imperial control. These officials tend to have short careers.

#### The Evertorch Legacy

Tarkha was once home to the Evertorch—the eternally burning flame that symbolizes Tarkhon's eternal dominion. When the capital moved to Tarkhetan, the torch was ceremonially transported to its new home.

Some in Kerwin still resent this. They believe the torch belongs in Tarkha, that moving it was a wound to the empire's spiritual heart. A small but persistent movement advocates for the torch's return.

Ulyas finds this exhausting. He preferred Tarkha when no one important cared about it.

### Midton

Tags: island, geography

A small, rocky island in the eastern Tarkhon Passage, home to Ekfusy fortress and little else.

#### Geography

Midton sits south of Enymu, where the Tarkhon Passage begins to widen toward the Middle Sea. The island is small—perhaps ten miles long and five wide—with rocky coastlines and sparse vegetation.

The terrain is unremarkable: low hills, scrubby grass, a few wind-twisted trees. No natural harbors worth mentioning. The only significant structure is Ekfusy fortress on the northern shore.

#### Population

Midton has no real population. A fishing hamlet of perhaps fifty souls clings to the southern coast, their ancestors presumably stranded here generations ago and too stubborn to leave. They catch fish, curse the wind, and avoid the soldiers.

The fortress garrison adds another 200, but they don't count—they're temporary, rotating in and out on tours of duty, counting the days until they can leave.

#### Strategic Value

Midton's only importance is its position. Ships entering the Tarkhon Passage from the east must pass within sight of the island. Ekfusy fortress watches for hostile fleets, pirates, or smugglers.

In practice, this matters less than it should. The Needle catches everything. By the time ships reach Midton's longitude, they've already been taxed and documented at Tarkhetan. Ekfusy exists mostly as insurance—a backup that rarely proves necessary.

#### Conditions

Life on Midton is miserable. The island offers nothing: no entertainment, no women, no opportunities. The fishing hamlet resents the garrison. The garrison resents being here. The wind blows constantly.

Supply ships visit monthly, weather permitting. Mail is slow. News from Tarkhetan arrives weeks late. For the soldiers stationed here, Midton might as well be another world.

#### The Blessing in Disguise

Some find Midton's isolation appealing. No politics. No intrigues. No one watching, no one caring. For men with pasts they'd rather forget, Midton offers anonymity.

The garrison doesn't ask questions. Do your job, keep your head down, serve your time. Whatever you're running from, it won't follow you here.

### Murth

Tags: state, nation

A state in Tarkhon.

#### Eynmore

One of the two capital cities of Murth. The more noble and scholarly of the twin capitals. Inhabited by Rhea.

#### Vastilin

One of the two capital cities of Murth. Less noble and scholarly than Eynmore, but controls more resources and serves as the commercial heart of the state.

### Nektuna

Tags: state, nation

The imperial heartland of the Tarkhon Empire, controlling both shores of the Needle—the strait's narrowest point and the key to everything.

#### Position and Borders

Nektuna occupies the central position in Tarkhon's territory:
- **North**: Enymu (agricultural tributary)
- **South**: The strait itself, with Astrelle (vassal) on the opposite shore
- **West**: Pyris Island (controlled territory)
- **East**: The broader Tarkhon Passage, narrowing toward Eros

The Needle—where Tarkhetan faces Torsnerhun fortress across the narrowest water—is the geographic heart of Tarkhon's power.

#### Terrain and Climate

Warm Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot, dry summers. The land rises from the harbor in a series of hills, each topped with fortifications or noble estates. Olive groves and vineyards cover the slopes outside the city walls.

The coastline alternates between rocky cliffs and protected harbors. Tarkhetan occupies the best natural harbor on the strait, which is why it became the capital.

#### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire, built on hills overlooking the Needle. From the palace walls, you can see clear across to Torsnerhun fortress on the Astrelle shore.

The city is divided into districts by elevation and wealth:

**The Old City** — The highest hills. Noble estates, the royal palace, the great cathedral where the Evertorch burns. Wealth, power, and ancient blood.

**The Middle City** — Lower slopes. Merchant houses, guild halls, the homes of successful craftsmen. Where business happens and fortunes are made.

**The Waterfront** — Along the harbor. Warehouses, shipyards, tenements, taverns, brothels. Craven make up the majority. The smell of fish, tar, and humanity.

**The Undercity** — Tunnels, cellars, forgotten passages beneath the streets. Smugglers, thieves, and things that don't like sunlight.

#### The Evertorch Cathedral

The great cathedral at Tarkhetan's heart, where the Evertorch has burned without interruption for six centuries. The flame is the empire's holiest symbol—emperors are crowned in its light, the most binding oaths are sworn before it.

The cathedral is also a center of fire magic. Ritual work occurs here, sustained by both the Evertorch's power and the fire leyline running beneath the Old City.

What the human clergy don't like to discuss: the Evertorch is a Neferati creation, lit by Neferati hands, sustained by Neferati traditions. The Kingdoms of Fire haven't forgotten.

#### The Fire Leyline

A leyline of fire runs beneath Tarkhetan, concentrated under the Old City. Children born here sometimes manifest fire attunement—and those who do are claimed by the Firemage Corps.

The Corps' Citadel of Flames sits on the leyline's strongest point, training mages who can burn ships from the city walls.

#### Besnoumeru

Nektuna's second city, built on a **time leyline**. The Oracle Merchants born here can sense market changes before they happen—not prophecy, but an instinct for timing that has made Besnoumeru almost as wealthy as Tarkhetan.

The city has an eerie calm. Nobody rushes. The merchants already know what's coming.

#### Pyris Island

A moderate-sized island southwest of the strait. Home to the Pyrisi—stocky, hardy folk descended from human-dwarf interbreeding over centuries. They're farmers and fishers who want to be left alone.

The island includes a town and several villages in the north, supporting a modest population that pays taxes and provides sailors for the navy.

#### Fort Tenze (Ruined)

On Pyris's eastern coast stand the ruins of Fort Tenze, guardian of a secondary chokepoint. The fortress has been abandoned for nearly three centuries, ever since the **Severance**—the civil war that ended Neferati rule.

During the Severance, Fort Tenze's garrison sided with the Neferati faction. When they lost, something went wrong. The fortress burned with unnatural fire that left the stones themselves twisted. The wrongness never left.

Three attempts to rebuild have failed. Workers suffer accidents, disappearances, madness. Equipment fails. Stones won't set. People hear whispers, see figures in their peripheral vision, dream of burning.

The crown has stopped trying. Smugglers use the ruins as a waypoint, but nobody stays long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

#### The Harbor

Tarkhetan's harbor is the busiest port in the region. Ships from across Alaria arrive and depart at all hours, their cargoes taxed, inspected, and sent onward.

The harbor is protected by both geography (natural breakwaters, defensible approaches) and magic (firemages on the walls can burn any hostile fleet). This combination makes Tarkhetan's harbor essentially unassailable by naval attack.

#### The Needle

The narrowest point of the Tarkhon Passage—perhaps half a mile of water between Tarkhetan's walls and Torsnerhun fortress on the Astrelle shore.

Nothing passes the Needle without Tarkhetan's permission. Firemages on both shores can burn ships attempting to run the strait. The navy patrols constantly. Even if a ship somehow slipped through, the fortresses further east would catch it.

This chokepoint is everything. Tarkhon's wealth, power, and existence depend on maintaining absolute control of the Needle.

#### Relationships

**With Astrelle**: Vassal state across the Needle. Astrelle hosts Torsnerhun fortress, making it strategically vital. The current Duchess Ysmera is also the queen's aunt—family ties complicate the overlord-vassal relationship.

**With Enymu**: Loyal tributary to the north. Provides food, conscripts, and access to the Stone Forest border. The honorable kings of Enymu have never given Nektuna trouble.

**With Kerwin**: Distant and nominal. King Ulyas pays tribute but effectively governs himself. He's been ruling longer than Nektuna's current dynasty has existed.

**With the Kingdoms of Fire**: Complex. They're nominally tributary but act as a bloc. They remember founding the empire the humans now rule. The relationship is stable but fragile.

### Pebble Islands

### Pyris

Tags: island, geography

A moderate-sized island southwest of the Tarkhon Strait, part of Nektuna's territory. Home to the Pyrisi—a hardy, independent folk who want nothing more than to be left alone—and the cursed ruins of Fort Tenze.

#### Geography

Pyris is the largest island in the western passage, roughly forty miles long and twenty wide. The terrain is hilly, with rocky coastlines giving way to modest farmland in the interior. A spine of low hills runs north-south through the island's center.

The climate is Mediterranean—milder than the mainland, with reliable rainfall and good growing conditions. The soil is decent for olives, grapes, and grain.

#### The Pyrisi

The island's population descends from centuries of interbreeding between humans and dwarves—a mixing that occurred long before anyone thought to record it. The result is a people who are stocky, hardy, and stubborn.

The Pyrisi are primarily farmers and fishers. They grow olives and grapes, catch fish, and want to be left alone. They pay their taxes to Tarkhetan, send their young to serve in the navy, and otherwise try not to attract attention.

They have little interest in mainland politics. When Tarkhetan's intrigues spill over, the Pyrisi wait for it to pass. When asked their opinion on the succession, they shrug. When pressed about the Neferati legacy, they change the subject.

This isn't ignorance—it's survival. The Pyrisi have learned that attracting attention rarely ends well for islanders.

#### Settlements

**Pyris Town** is the largest settlement, located on the northern coast. Perhaps 3,000 people live here—merchants, craftsmen, and the administrators who handle the island's relationship with Tarkhetan. The town has a modest harbor, a small market, and a temple to the Evertorch (rarely attended).

Several **villages** dot the interior and southern coast, home to farming families who've worked the same land for generations. These communities are insular, intermarried, and suspicious of outsiders—including visitors from Pyris Town.

#### Fort Tenze

On the island's eastern coast stand the ruins of **Fort Tenze**, once a vital fortress guarding the western approaches to the strait.

Fort Tenze has been abandoned for three centuries, ever since the Severance—the civil war that ended Neferati rule. The garrison sided with the losing faction. When the victors came to take the fortress, something went wrong. The place burned with unnatural fire and has been cursed ever since.

Three attempts to rebuild have failed. Workers suffer accidents, disappearances, madness. The Pyrisi avoid the ruins. They tell stories to keep children away. Even smugglers don't stay long.

Whatever happened at Fort Tenze, the fire hasn't quite gone out.

#### Strategic Position

Pyris guards a secondary chokepoint—not as critical as the Needle, but significant. Ships hugging the western coast to avoid Tarkhetan's tariffs must pass within range of... well, where Fort Tenze's walls used to be.

The fortress's absence creates a gap in Tarkhon's defenses. Smugglers exploit it. The crown knows but hasn't successfully addressed the problem.

#### Relationship with Tarkhetan

Pyris is technically part of Nektuna, governed from Tarkhetan. In practice, the island largely governs itself. A minor noble holds the title of Governor of Pyris—usually someone being quietly exiled from court politics—and the Pyrisi ignore them as much as possible.

The island pays taxes, provides sailors, and hosts the cursed ruins of a fortress nobody wants to rebuild. In exchange, Tarkhetan mostly leaves them alone.

It's not a bad arrangement. The Pyrisi have survived worse.

### Sea of Merchants

### Tarkhetan

Tags: city, capital

The capital city of the Tarkhon Empire.

TODO

### Tarkhon Empire

Tags: state, nation, empire

The dominant empire of the Tarkhon region, controlling the critical strait between the Middle Sea and the western ocean.

#### The Evertorch

In Tarkhetan's great cathedral burns the **Evertorch**—an eternally burning flame that has never been extinguished since its lighting centuries ago. The torch is Tarkhon's most sacred symbol, representing the empire's eternal dominion and unbroken continuity.

The flame burns without fuel, without maintenance, without apparent source. Scholars have studied it for generations without understanding how it works. Some believe it's fed by a leyline. Others think it's a divine gift. A few whisper that something was sacrificed to light it, and that sacrifice is what keeps it burning.

The torch was originally lit in Tarkha—now a provincial capital in Kerwin—before being ceremonially moved to Tarkhetan when the seat of power shifted. This transfer remains controversial among those who believe the torch belongs in its original home.

#### Tarkhetan

The capital of the Tarkhon Empire, built on the northern shore of the strait. Tarkhetan is a city of extremes—fabulous wealth alongside desperate poverty, gleaming palaces beside rotting slums, merchant princes who could buy kingdoms and beggars who will never own anything.

The city's power comes from position, not production. Every ship that passes through the strait pays tribute. Every merchant who wants access to Tarkhon markets pays fees. The city produces little itself but takes a cut of everything that moves through.

King Selron II rules from the great palace overlooking the strait. His court is a nest of intrigue—lords from across the empire jockeying for position, merchants buying influence, and spies from every neighboring power watching for weakness.

#### The Strait

The narrow passage connecting the Middle Sea to the western ocean. Ships can cross it in hours, but those hours pass under the watchful eyes of Tarkhon's navy and the burning gaze of its firemages.

The strait is everything. Without it, Tarkhon is just another middling power. With it, Tarkhon controls half the world's trade. This makes the empire both fabulously wealthy and desperately paranoid. Any threat to the strait is an existential threat to the empire itself.

#### Leylines

Tarkhon's territory contains several important leylines:

- **Fire Leyline**: Runs through Nektuna and Tarkhetan, producing the firemages who serve as the empire's elite military asset
- **Time Leyline**: Runs through Besnoumeru, enabling the city's famous merchants to anticipate market changes before they happen
- **Yolus Leyline**: Runs through the Fleimrut Mountains, unstable and dangerous, responsible for the Fleimrut Awakening

#### The Imperial Legacy

Tarkhon was not always a maritime empire. Centuries ago, it was a land empire centered on Tarkha, expanding through conquest and diplomacy. The Evertorch burned in Tarkha. The emperor ruled from Tarkha. The empire's heart was in Tarkha.

Then maritime trade exploded in importance, and suddenly the strait mattered more than land. Nektuna rose. The capital moved. The torch was transferred. The empire's character changed—from territorial ambition to commercial exploitation.

The old Tarkhon is gone. But its echoes remain in Tarkha's faded grandeur, in the Evertorch controversy, in the immortal king who remembers when things were different.

## Westrim

### Geography

Westrim occupies the northwestern quadrant of Rimihuica, dominated by the massive Dunes of Kunagi desert and ringed by mountains and deadly jungles. This is a land of extremes—scorching desert sands, impenetrable jungle, and the mountain fortresses of dwarven city-states.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eronia Range forms the northern boundary, separating Westrim from the Tarkhon Empire. This mountain range includes several smaller ranges home to dwarven city-states.
- **East**: Transitions into the Innerrim jungle basin
- **South**: The Ishnit Jungles wrap around the southern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi
- **Southwest**: The Agreben Sea and the Greenwater Isles
- **West**: The Western Isles lie offshore; the state of Mueras occupies the western coastal region

#### Major Features

##### Dunes of Kunagi

The dominant feature of Westrim—a vast, kidney-shaped desert of golden sand stretching across the interior. Home to giant sand wurms reminiscent of *Dune*. The only reliable water source for hundreds of miles is Benshu's Promise, an oasis guarded by a deadly sphinx who demands riddles be answered before any may drink.

##### Ishnit Jungles

Covering the entire southern side of the Dunes of Kunagi, the Ishnit Jungles are among the most dangerous wilderness areas in Alaria. Home to the Naruaghin people and countless deadly monsters. Notable locations include:
- **Ekomorn**: A rift extending to the center of the material plane, feared by all
- **Demonwatch**: A darkstone palace on the southern cape, overrun by confined but immortal demons

##### Eronia Range

The northern mountain barrier, home to multiple dwarven city-states nestled among the peaks. These mountains catch moisture from the north, contributing to the rain shadow that creates the Dunes of Kunagi.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Agreben Sea**: Southwest of Westrim, south of Mueras, west of the Ishnit Jungles
- **Gulf of Norag**: South of the Ishnit Jungles

### Notable Locations

#### Dunes of Kunagi

##### Husakas

A desert region in the southwest Dunes of Kunagi, roamed by scorpion riders who have adapted to the harsh conditions. Husakas contains one of the few sources of water in this part of the dunes—a network of seasonal streams and creeks that flow during rare rains.

However, the water carries a terrible curse: drinking from these streams causes complete loss of long-term memory. Victims forget their past, their identity, everything except the immediate present. The water's power is bound to the region—if transported away from Husakas, it becomes ordinary water. This creates a grim trap: travelers dying of thirst must choose between death and losing themselves entirely.

The scorpion riders who patrol Husakas have developed techniques to survive on minimal water, avoiding the cursed streams except in the direst emergencies.

#### Mueras

The western coastal state of Westrim, positioned between the Taflex Forest and Grimreach in the southwest, overlooking the Agreben Sea.

##### Darkened Coast

East of the Taflex Forest and south of Grimreach, along the northwest coast of the Agreben Sea, lies the Darkened Coast—a stretch of shoreline perpetually shrouded in shadow. The waters teem with dark-attuned sea creatures: shadow rays that glide beneath the waves, void eels that drain light from their surroundings, and worse things that rise from the lightless depths during moonless nights.

Sailors avoid this coast when possible, as ships that venture too close risk being pulled under by creatures that exist more in shadow than flesh.

This oasis is located in the Dunes of Kunagi, and is the only source of freshwater for hundreds of miles. It is guarded by Benshu, a large, incredibly deadly sphinx. To drink from the water, you must answer at least one of the sphinx's three questions correctly. If you drink from the oasis before asking the sphinx for permission, the sphinx captures you (all your muscles go limp) and gives you choice for doing maze or being eaten.

#### Shyalaviin (Malasi Karkus)

Hills just south of the Eronia range that poke into the northern edge of the Dunes of Kunagi. This region, also known as Malasi Karkus, is home to the Blitzling—creatures that inhabit these transitional hills between the mountains and the desert sands.

Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The Naruaghin who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.

#### Demonwatch

Large, darkstone palace on the southern cape of the Ishnit Jungles, vines growing up over all of it. Overrun when a demon-summoning wizard lost control over his subjects. The demons are confined to the tower, but they're quite powerful, and immortal. Decorated with large, leathery-winged gargoyles with curling horns perched on guard.

Sailors are incredibly superstitious of the place, won't go near it. Others make fun of them for it—"the stone gargoyles just look scary, they aren't real." They aren't, but the demons within are.

### Geography

The Innerrim is the vast jungle basin at the heart of Rimihuica—a dark green sea of dense forest filling the continental interior. This is the "Godahi basin," a lowland region surrounded by mountains on multiple sides, where competing states carve out territory amid the endless canopy.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bordered by the Middle Sea region and Ofrenia; Swampdeep (a saltwater swamp/bayou) lies to the northeast
- **East**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form an east-west barrier separating Innerrim from the Emerald Coast
- **South**: The Cloud Mountains run from southeast to northwest, separating the basin from the Shacklands (particularly Gorath)
- **West**: Transitions into Westrim; the Ishnit Jungles and Thunder Plains mark the western and southwestern edges

#### The Thunder Plains

A significant geographic feature—the open plains that form the gap between the Ishnit Jungles to the west and the main Innerrim jungle mass. South of the Thunder Plains lies the Sea of Selegos.

#### States of the Innerrim (Clockwise from West)

The basin is divided among several competing powers:

- **Qet Yemani** (West): Home to the Ulvsjael, wolf-people who have adapted to the jungle depths
- **Da Trang** (North): Territory of the Ix'Tyrann, ferocious lizard-people and deadly killers
- **New Chimea** (East): A colonial state extending from the old empire of Chimea. Unusually, it spans across the eastern mountain range, holding territory in both the Innerrim jungles and on the Emerald Coast
- **Vystrilik** (Southeast): Another state that crosses the mountain divide, with lands in both the jungle basin and coastal regions
- **Eoga** (South): The southernmost Innerrim state, bordering the Cloud Mountains

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: South of the Thunder Plains, separating mainland Rimihuica from Pesalolo island (Tamadrez)

## Emerald Coast

### Geography

The Emerald Coast occupies the eastern seaboard of Rimihuica, a verdant strip of jungle and coastline running from south of Ofrenia all the way to Phyrexes in the southeast. True to its name, this region is deep, lush green—dense rainforest benefiting from ocean moisture, creating fertile territory where life thrives in abundance.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Begins south of Ofrenia (the island in the Middle Sea) and Swampdeep
- **West**: The Green Mountains, Seawatch Mountains, and Tambrielle Mountains form the western boundary, separating the coast from the Innerrim basin
- **South**: Extends to Phyrexes (a misty swamp) and borders Kyagos (the mountainous southeastern peninsula)
- **East**: Faces the open ocean; the permanent storm Oblivion churns offshore to the northeast

#### Geographic Extent

The Emerald Coast stretches along the entire eastern shoreline of Rimihuica's jungle regions. It includes:
- The coastal portions of **New Chimea** and **Vystrilik**, states that span across the mountain divide from the Innerrim
- **Phyrexes**: A misty, fog-shrouded swamp marking the southeastern extent of the coast, positioned north of the mountainous Kyagos peninsula

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Seven Snakes**: The body of water between Phyrexes and Kyagos/Gorath to the south
- **Oblivion**: A permanent supernatural storm northeast of the coast, between the Middle Sea and open ocean. Anyone who enters forgets everything they know and sails out in confusion.

#### Crystal Caverns

Deep beneath the coastal waters of the Emerald Coast lie the Crystal Caverns—submarine cave systems filled with brilliant, extraordinarily potent force-attuned crystals. These crystals pulse with concentrated magical energy, glowing with an inner light that illuminates the dark waters.

The crystals possess formidable powers of force magic, making them highly valuable to mages and artificers. However, they are also extremely volatile—when shattered, they release their stored energy in a massive explosion capable of collapsing entire cave sections or sinking ships above. Harvesting the crystals requires expert technique and extreme caution, as a single mistake can trigger a cascading chain reaction throughout the cavern system.

## Shacklands

### Geography

The Shacklands are not a single contiguous territory but rather a collection of southern regions united by their participation in the slave trade. The name comes from the shackles worn by enslaved dwarves—a grim legacy that defines the region's character. These scattered territories stretch across the southern reaches of Rimihuica, from the mainland jungles to distant island chains.

#### The Concept

Unlike other regions defined by geography, the Shacklands are defined by economy and practice. States belong to the Shacklands not because they share borders but because they share in the brutal commerce of slavery. This makes the region's boundaries fluid and political rather than natural.

#### Major Territories

##### Gorath

The largest Shacklands state on the mainland, covering the Jungles of Titania and surrounding territories. Gorath lies:
- South of the Cloud Mountains
- East of the Thunder Plains
- Contains the Moon Wilds, home to six-eyed goblin-spider creatures with corrosive blood

##### Kyagos

A mountainous, cloud-shrouded peninsula in the far southeast—almost island-like in its isolation. Kyagos is covered in peaks and perpetual mist, containing numerous city-states (Tekos, Syvlius, Sy, Vassum) and jungle territories. It lies south of Phyrexes, separated by the Sea of Seven Snakes.

##### Tamadrez

The state covering Pesalolo, a large island in the far south separated from the mainland by the Sea of Selegos. This island marks the southern extent of the Shacklands' reach.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Selegos**: Separates the mainland from Pesalolo island
- **Deaddorf Strait**: A passage within the Shacklands region
- **Cindrak Sea**: Southern waters

### Deaddorf Strait

Tags: strait, geography

TODO


The name of the strait comes from a misspelling of a description of the strait: dead-dwarves. This strait sees the most dwarven deaths while in transport to Kyagos, and their bodies are thrown overboard. On occasion, the bodies can be thick enough to cause mile long stretches of open sea to smell of rotten flesh.

#### Moonwood

A jungle/forest on the north side of Kyagos.

##### Juniper Swamp

A swamp within the Moonwood.

##### Xyrionn

In the northeast edges of Moonwood, north and east of Juniper Swamp, stands Xyrionn—a giant tree stump with a maze leading to its center. The stump is all one piece of living wood, resistant to many forms of magic. A druid lives within the maze, and they will be furious if anyone attempts to burn or harm the sacred tree.

Dense overbrush prevents people from passing through the top of the maze, forcing them to navigate the deadly traps within. Only those who successfully reach the center prove themselves worthy of the druid's mentorship.

#### Jungula Serpentine

A jungle forest in the northwest of Kyagos, sharing a coast with the Sea of Seven Snakes.

#### Traevluong

A jungle forest on the southeast side of Kyagos, home to the Ulvsjael—werewolves who never transform to human form, remaining always in wolf form. They are somewhat feral but not evil, living in harmony with the deep jungle.
