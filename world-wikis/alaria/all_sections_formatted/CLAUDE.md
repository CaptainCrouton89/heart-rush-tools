# Alaria Formatted Sections

This directory contains aggregated, formatted versions of Alaria world wiki content organized by major topic.

## Purpose

These files are compiled/aggregated versions that combine related content from category subdirectories into comprehensive topic files. They serve as reference documents and may be used for:
- Generating combined exports or PDFs
- Providing complete topic overviews
- Facilitating cross-reference resolution during compilation

## Files

Each markdown file represents a major topic area:

- **Cosmology_&_Religion.md** - Planar systems, deities, cosmic forces, and spiritual beliefs
- **Magic_&_Knowledge.md** - Magical systems, schools of magic, and arcane knowledge
- Additional topic files as needed

## Editing Notes

- These files are generated/aggregated during the content compilation process
- Prefer editing source files in category subdirectories (`cosmology_and_religion/`, `magic_and_knowledge/`, etc.)
- Changes to this directory may be overwritten during compilation—verify source files instead
- Maintain clear heading hierarchy and consistent formatting with other sections
