# Deoric

## Deoric

Tags: magic

Deoric is the language of absolute power. Statements spoken in deoric have the power to rip the world apart, if anybody had the knowledge and capacity to wield the power required to do so. According to legends, this is the language the gods spoke when they created the world. Nowadays, the spoken language is nearly dead, though the written form remains alive in the runes used in handmagic, as well as forbidden rituals performed by the few left who know them. 

### Handmagic

The amount of power required to channel Deoric is immense, let alone wield it in a purposeful way. It is only through the strengthening of the astral thread binding one’s soul and shadow that one can hope to bind the power necessary to use Deoric. With stronger astral thread, one’s hand can be tattooed with more runes in titan blood (or the ground up dust from titan bones, mixed into a paste) which act both as a means of holding the magic as well as channeling it in way described by the Deoric runes. However, inscribing too many runes on one’s hand runs the risk of snapping one’s astral thread, killing the owner instantly. 

Handmagic comes in two main flavors—unique abilities, and skill buffs. Both strain your astral thread, though the skill buffs are generally simpler and cheaper, as the addition in skill is usually a less complicated rune. 

For players of Heart Rush, strengthening one’s astral thread takes the form of gaining XP and spending it on handmagic. 

### Ritual Magic

Ritual magic is magic performed using Deoric speech, powered by blood sacrifice. Anything is possible with ritual magic so long as you know the words and have a suitable amount of life sacrificed. Rules for ritual magic are described in below the Spells section.

### Recording Deoric Text

Deoric cannot be recorded except with titan blood or special ink made from their ground up bones. It is magically draining to write, due to the powerful nature of the text. Writing a rune or simple command takes about an hour to complete, and causes you to lose 10 hitpoints. You regain hitpoints lost in this way at a rate of 1 hitpoint each week. 

Once Deoric text is read by someone other than the author, the text disintegrates into ash. For this reason, along with the reasons above, any book of Deoric text is incredibly valuable. 

### Deoric, Daemons, & Celestia

Deoric is primarily used by the daemons of Celestia. Having been around for centuries, millennia, or in some rare cases, eons, these beings are frequently at much higher levels of mastery with the Deoric language than mortals can hope to achieve.

#### The Celestia Paradox

Deoric does not function on Celestia. The plane is saturated with Ezz—the same substance that gave it form—and this Ezzic interference disrupts the absolute commands of Deoric speech. A daemon standing in Celestia cannot simply speak Deoric words and reshape reality as a mortal could on the Material Plane.

Yet daemons are the greatest Deoric practitioners in existence. How?

#### Projection Across the Boundary

Daemons cannot cast Deoric *within* Celestia, but they can project their knowledge and power *across* the boundary to the Material Plane. This is how daemons grant miracles to their followers:

1. A worshipper on the Material Plane performs a ritual, providing the necessary blood sacrifice and speaking the Deoric words they have been taught
2. The daemon, perceiving this through the Psywinds, guides the ritual—correcting pronunciation, amplifying intent, or providing knowledge the mortal lacks
3. The Deoric magic takes effect on the Material Plane, where it functions normally

The worshipper provides the physical presence, the sacrifice, and the initial invocation. The daemon provides mastery, knowledge, and subtle guidance. Neither could accomplish what they achieve together: the mortal lacks knowledge; the daemon lacks a location where Deoric functions.

This is why daemon worship requires *active followers*. A daemon who loses all worshippers loses their ability to affect the Material Plane through Deoric—they become trapped in Celestia, powerful in knowledge but impotent in action, slowly fading as their name is forgotten.
