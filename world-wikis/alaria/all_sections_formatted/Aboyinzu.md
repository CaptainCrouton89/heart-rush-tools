# Aboyinzu

Aboyinzu stretches like a hooked tail along the southwestern edge of the known world. Temperate states in the northwest give way to vast savannas, humid jungles, and the cold, mist-shrouded Dragon's Spine mountains in the far south. Multiple mountain chains—the Crystal Mountains, the Morygun range, and the Dalizi Highlands—carve the continent into distinct biomes, while the Deadloop inner sea cuts deep into its heart. To the east, the South Sea separates Aboyinzu from the Shacklands, and to the west the Wanderlands peninsula reaches toward distant horizons.

## Featured Regions

- **Terrenia** – Northwestern coastal states and gateways to the continent.
- **Central Aboyinzu** – The savanna heartlands surrounding the Deadloop and the Crystal Mountains.
- **Wanderlands** – A long southern peninsula of plains and rugged hill country.
- **Elder Wilds** – The ancient rainforest that dominates the eastern peninsula.
- **Dalizi Confederation** – Allied states ringing Lake Tonactlet Chitle and the Dalizi Highlands.
- **Dragon's Spine Coast** – Misty southern mountains and the Pindolin archipelago.
- **Crimson Coast** – Haunted southern shores south of the Dragon's Spine.

## Terrenia

### Geography

Terrenia occupies the northwestern reaches of Aboyinzu, a region of temperate states stretching from the coast down to the Crystal Mountains. This is the gateway to the continent—the first landfall for ships crossing from the Shacklands or Free Isles, and the most "civilized" portion of Aboyinzu.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Coastal waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands; the Free Isles lie further west
- **East**: Transitions into Central Aboyinzu and the vast interior
- **South**: Bordered by the Crystal Mountains, which separate Terrenia from the southern regions
- **West**: Western coastline facing the open ocean

#### States (North to South)

- **Aal Salma**: The northwesternmost state of Terrenia
- **Windor**: South of Aal Salma
- **Green Mountains**: A small mountain range separating Windor from Poum Titch
- **Poum Titch**: South of the Green Mountains
- **Chaal Nazaerox**: A massive state stretching from the east coast all the way to the west coast, positioned north of the Crystal Mountains. This is one of the largest political entities in Aboyinzu.

#### Connection to Central Aboyinzu

East of Chaal Nazaerox lie Grustos and Quintas, two more states that serve as the transition zone between Terrenia and the interior regions around the Deadloop inner sea.

### Aal Salma

Tags: state, nation

An old and careful nation on Terrenia's northwestern coast, Aal Salma has survived centuries by trading with everyone and trusting no one. Its people are merchants, sailors, and cartographers—pragmatists who measure wealth in ships and alliances in contracts. Where the Scalawags of Poum Titch throw festivals, the Salmani sign agreements.

The nation is shaped by its geography: the sheltered waters of Masaad Takid in the north, the tiered capital overlooking Prison Bay in the south, and the great Whitewood forest running along its eastern border like a natural wall. Aal Salma has always been a buffer state—between the chaotic interior and the ocean, between northern Terrenia and southern, between what people want and what they can afford.

Now, with Poum Titch tearing itself apart next door, that careful neutrality is being tested. Refugees pour across the border. Both sides of the civil war send envoys seeking support. And in the halls of Hillat Abu Hizam, the old families debate whether to help their neighbors—and what such help might cost.

---

#### Settlements

##### Hillat Abu Hizam

The capital of Aal Salma, an ancient port city built in concentric tiers above the cliffs of Prison Bay. Its name means "Belt-Town" in the old trade tongue—a reference to the defensive walls that ring the city like bands on a barrel, each built higher than the last as the city grew upward.

The lowest tier holds the harbor, shipyards, and warehouses. Middle tiers contain markets, guild halls, and the famous School of Charts—a cartographic academy whose maps command premium prices across Aboyinzu. The highest tier belongs to the old merchant families, whose compounds look down on everything below.

Hillat Abu Hizam has never been conquered. Its walls are strong, its harbor defensible, and its rulers have always been willing to pay tribute rather than fight—then outlast their would-be conquerors through patience and commerce. The current crisis in Poum Titch worries them. Wars are bad for trade, and desperate neighbors make dangerous ones.

##### Zamrat Aqabah

A northern port city on Masaad Takid, Aal Salma's second city and its moral opposite. Where Hillat Abu Hizam is regulated and respectable, Zamrat Aqabah is neither. Deals that can't be done in the capital get done here. Questions aren't asked. Paperwork gets lost.

The city's warehouses hold goods of uncertain provenance—salvage from wrecks that may not have been accidents, cargo that changed hands under duress, items that certain parties would prefer not be traced. The harbor masters take bribes openly. The city watch takes larger ones.

Since the Poum Titch civil war began, Zamrat Aqabah has swelled with Scalawag refugees. Some are genuine displaced persons; others are smugglers, spies, and war profiteers. The city's criminal economy has boomed. Hillat Abu Hizam pretends not to notice, as long as the tariff revenues keep flowing south.

---

#### Geography

##### Masaad Takid

A broad, sheltered bay or inland sea on Aal Salma's northern coast—warm, shallow, and rich with life. Pearl divers work its sandy bottoms. Fishing boats crisscross its calm waters. Trade ships move between Zamrat Aqabah and smaller coastal towns without risking the open ocean.

The bay's inlets and coves have always sheltered smugglers and, occasionally, pirates. Aal Salma's navy patrols when it can, but Masaad Takid has too many hiding places to control completely. The authorities mostly focus on keeping the main shipping lanes clear and let the margins police themselves.

##### Whisper River

The primary waterway connecting Zamrat Aqabah to Hillat Abu Hizam, flowing south through the Hiska Wissa forest. Named for the way sound carries over its glassy surface—conversations on the water travel farther than they should, a feature that makes the river's boatmen famously tight-lipped.

Villages cluster along the Whisper's banks, farming the fertile floodplains and fishing its waters. The river is Aal Salma's internal highway, carrying goods, people, and information between its two cities. Control the Whisper, and you control the nation's circulation.

##### Hiska Wissa

The inhabited forest between Zamrat Aqabah and Hillat Abu Hizam, through which the Whisper River flows. Unlike the deeper forests to the south, Hiska Wissa has been tamed—its trees selectively logged, its clearings cultivated, its trails maintained by the villages that shelter beneath its canopy.

The forest provides timber, game, and mushrooms to both cities. Its communities are small but prosperous, benefiting from river trade while avoiding the crowding and politics of urban life. In times of invasion, the Hiska Wissa villages have traditionally melted into the trees, waiting out whatever army marches through.

##### Whitewood

A vast forest of silver-barked trees running north-south along Aal Salma's eastern border, forming a natural boundary with Poum Titch. The wood of these trees is pale, almost white, and prized for shipbuilding—light, strong, and resistant to rot.

Logging camps work the northern reaches, sending timber down to Zamrat Aqabah's shipyards. The deeper portions of the Whitewood remain wild and largely unexplored. Travelers who stray from the main trails report disorientation, strange silences, and the sense of being watched. Most stay on the roads.

The Whitewood has become the primary route for refugees fleeing the Poum Titch civil war. They emerge from the tree line starving and traumatized, with stories of violence that grow worse with each wave.

##### Ashen Hills

A range of dry, pale hills running through Aal Salma's interior, named for their ash-colored stone and thin, dusty soil. Little grows here except scrub grass and hardy thornbushes. The hills are hot in summer, cold in winter, and unpleasant year-round.

Despite their barrenness, the Ashen Hills hold value. Salt deposits in the eastern reaches supply Aal Salma's preserving industry. Ancient caves riddle the rock, used variously by hermits, outlaws, and—allegedly—pre-human cultures whose carvings still mark the deepest chambers. Miners and scholars both venture into the hills, though neither finds exactly what they're looking for.

##### Hiska Baatos

A coastal forest in the southern reaches, between the Ashen Hills and the sea. Less dense than the Whitewood, Hiska Baatos is lightly settled by fishing communities and charcoal-burners who supply fuel to Hillat Abu Hizam.

The forest has a reputation for unremarkability—it's simply there, neither beautiful nor dangerous, a place people pass through without remembering. Some find this suspicious. Most don't think about it at all.

##### Hiska Sobada

An uninhabited forest south of Hillat Abu Hizam, dense and dark despite its coastal position. Locals avoid it. The official reason is dangerous terrain—ravines, sinkholes, unstable ground. The unofficial reasons are vaguer and more varied.

Some say the forest is haunted by the spirits of prisoners who died in Vadu Inat and washed ashore. Others claim something older lives in the Sobada, something that was there before Aal Salma was founded. The capital's authorities dismiss these stories but have never attempted to survey or settle the forest. When asked why, they change the subject.

##### Bonecrunch Hills

A troll-infested range on Aal Salma's western border, home to numerous troll clans who've lived there longer than humans have sailed these coasts. The hills get their name from what happens to travelers who ignore the warnings.

Aal Salma maintains an uneasy truce with the trolls—humans don't settle the hills, trolls don't raid the lowlands. The arrangement mostly holds. Occasionally, brave or foolish merchants venture into troll territory to trade for bone-work and hides, commodities the trolls produce in abundance. These traders either return wealthy or don't return at all.

Some troll mercenaries have found employment in Aal Salma's less reputable enterprises. They're expensive, unreliable, and terrifying—which makes them perfect for certain jobs.

##### Prison Bay

A southern bay below Hillat Abu Hizam, guarded by the island fortress of Vadu Inat. The bay serves as the primary anchorage for Aal Salma's small but well-maintained navy—enough ships to patrol coastal waters and discourage casual piracy, not enough to project power beyond their own shores.

The bay's name comes from its most famous feature, visible from the capital's upper tiers: the dark silhouette of Vadu Inat, where Aal Salma sends those it wants forgotten.

##### Vadu Inat

The prison island at the mouth of Prison Bay, a black rock fortress that has held Aal Salma's most dangerous and valuable captives for over three centuries. Its name translates roughly as "the Final Ledger"—a merchant's term for accounts that will never be settled.

Vadu Inat holds three categories of prisoner: pirates captured in Salmani waters, political prisoners whose continued existence serves some purpose, and those whose crimes are too embarrassing for public trial. The categories sometimes overlap. Escape is considered impossible—the currents around the island are treacherous, the guards well-paid, and the sharks well-fed.

The prison's most famous feature is its silence. Vadu Inat has no torture chambers, no public executions, no dramatic cruelties. Prisoners simply... remain. They're fed adequately, housed in cells that are uncomfortable but not inhumane, and left alone. Years pass. Decades. The outside world forgets them. This, the Salmani believe, is worse than any physical punishment.

Some cells have held their occupants for lifetimes. The oldest prisoner, it's said, was there when the fortress was built—though that's surely legend. The guards don't discuss inmates with outsiders. The inmates don't discuss anything with anyone.

---

#### What Makes Aal Salma Interesting

- **Pragmatic neutrality**: Aal Salma deals with everyone—pirates, slavers, revolutionaries—as long as they pay and don't make trouble in port.
- **The refugee crisis**: Scalawag refugees strain resources and test Salmani patience. Some want to help; others want the borders closed.
- **Vadu Inat's secrets**: Who's actually in that prison? What deals keep certain prisoners alive?
- **Hiska Sobada**: The forest everyone avoids. What's actually in there?
- **The troll truce**: It's held for generations. What happens when it breaks?
- **Maps and knowledge**: The School of Charts knows things other nations don't. They're very careful about who gets to learn them.

---

#### What Will Go Wrong

Aal Salma's careful balance is eroding:

- **The Poum Titch war will spill over**. One side or the other will demand Aal Salma pick sides. Neutrality will become impossible.
- **Zamrat Aqabah is out of control**. The criminal economy is now larger than the legitimate one. Eventually, Hillat Abu Hizam will have to act.
- **The trolls are restless**. Something is pushing them out of the deeper hills. Raids have increased.
- **Vadu Inat holds someone important**. Sooner or later, someone will come to retrieve them—or silence them.
- **The Whitewood refugees carry more than trauma**. Disease, enemies, and secrets cross the border with them.

### Bonecrunch Hills

Home to numerous trolls.

### Chaal Nazzerox

Tags: state, nation

The largest state in Terrenia and one of its greatest horrors—an undead empire stretching from the western coast to the Crystal Mountains, ruled by the lich king Xynoth Azkonor. What was once a prosperous agricultural heartland is now a land of shambling dead, rotting cities, and the desperate living who serve or hide from their immortal master.

The empire is bounded by natural barriers on all sides: the sea to the west, the Crystal Mountains to the south, the Smokey Hills and their Firesworn defenders to the east, and the still-living states of northern Terrenia to the north. These barriers have contained the undead—for now. Xynoth's armies probe constantly for weakness, and his living servants work to build the navy that will let him break free.

Travel in Chaal Nazzerox is almost exclusively by river. The ground is soft, waterlogged, and refuses to hold roads. This has shaped the empire's geography—cities cluster along riverbanks, and whoever controls the waterways controls movement. The dead don't tire, but they're slow on soft ground. Barges are faster.

The land itself seems sick. Forests weep or frown. Hills are named for graves and bones. Lakes hold the drowned. Even the geography has absorbed the empire's nature, or perhaps it was always this way, and that's why Xynoth chose it.

---

#### Central Forests

##### Mournful Wood

The largest forest in Chaal Nazzerox, sprawling across the north-central region between Deadman's Lake and the Grave Hills. The Mournful Wood earned its name through a phenomenon no scholar has adequately explained: those who sleep within its boundaries weep uncontrollably through the night. By morning, the tears have crystallized on their faces, sealing their eyes shut.

Victims emerge with tear-tracks of pale crystal running from their eyes to their chins—permanent if not carefully removed. Some have gone blind. Others have been found wandering the forest's edge with their entire faces encased, suffocated by their own sorrow.

The undead pass through the Mournful Wood without difficulty. They don't sleep. They don't weep. Whatever curse afflicts this place targets only the living, which makes it an effective barrier between the northern territories and the south. Refugees fleeing the capital must go around—adding days to their journey and increasing the chance of capture.

##### Spiritwood

A forest in the northeast where something has gone wrong with the natural order of death. Spirits linger here—not undead (those are shadow-bound corpses), but actual spirits, the consciousness and identity that should have faded to Celestia. They didn't. They stayed.

The spirits of Spiritwood are not friendly. They remember their deaths, their murderers, their betrayals. Some were killed by Xynoth's forces. Others died in the chaos before the empire consolidated. A few are older still, remnants of whatever people lived here before. They hate the living for still being alive and hate the undead for being a mockery of what they've become.

Even Xynoth's forces avoid Spiritwood. The spirits cannot be commanded—they have no shadows to bind—and they're vicious to anything that enters. The forest has become a de facto no-man's-land, dangerous to both sides of any conflict.

##### Frowning Forest

A twisted woodland in the east where the trees grow in downward-curving shapes, their branches drooping like disapproving brows. Local legend claims the forest watched something terrible happen and has worn the expression ever since.

The Frowning Forest is not actively hostile like Spiritwood or Mournful Wood—it's simply oppressive. The trees block light. Sound carries strangely. Travelers report the constant sensation of being observed and judged. Most pass through as quickly as possible, though "quickly" is relative when every path seems to curve back on itself.

Refugees have learned to use the Frowning Forest as a hiding place. The undead can navigate it, but they're slow and easily confused by the twisting paths. A living person who knows the routes can stay ahead of pursuit for days.

---

#### Hills and Highlands

##### Grave Hills

The heart of Chaal Nazzerox's horror—a region of ancient burial grounds, mass graves, and earth that refuses to keep its dead. The Grave Hills are where Xynoth first raised his armies, drawing on centuries of accumulated corpses to build an unstoppable force.

The hills still produce. Fresh graves empty themselves within days. Bodies buried elsewhere sometimes claw their way toward the Grave Hills, drawn by whatever power saturates the soil. The living population learned long ago not to bury their dead here—they burn them instead, when they can, and scatter the ashes over water.

Some scholars believe the Grave Hills were cursed long before Xynoth arrived, that he simply recognized and exploited existing necromantic potential. Others argue he created the effect through sheer accumulated death. Either way, the hills remain the empire's most reliable source of new soldiers.

##### Hills of Deoria

Central highlands named for a kingdom that no longer exists. Deoria fell to Xynoth's first campaigns, its people scattered or enslaved, its cities reduced to ruins now picked over by the undead.

The Hills of Deoria are largely empty—depopulated by war and never resettled. Crumbling villages dot the slopes, their inhabitants long dead or fled. Cave systems riddle the rock, used by refugees hiding from undead patrols. The caves connect in ways the empire hasn't fully mapped, allowing the desperate to move unseen between regions.

Occasionally, someone emerges from the Hills of Deoria with pre-empire artifacts—jewelry, weapons, records of a nation that was. These fetch high prices among collectors willing to deal with goods from the undead lands.

##### Steed Hills

A rocky highland in the west where the Gray Citadel stands—one of the last holdout fortresses against the undead empire. The hills were once famous for horse-breeding, producing cavalry mounts prized across Terrenia. That tradition is extinct now; the horses were eaten during sieges or taken by the empire.

The terrain favors defense. Rocky outcrops, narrow passes, and poor footing make the Steed Hills difficult for shambling undead armies to traverse. The Gray Citadel was built here precisely because the land itself resists assault. So far, it has held.

##### Brevldorf Hills

Northeastern hills where scattered settlements still cling to existence by paying tribute to the empire. The people of Brevldorf learned early that resistance meant death—or worse, undeath in the lich king's armies. They chose survival.

Tribute takes the form of food, labor, and occasionally slaves. Villages that meet their quotas are left alone. Those that don't are made examples. The population has learned to hide their healthiest members when the collectors come, offering the old and sick instead. It's grim arithmetic, but it's kept them alive.

Resistance cells occasionally form in the Brevldorf Hills, young people who refuse to accept this existence. They rarely last long. The empire has informants everywhere, and the punishment for rebellion is applied to entire villages.

##### Prowling Hills

Southern highlands near the Crystal Mountains, where something hunts. Travelers report being stalked through the rocky terrain—not by undead, who are too clumsy for this landscape, but by something faster and more deliberate.

The most common theory is mountain predators descended from the Crystal ranges—cats, wolves, or something worse that found easy prey in the refugees trying to cross south. Others believe living resistance fighters use the Prowling Hills as a base, preying on empire supply convoys. A few whisper about older things, creatures that lived in these hills before humans came and resent all intruders equally.

Whatever prowls here, the undead armies have trouble in this terrain. Their shambling gait catches on loose rock, and they lack the awareness to spot ambushes until it's too late. The Prowling Hills remain unconquered—not because anyone defends them, but because the cost of conquest exceeds the value.

---

#### Lakes and Waterways

##### Deadman's Lake

A lake in the north-central region, so named for the bodies that fill its depths. The drowned dead of Chaal Nazzerox sink to the bottom of Deadman's Lake and stay there—preserved by the cold, dark water, never rising as undead despite the empire's necromantic saturation.

Scholars have theorized about why. Perhaps the water blocks whatever signal animates the dead. Perhaps the lake predates Xynoth's influence and carries older protections. Perhaps the drowned simply can't find their way out of the depths. Whatever the reason, Deadman's Lake is one of the few places in the empire where a corpse stays a corpse.

This has made the lake perversely valuable. The living sometimes dispose of their dead here, preferring true death to the alternative. The empire disapproves—every corpse in the lake is a soldier denied—but enforcement is difficult. The lake is large, the shores are many, and the dead don't report who dropped them in.

Gorvul Mkayin sits on the lake's southern shore, built there specifically to control access.

##### Sethlund Lake

The largest of the three western lakes near Hagswood, Sethlund has become hag territory. The coven uses its waters for rituals, its shores for camps, and its depths for disposing of victims. Fishing boats haven't worked these waters in decades.

The lake's surface often carries an oily sheen—residue from hag magic or something fouler. Locals claim the water itself has become poisonous, that anyone who drinks it falls under the hags' influence. True or not, no one tests the theory voluntarily.

##### Seron Lake

The middle of the three western lakes, smaller than Sethlund but deeper. Something lives in Seron Lake's depths—something large enough to create waves on windless days and old enough that even the hags of Hagswood treat it with respect.

The creature (if it is singular) has never been clearly seen. Fishermen in the time before the empire reported glimpses of scaled coils, massive shadows passing beneath their boats. Now, with the lake abandoned, it presumably feeds on whatever falls or is thrown in. The hags are suspected of making offerings.

##### Jabok Lake

The smallest and southernmost of the western lakes, Jabok is nearly dry—a muddy depression that fills only during heavy rains. Before the empire, villages surrounded it; now only their foundations remain, visible when the water level drops.

Some say the villages drowned when the lake rose unexpectedly, their populations becoming its first residents. Others claim the empire drained the lake deliberately, exposing the villages to destruction, and that the water has never fully returned. The truth is likely more mundane—climate shifts, upstream damming—but in Chaal Nazzerox, every tragedy acquires supernatural explanation.

##### The Rivers

The empire's highways. With no roads and soft ground, all significant travel and transport moves by water.

**Melkron River**: The largest river, running roughly north-south through the heart of the empire. Controls access between the capital region and the southern territories. Heavily patrolled by undead barges.

**Yephrenzi River**: Northwestern river flowing out of Aal Salma territory. One of the few routes refugees use to escape north—dangerous, but faster than overland.

**Tozzelak River**: Northeastern river through Brevldorf Hills. Tribute barges use this route; so do slave transports.

**Matorkey River**: Eastern river flowing toward the coast. Less traveled, as it leads to more heavily controlled territory.

**Rojek River**: Northeastern tributary, connecting several highland settlements to the main river network.

**Caarl River**: Central river serving the agricultural regions—what agriculture remains. Grain barges still move on the Caarl, feeding the living population.

**Caarline River**: Southern tributary of the Caarl, running through the Prowling Hills region. Dangerous; convoys require heavy escort.

**Berrisund River**: South-central river connecting interior settlements. Subject to frequent raiding—whether by living resistance or something else is unclear.

**Pabacine River**: Southwestern river flowing toward Lutuya Sound. Used primarily by the hags and those foolish enough to trade with them.

**Segos River**: East-central river serving the Frowning Forest region. Notoriously difficult to navigate; the forest seems to move the riverbanks.

---

#### Coastal Features

##### Hagswood

A dark forest at the southwest tip of Chaal Nazzerox, home to a coven of hags who terrorize the surrounding waters. The hags were here before the empire—they welcomed Xynoth's rise, seeing opportunity in chaos, and have carved out a domain within his domain.

The relationship between the lich king and the Hagswood coven is unclear. They're not his servants; hags answer to no one. But they're not his enemies either. Some arrangement exists—territorial, transactional, or simply mutual disinterest. The hags get their hunting grounds; Xynoth gets whatever the hags provide in exchange.

The forest itself is perpetually dim, its canopy blocking even midday sun. Paths shift between visits. Travelers who enter without hag permission rarely leave at all.

##### Nightport

A harbor on the coast of Hagswood, perpetually shrouded in unnatural darkness. The sun doesn't reach Nightport—not because of clouds or canopy, but because darkness has seeped into the air itself. Visitors report a pressure on their eyes, a thickness to the shadows that defies torchlight.

The hags of Hagswood use Nightport as their launching point for raids into the Strait of Curses. Their boats—if they can be called that—drift out from the harbor on nights when Nyxara hangs dark, hunting ships that stray too close to shore.

A few living traders deal with the hags through Nightport, exchanging goods for services or safe passage. These traders are universally distrusted elsewhere, but their prices for certain commodities can't be matched.

##### Strait of Curses

The waters south of Xabraedia and north of Hagswood are known as the Strait of Curses, named for the hags who prowl these treacherous waters. The strait is also inhabited by large, nasty serpents known as Silkwurms—creatures that can wrap entire ships in silk and knot them to the seafloor, dragging vessels and crews to their doom. The hags of Hagswood maintain an uneasy alliance with these serpents, communicating with them and occasionally working together to claim victims.

Ships that must cross the Strait of Curses do so quickly, in convoy if possible, and never at night. Even then, losses are common. The hags seem to know which ships carry valuable cargo—or valuable passengers.

##### Lutuya Sound

A southwestern bay where the empire's attempted shipbuilding efforts have repeatedly failed. Xynoth needs a navy to break free of his geographic containment, and Lutuya Sound has the deep water and sheltered anchorage to support one. The problem is the hags.

Every shipyard established in Lutuya Sound has been sabotaged, burned, or simply emptied of workers who vanished in the night. The hags apparently prefer their hunting grounds undisturbed by imperial naval traffic. Xynoth could force the issue—commit real resources to clearing Hagswood—but so far he's chosen to focus elsewhere. The standoff continues.

---

#### Towns and Villages

The empire's smaller settlements—what remains of them. Most were thriving communities before Xynoth's rise; now they're labor camps, tribute stations, or empty ruins. The living population in these places exists to serve the empire's needs, nothing more.

**Zornos**: A northeastern town in the Brevldorf Hills, serving as a collection point for tribute from surrounding villages. The living elite here are tax collectors backed by undead enforcers.

**Myavis Kaalthox**: An eastern town near the Frowning Forest, known before the empire for its woodworkers. Now produces coffins and siege equipment. The irony is not lost on the remaining craftsmen.

**Sharyakax**: A town east of the Hills of Deoria, uncomfortably close to the Melthrayn holdout. Functions as a forward observation post, watching for activity from the city-state. The garrison here is more alert than most.

**Nomos**: A central town on the Caarl River, once a market hub. Now processes agricultural goods from the surrounding slave farms. The granaries here feed the living population of several cities.

**Lepox Naan**: A south-central town that processes slaves arriving from the north before distribution to work sites. The holding pens are larger than the living quarters.

**Myrth**: A southern town near the Prowling Hills, perpetually on edge. Whatever hunts in those hills sometimes ranges this far north. The undead garrison here has unusually high turnover.

**Moartos**: A southwestern town serving as a waypoint between Pyaal Faras and the interior. Travelers bound for hag territory pass through here—if they're foolish enough to go.

**Iagyax**: A southern agricultural town where slave labor works the last productive farmland before the Crystal Mountains. The fields here haven't failed yet, which makes Iagyax valuable.

**Kuyakov**: A southwestern town on the Pabacine River, marking the edge of hag-influenced territory. Residents here have learned to leave offerings at the forest's edge. It seems to help.

**Esaavos**: A southern town that once served as a rest stop for travelers crossing to the Crystal Mountains. Now it's a military supply depot for the endless southern campaigns.

**Housan**: A small town in the agricultural south, unremarkable except for its survival. The living here keep their heads down and meet their quotas. That's all anyone can do.

**Hasaag**: A southeastern town near Eyovlix, housing support personnel for the mountain campaigns. Smiths, leatherworkers, healers—the trades an army needs that the dead can't perform.

**Kaffyak**: A southwestern village near the coast, half-abandoned. Those who remain fish the coastal waters and try not to attract attention from Hagswood.

**Soryla Navys**: A southern village in the foothills, named for a river that dried up generations ago. The population dwindles each year as quotas claim more than births replace.

**Toffertine**: A coastal village on Lutuya Sound, caught between the empire's shipbuilding ambitions and the hags who sabotage them. Residents have learned to be useful to both sides—a precarious balance.

---

#### What Will Go Wrong

Chaal Nazzerox is contained but not defeated. The empire will eventually:

- **Break out through the Crystal Mountains**: The passes are defended, but undead don't tire. Eventually, numbers will tell.
- **Build a navy**: Whether through Lutuya Sound, captured ships, or some other method, Xynoth will reach the sea.
- **Consume the holdouts**: The Gray Citadel and Melthrayn cannot resist forever. Every siege weakens them; every fallen defender becomes an enemy.
- **Find new sources of shadow**: The empire runs on animated corpses, and corpses run out. Xynoth needs fresh bodies from somewhere.
- **Fragment further**: Xynoth is a lich—his spirit fractures with each death and rebirth. Eventually, what remains may not be sane enough to rule.

### Green Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

The Green Mountains form the spine of southern Windor, a rugged barrier separating the halfling lowlands from Poum Titch and the lands beyond. Despite the name, they're not forested—the "green" comes from the thick blankets of moss and lichen that coat the exposed rock faces, giving the peaks an algae-tinged pallor visible from the lowlands below.

These are not tall mountains by continental standards, but they're steep, broken, and riddled with caves. The perfect country for trolls.

#### Character

The Green Mountains are more highland than alpine—rocky plateaus broken by sudden ravines, slopes of loose scree, cliff faces bearded with moss. The peaks rarely exceed a mile in height, but the terrain is treacherous. Visibility is poor. Sound carries strangely. And the caves go deep.

In summer, the mountains are almost pleasant—wildflowers in the high meadows, clear cold streams, views that stretch to the distant coast. But summer is short. By autumn the first snows come, and the mountains become hostile. By winter they're impassable to anyone without wings or a death wish.

The smell is distinctive: wet stone, moss, and something faintly sulfurous from the thermal vents that dot the deeper valleys. Travelers say you can smell the mountains before you see them.

#### Trolls

The Green Mountains are infested. Not everywhere, not constantly, but persistently. Troll warrens honeycomb the deeper cave systems, and every few years a new clan pushes into territory closer to the lowlands.

The trolls here are the common variety—large, regenerating, not clever but cunning enough. They raid for food, preferring livestock but taking halflings when they can. A troll can carry off two sheep or one adult Windorf. They hunt at night, in bad weather, when visibility favors their darkvision.

Troll behavior follows rough patterns:
- **Winter**: Dormant or sluggish. Raids rare.
- **Spring**: Emerging hungry. Most dangerous season for raids.
- **Summer**: Active but dispersed, hunting the highlands.
- **Autumn**: Gorging before winter. Raids increase as easy prey grows scarce.

The Windorf have adapted. The Warden system exists because it must. But the trolls are never eliminated—the caves go too deep, and more always seem to emerge. It's a managed problem, not a solved one.

#### Passes

Three main routes cross the Green Mountains into Poum Titch:

**The Nylen Pass**: The primary route, relatively well-maintained, starting just south of the capital. Wide enough for wagons in good weather. Warden patrols sweep it regularly. Still dangerous, but the safest option.

**The Eastern Stair**: A steeper, narrower path descending toward the Throatslit Mountains and the lands beyond. Less traveled, less patrolled. The name comes from the carved steps—old work, pre-Windorf—that switchback down the most treacherous cliff faces.

**The Goat Roads**: Dozens of smaller tracks used by herders, smugglers, and the desperate. Unmarked, unmaintained, often impassable. Some dead-end in troll territory.

#### Notable Locations

##### Clawsnatch Lake

High in the central mountains, Clawsnatch is the largest body of water in the range—a cold, deep lake filling an ancient crater or collapsed cave system. The water is clear but dark, visibility dropping to nothing below thirty feet.

Local legend says something lives in the depths. The Wardens neither confirm nor deny, but they don't patrol the lake shore, and they discourage expeditions. Whatever truth the stories hold, the lake is genuinely eerie—unnaturally still, strangely quiet, with a tendency to produce thick fog on windless mornings.

The claw-shaped peninsula that gives the lake its name extends from the western shore, a narrow spit of rock covered in the same green moss that marks the mountains.

##### The Sulfur Vents

Scattered through the deeper valleys, these thermal vents release steam and sulfurous gases from somewhere far below. The ground around them stays warm year-round, melting snow and supporting patches of unusual vegetation—heat-loving ferns, pale fungi, things that shouldn't grow at this altitude.

Some vents are small, barely noticeable. Others form steaming pools or fumaroles that whistle and hiss. The largest cluster sits in a valley the Wardens call the Kettle, which they avoid. Something nests there. They haven't confirmed what.

##### The Old Mines

Before the Windorf, someone else worked these mountains. The evidence remains: abandoned mine shafts, collapsed tunnels, rusted tools of unfamiliar design. The mines sought copper and tin primarily, with traces of silver in the deeper veins.

Most are unstable and long-emptied. A few serve as Warden outposts or emergency shelters. Others have been claimed by trolls—the caves suit them. The deepest shafts connect to natural cave systems that no one has fully mapped.

#### Connecting to the Secret Mountains

The Green Mountains blend into the Secret Mountains to the southwest, with no clear boundary between them. The Secret Mountains are smaller, lower, more accessible—but haunted by the legend of the lost halfling goldmine. Prospectors still occasionally venture into the overlap zone, searching for the old workings. Most come back empty-handed. Some don't come back.

#### Travel Advisory

The Windorf don't forbid travel into the Green Mountains, but they don't encourage it either. Anyone heading into the heights should:

- Travel in groups of at least four armed individuals
- Register their route with the Warden post at Vaken or Nylen
- Carry signal flares (the Wardens provide them, for a fee)
- Expect the journey to take twice as long as estimated
- Accept that rescue is unlikely if something goes wrong

The mountains are not a place for casual exploration. They're a buffer zone, a troll preserve, a problem contained rather than conquered. The Windorf live next to them because they must. They don't pretend to control them.

### Poum Titch

Tags: state, nation

A Scalawag goblin nation in southeastern Terrenia, wedged between the Green Mountains to the north, Aal Salma to the west, and the coastal waters of Whitefin Bay to the east. For generations, Poum Titch was known for its raucous festivals, its philosopher-poets, and its peculiar dual-capital system—a compromise that kept the peace between the coastal and inland Scalawag factions.

That peace is over.

#### The Civil War

A massive civil war has erupted. The northern region has declared independence from the rest of the state, and what began as political grievance has become open slaughter. Armies are assembling. Villages burn. The roads are no longer safe.

The causes seem absurd to outsiders: disputes over festival rights, river toll allocations, and which capital gets to host the Philosopher's Congress. But beneath the theatrical grievances lie real fractures—northern Scalawags resent generations of taxation without representation, conscription quotas that fell disproportionately on their villages, and the perception that Tadinu's bureaucrats have grown fat while northern farmers starve.

The rebellion began when the northern council refused to send its tithe-wagons south. Tadinu sent tax collectors backed by armed escorts. The escorts never returned. Now the Stalking Fields run red, and both sides claim the other struck first.

---

#### Settlements

##### Tadinu

The administrative co-capital of Poum Titch, an inland city of limestone warrens and bureaucratic complexity. While Lekia gets the festivals and the glory, Tadinu does the actual work of governance—tax collection, census-keeping, military logistics, and the endless paperwork of running a nation.

The city is built into and around soft limestone formations, with council chambers, treasuries, and archives carved directly into the pale rock. The Titch Council meets here in a natural amphitheater called the Hollow, where acoustics allow speakers to address hundreds without raising their voice.

The rebellion has cut Tadinu's northern trade roads. Food is rationed. The council debates endlessly while refugees crowd the southern districts. Some whisper that Tadinu's bureaucrats caused this war through decades of neglect; others insist the northern rebels are opportunists who smell weakness.

##### Lekia

The cultural co-capital, a coastal city on Whitefin Bay famous for its amphitheaters, festival grounds, and the Philosopher's Wharf—a long stone pier where Scalawag thinkers hold public debates, sometimes for days on end, drawing crowds who cheer arguments like sporting matches.

Lekia's harbor shelters fishing fleets and the ornate festival barges that carry revelers between coastal celebrations. The city's architecture favors open plazas and tiered seating, designed for performance and spectacle. Even the fish markets have stages.

The war has changed everything. Rebel-sympathizing ships blockade the harbor, strangling trade. The festival grounds have become refugee camps. The philosophers still debate on the Wharf, but now they argue about who deserves to die.

##### Goipin

A strategic crossroads city in the central region, where the Tyura River commerce meets overland trade routes. Before the war, Goipin was neutral ground—a place where northern and southern Scalawags did business without politics.

Rebel forces now occupy the city. It was here that the first blood of the civil war was spilled, when a tax dispute at the river wharves escalated into a massacre. The warehouses that once held trade goods now hold prisoners. Both capitals consider retaking Goipin essential to victory; neither has managed it.

##### Bobeitio

A southern city along the Mhunta River, the agricultural heart of loyalist Poum Titch. Grain barges from Bobeitio's irrigation networks feed Lekia and Tadinu both. The fields here are ancient, worked by the same Scalawag families for generations.

Since the war began, Bobeitio has become a loyalist stronghold and the primary supply depot for southern forces. Refugee camps have doubled the city's population. Food that once sold in markets now goes directly to army quartermasters. The farmers grumble, but they fear the northerners more than they resent their own government.

##### Uara

An eastern coastal town on Whitefin Bay, traditionally focused on fishing and salt-drying. Uara's Scalawags are more conservative than their western cousins—less interested in philosophy and festivals, more concerned with tides and catch yields.

Officially loyalist, Uara has avoided the worst of the fighting through geography and apathy. The town has become a smuggling hub, moving goods to both sides for anyone with coin. Some call this pragmatism; Tadinu's loyalists call it treason. So far, no one has forced the issue—Uara's fish and salt are too valuable to alienate.

---

#### Geography

##### Ovuluria River

The lifeblood of Poum Titch—a major river flowing from the western highlands through the heart of the nation, connecting Tadinu to Lekia before emptying into Whitefin Bay. Control of the Ovuluria means control of trade, communication, and troop movement between the capitals.

Before the war, river traffic was constant: grain barges, passenger ferries, festival boats strung with lanterns. Now the river is contested. Loyalist patrols guard the southern stretches; rebel raiders strike from hidden coves. The fortress at Tuo, long abandoned, has become a flashpoint.

##### Tuo

A ruined fortress on the Ovuluria River, strategically positioned between Tadinu and the eastern territories. The fortress dates to an earlier age—some say pre-Scalawag, built by whatever people held this land before the goblins came.

Both sides want Tuo. Its walls still stand, its position commands river traffic, and whoever holds it controls the Ovuluria's middle reaches. Skirmishes have been fought in its shadow. So far, neither army has committed to a full siege. The ruins are said to be haunted, which gives even battle-hardened Scalawags pause.

##### Tyura River

A northern river flowing from the Green Mountains through rebel-held territory. The Tyura was once famous for its clarity—snowmelt from the mountains kept it cold and clean year-round. Micah Falls, where it tumbles over a 200-foot cliff face, was a pilgrimage site.

The rebels control the Tyura now. They've fortified the river crossings and collect tolls from anyone foolish enough to travel north. Rumor says they're diverting water to flood the Stalking Fields, turning the ancient battleground into a marsh.

##### Mhunta River

A southern river flowing through Bobeitio and the agricultural lowlands before reaching the coast. Warmer and slower than the Tyura, the Mhunta supports the irrigation networks that make southern Poum Titch the nation's breadbasket.

Loyalist forces patrol the Mhunta heavily. It's their supply line, their lifeline, the one river they cannot afford to lose. So far the rebels haven't pushed this far south—but if Goipin falls back into loyalist hands, the Mhunta will be the next target.

##### Mavriki River

An eastern river running through the hills toward Whitefin Bay. Less vital than the Ovuluria but still contested—whoever controls the Mavriki controls access to the eastern coast and the towns that depend on it.

The fighting here has been sporadic, more raids than battles. Both sides probe each other's positions, testing for weakness. The villages along the Mavriki have learned to hide when soldiers approach, regardless of which banner they fly.

##### Whitefin Bay

The major bay dominating Poum Titch's eastern coast, named for the silver-scaled whitefin fish that have sustained coastal communities for centuries. Whitefin is the primary protein source for most of the nation—smoked, salted, or fresh, it appears on every table.

The war has disrupted the fishing grounds. Naval skirmishes between loyalist and rebel vessels make open-water fishing dangerous. Catches are down. Prices are up. The coastal towns grow hungry, and hungry Scalawags grow desperate.

##### Stalking Fields

Open grasslands in the northwestern region, named for the tall grass that lets hunters—and warriors—stalk prey unseen. This has been Scalawag battleground for generations, a traditional place for armies to meet and settle disputes.

Ancient goblin burial mounds dot the fields, marking where previous conflicts ended. The current war has added fresh graves. Loyalist and rebel forces clash here regularly, neither able to hold the ground for long. The grass, they say, has turned red at the roots.

##### Troyt Loofos

A dense forest in the western reaches, known for its strange acoustics—sounds carry unpredictably, echoing from directions that make no sense. Some blame the trees; others whisper about fae influence or old magic sunk into the soil.

The rebels use Troyt Loofos for ambushes. Loyalist patrols enter and don't come out, or come out raving about voices in the trees. Military commanders have learned to go around rather than through. The forest has become a no-man's-land, belonging to neither side and dangerous to both.

##### Grayfang Mountains

Home to the Grayfang Goblins, a clan distinct from the Scalawags who use stone attunement to augment their teeth to enormous size. While many choose to enlarge their incisors into tusks, there's wide variation—some combine their front teeth into a single massive fang, others favor enlarged molars for crushing.

The Grayfangs have remained neutral in the civil war, watching from their mountain holds. Both sides have sent envoys seeking alliance. The Grayfangs have sent them back with polite refusals and not-so-polite warnings about what happens to armies that march through their territory.

##### Throatslit Mountains

Home to the Throatslit Murder Clan, descended from a single legendary goblin whose skill with knives became the foundation of an entire warrior tradition. The clan has ruled the mountain passes for generations through reputation alone—no army wants to fight knife-masters in terrain that favors ambush.

Like the Grayfangs, the Throatslits have stayed out of the civil war. Unlike the Grayfangs, they've been less polite about it. Envoys who push too hard don't return at all. Both sides have learned to route their armies elsewhere.

---

#### What Will Go Wrong

The civil war will not end cleanly. Even if one side achieves military victory, the grievances that sparked the conflict will fester. Poum Titch faces:

- **Famine**: The war has disrupted planting, harvesting, and fishing. Winter will be brutal.
- **Refugee crisis**: Displaced Scalawags are flooding into Aal Salma, Windor, and even the Shacklands.
- **Intervention**: Outside powers may see opportunity in Poum Titch's weakness.
- **The fortress at Tuo**: Whatever haunts those ruins, both armies keep waking it up.
- **The Grayfangs and Throatslits**: Their neutrality has limits. Push them, and two veteran mountain clans enter a war that neither capital can afford to expand.

### Riptear Sea

Tags: sea

Home to numerous Cendoriln.

### Secret Mountains

Tags: mountains

A small range of mountains south of Windor, where a halfling infamously kept secret a massive goldmine in the hills for nearly a decade. The gold has long been mined out and the mines abandoned, but the story remains legend.

### Smokey Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills south of Poum Titch, east of Aal Salma, and north of Chaal Nazzerox that have ceaselessly billowed smoke and ash for decades. The cause remains a mystery—theories range from massive forges inside the hills (operated by dwarves, goblins, or cyclops) to ongoing volcanic activity.

The hills are inhabited by the Firesworn, who have adapted to life amid the constant smoke and heat. The perpetual haze makes the region dangerous to navigate, and the true nature of what produces the endless smoke remains unknown.

### Windor

Tags: state, nation, region

Windor occupies the northern coast of Terrenia, a wedge of fertile lowland backed by the forested bulk of the Green Mountains. The land slopes from mountain foothills in the south down to a rocky coastline in the north, cut by rivers draining snowmelt toward the sea. It's a country of orchards and pastures, stone-walled villages, and distant peaks that always seem closer than they are.

The Windorf halflings who call this place home have shaped it into something comfortable—roads well-maintained, inns frequent, hedgerows trimmed. But the mountains loom. Smoke rises from unseen valleys. And every village within a day's walk of the treeline keeps its gates sturdy and its signal fires ready.

#### Geography

**The Lowlands** stretch from the mountain foothills to the coast, a patchwork of small farms, orchards, and grazing land. Rivers wind through shallow valleys, powering mills and feeding irrigation channels. The soil is good here—dark and loamy in the river bottoms, stonier on the hillsides. Apple orchards are common, as are sheep and goats.

**The Coast** is rocky rather than sandy, with small fishing harbors carved into natural inlets. The water is cold year-round. Villages like Hanssevelde and Gorstraat work the sea for cod, herring, and crab, trading their catch inland for grain and goods.

**The Mountain Fringe** marks where farmland gives way to rocky slopes. Villages here—Vaken, Comines, settlements along the hill roads—live with one eye always on the heights. The air is thin and cold. And the trolls come down when they're hungry.

#### Climate

Windor has cool summers and bitter winters. Snow blankets the mountains from mid-autumn through late spring, and the lowlands see their share of frost. Spring brings flooding as snowmelt swells the rivers. Autumn is the kindest season—harvest time, when the orchards hang heavy and the roads are dry.

Fog rolls off the coast on many mornings, especially in spring and autumn. The mountain passes become impassable by early winter and don't reliably open until late spring.

#### Roads and Travel

The main road runs from Nylen northeast through Roye toward the Aal Salma border at Gorstraat. Secondary roads connect the lowland villages in a loose web. Most are dirt, muddy in spring, dusty in summer, frozen solid in winter.

Mountain roads are another matter. The passes into the Green Mountains are steep, winding, and treacherous even in good weather. Goat tracks and old mining roads push into the lower slopes, but few go deep. The Windorf don't encourage casual travel into troll country.

Travel times (on foot, good weather):
- Nylen to Roye: 2 days
- Nylen to Biesestraat: 1 day
- Nylen to Vaken: half a day
- Coast villages to Nylen: 2-3 days
- Any mountain pass: add half again the distance in time, and bring guards

#### Settlements

##### Nylen (Capital)

The largest settlement in Windor sits where the main road from the south meets the primary pass into the Green Mountains. Nylen grew up around this crossroads—first as a waystation, then a market town, now the seat of the Council of Chairs.

The town spreads across both banks of the Tyarah River, connected by three stone bridges. The Council Hall dominates the eastern bank, a sprawling complex of meeting chambers, archives, and the Bureau of Fortune where luck-blessers train and ply their trade. The western bank holds the main market, the craftsman's quarter, and most of the inns.

Nylen has walls—not tall ones, but solid, maintained out of habit rather than immediate necessity. The trolls rarely come this far down. But the Windorf remember when they did.

##### Roye (Town)

The only other settlement large enough to call a town, Roye sits in the northeastern lowlands where several secondary roads converge. It serves as the market hub for the eastern villages and the coastal settlements, handling the fish trade that flows inland and the grain that flows out.

Roye is smaller than Nylen and less concerned with politics. The locals joke that Nylen talks while Roye works. The town has a reputation for practical folk who care more about getting things done than debating about it.

##### Villages

The remaining settlements are villages, ranging from a few dozen families to a few hundred. They cluster in three rough groups:

**Coastal Villages** (Hanssevelde, Gorstraat, Mazits): Fishing communities along the northern shore. Gorstraat handles most trade with Aal Salma. Hanssevelde is the largest fishing harbor. Mazits sits on a small peninsula, isolated but picturesque.

**Lowland Villages** (Biesestraat, Egelplas, Naast, Panottes, Gentbosch, Lavischois, Zalfen, Utsenstraat, Paperode, Bergwijk): Agricultural communities scattered across the farming country. Most are unremarkable in the best way—quiet, prosperous, boring. Biesestraat and Lavischois are the largest, serving as local market centers for surrounding farmsteads.

**Mountain-Fringe Villages** (Vaken, Comines, Aulnois, Schonburg, Hanset): Settlements along the forest edge where the lowlands meet the mountains. These are the frontline communities, the ones that see troll raids firsthand. They're more fortified than their lowland cousins—palisades, watch towers, gates that close at dusk. Vaken hosts a permanent Warden garrison. Schonburg has old walls from a previous era, when things were worse.

#### Notable Features

##### The Tyarah River

The largest river in Windor, the Tyarah rises somewhere deep in the Green Mountains and flows northeast through Nylen before curving east toward the coast. It's navigable by small boats for much of its length, though rapids near the mountain foothills limit upstream travel.

##### Micah Falls

Where the mountains drop sharply toward the eastern lowlands, the Tyarah's tributaries cascade down in a series of waterfalls collectively called Micah Falls. The largest drop is nearly two hundred feet. The falls are visible from miles away on clear days, a white streak against the green mountainside. A small shrine to fortune stands at the base, maintained by travelers who survived the mountain crossing.

##### Clawsnatch Lake

A cold, deep lake high in the Green Mountains, Clawsnatch sits in a bowl-shaped valley surrounded by steep rocky slopes. The name comes from the claw-shaped peninsula that juts into the water from the western shore—or from something else, depending on who you ask.

The lake is remote, several days into the mountains, and few Windorf visit it willingly. Fishermen who've made the trip report excellent trout but an unsettling stillness. Something large lives in the depths. The Wardens don't deny it.

#### Hazards

The obvious hazard is trolls—see the Green Mountains entry for details. Beyond that:

**Spring Floods**: The Tyarah and its tributaries overflow their banks most springs. Lowland villages are built on high ground, but roads wash out and fields flood.

**Mountain Weather**: The passes are deadly in winter and unpredictable in shoulder seasons. Blizzards can strike with little warning. Fog makes navigation treacherous.

**Wolves**: Common in the highlands, occasionally bold enough to threaten livestock in fringe villages. More nuisance than mortal danger, but they've killed travelers caught alone.

## Central Aboyinzu

### Geography

Central Aboyinzu is the vast interior of the continent—a general term encompassing the savanna heartlands, the Deadloop inner sea, and the territories between the major mountain ranges. The terrain is a mix of tan and light green, characteristic of vast savanna and dry grassland. Think of the African Serengeti—endless golden grass beneath wide skies, punctuated by scattered trees and watering holes.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Terrenia and the states of Chaal Nazaerox, Grustos, and Quintas
- **East**: The Elderwilds peninsula and South Sea
- **South**: The Morygun Mountains and Dragon's Spine range
- **West**: Korgül forest, the Mumbling Forest, and largely uncharted wilderness of grassland and forest

#### Major Geographic Features

##### The Deadloop (Inner Sea)

A large inland sea cutting into the continental interior. Key features around the Deadloop:
- **Echem Yiakraxes**: Large plains in the northwestern portion of the Deadloop
- **Donclik Sound**: Body of water due east of Echem Yiakraxes
- **Mikisapi Forest**: An island/peninsula within the Deadloop, encircled by the waterway
- **Tenches**: A city-state on Mikisapi Forest

##### The Crystal Mountains

A major mountain range running southwest to northeast across central Aboyinzu. At their southwestern point, they connect to the Morygun Mountains. At their northeastern extent, they overlap with the mountains of Grustos. Chaal Nazaerox lies to their north.

##### The Morygun Mountains

Running northwest to southeast, these mountains connect the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region (home to satyr).

#### States and Territories

- **Chaal Nazaerox**: The massive northern state (shared with Terrenia)
- **Grustos & Quintas**: Eastern states near the Crystal Mountains
- **Kadroka**: Southern territory
- **Chechol**: Eastern territory, south of the Deadloop and northwest of Dalizi
- **Korgül**: Western forest region, home to satyr

### Notable Locations

#### Frogsong River

Inhabited by extremely poisonous frogs.

#### Crystal Mountains

##### Blinding Mines

Located deep within the Crystal Mountains at the intersection of void and air leylines, the Blinding Mines are filled with crystals of pure light that illuminate the tunnels with blinding intensity. However, the mines are extremely dangerous—the intersection of void and air leylines causes unpredictable teleportation throughout the tunnels, leading miners to become hopelessly lost or teleported into solid rock.

Despite these hazards, the mines contain valuable crystals and magical resources, drawing prospectors willing to risk the supernatural dangers. Many elves have died attempting to exploit the mines' riches.

#### Morygun Mountains

A major mountain range running northwest to southeast, connecting the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region. The southern reaches of the Morygun Mountains connect to the Remakemizi Mountains north of Kadroka state.

The mountains are home to the fearsome Morygun mountain goats—thunderous ram-centaur creatures attuned to both air and earth magic. These vicious predators are violently territorial, charging at intruders with devastating force and using their elemental attunement to cause rockslides and wind blasts. Traversing the Morygun range means risking an encounter with these deadly guardians of the peaks.

##### Phaerhom

A hidden valley deep in the far southern Morygun Mountains, southeast of the Korgül forest region. This secluded vale is home to Dead Claws—dangerous predators that have adapted to the mountain environment—and a small enclave of fairies and pixies who have claimed the valley as their sanctuary.

The fairy enclave guards the valley fiercely, using illusion magic to hide the entrance and nature magic to make the surrounding mountains nearly impassable. Few outsiders even know Phaerhom exists, and those who stumble upon it are usually led astray by fairy glamours before they can find their way in.

### Agony Stones

Tags: geography, cursed, landmark, danger

The Agony Stones are not ruins. They are not a monument. They are not the remnants of some ancient civilization. They are the still-dying body of something that has been dying for millennia.

Spanning roughly forty miles east to west and twenty miles north to south, the Agony Stones dominate the southern reaches of Tythikerys. The formations are massive—individual "stones" can reach a mile across—and take the shape of strange, contorted, branching tubes, like the circulatory system of something impossibly vast, frozen mid-pulse and turned to rock.

#### The Dying One

The entity at the heart of the Agony Stones has no name that anyone living knows. Scholars call it the Dying One. The Tytheri orcs call it *Thryg-Makaal*, which translates roughly to "the Bleeding Forever." Whatever it is—a creature from another plane, something older than the current age, a god that fell—it suffered a catastrophic wound sometime in the distant past and has been dying ever since.

Its death is happening on geological time. The stone formations are its petrified tissue, still technically alive, still in agony.

#### Physical Properties

The Stones exhibit properties that should be impossible for rock:

**Temperature**: The stone is warm to the touch. Not hot, but noticeably warmer than the surrounding air. Something inside is still metabolizing, impossibly slowly.

**Heartbeat**: Press your ear to the rock and wait. After three or four hours, you will hear it: a single, massive pulse. Then silence. Then another, hours later. The Dying One's heart still beats.

**Movement**: The tubes creep. The movement is imperceptible to the eye—inches per year at most—but they are not static. They are reaching. Toward what, no one knows.

**The Weeping**: Dark fluid seeps from cracks and fissures throughout the Stones. Not blood, not oil, but something in between. The Tytheri call it *Thryg-Myr*—the Agony Ichor.

#### The Agony Ichor

The fluid that weeps from the Stones is the blood of the Dying One, and it has properties that make it priceless to those who understand it.

When processed and consumed, the Ichor grants resistance to pain, heightened aggression, and a reddish tinge to the eyes. Extended use bleaches the skin pale white. The Tytheri blood orcs have built their entire culture around harvesting and consuming it.

But the Ichor is addictive. Long-term users find their emotions deadening—everything becomes muted except the sensation of violence. They need to inflict pain to feel anything at all. Withdrawal is worse: the Dying One's suffering hits directly, phantom agony with no physical source, lasting until the user consumes more Ichor or dies.

Alchemists prize the Ichor for other applications: potent painkillers, flesh-hardening agents, and more esoteric preparations that scholars don't discuss openly.

#### Why Everyone Avoids It

Both Kadrokans and Tytheri give the Stones a wide berth. The orcs approach only in small, carefully-timed harvesting parties. No one *lives* in the Stones. The reasons are visceral:

**Sympathy Pain**: Proximity to the Stones causes your body to feel what the Dying One feels. At the edges, it's discomfort—an ache in the joints, a headache that won't fade. Hours of exposure becomes screaming agony with no visible cause. Your body is sympathizing with something that has been in torment for millennia.

**Petrification Risk**: Extended contact—days, not hours—and your flesh begins to harden. The stone spreads from the point of contact, slowly, inexorably. The dragon Melekas learned this eight hundred years ago and has been fused to the bedrock of Ponoigari ever since. Melekas is the most famous victim, but not the only one.

**Dream Invasion**: Sleep within five miles of the Stones and you will dream its suffering. Not your own nightmares—its. You will experience moments of the Dying One's endless death, stretched across eons, compressed into a single night's sleep. People wake exhausted, weeping, sometimes screaming. Repeated exposure has driven people mad.

**Animal Madness**: Horses won't approach. Dogs howl and flee. Birds avoid the airspace above the Stones entirely. Only creatures too simple to feel the sympathy effect—insects, worms, certain reptiles—can exist there without distress.

#### Consciousness

The Dying One is aware.

Its thoughts move at geological speed—a single coherent thought might take years to form—but it is conscious. It feels pain. It knows it is dying. Scholars who have attempted magical communication report fragmentary impressions: confusion, agony, and something that might be a plea for help. Or might be a plea for death. The distinction is unclear.

Some theorize that the Dying One's consciousness is why the sympathy effect exists: it is reaching out, trying to share its burden, trying to make others understand what it has endured for so long.

#### What's Inside

The petrified tissue of the Dying One contains things. Artifacts, creatures, even people—preserved from the moment of the original wound, trapped in stone that was once living flesh. Explorers who have penetrated the outer formations and returned (there are very few) report finding:

- Weapons of unknown design, fused into the stone
- Skeletal remains that don't match any known species
- Chambers that might once have been organs, now hollow and echoing
- Crystalline structures that pulse with the same slow heartbeat as the surrounding stone

What treasure or knowledge might be found deeper in, closer to whatever passes for the Dying One's core, is unknown. No one has gone that far and returned sane.

#### The Cycle

The Agony Stones have created a cycle that traps everyone around them:

The Dying One bleeds Ichor. The Tytheri harvest it and become addicted. The addiction requires violence to feel anything. The violence is directed at Kadroka. Kadroka cannot retaliate effectively because their dragon-king was crippled by the same Stones that sustain the orcs. The dragon schemes for a way to destroy the Stones. But destroying the Stones might kill the Dying One entirely—and no one knows what happens when something that big finally dies.

Does it release energy? Does something trapped inside escape? Does the sympathy effect amplify into a psychic scream that kills everyone within a hundred miles?

Melekas wants to know. Melekas is not sure anyone should find out.

#### Approaching the Stones

For those foolish or desperate enough to approach:

**From the North** (Kadrokan territory): The land transitions from savanna to rocky scrubland before reaching the Stones. The sympathy effect begins at roughly ten miles distance—subtle at first, then intensifying. Kadrokan patrols turn back at the five-mile mark.

**From the West** (Tythikerys): Orc harvesting parties know paths that minimize exposure time. They move fast, collect what they need from the outer formations, and retreat. They do not go deep. They do not linger. Even addicted to the Ichor, they fear the Stones themselves.

**From the South**: The Fury Hills and Deadjack Forest provide some buffer. The forest, in particular, seems to dampen the sympathy effect slightly—whether due to distance, the trees themselves, or some other factor is unknown.

There is no safe approach. There is only "less immediately fatal."

### Bloodswamp

Tags: swamp, geography, wetland

The Bloodswamp is a large wetland in southwestern Kadroka where the region's major rivers converge before flowing into Tytheri territory. It marks the effective border between Kadrokan civilization and the orc-controlled scrublands to the south—and it is named for the battles that have been fought there for centuries.

#### Geography

The swamp forms where the Royko River's tributaries—the Sikuri, the Noara, and smaller streams—merge into a single drainage. The terrain is a maze of channels, pools, reed beds, and sodden ground. During the wet season, the swamp expands dramatically; during the dry season, it contracts to a still-substantial core of permanent wetland.

**Approximate dimensions**: 15-20 miles north-south, 30-40 miles east-west at maximum wet-season extent.

#### The Name

"Bloodswamp" is not poetic exaggeration.

For as long as Kadroka and the Tytheri have been in conflict, this wetland has been contested ground. Orc raiding parties push north through the swamp; Kadrokan forces try to stop them. Bodies sink into the muck. Blood mixes with the water. Some say the reeds grow taller here because of what feeds them.

During dry seasons when the water level drops, bones surface—human, orc, and older things. The locals collect them, burn some, sell others. War is the swamp's economy.

#### Strategic Importance

The Bloodswamp is both obstacle and gateway.

**For the Tytheri**: The swamp is difficult terrain, but it provides water and cover during the long push into Kadrokan territory. Experienced raiders know paths through the worst of it. Less experienced ones drown.

**For Kadroka**: The swamp is the last defensible line before the savanna heartland. Naga troops excel in this terrain; human forces struggle. Fortified positions on dry ground overlook the main channels, but there are always alternative routes.

Neither side can truly *hold* the Bloodswamp. It is too large, too mutable, too easy to infiltrate. Instead, both sides maintain presence, conduct patrols, and fight when they meet.

#### Ecology

The swamp supports a rich and dangerous ecosystem:

**Flora**: Dense reed beds, floating vegetation mats, gnarled trees on the higher ground. Some plants have developed interesting properties—natural painkillers, hallucinogens, poisons. Kadrokan herbalists know which are which; outsiders often do not.

**Fauna**: Crocodilian creatures patrol the deeper channels. Venomous snakes occupy the shallows. Clouds of biting insects make extended stays miserable. Larger predators—swamp cats, massive serpents—hunt both prey and unwary travelers.

**Disease**: The water breeds illnesses. Parasites, infections, and swamp fevers afflict those who drink untreated water or spend too long in the wet. Kadrokan troops rotate frequently; Tytheri raiders push through quickly for the same reason.

#### Settlements

No permanent settlements exist within the swamp proper. The nearest substantial population centers are:

- **Dranabaru** (north): Kadrokan city overlooking the swamp's northern edge, housing most of the garrison forces.
- **Arigaska** (east): Frontier city that faces both swamp and savanna threats.

Temporary camps, outposts, and watch stations dot the swamp's margins, but flooding makes permanent construction impractical.

#### Naga Presence

The Bloodswamp is where Kadroka's naga population proves most valuable.

Naga troops operate in the swamp with an ease human soldiers cannot match. They move through water silently, see in the murky depths, and fight effectively in environments that exhaust ordinary infantry. Some of the most successful defenses against Tytheri raids have been organized by naga commanders who understand the terrain intimately.

This military importance reinforces naga political influence in Kadroka generally. Human generals cannot dismiss naga contributions when naga soldiers are the ones holding the line.

#### Crossing the Swamp

For travelers (or adventurers) who need to pass through:

**From the North** (Kadroka): Kadrokan patrols can provide guidance to known paths—for a fee, and with questions about your business. Going south means going toward the orcs; that attracts attention.

**From the South** (Tythikerys): Good luck. Any path you find was made by orc raiders. If you're not an orc, the orcs will find you. The swamp's dangers pale compared to meeting a Tytheri war party.

**Guides**: A few individuals—human, naga, and otherwise—know the swamp well enough to navigate it safely. Their services are expensive and their availability is unpredictable. Most won't guide anyone into Tytheri territory.

#### What Lies Below

The swamp has accumulated centuries of battle detritus.

Weapons, armor, and other war material sink into the muck and stay there. Scavengers retrieve what they can reach, but the deeper layers remain untouched. Somewhere below the surface is a layered record of every conflict fought here—an archaeological treasure trove for anyone willing to dig through a monster-infested, disease-ridden, actively contested war zone.

Rumors persist of older things beneath the battlefield debris. The swamp existed before Kadroka, before the Tytheri. What people fought here in earlier ages, and what they left behind, is unknown.

### Bluesong Bay

Tags: bay, geography, coastal

Bluesong Bay is a large inlet on the western coast of Central Aboyinzu, notable primarily for who *doesn't* use it. Despite being the natural maritime gateway for the Kadroka region, the bay's coastline is controlled entirely by the Tytheri blood orcs, who have no interest in sea trade and actively prevent anyone else from establishing ports.

#### Geography

The bay extends roughly 80 miles inland from the Untouched Sea, with a width of 40-50 miles at its mouth narrowing to about 20 miles at its deepest point. The waters are calm compared to the open sea, protected by the Sokorgül peninsula to the north.

**Coastline Features:**
- **Northern Shore**: Where Sokorgül forest meets the water. Dense woodland comes nearly to the waterline. No settlements.
- **Eastern Shore**: Scrubland and grassland of Tythikerys. The Royko River empties here, creating a marshy delta.
- **Southern Shore**: The Mumbling Forest dominates this stretch, its trees growing to the water's edge.
- **A small island**: Sits in the northern portion of the bay, unnamed and uninhabited.

#### The Name

Sailors from distant ports who have entered the bay report an unusual acoustic phenomenon: the water seems to carry sound in strange ways, producing a low, melodic resonance that some describe as singing. The effect is subtle—easy to dismiss as wind or waves—but persistent enough that multiple independent accounts describe it.

Whether this is a natural property of the bay's shape and currents, an effect of the nearby Mumbling Forest, or something else entirely remains unknown. The Tytheri, who avoid the water, have no explanation.

#### Strategic Importance

Bluesong Bay should be one of the most valuable maritime assets in southwestern Aboyinzu. It offers:
- Protected anchorage from open-sea storms
- River access deep into the interior via the Royko
- Proximity to the productive Kadrokan savanna

Instead, it sits empty. The Tytheri have no naval tradition and no interest in developing one. They control the coast purely to deny it to Kadroka—a strategy that has worked for centuries.

#### Kadrokan Frustration

Every generation, some Kadrokan leader proposes seizing a foothold on the bay. Every generation, the plan fails. The problems are straightforward:

1. **No Navy**: Kadroka has no maritime tradition and would need to build a fleet from scratch, using materials hauled over the Ramakemizi Mountains.

2. **Supply Lines**: Any coastal settlement would need to be supplied through Tytheri territory—or by sea, requiring the fleet that doesn't exist.

3. **The Dragon Can't Help**: Melekas cannot fly to provide air support for a coastal operation. Kadrokan forces would face the orcs without their greatest asset.

The bay remains tantalizing and unreachable, a constant reminder of what the Tytheri blockade costs Kadroka.

#### What Lives There

The bay itself supports typical coastal marine life—fish, crustaceans, seabirds. The waters are clean and productive.

More unusual reports include:
- Large shapes moving in the deeper portions of the bay, never clearly seen
- Lights beneath the water at night, particularly near the Mumbling Forest shore
- The unnamed island occasionally appearing to have structures on it that aren't there when approached

Whether these are real phenomena, tricks of the "singing" water, or sailor's tales is unclear. Few ships enter the bay, and fewer still linger.

#### Approaching by Sea

For those arriving from the Untouched Sea, Bluesong Bay presents a deceptively welcoming appearance: calm waters, a protected anchorage, apparent emptiness. The dangers are not immediately visible.

Ships that land are unlikely to be attacked at the waterline—the Tytheri avoid the coast itself—but any party moving inland will quickly encounter orc patrols. The orcs may not use the sea, but they watch it, and strangers are not welcome.

The Mumbling Forest shore is technically safer from orcs but presents its own uncertainties. The forest does not welcome visitors.

### Byvarnül Lake

Tags: lake, geography

A broad, shallow lake in the southeastern reaches of Luendrokrül, roughly fifteen miles across at its widest point. The water is dark—not murky, but deep-colored, like tea steeped too long. The lake is still. Unnaturally still. Even when wind moves through the surrounding trees, the water's surface barely ripples.

#### The Drowned Ruins

The lake has risen over centuries, swallowing structures that once stood on dry ground. Stone walls break the surface near the shore, their tops worn smooth by time and water. Further out, shapes are visible beneath the surface on clear days—larger structures, partially collapsed, built from stone blocks too massive for human construction.

The architecture doesn't match the other ruins scattered through Luendrokrül. Those are human-scale, built with human techniques. The drowned ruins at Byvarnül are something else: doorways twice normal height, corridors wide enough for processions, and a central structure—visible only as a dark mass in the lake's deepest point—that defies easy categorization.

Divers have explored the shallower ruins. They report halls filled with preserved objects: furniture, tools, containers that might have held food or offerings. No bodies. No bones. Whatever lived here left, and they took their dead with them.

No one has reached the central structure. Divers who've tried report difficulty—the water grows colder as they descend, currents appear where none should exist, and something about the depths discourages progress. Not danger exactly. Just a growing certainty that they should turn back.

#### The Shore Settlements

The lake's shores show signs of later habitation—the human-scale ruins found throughout the forest. These settlers built over and around the earlier structures, incorporating the strange architecture into their own. A village wall might include blocks scavenged from the drowned ruins. A foundation might rest on an older, larger foundation meant for different purposes.

These settlers stayed longer than anywhere else in Luendrokrül. The ruins here are more extensive, more developed, suggesting generations of occupation. And then they left too, just like the rest, with no explanation and no trace.

Whatever drew them to the lake—the earlier ruins, the water itself, something they found or hoped to find—apparently wasn't enough to keep them.

#### Local Beliefs

The Ix'Lorett won't discuss Byvarnül Lake in detail. When pressed, they acknowledge knowing about it, acknowledge that it predates their presence in M'Svyla, and decline to say more. Their silence isn't hostile—it's simply complete.

The Old Terrenians in the Cowardly Mountains have stories, fragments passed down from ancestors who knew the forest before it became what it is now. They speak of the lake as a door—not metaphorically, but literally. A door to somewhere else, opened long ago by the tall builders, never properly closed.

In their telling, the builders didn't die or flee. They went through. And the door, left ajar, changed the forest around it. The settlers who came later were drawn by the opening, trying to follow, trying to understand. One by one, family by family, they found what they were looking for.

The Old Terrenians don't enter Luendrokrül. They don't look toward the forest if they can help it. When asked why, they give the same answer as everyone else: *some doors shouldn't be opened, and some should never have been left open*.

### Chechol

Tags: region, state

A landlocked territory in southeastern Central Aboyinzu, defined by three river valleys that drain northward into the Deadloop inner sea. Chechol sits between the vast savannas of the interior and the Dalizi Confederation to the south—a transitional zone where the flat grasslands begin to rise into the Dalizi highlands.

The landscape is rolling savanna punctuated by river-cut valleys. The valleys themselves are green and cultivated—wheat, vegetables, orchards—while the highlands between them remain wild grassland dotted with Rentar monasteries. From the highlands, you can see for miles: golden grass rippling in the wind, the distant gleam of the Deadloop to the north, and the hazy rise of the Dalizi mountains to the south.

#### The Three Rivers

Three river systems define Chechol's geography, each carving a valley from the southern highlands to the northern lowlands:

##### Chechik River

The westernmost and largest river, originating in the highlands near the Pyramid of Five Sides and flowing north-northeast toward the Deadloop drainage. The Chechik Valley is the political and economic heart of Chechol.

**Major Settlements:**
- **Sevich** (capital, ~15,000): Where the Chechik widens before joining the Deadloop system. Seat of Duke Vorotny, home to the Grand Temple of Communion.
- **Astopol** (~8,000): Upriver from Sevich, a market town serving the central valley's agricultural lands.
- **Pyadrov** (~6,000): Near the river's headwaters, the gateway to the southern highlands and the Pyramid.

##### Stulov River

The central river, smaller than the Chechik but supporting the most productive farmland. The Stulov Valley is Chechol's breadbasket—wide, flat, and intensively cultivated.

**Major Settlements:**
- **Stulovka** (~7,000): The valley's main town, a prosperous agricultural center known for grain markets.
- **Yeletity** (~4,000): A smaller town upriver, increasingly dominated by a nearby Rentar monastery.

##### Riki River

The easternmost river, closest to the Dalizi border and the School of Summoning. The Riki Valley is the most rural and the most Rentar-influenced—fewer human farms, more monasteries, and a growing atmosphere of religious intensity.

**Major Settlements:**
- **Prozny** (~5,000): The largest town in the Riki Valley, serving as a waystation for travelers to the School of Summoning.

#### The Highlands

Between the river valleys, the highlands rise in gentle swells of savanna grass. These uplands are sparsely populated by human standards, but they're where the Rentar have made their home.

**Rentar Monasteries**

Scattered across the highlands are dozens of Rentar monasteries—stone compounds built for contemplation, martial training, and spiritual communion. Each monastery maintains gardens, livestock, and training grounds sufficient for self-sufficiency. They trade with the valley towns but could survive without them.

The largest concentration of monasteries lies between the Stulov and Riki valleys, in the highlands south of Yeletity. This region has become informally known as the **Holy Hills**, though the name makes human residents uncomfortable—it feels presumptuous, like the Rentar are claiming the land's soul.

**The Pyramid of Five Sides**

In the highlands between the Chechik and Stulov valleys, southeast of Pyadrov. See the full entry for details. The Pyramid predates human settlement—a stepped structure whose fifth face exists only in Celestia. Pilgrims come from across Aboyinzu to meditate in its shadow.

#### Lake Ntsa

A small lake on the eastern border, straddling Chechol and the Dalizi city-state of Turbuni. The School of Summoning overlooks Lake Ntsa from a ridge on its western shore. The lake itself is unremarkable—good fishing, pleasant views—but its border position makes it diplomatically significant.

#### Climate and Terrain

Chechol has a classic savanna climate: wet season (roughly 60 days) brings thunderstorms and flooding in the river valleys; dry season means golden grass and dust. The highlands stay cooler than the valleys, catching breezes from the south.

Travel is easiest along the river valleys, where roads connect the major towns. Highland travel requires guides—the terrain isn't dangerous, but it's featureless enough that travelers lose their bearings. The Rentar navigate by landmarks invisible to outsiders: a particular rock, a twisted tree, a monastery bell audible only at certain hours.

#### Borders

- **North**: The Deadloop inner sea and its surrounding territories
- **East**: The Dalizi city-states (Turbuni directly borders)
- **South**: The Dalizi highlands, rising toward Lake Tonactlet Chipe
- **West**: The open savannas of Central Aboyinzu

#### Notable Locations

##### Sevich

The capital city, where the Chechik River widens into a marshy delta before joining the Deadloop drainage. Sevich sprawls along both banks, connected by three bridges. The ducal palace sits on the western bank's highest point; the Grand Temple of Communion dominates the eastern bank.

The city feels old and comfortable—stone buildings weathered by centuries, streets worn smooth by generations of feet. It's also quieter than it should be. Visitors notice that people speak softly, defer quickly, avoid disagreement. The Rentar presence isn't overbearing, but it's pervasive. Even the humans seem to be waiting for guidance before acting.

##### The Pyramid of Five Sides

A stepped pyramid of unknown origin, its four visible faces oriented to the cardinal directions. The structure is made of stone that doesn't match any local quarry—pale gray, almost luminous in certain light. The fifth face exists only in Celestia; those who enter during specific celestial alignments can cross between planes.

The Pyramid is tended by the Keepers of the Fifth Face, an order of Rentar monks who've maintained the site for centuries. Pilgrims come to meditate, seek visions, or attempt the crossing. Most experience nothing. A few receive genuine celestial inspiration. Rarely, someone doesn't come back.

##### The School of Summoning

On a ridge overlooking Lake Ntsa, technically on the border with Turbuni. The School has operated for over two thousand years, training summoners and communion practitioners who serve across Aboyinzu. Its campus includes the Spire of Calling, the Communion Halls, the Binding Grounds, and the Archives.

See the full entry in magic_and_knowledge/schools/ for details.

##### The Holy Hills

The highland region between the Stulov and Riki valleys, where Rentar monasteries are most concentrated. This isn't an official designation—maps call it the Southern Highlands—but locals use the name, sometimes reverently, sometimes uneasily.

The monasteries here are older and larger than those elsewhere in Chechol. Some have stood for over a thousand years. Their bells ring at dawn and dusk, audible for miles across the grasslands—a sound that human residents have grown up with, comforting and unsettling in equal measure.

#### Roads and Travel

**The Valley Road**

A well-maintained road connecting Sevich to Prozny via Stulovka, running roughly north-south through the river valleys. This is Chechol's main artery—merchants, pilgrims, and officials travel it constantly.

**The Pyramid Road**

A secondary route from Pyadrov to the Pyramid of Five Sides, then continuing south into the Dalizi highlands. Less traveled, more scenic, and increasingly used by Rentar moving between monasteries.

**Highland Tracks**

Unmarked paths connecting the monasteries across the highlands. Outsiders need guides; the Rentar navigate by sound, smell, and landmarks invisible to others.

#### What Visitors Notice

First-timers to Chechol often describe feeling watched—not threatened, but observed. The Rentar are everywhere, even when you can't see them. Their monastery bells mark the hours. Their silent figures stand on hilltops at dawn. Their certainty fills every conversation.

The humans are friendly but reserved. They answer questions but rarely volunteer information. They smile but rarely laugh. Longtime visitors say the population has grown quieter over the decades—more deferential, less argumentative, slower to make decisions without consultation.

The land itself is beautiful. Golden savannas, green river valleys, ancient monuments. It would be peaceful if not for the feeling that everyone is waiting for something.

### Cowardly Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A sub-range of the Crystal Mountains, curving southwest from the main spine to form Luendrokrül's northwestern boundary. The name is old, possibly older than the common tongue version suggests, and no one agrees on its origin. What everyone agrees on is that things live here that live nowhere else—and most of them came from somewhere else.

#### Geography

The Cowardly Mountains are lower and more broken than the Crystal Mountains proper. Where the main range presents sheer faces and defined peaks, the Cowardly Mountains are a jumble of ridges, box canyons, hidden valleys, and cave systems that honeycomb the stone. The terrain is defensive by nature—easy to hide in, hard to search, impossible to hold against someone who knows it better than you.

The western slopes drop into the foothills above the Minas River. The eastern faces overlook Luendrokrül's canopy, offering views that would be spectacular if anyone wanted to look at that forest for long. The Safeway Passage cuts through the range's narrowest point, the only reliable route between the western territories and the lands beyond.

#### The Refuge

The Cowardly Mountains earned their name—or perhaps always had it—because things flee here. Not just animals seeking territory. People. Creatures. Things that needed to disappear.

Refugees from Chaal Nazzerox's expansion found their way here generations ago, the living who escaped before Xynoth's conquest was complete. Their descendants still inhabit hidden valleys, speaking old Terrenian dialects and practicing customs that died everywhere else. They don't welcome outsiders, but they don't attack them either. They've learned that staying hidden is safer than staying hostile.

Other things came later. Deserters from a dozen armies. Criminals whose crimes were severe enough to warrant real pursuit. Cultists whose worship drew too much attention. Monsters intelligent enough to know when they were being hunted. The mountains don't judge. They just provide cover.

Not everything here fled from something. Some things fled *to* something—the forest below, Luendrokrül, draws certain minds the way a wound draws flies. Pilgrims who believe something waits in the ruins. Scholars obsessed with the vanished civilization. Madmen who heard voices promising answers. They pass through the Cowardly Mountains on their way down, and the mountain-dwellers let them go. Anyone that determined to enter Luendrokrül won't be stopped by warnings.

#### The Inhabitants

No census exists of who or what lives in the Cowardly Mountains. The terrain makes surveying impossible and the inhabitants make it inadvisable. What's known comes from occasional contact at the Safeway Passage, rare trading encounters, and the testimony of the few who've traveled deeper and returned.

**The Old Terrenians**: Descendants of refugees, clustered in three or four hidden valleys. They raise goats, grow what the thin soil allows, and maintain traditions from a country that no longer exists. Suspicious of outsiders but not automatically violent. Will trade for metal goods and news from the wider world.

**The Unaffiliated**: A catchall term for everyone else—bandits, hermits, exiles, and stranger things. No organization, no common cause, just people and creatures who needed to be somewhere no one would look. Mostly avoid each other as much as they avoid outsiders.

**The Listeners**: A name used by the Old Terrenians for something else in the mountains. Not human, not quite animal, seen only at the edges of vision. They don't attack, don't communicate, don't seem to want anything. They just watch. The Old Terrenians leave offerings at certain stones and don't speak of them to outsiders.

#### Why "Cowardly"

Theories abound. The mountains shelter cowards and refugees. The stone is geologically unstable, "cowardly" rock that crumbles under stress. An old legend claims the mountains themselves fled here during some primordial cataclysm, cowering at the edge of the world.

The Old Terrenians have their own explanation, which they don't share with outsiders. When traders at the Safeway Passage have asked, the answer is always the same: *The mountains know what's in the forest. So do we. Wouldn't you hide too?*

### Crystal Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A fifty-mile spine of peaks running northwest to southeast through Central Aboyinzu, separating Terrenia and the horrors of Chaal Nazzerox from the forests of M'Svyla and the southern grasslands. The range takes its name from the dense quartz formations that stud its slopes—on clear days, the peaks catch the sun and throw light across the foothills in blinding sheets.

#### Geography

The Crystal Mountains rise sharply from the surrounding terrain, their western faces particularly sheer where they border Chaal Nazzerox. The eastern slopes descend more gradually into the temperate forests of M'Svyla. Dozens of passes cut through the range, though only a handful are wide enough for an army. These chokepoints have determined the fate of the region for centuries.

The mountains are riddled with cave systems, many of them lined with crystal formations that grew over geological ages. Quartz veins run through the granite like frozen lightning, and in places the crystal deposits are so dense that natural light penetrates deep into the mountainside, refracted through countless facets until it emerges in unexpected places. Miners speak of "light wells"—shafts where sunlight travels hundreds of feet through crystal channels to illuminate chambers that have never seen the sky.

#### The Crystal Mines

Mining operations dot the eastern slopes, extracting quartz and rarer mineral formations for trade. The work is dangerous—not from magic, but from the mountains themselves. Crystal formations are brittle and unpredictable. Miners have been buried by sudden collapses, blinded by light concentrated through crystal lenses, or simply lost in the labyrinthine cave networks. The Ix'Lorett of M'Svyla prize certain resonant crystals for their craft, and a steady trade flows between the mining settlements and the forest villages below.

The most valuable deposits lie deeper, in chambers where the crystal formations have grown for millennia undisturbed. Expeditions into the deep mines return with specimens worth fortunes—or don't return at all.

#### The Defenders

Someone holds the passes against Chaal Nazzerox. They have held them for years.

The defenders are not a single army. They are remnants of Terrenian border garrisons who refused to flee, mercenary companies paid by southern states who fear what happens if the mountains fall, volunteers from a dozen nations who'd rather die in the passes than see the undead flood south. Religious orders maintain fortified monasteries on strategic peaks. Exiles from Chaal Nazzerox itself—the living who escaped Xynoth's conquest—fight alongside people who would have been their enemies a generation ago.

There is no unified command. Cooperation happens through necessity and mutual desperation. Some passes are held by hardened professionals; others by farmers with spears who happened to live in the wrong valley when the dead came north.

They are losing. Slowly, year by year, pass by pass. The undead do not tire, do not starve, do not break. The defenders do all three. Every winter, the line contracts. Every spring, the dead probe further. The mathematics are simple and merciless: Xynoth has forever, and the defenders do not.

#### The Northern Threat

The Crystal Mountains are all that stands between Chaal Nazzerox and the living south. Xynoth's undead legions mass in the Prowling Hills and along the mountain's northern approaches, testing defenses, probing for weakness. The terrain favors the defenders—narrow passes, steep approaches, positions that can be held by few against many—but terrain only delays the inevitable when your enemy never stops coming.

Why Xynoth hasn't committed his full strength remains unclear. Perhaps the cost isn't worth the gain. Perhaps something in the mountains gives him pause. Perhaps he's simply patient, content to grind down the defenders over decades rather than spend his armies in costly assaults. The lich king's motives are not human motives, and those who try to predict him rarely survive their miscalculations.

#### The Southern Slopes

Below the eastern passes, the mountains give way to forested foothills that blend into M'Svyla. The transition is gradual—bare rock to scrub pine to the temperate broadleaf forests where the Ix'Lorett make their homes. Streams cascade down from snowmelt and mountain springs, feeding the rivers that water the forests below.

The Ix'Lorett maintain healing stations in the foothills, tending to wounded defenders who make it down from the passes. It's quiet work, far from the fighting, but essential. The lizardfolk ask no questions about allegiance or origin. They simply heal what can be healed and bury what cannot.

Some defenders, broken by the fighting, never return to the passes. They drift into M'Svyla's forests and stay, finding something in the Ix'Lorett's patient philosophy that the endless war had burned out of them.

### Deadjack Forest

Tags: forest, geography, dangerous

Deadjack Forest is a dense woodland in southeastern Kadroka, positioned between the Fury Hills and the approaches to the Agony Stones. The forest is named for the jack pines that dominate it—trees that appear dead, with bare grey branches, but are very much alive and deeply unsettling.

#### Geography

The forest covers approximately 30 miles east-west and 20 miles north-south, filling a basin between the Fury Hills to the north and the rising ground toward the Agony Stones to the south. The terrain is uneven, with rocky outcrops breaking through the forest floor and seasonal streams that flood during the wet season.

#### The Trees

Deadjack pines are visually disturbing. Their bark is pale grey, almost white. Their branches are bare except at the very tips, where clusters of dark needles grow in twisted masses. The trees appear skeletal, corpse-like, as if the forest died long ago and forgot to fall down.

The trees are alive. They grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment. But they have adapted to conditions—possibly magical conditions, given the proximity to the Agony Stones—that have stripped away everything that makes a tree look healthy.

Walking through the Deadjack Forest feels like walking through a graveyard. The bare branches cast strange shadows. The wind through the needle-clusters makes sounds like whispered conversation. The overall effect is deeply oppressive.

#### Sympathy Dampening

The Deadjack Forest has one notable property: it seems to dampen the sympathy effect from the Agony Stones.

Within the forest, the phantom pain and emotional disturbance caused by proximity to the Dying One is noticeably reduced. Not eliminated—travelers still feel something—but muted compared to equivalent distances in open terrain.

Why this occurs is unknown. Theories include:
- The trees absorb or redirect whatever emanates from the Stones
- The forest sits on a leyline that interferes with the sympathy effect
- Something in the soil or water neutralizes the transmission medium
- The forest itself is in sympathy with the Dying One and simply doesn't pass the effect to others

Whatever the cause, the dampening makes Deadjack Forest the safest approach route to the Agony Stones—which is not the same as safe.

#### Wildlife

The forest supports unusual fauna:

**Deadjack Ravens:** Pale-feathered birds that nest in the skeletal branches. They watch travelers with apparent intelligence and occasionally follow groups through the forest. Their calls sound disturbingly like words.

**Grey Wolves:** A population of wolves with fur that matches the trees' bark, nearly invisible among the trunks. They hunt in the forest and rarely leave it.

**Other Things:** Reports of stranger creatures exist—things that might be corrupted by the Stones' influence, things that might have always lived here, things that might be the forest's own defenses. These reports are inconsistent and unverified.

#### Traversing the Forest

For those attempting to reach the Agony Stones from Kadrokan territory, Deadjack Forest is the preferred route:

1. Cross the Fury Hills (contested, storm-prone)
2. Enter the forest from the north
3. Navigate south through approximately 20 miles of dead-looking trees and unsettling fauna
4. Emerge on the northern approaches to the Stones

The journey takes 2-3 days for a prepared party. The dampening effect makes sleep possible, though rarely restful. The forest's residents are dangerous but not inevitably hostile.

Most who attempt this route are doing so at Melekas's behest, seeking knowledge of the Dying One or a cure for the dragon's stillbinding. Few return with good news.

### Deadloop

Tags: sea, waterway, geography

A vast inland sea surrounding Mikisapi Island, connecting Donclik Sound to the interior waters of Central Aboyinzu. The name comes from old sailing hazards—ships that lost the currents could spend weeks circling the island before finding the exit.

#### Geography

Deadloop is roughly fifty miles across at its widest point, forming a near-complete ring of open water around Mikisapi Island. The northern passage opens to Donclik Sound; the southern channels connect to the river systems of Central Aboyinzu. The western shore is bounded by Chechol territory and the Sallow Hills; the eastern shore borders the empty approaches to the Wanderlands.

The water is brackish—salt from Donclik Sound mixing with freshwater from the mainland rivers. Depths vary wildly: shallow flats near the shores drop suddenly into trenches that plunge hundreds of feet. Local sailors know the safe routes; outsiders hire pilots or risk their hulls.

#### The Currents

Deadloop's currents flow in a rough clockwise pattern, driven by tidal exchange with Donclik Sound and the outflow of the southern rivers. Ships entering from the north can ride the current around the island's western shore, then exit south—a journey of several days with favorable winds.

The danger comes from missing the exit channels. Ships that drift past the southern passages get caught in the eastern current, which sweeps them back north toward Donclik Sound. Before modern navigation, crews could circle the island multiple times, running out of fresh water and food while the cursed waters of Donclik Sound crept closer with each pass. Hence: Deadloop.

#### Relationship to Donclik's Curse

The curse that haunts Donclik Sound does not extend into Deadloop. The mixing of freshwater from the mainland rivers dilutes whatever essence the kraken-matriarch left behind—or perhaps the curse simply cannot survive outside the sound's boundaries. Either way, Deadloop is safe. Ships can anchor here, crews can fish these waters, and travelers can take their time.

This makes Deadloop one of the only safe harbors in the region. To the north, Donclik Sound is cursed. To the east, the Wanderlands offer nothing. To the west, Chechol is landlocked. Deadloop—and the city-state of Tenches at its center—controls the only reliable maritime route between Central Aboyinzu and the South Sea.

#### What It Looks Like

Open water stretching to the horizon in every direction, broken only by the dark line of Mikisapi Island to the east or west depending on your position. The water is gray-green and choppy, kicked up by winds that have fifty miles of fetch to build. Fishing boats work the shallows near the shores; larger vessels keep to the deeper channels where the currents run true.

On clear days, you can see the Sallow Hills rising from the western shore, and sometimes the distant towers of Tenches above the forest canopy to the east. On foggy days—which are common—you see nothing, and navigation becomes a matter of current-reading and prayer.

#### For Adventurers

Deadloop offers:

- **Safe passage** through a region surrounded by dangers
- **The only reliable maritime route** between Central Aboyinzu and the South Sea
- **Tenches** at its center—neutral ground, trade hub, and political crossroads
- **Shipwrecks** from centuries of sailors who misjudged the currents
- **A buffer zone** between the cursed waters of Donclik Sound and the settled lands to the south

### Echem Yiakraxes

Tags: savannah, plains, geography, terrogone, dangerous

A vast killing ground in northwestern Central Aboyinzu, Echem Yiakraxes is Terrogone territory—and everyone knows it. The name translates roughly from Old Aboyinzan as "the Empty Throne," though whether this refers to some forgotten kingdom or the Terrogones' unchallenged dominion is lost to history. Caravans route around it. Armies avoid it. The few explorers who've returned describe endless tan grass under a bleached sky, the silence broken only by wind and the distant crack of bones.

#### The Claimed Land

The Terrogones have hunted here for centuries, and the land shows it. Prey animals have been culled to near-extinction; what remains are creatures too fast, too poisonous, or too clever to catch. The grass grows sparse and brittle. Watering holes are killing grounds, ringed with the gnawed remains of the desperate and the foolish.

Terrogone family groups claim territories of dozens of square miles, marked at the borders by **bone totems**—vertical stakes of fused skulls and femurs, treated with some substance that preserves them against rot. The message is clear. Travelers who ignore it rarely get a second warning.

The scattered mountain formations in the northern reaches serve as Terrogone strongholds. Caves and overhangs provide shelter, elevation for spotting prey, and defensible positions during the rare inter-family conflicts. These aren't settlements in any civilized sense—more like predator dens scaled up for creatures that stand six feet tall on all fours.

#### What the Terrogones Protect

The Chulpe race file mentions that Terrogones serve as "protector of the region's most dangerous secrets." This isn't metaphor. Something lies at the heart of Echem Yiakraxes that the Terrogones guard with unusual deliberation—not merely hunting intruders, but *preventing access* to specific locations.

Nyavminthk Castle is the obvious candidate. The Terrogones don't occupy the ruin, but they patrol its approaches. Scholars who've studied Terrogone behavior from safe distances note that family groups that normally war over territory cooperate when it comes to the castle's perimeter. Whatever's inside, they want it to stay there.

Local theories range from the mundane (a breeding ground, a food cache) to the apocalyptic (a sealed daemon, a leyline wound, something from before the current age). The Terrogones aren't talking.

#### Survival and Transit

Nobody crosses Echem Yiakraxes by choice. Those who must—usually pursuing bounties, fleeing worse things, or catastrophically lost—follow a few hard-won rules:

- **Travel by night.** Terrogones hunt dawn and dusk. Midday heat and full darkness offer narrow windows.
- **Stay downwind.** Their sense of smell is extraordinary. Experienced travelers carry packets of bitter herbs that mask scent.
- **Never approach water.** Terrogones stake out every watering hole. Bring everything you need or die thirsty.
- **If you see a bone totem, you're already being watched.** Turn back. Running triggers pursuit.

The Tasqh Evikkris river along the western edge offers the only reliable transit. River traffic stays close to the water; the Terrogones rarely hunt the banks. Why they avoid the river is unclear—possibly the current is too strong for their bulk, possibly something in the water they've learned to respect.

#### What It Looks Like

Endless tan grass, knee-high and razor-edged, stretching to a horizon that shimmers with heat. The soil is pale and powdery, kicked into dust clouds by the constant wind. Scattered acacia-like trees offer the only shade, their branches hung with old kills—Terrogone markers or simply convenient storage. The sky feels too large, too empty. Sound carries for miles, which means silence is survival.

The smell is dry grass, old blood, and something musky-sharp that travelers learn to recognize as Terrogone scent. Once you know it, you never forget it.

#### For Adventurers

Echem Yiakraxes offers:

- **Nyavminthk Castle** at its heart—a dungeon guarded not by traps but by apex predators
- **Terrogone politics** to exploit, if you're clever enough to play family groups against each other
- **Ancient secrets** the Terrogones are protecting, which means someone powerful wants them protected
- **Survival challenges** that test resource management, stealth, and the wisdom to know when to turn back
- **The question** that drives the foolhardy: what could possibly be worth guarding this hard?

### Enuau Kemjallb

Tags: citystate

The radiant House of the Sun—a golden city-state of the Kryaaji sun elves, forbidden to outsiders. Enuau Kemjallb rises from the shores of Sopona Fia lake in western Grustos, its white stone towers and golden domes reflecting sunlight in displays visible for miles. The Light leyline passes directly through the city, and the Kryaaji believe this is no coincidence.

The sun elves maintain strict isolation not from arrogance but from sacred duty. They believe their light and their home are too pure for outsiders to touch—that contact with the wider world would diminish what they guard. Visitors are turned away at the boundary markers, politely but with spears ready. The Lightbearer priests who patrol these borders radiate actual sunlight from their eye sockets, a reminder that the Kryaaji's faith is not merely symbolic.

Trade with the outside world occurs at designated boundary markets along the Flejdeaako Yni river, never within the city itself. Merchants leave goods at appointed places; the elves collect what interests them and leave payment. No haggling. No conversation. The system works because Kryaaji craftsmanship commands premium prices, and their Wysynnbre-trained eagles are beyond price entirely.

#### The Wysynnbre

The golden, luminant eagles of the Sunwing Peaks nest in eyries maintained by the Kryaaji for generations. These magnificent creatures bond with sun elf handlers through rituals of magical symbiosis—each pair sharing senses, emotions, and something deeper. A Kryaaji with a bonded Wysynnbre can see through the eagle's eyes across vast distances, and the eagle gains a measure of its partner's wisdom.

The eagles are never sold. Occasionally, one chooses a non-Kryaaji handler—this is rare, disturbing to the sun elves, and considered a matter for the individual eagle's judgment rather than elven intervention.

#### The Order of Bryn

The Kryaaji maintain their own sect of the Order of Bryn, differing from mainland branches in one crucial belief: they hold that Bryn, the Awakened Sun, was an elf rather than a human. This theological distinction has caused friction with other Bryn-worshippers, but the Kryaaji consider outside opinions irrelevant. Their Lightbearer priests demonstrate powers that mainstream clergy cannot replicate, which they take as vindication.

#### Relations

**Grustos**: The sun elves technically reside within Grustos's claimed territory, but no one in Cañas pretends to have authority over Enuau Kemjallb. The relationship is one of mutual non-interference.

**Giant Herders**: The nomadic giants who pass through Giants' Corridor give the sun elf city wide berth. Whether this is respect, fear, or simply disinterest is unclear.

**Aciabro Goblins**: The blood-mechanists of the Sunwing Peaks have no contact with the Kryaaji. Both peoples prefer it that way.

### Falsehaven Bay

Tags: bay, geography

A broad, sheltered bay on Central Aboyinzu's western coast, where Satyr Wood meets the sea. The name dates back centuries, to a time when ships still occasionally sailed these waters and learned—too late—that the bay's shelter came with costs.

#### Geography

Falsehaven Bay cuts roughly fifteen miles inland, protected from open ocean swells by a curving headland to the north. The water is deep enough for large vessels, the anchorage good, the beaches suitable for landing. By every practical measure, it's an excellent natural harbor.

The problem is what surrounds it.

The bay's shores are mostly wetland—coastal marsh fed by the Bluecras River and smaller streams draining from Satyr Wood. The ground is soft, the vegetation dense, and the transition from water to solid land unclear. Beyond the marshes, the forest begins immediately, pressing down to the waterline in places where the ground firms up enough to support trees.

Noso Lake sits just inland from the bay's eastern shore, connected to the sea by a tidal channel that floods twice daily. The lake's western edge effectively merges with the coastal wetlands, creating a maze of waterways, mudflats, and reed beds that only locals can navigate reliably.

#### The Name

Ships used to shelter here. The bay offered protection from storms, fresh water from the river, and what appeared to be safe anchorage far from any obvious threats.

Then the pipes would start.

The satyrs learned early that their music carried across water. A Pipe-Lord on the shore could reach sailors anchored in the bay, drawing them toward land with songs that promised safety, pleasure, rest. Some crews resisted. Most didn't. Those who came ashore rarely returned to their ships.

The bay earned its name from survivors—the few who escaped, the occasional vessel that fled before the music took hold. They carried warnings south and north: the haven is false, the shelter is a trap, the bay belongs to something that hunts with sound.

#### Current State

Traffic along this coast has dwindled to almost nothing. The shipping lanes run further west, avoiding the entire shoreline. Fishing vessels from distant ports occasionally appear, but they know better than to anchor overnight. The bay sits empty most of the year, its natural harbor wasted on creatures who have no use for ships.

The satyrs still watch the water. The war-bands that control the Noso Lake territory maintain lookouts on the headlands, more from habit than necessity. When a vessel does appear—once every few years, usually storm-driven or lost—the old techniques still work. The pipes still carry. The songs still compel.

But mostly the bay is quiet. The marshes breed insects and waterfowl. The tides come and go. The forest watches the sea, and the sea has learned to watch back.

#### The Coastal Satyrs

The war-bands near Falsehaven Bay occupy an unusual position in satyr society. Their territory includes the only significant contact point between Satyr Wood and the outside world, which gives them access to goods and knowledge that inland bands lack—but also marks them as tainted by that contact.

They're the satyrs most likely to speak common tongue, most likely to have human-made goods, most likely to understand how the outside world works. Other war-bands view them with suspicion, as if proximity to the coast has somehow diluted their satyr nature. The coastal bands view the inland bands as provincial and ignorant, fighting the same territorial squabbles for generations while the world beyond the forest changes without them.

This tension rarely escalates to open conflict—the coastal bands are too useful as a source of outside goods, and too far from the political center at Pirison Lake to threaten anyone's position. But it adds another layer to the already complicated caste dynamics of satyr society.

### Forest of Avarice

Tags: forest, geography, dangerous, fae

A dense, ancient woodland marking the eastern boundary of Echem Yiakraxes, the Forest of Avarice earned its name from the prospectors and treasure-hunters who enter seeking fortune and emerge—if they emerge—empty-handed and changed. The Terrogones who dominate the plains refuse to hunt beneath its canopy. Local Aboyinzan peoples consider this the most damning warning possible: if apex predators won't go there, neither should you.

#### The Boundary

The transition from savanna to forest happens unnaturally fast. One moment, sparse grass and open sky. The next, towering hardwoods with canopies so thick that noon looks like dusk. The tree line runs roughly north-south, separating the Terrogone killing grounds from the Deadloop's eastern shores. It's not a natural forest edge—more like a wall, as if something drew a line and said *this far, no further*.

This is the only direction the Terrogones don't expand. Family groups that control territory near the forest's edge are notably less aggressive than their inland cousins, as if they've learned that some boundaries shouldn't be tested. Prey animals that flee into the trees rarely come back out, but neither do the Terrogones pursue them. An unspoken truce, enforced by something inside.

#### What Lives Within

The forest hosts a predator ecosystem entirely separate from the plains—and possibly more dangerous. Confirmed inhabitants include:

- **Greenwing stalkers**: Six-legged ambush predators that mimic fallen logs until prey steps close enough to grab. Their camouflage is near-perfect.
- **Whisper moths**: Insects the size of dinner plates whose wing-beats produce subsonic frequencies that cause disorientation and mild hallucinations. Swarms can drive travelers in circles for days.
- **Something that speaks**: Multiple survivors report hearing voices calling their names from deeper in the forest. No one who followed the voices has returned to describe the source.

The deeper one goes, the stranger the wildlife becomes. Trees grow in spirals. Clearings appear and vanish between visits. Time behaves inconsistently—travelers have emerged after what felt like hours to find days have passed, or vice versa. Fae influence is suspected but unconfirmed.

#### The Name

"Avarice" didn't come from nothing. Early explorers reported finding things in the forest—coins, jewelry, weapons of exceptional make—lying in plain sight on the forest floor. Those who picked them up found more treasures deeper in. Those who kept following the trail didn't come back.

Current theory holds that something in the forest *baits* intruders. Whether this is a predator's hunting strategy, fae mischief, or something more purposeful is unknown. What's clear is that the forest rewards greed with disappearance.

The few who've resisted temptation and turned back describe an almost physical sensation of *wanting*—a pull toward the forest's heart that had nothing to do with the treasures visible and everything to do with treasures imagined. Some survivors develop lasting compulsions, dreaming of the forest for years afterward, convinced that what they truly desire waits inside.

#### Relationship with the Plains

The Forest of Avarice and Echem Yiakraxes exist in strange equilibrium. The Terrogones control the open ground; whatever inhabits the forest controls the canopy. Neither encroaches on the other.

Some scholars speculate that this arrangement predates the Terrogones—that they were drawn to Echem Yiakraxes specifically *because* the forest created a defensible border. Others believe the forest's presence is what prevents the Terrogones from expanding east toward more populated regions, making it an accidental bulwark protecting the Deadloop settlements.

A minority theory suggests coordination: that whatever guards Nyavminthk Castle and whatever lurks in the Forest of Avarice serve the same master, or at least the same purpose.

#### For Adventurers

The Forest of Avarice offers:

- **A back door** into Terrogone territory, for those willing to trade one danger for another
- **Treasures that may or may not be bait**—risk assessment is the adventure
- **Fae or fae-adjacent mysteries** for parties interested in the strange over the violent
- **The voice** calling from deeper in, which someone eventually has to investigate
- **The question** of what could make Terrogones, creatures that fear nothing in the natural world, refuse to enter

### Fury Hills

Tags: hills, geography

The Fury Hills are a range of rugged highlands in southeastern Kadroka, forming part of the border zone between Kadrokan territory and Tythikerys. They are named for the sudden, violent weather that sweeps through them—and for the battles that have been fought among their ridges.

#### Geography

The hills rise from the savanna in the north and extend southward toward the Deadjack Forest and the approaches to the Agony Stones. The terrain is rocky and broken, with deep ravines, isolated mesas, and sparse vegetation that offers little cover or sustenance.

The highest points reach perhaps 2,000 feet above the surrounding plain—not mountains, but high enough to channel weather and create defensible positions.

#### The Weather

The Fury Hills are notorious for sudden storms. Winds funnel through the ravines with devastating force. Rain arrives without warning and turns dry streambeds into flash floods within minutes. Lightning strikes the exposed ridgelines with unusual frequency.

Local wisdom holds that the hills are touched by air leylines, though no formal survey has confirmed this. Whether magical or mundane, the weather makes the hills dangerous to traverse and nearly impossible to hold for extended periods.

#### Strategic Significance

The Fury Hills are contested territory—too rough for Kadrokan settlement, too exposed for Tytheri camps, but important to both sides.

**For Kadroka:** The hills provide early warning of orc movements from the south. Patrol routes cross the northern ridges, and watchtowers on the highest points can see deep into Tythikerys.

**For Tythikerys:** The hills offer covered approach routes for raiders seeking to bypass Kadrokan defenses. War parties that know the ravines can move undetected until they emerge onto the savanna.

Skirmishes in the Fury Hills are common. Neither side commits major forces—the terrain is too unpredictable—but small-unit actions occur throughout the year.

#### The Deadjack Approach

The southern Fury Hills transition into the Deadjack Forest, which in turn borders the approaches to the Agony Stones. This makes the hills one of the few overland routes for anyone attempting to reach the Stones from Kadrokan territory—a dangerous path through contested ground, storm-wracked heights, and haunted forest.

Few attempt it. Fewer succeed.

#### Wildlife

The hills support hardy fauna adapted to the harsh conditions: mountain goats, predatory cats, and various reptiles. The sudden storms have selected for creatures that can find shelter quickly or withstand exposure.

More unusual sightings are occasionally reported from the deeper ravines—things that might be magical beasts, things that might be something else entirely. The hills are not well-explored, and their secrets remain largely unknown.

### Fyrsan Al Troikas

Tags: mountains, geography

A jagged mountain range forming the eastern boundary of Satyr Wood, running roughly north-south for over a hundred miles. The name is old—possibly Spine Goblin in origin, possibly older—and translates approximately to "the teeth that bite back." The mountains have earned the name. They're treacherous for everyone, including the goblins who call them home.

#### Geography

The Fyrsan Al Troikas rise sharply from the forest floor, their western faces a wall of broken cliffs and unstable scree slopes. The peaks are not particularly high by mountain standards, but they're brutally steep, with knife-edge ridges connecting summits that seem designed to funnel travelers into dead ends and killing grounds.

The rock itself is unreliable. Shale and limestone dominate, prone to crumbling underfoot and sheering away without warning. Paths that existed last season may have collapsed. Handholds that look solid give way. The mountains punish anyone who doesn't know them intimately, and even those who do sometimes miscalculate.

Weather adds another layer of danger. Storms blow in from the east without warning, turning slopes slick and filling ravines with flash floods. Fog settles in the valleys and doesn't lift for days. Snow lingers in the high passes well into summer, hiding crevasses and weak points in the ice.

#### The Spine Goblins

The Spine Goblins have lived in these mountains long enough that no one—including the goblins themselves—remembers when they arrived. They're adapted to the terrain in ways that seem almost deliberate: smaller and lighter than lowland goblins, with longer fingers for gripping rock and an uncanny sense of balance. They move through the mountains like the terrain was built for them, which it effectively was—they've spent generations learning every stable path, every reliable handhold, every route that won't collapse.

They live in the peaks themselves. Not caves at the base of the mountains, but warrens carved into the ridges and summits, accessible only by climbs that would kill most other creatures. From these positions they watch everything below—the forest, the approaches, the satyr war-bands that occasionally attempt to push into the mountains.

Spine Goblin society is organized around raiding. They have little capacity for agriculture and less interest in it. What they need, they take: food from the forest edge, metal from occasional traders foolish enough to enter their territory, captives for labor and darker purposes. Their raids into Satyr Wood are quick, brutal, and carefully calculated—they know exactly how far they can push before the satyrs respond in force, and they rarely miscalculate.

The satyrs hate them with a passion that borders on religious. Generations of border warfare have created blood feuds that neither side can abandon. Greater Satyr war-bands mount expeditions into the mountains regularly, seeking to clear goblin warrens and claim revenge for past raids. These expeditions usually fail. The goblins know the terrain too well, retreat too easily, and return too quickly once the satyrs withdraw.

#### The Border War

The conflict between Satyr Wood and the Fyrsan Al Troikas has no beginning anyone remembers and no end anyone expects. It's simply a fact of life in this region—satyrs raid into the mountains, goblins raid into the forest, both sides take losses, neither side gains ground permanently.

For the satyrs, the war serves a purpose beyond territory. It provides enemies to fight, glory to claim, and a way for ambitious warriors to prove themselves. A satyr who returns from a mountain raid with goblin trophies gains status. A satyr who leads a successful expedition gains more.

For the goblins, the war is survival. They need what the forest provides, and they lack the numbers or strength to take it by force. Raiding is the only option, and defending against satyr reprisals is the cost.

The border itself is poorly defined—a rough line where forest gives way to mountain slope, contested ground that belongs to whoever holds it at any given moment. Watch-posts change hands regularly. Ambush sites are used by both sides depending on who gets there first. The only constant is the fighting.

#### Beyond the Mountains

East of the Fyrsan Al Troikas, the terrain drops into lower hills and eventually the coastal regions beyond. Few from Satyr Wood have seen this—the mountains are an effective barrier in both directions. Trade routes that might otherwise connect the satyr lands to the eastern coast instead swing far north or south, avoiding the goblin-held passes entirely.

The Spine Goblins maintain some contact with the lands to the east, though the nature of this contact is unclear. Traders occasionally appear from that direction, and the goblins have metal goods and worked materials that they certainly didn't make themselves. Whether this represents formal trade relationships or simply the proceeds of raiding is impossible to say from the satyr side of the mountains.

### Giant's Corridor

Tags: mountain range

The Giant's Corridor is a passage between two mountain ranges. It is the passage through which the nomadic, pastoral giant herders bring their flocks.

### Grustos

Tags: state, nation

A mountainous state in Central Aboyinzu defined by the uneasy coexistence of three very different peoples: the isolationist Kryaaji sun elves of Enuau Kemjallb, the blood-mechanist Aciabro goblins in the high peaks, and the nomadic giant herders who pass through seasonally. The human population—concentrated in the central lowlands around Cañas—has learned to navigate between these powers, profiting where possible and staying out of the way when necessary.

The Light leyline cuts east-west through Grustos, passing directly through Enuau Kemjallb before continuing into Qintas. Whether this explains the sun elves' presence or merely validates their choice of location depends on who you ask.

Grustos is not wealthy by Aboyinzu standards. The mountains limit agriculture; the sun elves don't share; the goblins trade only in blood-soaked machinery no sane person wants. What prosperity exists comes from the giant herder migrations—seasonal trade fairs that briefly transform sleepy towns into chaotic markets—and from serving as a buffer between the undead horrors of Chaal Nazzerox to the west and the more civilized states to the east.

---

#### Mountains

##### Sunwing Peaks

The western mountain range, named for the magnificent Wysynnbre—golden, luminant eagles that soar among the peaks. These are not ordinary birds. They glow with inner light, live for centuries, and bond with the Kryaaji sun elves through rituals of magical symbiosis.

The Kryaaji maintain eyries throughout the Sunwing Peaks, tending generations of eagle lineages. Non-elves who venture too deep into eagle territory are not attacked but are watched—and reported. The sun elves know everything that happens in their mountains.

The Aciabro goblins also inhabit the Sunwing Peaks, in workshops carved into the rock far from the eagle eyries. The two peoples ignore each other with practiced determination.

##### Giants' Corridor

A broad passage between the Sunwing Peaks and the Torulius Mountains, carved by glaciers in some forgotten age. The corridor is the traditional route for nomadic giant herders bringing their flocks between summer and winter pastures.

The giants are pastoral, not aggressive—enormous figures tending herds of equally enormous beasts, moving through human lands like ships passing fishing boats. They trade at designated stops, exchanging wool, leather, and exotic meats for manufactured goods they can't produce while nomadic. Then they move on, and the corridor falls quiet until the next migration.

The corridor towns have adapted. Buildings are reinforced against accidental giant footsteps. Markets include giant-scale stalls. Children learn early to watch the ground for shadows.

##### Torulius Mountains

The northern range, less dramatic than the Sunwing Peaks but more accessible. Mining operations extract iron and copper from the Torulius slopes, feeding Grustos's modest metalworking industry.

The mountains are not uninhabited—small communities of herders and miners dot the lower slopes—but they lack the dramatic populations of the Sunwing Peaks. No sun elves, no blood-goblins, no giants. Just rock, ore, and people trying to make a living.

---

#### Forests

##### Sobrevire

A substantial forest along the eastern border with Qintas, claimed by both states and controlled by neither. The Sobrevire serves as a buffer zone—Grustani woodcutters work the western edges while Qintan vintners harvest from the east, and both sides pretend the middle doesn't exist.

The forest is old, dense, and poorly mapped. Travelers who stray from the main roads report disorientation, lost time, and the sense of being observed. Whether this reflects actual danger or merely the forest's reputation is unclear. Most people stick to the roads.

##### Bolsaña P'Suelos

A southern forest whose name translates roughly as "bag of soils"—a reference to the unusual variety of ground conditions within its boundaries. Sandy patches border clay deposits border rocky outcrops, sometimes within the same clearing. Botanists find the forest fascinating; everyone else finds it annoying.

The varied soil produces varied flora, including several medicinal plants found nowhere else in the region. Herbalists from across Central Aboyinzu make pilgrimages to Bolsaña P'Suelos, though they often hire local guides—the forest's patchwork terrain makes navigation difficult.

---

#### Lakes and Rivers

##### Sopona Fia

A large lake in the western region, its shores dominated by the gleaming towers of Enuau Kemjallb. The Kryaaji consider the lake sacred—its waters reflect sunlight in patterns they read for omens, and bathing in its depths is part of their religious practice.

Outsiders are not permitted on the lake. Those who try find their boats mysteriously becalmed, their oars heavy, their progress impossible. The sun elves don't need guards when the lake itself enforces their boundaries.

##### Sopona Strempele

A smaller lake in the central region, near the town of Opela Sopona. Unlike its larger cousin, Sopona Strempele welcomes visitors—fishing boats work its waters, and swimming is a popular summer activity.

Local legend claims the two Sopona lakes were once connected, separated when a sun elf priest raised the land between them to create privacy for Enuau Kemjallb. The geological evidence is ambiguous.

##### Flejdeaako Yni River

The primary river feeding Sopona Fia, flowing from the Torulius Mountains through the northern lowlands. The Kryaaji boundary markets operate along this river—the closest most traders ever get to the sun elf city.

The river's name is Kryaaji, roughly translating to "golden approach." In certain light, the water does seem to carry a golden tint, though whether this is mineral content, leyline influence, or elven magic is debated.

##### Sopo Calisando River

A southern river draining the Bolsaña P'Suelos forest toward the coast. The Calisando is shallow, slow, and warm—poor for transport but excellent for irrigation. The farms along its banks produce most of Grustos's grain.

##### Tasah Evikktus River

A southwestern river notable primarily for what it passes: the ruins of Skyloft Castle. The river's name predates the castle's fall, suggesting it was significant before the fortress was built—or that the fortress was built because of the river's significance.

---

#### Settlements

##### Cañas

The capital of Grustos, positioned centrally where the Giants' Corridor meets the lowland roads. Cañas exists because someone has to coordinate between the state's disparate populations, and the humans decided it might as well be them.

The city is practical rather than beautiful—sturdy buildings, wide streets (for giant traffic during migration seasons), and a government focused on keeping everyone calm. The ruling council includes representatives from all major populations: human merchants, giant clan-speakers (when available), and a perpetually empty chair reserved for the Kryaaji, who have never sent a delegate.

The Aciabro goblins are not represented. They've never asked to be.

##### Amaro

A northern city near the Torulius Mountains, serving as the primary market for giant herder goods during migration seasons. For three months of the year, Amaro transforms into one of the largest trade fairs in Central Aboyinzu. The rest of the year, it's a quiet mining town wondering where everyone went.

##### San Isidrio

A central city along the main road between Cañas and Qintas. San Isidrio has positioned itself as a waystation for travelers and merchants, offering comfortable inns, reliable supplies, and absolutely nothing memorable. This is intentional—the city profits from traffic passing through, not from giving anyone reason to linger.

##### Tacuarembo

A city in the agricultural heartland, surrounded by the farms that feed Grustos. Tacuarembo is quietly proud of being boring—no sun elves, no goblins, no giants, just humans growing food and minding their business. Visitors from the more dramatic parts of the state often find it restful.

##### Belén

A southern city near the Skyloft Castle ruins, drawing scholars and treasure-hunters interested in whatever caused the fortress to fall. Belén's economy has become dependent on these visitors—guides, supplies, lodging, and discreet medical care for those who return injured.

The city council officially discourages exploration of the ruins. The city economy would collapse without it.

##### Tropizo

A town in the corridor route, existing primarily to service giant herder caravans. The buildings are reinforced; the streets are wide; the locals have perfected the art of getting out of the way quickly.

##### Alejendrina

A town in the central region, known for its pottery. The varied clays of the Bolsaña P'Suelos forest provide raw materials; local artisans have developed distinctive glazing techniques. Alejendrina ceramics are minor exports, nothing compared to Sondoros wine, but they have their admirers.

##### Opela Sopona

A lakeside town on Sopona Strempele, the accessible lake. Fishing, swimming, and a relaxed atmosphere draw visitors from across Grustos—the closest thing the state has to a resort town. The proximity to Enuau Kemjallb adds exotic appeal, even though the sun elf city is neither visible nor accessible from here.

##### Zambullón

A small village in the southern forest fringe, surviving on herbalism and logging. Zambullón guides are considered essential for anyone entering the Bolsaña P'Suelos—they know which patches of ground will support weight and which will swallow a traveler to the knees.

---

#### Points of Interest

##### Skyloft Castle

A ruined fortress on the Tasah Evikktus river, its towers collapsed and its walls breached. What happened to Skyloft is unclear—the records are incomplete, and the survivors (if any) didn't explain.

The ruins are old, predating the current political arrangement by centuries. Some architecture suggests giant construction; other elements are clearly human-scale. The fortress may have been built cooperatively, in an era when such things were possible.

Whatever destroyed Skyloft left traces. The ruins are not safe. Expeditions report structural instability, residual magical effects, and—occasionally—things moving in the lower levels. Belén's economy depends on these expeditions. Belén's graveyards receive their failures.

---

#### What Makes Grustos Interesting

- **Three peoples, one territory**: Sun elves, blood-goblins, and giant herders share space with humans. The balance is delicate.
- **The Light leyline**: Passes through Enuau Kemjallb and affects... something. The sun elves know more than they share.
- **Giant migration seasons**: Twice yearly, the state transforms. Trade booms, then vanishes.
- **Skyloft's secrets**: Whatever destroyed the castle is still there. Adventurers keep trying to find out what.
- **Buffer state**: Grustos sits between Chaal Nazzerox's horrors and Qintas's civilization. If the undead break out, Grustos falls first.

### Kadroka

Tags: state, nation, region

Kadroka is a savanna region in southwestern Central Aboyinzu, dominated by open grasslands and the drainage basin of the Royko River system. The region takes its name from the state that controls it—a dragon-ruled territory centered on the capital city of Ponoigari.

#### Geography

The landscape is classic African-style savanna: golden grass beneath wide skies, scattered acacia-like trees, and seasonal watering holes that draw both wildlife and settlement. The terrain rises gradually toward the Ramakemizi Mountains in the east and descends toward the coastal lowlands in the west (though Kadrokan territory does not reach the coast).

**Key Features:**
- **Ramakemizi Mountains**: Eastern boundary, separating Kadroka from the Dalizi Confederation
- **Penor Syalki / Sokorgül**: Dense forests forming the northern and northwestern boundaries
- **Bloodswamp**: Wetland in the southwest where multiple rivers converge
- **Tythikerys**: Arid scrubland to the south, controlled by blood orcs

#### River System

The rivers of Kadroka drain generally southwest toward Bluesong Bay, though they pass through Tytheri territory before reaching the coast:

- **Noara River**: Major northern river, flowing south through the settled heartland
- **Molotai River**: Feeds into the Royko from the Lonesome Lake region
- **Hurikono**: Stream system in the north, joining the Molotai
- **Sikuri River**: Southern tributary joining the Royko at the Bloodswamp
- **Royko River**: The main drainage, collecting all tributaries and flowing southwest through Tythikerys to the sea
- **Lagasuki River**: Eastern river draining the Ramakemizi foothills

#### Settlements

Kadroka is relatively densely settled for Central Aboyinzu, with a road network connecting major population centers:

**Cities:**
- Ponoigari (capital) — Built around the paralyzed dragon Melekas
- Sukinada — Eastern gateway to mountain passes
- Ibasaka — Northern river city
- Dranabaru — Southern city near the Bloodswamp
- Arigaska — Frontier city facing Tytheri raids

**Towns:** Seyezka, Gaku, Eshesei, Skara, Toan

**Villages:** Gomato, Noka, Tomgichi, Kandaki, Apuku, Ika, Jehikita, Bwaruta, Sira, and others

Settlement density decreases sharply toward the south and southwest, where Tytheri raids make permanent habitation dangerous.

#### Climate

Wet and dry seasons dominate the annual cycle. The wet season brings flooding to low-lying areas (particularly near the Bloodswamp), while the dry season turns the grasslands golden and concentrates wildlife around permanent water sources.

Temperatures are warm year-round, though the eastern highlands near the Ramakemizi Mountains are noticeably cooler.

#### Wildlife

The savanna supports large herbivore populations—analogous to African plains fauna—along with the predators that hunt them. The rivers teem with fish and the crocodilian creatures that eat them.

More dangerous fauna include various magical beasts drawn to the leyline-adjacent areas near the mountains, and the occasional creature wandering north from the cursed Agony Stones region.

#### Political Control

For detailed political information, see the state entry for Kadroka in Nations & Powers. The region is ruled by the dragon Melekas from Ponoigari, with a mixed human-naga administration handling day-to-day governance.

### Lonesome Lake

Tags: lake, geography

Lonesome Lake is a small, isolated body of water in northern Kadroka, notable for having no visible inlet or outlet. The lake simply exists—a still pool amid the savanna that locals have avoided for as long as anyone can remember.

#### Geography

The lake sits in a shallow depression approximately 2 miles across, surrounded by typical Kadrokan grassland. No rivers feed it. No streams drain it. The water level remains remarkably constant regardless of season.

#### The Mystery

Hydrologically, Lonesome Lake should not exist. Lakes without inlets evaporate. Lakes without outlets stagnate, grow brackish, or overflow. Lonesome Lake does none of these things.

The water is fresh, clear, and cold—colder than it should be given the climate. The surface is unnaturally still; even on windy days, the lake barely ripples. Fish swim in its depths, though no one knows how they got there or what they eat.

Several theories attempt to explain the lake:
- **Underground springs**: The most mundane explanation, though no one has located the water source
- **Magical sustenance**: Some form of permanent enchantment maintaining the water
- **Planar connection**: The lake connects to somewhere else, and water flows through in ways invisible to surface observers
- **The lake is alive**: The water itself is a single organism, maintaining its own equilibrium

None have been proven. The lake keeps its secrets.

#### The Name

"Lonesome" refers both to the lake's isolation and to the feeling people report when near it.

Visitors describe an inexplicable sense of melancholy—not fear, not danger, just profound sadness. Animals avoid the shore. Travelers who camp nearby report dreams of vast, empty spaces. The sensation fades within a few miles, but few choose to return.

Whether this is a property of the lake itself or a psychological response to its uncanny stillness is unclear.

#### Local Customs

Kadrokans treat Lonesome Lake with cautious respect. They don't drink from it (though the water is apparently safe). They don't fish it (though fish are clearly present). They don't build near it (though the land would support settlement).

Some traditions hold that the lake grants visions to those who gaze into it at midnight. Others say it swallows anyone who enters the water. Still others claim it's simply cursed and best left alone.

The truth may be simpler: the lake is strange, and strange things are best avoided.

#### Location

Lonesome Lake lies roughly 40 miles north of Ponoigari, accessible via the road toward Phaerhom and the northern forests. The Hurikono stream system passes nearby but does not connect to the lake.

### Luendrokrül

Tags: forest, geography

A four-hundred-mile expanse of dense forest stretching across Central Aboyinzu, bounded by the Cowardly Mountains to the northwest and thinning into savanna grasslands to the south and east. Unlike its northern neighbor M'Svyla—cultivated, inhabited, deliberately shaped by the Ix'Lorett—Luendrokrül is abandoned. Something lived here once. The forest swallowed it.

#### Character

Luendrokrül is old in the way that makes travelers uneasy. The canopy closes overhead like a held breath. Sound travels wrong—voices don't carry, footsteps echo where they shouldn't, and the usual forest noise (birdsong, insect hum, wind through leaves) goes quiet without warning. Locals from the surrounding grasslands don't enter the forest. They don't forbid it exactly, but they don't do it, and they don't explain why.

The trees here grow differently than in M'Svyla. Trunks twist, branches reach at odd angles, root systems surface and dive in patterns that suggest the trees are moving—not quickly, not visibly, but over years. Clearings that existed last season aren't there anymore. Paths close behind travelers. The forest rearranges itself, and no one knows if it's deliberate or just how forests are when left alone long enough.

People who spend too long in Luendrokrül come out changed. Not cursed, not possessed—just different. Quieter. They struggle to explain what they saw or didn't see, what they felt. Most don't go back. The few who do tend to go deeper each time, staying longer, until eventually they don't come out at all.

#### The Ruins

Scattered throughout Luendrokrül are the remnants of whoever lived here before. Stone foundations covered in moss. Walls that might have been temples or granaries or something else entirely, too overgrown to tell. Carved markers with script no living scholar can read. The ruins aren't clustered—they're everywhere, suggesting not a single city but a civilization that spread across the entire forest.

Whatever happened to them left no bodies, no signs of violence, no indication of plague or war. They simply stopped being here, and the forest moved in. Some ruins show signs of deliberate abandonment: doors left open, belongings packed and removed. Others look like the inhabitants vanished mid-task, tools left where they fell, meals half-prepared.

The deepest ruins, near Byvarnül Lake, are the oldest and strangest. The architecture there doesn't match the rest—larger, built for beings taller than humans, using construction techniques that shouldn't have been possible with the tools available. These ruins are partially submerged now, the lake having risen over centuries to claim them.

#### The Rivers

Three rivers define Luendrokrül's hydrology:

**Minas River** flows along the western edge, marking an approximate boundary between the forest and the foothills of the Cowardly Mountains. Its water runs unusually clear—locals say nothing lives in it, though no one can explain why.

**Moshavril River** cuts through the forest's northern reaches before joining tributaries that eventually feed into M'Svyla's watershed. The healthiest section of forest, if Luendrokrül can be called healthy anywhere.

**Egetli River** drains the eastern forest, flowing south toward the grasslands. Settlements along the Egetli's southern reaches are the closest thing to civilization that borders Luendrokrül directly, and even they keep their distance from the treeline.

#### Why the Passage Exists

The Safeway Passage through the Cowardly Mountains exists because going *through* Luendrokrül is worse than going around. Caravans that need to move between the western territories and the eastern grasslands take the mountain route despite its difficulty, despite the tariffs at Horan's Hut, despite everything. The forest route is shorter. No one takes it.

Expeditions have tried. Military surveyors, merchant scouts, scholars convinced the dangers are exaggerated. Most turn back within a few days, spooked by things they can't articulate. The ones who push through either emerge on the other side weeks later than the journey should have taken, or they don't emerge at all.

The Ix'Lorett of M'Svyla, when asked about their southern neighbor, simply say they don't go there. When pressed for reasons, they give the same answer they give for everything difficult: *some questions answer themselves if you wait long enough*.

#### Byvarnül Lake

The forest's heart, if it has one. A broad, still lake in the southeastern reaches, surrounded by the oldest and strangest ruins. See the dedicated entry for details.

### M'Svyla

Tags: state, nation, forest

A two-hundred-mile stretch of temperate forest running east from the Crystal Mountains into the Central Aboyinzu grasslands. Home to the Ix'Lorett—a lizardfolk people who have turned their homeland into something between a nation and a living gallery.

#### The Forest

M'Svyla is old growth, the kind of forest that remembers when different creatures walked beneath its canopy. Broadleaf trees dominate—oak, ash, and species with no common tongue names—their crowns forming a broken ceiling that filters light into green-gold shafts. The understory is dense but navigable, threaded with game trails that the Ix'Lorett have walked for generations.

The forest thins as it stretches east, transitioning gradually from dense woodland to scattered copses to the open savanna of interior Aboyinzu. The western edge presses against the Crystal Mountain foothills, where mountain streams feed into the forest's river network. Xia Lake sits in the south-central forest, a broad shallow body of water ringed by some of the oldest Ix'Lorett settlements.

The Esosa River flows down from the north, cutting through the forest's eastern reaches before continuing south into the grasslands. Smaller tributaries web through the woodland, and the Ix'Lorett have built their villages along these waterways for as long as anyone can remember.

#### The Ix'Lorett

The Ix'Lorett are iguana-like lizardfolk—slow-moving, ancient in appearance, patient beyond human comprehension. They live long lives and spend them deliberately. An Ix'Lorett might dedicate thirty years to a single sculpture, or fifty to mastering a particular technique of gem-setting. They do not rush. They do not need to.

Their villages are art installations as much as settlements. Mosaic pathways wind between dwellings, each stone placed with intention. Trees bear carved panels depicting local history or abstract meditations on light and shadow. Gemstones from the Crystal Mountains are set into everything—doorframes, communal halls, the handles of everyday tools—not for wealth, but for the way they catch the light.

The Ix'Lorett philosophy centers on inner cultivation. They believe that patience and presence are the highest virtues, that a life lived deliberately is worth more than a life lived long. Their legendary regenerative abilities—they can regrow lost limbs over months of focused healing—are seen not as biological accident but as physical proof that the body follows the mind's intention.

They are not pacifists. An Ix'Lorett will fight to defend their home, their art, their people. But violence is a failure state, a sign that patience and wisdom were insufficient. They would rather outlast a threat than destroy it.

#### Governance

The Ix'Lorett govern by consensus, and consensus takes time.

The Slow Council meets in a great hall near Xia Lake, its walls covered in centuries of accumulated mosaic work. Representatives from every village attend, though "attend" may mean sitting in contemplative silence for days before speaking. Decisions emerge gradually, shaped by discussion and meditation, tested against the community's collective sense of rightness. A proposal might take months to resolve. Major questions—war, alliance, fundamental changes to Ix'Lorett society—can take years.

This makes the Ix'Lorett maddening partners in diplomacy. Ambassadors from faster-paced nations have grown old waiting for answers. But decisions made by the Slow Council stick. They've been considered from every angle, accepted by every faction. There are no hasty mistakes to walk back, no factions nursing grievances over railroaded votes.

#### The Unfinished Work

Deep in the western forest, where the oldest trees grow, the Ix'Lorett have been building something for six hundred years.

They call it the Unfinished Work—a complex of structures, sculptures, gardens, and mosaic installations that sprawls across a square mile of forest floor. Each generation adds to it. Each addition must harmonize with what came before while leaving space for what comes after. The project has no planned endpoint. It will be finished when it is finished, or it will never be finished at all.

Outsiders who've seen the Unfinished Work describe it as overwhelming. The accumulated weight of centuries of patient craft, each piece perfect in itself and part of a larger whole too vast to comprehend. Some find it beautiful. Some find it terrifying—a reminder of how small a single lifetime is against the scale of Ix'Lorett intention.

#### Refugees and Healing

M'Svyla has become, almost by accident, a place where broken people come to mend.

It started with the Crystal Mountain defenders. Wounded soldiers stumbled down from the passes and found Ix'Lorett healing stations in the foothills. Some recovered and returned to the fighting. Others didn't—couldn't—and drifted deeper into the forest instead. The Ix'Lorett didn't turn them away. They simply made room.

Now M'Svyla hosts a scattered population of refugees, veterans, scholars fleeing war-torn libraries, anyone who needs time and quiet to rebuild themselves. The Ix'Lorett ask nothing of them except respect for the forest and its ways. Some stay for months, then leave. Some stay for years. Some, eventually, begin learning the Ix'Lorett crafts—not because they're required to, but because the slow, deliberate work gives them something they'd lost.

The Ix'Lorett view this as natural. Healing is what they do. The forest has room.

#### The Shadow in the North

The Ix'Lorett know what waits beyond the Crystal Mountains. They've seen what comes down from the passes—the wounded, the traumatized, the ones who've looked into the eyes of Xynoth's legions and somehow survived. They know the defenders are losing.

They do not discuss it often. There is no panic, no urgency that would satisfy a human observer. But the Slow Council has been deliberating on the question for three years now: what will M'Svyla do when the mountains fall?

Some argue for preparation—fortification, alliance with southern powers, stockpiling weapons. Others argue that such preparations would transform M'Svyla into something it isn't, destroy the very thing they'd be trying to save. Still others suggest evacuation, abandoning the forest before the dead arrive.

No consensus has emerged. The Ix'Lorett continue their crafts, tend their wounded, add to the Unfinished Work. Perhaps they are paralyzed by indecision. Perhaps they trust that the right answer will become clear in time. Perhaps they've simply accepted that some problems have no solutions, only responses.

The mountains still hold. For now, that's enough.

### Melekas the Stillbound

Tags: dragon, creature, ruler

Melekas is an ancient dragon who rules the state of Kadroka from the capital city of Ponoigari—though "rules" understates the complexity of the situation. For nearly eight hundred years, Melekas has been paralyzed from the neck down, fused with the bedrock beneath the city, unable to fly, walk, or leave the spot where the dragon landed after a catastrophic encounter with the Agony Stones.

#### The Stillbinding

Around 800 years ago, Melekas flew to investigate the Agony Stones—a vast region of strange, contorted rock formations in the southern reaches of what is now Tythikerys. The dragon landed on the largest formation to examine it more closely. That was a mistake.

The stone *reached back*.

Petrification raced up the dragon's legs before Melekas could tear free. The dragon barely managed to take flight, but the curse—or infection, or sympathy-bond, scholars still argue—had already spread through most of the body. Melekas made it back to the settlement that would become Ponoigari and has been rooted there ever since.

#### Present State

Melekas's body is fused with the bedrock beneath the capital. The dragon's immense form—several hundred feet from tail to snout—now serves as the foundation for the palace complex and surrounding government district. Only the head, neck, and one foreleg retain mobility. The scales have taken on a grey-stone cast that wasn't there before, and the line where living tissue meets petrified flesh creeps imperceptibly higher each decade.

The dragon can still breathe fire. Still think. Still speak in a voice that rattles windows across the city. But Melekas cannot fly, cannot walk, cannot project physical power beyond the reach of neck and flame.

The petrification continues to spread. Slowly—a few inches per decade—but inexorably. Melekas has perhaps four or five centuries before the head goes still. The dragon knows this. Everyone in Kadroka knows this.

#### The Palace of the Stillbound

The royal palace is built *around* and *upon* the dragon's immobile body. Petitioners approach the living head while standing on the dragon's petrified flank. Audience chambers are carved into the spaces between frozen limbs. The dragon's one mobile foreleg occasionally gestures during conversation, a reminder that this is not a statue but a living ruler trapped in stone.

The architecture has evolved over centuries to accommodate both the dragon's needs and the practical requirements of governance. Heating systems draw from the dragon's body heat. Drainage channels redirect the occasional gout of flame. The throne room is simply the space before Melekas's face, with the dragon's eye—each larger than a wagon wheel—providing illumination and, some say, lie detection.

#### Personality and Rule

Eight centuries of forced immobility have transformed Melekas from a creature of physical dominance into one of pure political cunning. The dragon who once ruled through terror and flight now rules through manipulation, information networks, and the careful cultivation of loyal agents. Melekas has become the ultimate stationary power—all of Kadroka must come to the dragon, never the reverse.

The dragon is patient in ways that shorter-lived beings cannot comprehend. Melekas plans in decades, thinks in centuries, and nurses grudges that span generations. The Tytheri orcs who now raid Kadrokan settlements with impunity? Melekas remembers when their ancestors were scattered tribes easily burned from the sky. The Agony Stones that trapped the dragon? Melekas has spent eight hundred years researching them, interviewing survivors who approached them, and sending agents to study them from safe distances.

The dragon desperately wants two things: a cure for the stillbinding, and revenge on whatever the Agony Stones actually are. These goals may be connected. Melekas suspects that understanding the Dying One—truly understanding it—might provide a way to reverse the petrification. But that would require someone to go *into* the Stones. Deep into them. And everyone who has tried that has either died or joined the Dying One's slow agony.

#### Relationship with Kadroka

The people of Kadroka have a complicated relationship with their immobile ruler. On one hand, Melekas provides genuine protection—the dragon's fire can reach well beyond the city walls, and any army foolish enough to assault Ponoigari directly would face an enemy that cannot be flanked, cannot retreat, and has nothing to lose.

On the other hand, Melekas is still a dragon. Taxation is heavy. Dissent is noted and remembered. The dragon's network of informants—humans, naga, and others who serve the Stillbound—ensures that very little happens in Kadroka without Melekas eventually learning of it.

The naga population, in particular, has thrived under draconic rule. Dragons and naga share ancient connections, and many naga serve in Melekas's inner circle as advisors, spies, and interpreters of the dragon's will. Human Kadrokans sometimes resent this, creating ongoing tension within the realm.

#### The Tytheri Problem

Melekas's paralysis has emboldened the Tytheri blood orcs to the southwest. They know the dragon cannot hunt them. They know Kadroka's military, without aerial support, struggles to project power into the rough terrain of Tythikerys. They raid with increasing boldness, and Melekas can do nothing but watch and scheme.

The dragon's hatred for the Tytheri is matched only by hatred for the Agony Stones that crippled Melekas in the first place—and the orcs' connection to those Stones, their harvesting of the Dying One's ichor, makes them doubly offensive. Melekas would give almost anything for a way to destroy both the orcs and the Stones that sustain them.

Almost anything.

### Melway Pass

Tags: pass, geography, mountain

Melway Pass is a route through the northern Morygun Mountains, connecting the Korgül forest region to the lands beyond. It is one of the few reliable passages through this section of the range—and one of the most dangerous.

#### Geography

The pass winds through the mountains at moderate elevation, following an ancient riverbed that has long since dried. The route is approximately 40 miles from entrance to exit, passable by foot or pack animal but not by wagon.

The terrain is rugged but navigable: rocky slopes, narrow defiles, and exposed ridgelines alternate with sheltered valleys where travelers can rest. Water is available from springs and snowmelt for most of the year.

#### The Dangers

Melway Pass is dangerous not because of its terrain but because of what inhabits it.

**Morygun Mountain Goats**: The fearsome ram-centaur creatures that give the mountains their name are particularly active in this area. These territorial predators attack anyone they perceive as intruders—which is everyone. They use air and earth attunement to cause rockslides and wind blasts, making straightforward combat nearly impossible.

**Weather**: The pass channels wind into savage gusts that can knock travelers off exposed sections. Storms roll in with little warning. Snow is possible even in summer at the higher elevations.

**The Satyrs**: Korgül lies at the western end of the pass, and Greater Satyrs sometimes range into the mountains. Their attitude toward travelers varies from helpful to hostile depending on factors outsiders rarely understand.

#### Usage

Despite the dangers, Melway Pass sees regular use by those who need to cross the Morygun range:

- **Traders** moving goods between Korgül and the eastern territories
- **Scholars** seeking Phaerhom or the Valley of the Witches
- **Refugees** fleeing various troubles in one direction or another
- **Adventurers** with business in the wild mountains

Most travelers hire guides—either satyr, human, or occasionally fae—who know the pass's rhythms: when the mountain goats are most active, which valleys provide safe shelter, where water can be found.

#### The Name

"Melway" is attributed to various sources: a legendary traveler who first mapped the route, a corruption of an older fae term, or a descriptive phrase meaning "middle way" in some tongue. The true origin is lost.

#### Relationship to Kadroka

Melway Pass lies north of Kadrokan territory, in the mountains that form the boundary between Central Aboyinzu and the wilder regions beyond. Kadrokans who wish to reach the northern forests without going through Phaerhom (and dealing with fairies) sometimes use this route.

The dragon Melekas has no particular interest in the pass, which lies far beyond the range where Kadrokan authority meaningfully extends.

### Mikisapi Forest

Tags: forest, geography, island

An ancient forest covering Mikisapi Island, the landmass at the center of Deadloop. Unlike the hostile Dragonsong forests to the east, Mikisapi is inhabited—but on the forest's terms.

#### Geography

Mikisapi Island is roughly thirty miles long and fifteen miles wide, entirely covered by old-growth forest except for the city of Tenches at its heart. The coastline is rocky and difficult to land on; most visitors arrive at one of three maintained harbors that connect to roads leading inland.

The forest floor is surprisingly navigable in most areas—the canopy blocks enough light that undergrowth stays sparse. But the paths shift. Trails that were clear last season may be overgrown this season, while new routes open through previously impassable sections. Locals claim the forest guides travelers toward Tenches if they're peaceful, and away from it if they're not.

#### Character

Mikisapi is old, but not malevolent. The trees grow tall and close together, their canopy forming a continuous roof that turns daylight into perpetual green twilight below. Sound carries strangely—conversations seem muffled while distant birdsong rings clear. The air smells of loam, moss, and something faintly sweet that no one has ever identified.

The forest tolerates habitation. Woodcutters work its edges, hunters range through its depths, and hermits build cabins in isolated clearings. But tolerance isn't welcome. People who take too much find their luck turning—tools break, game vanishes, paths lead in circles. People who give back—planting seedlings, clearing deadfall, leaving offerings at the old stones—find the forest generous in return.

#### The Inhabitants

**Tenches** occupies the forest's heart, built around a clearing the trees have never reclaimed. The city-state has existed for centuries, maintaining a careful balance with the forest around it.

Beyond Tenches, the forest holds:
- **Woodcutters and hunters** who've learned to read the forest's moods
- **Hermits and exiles** seeking solitude or hiding from something
- **Spirits and fae** that never come to the city—older presences that tolerate Tenches but don't acknowledge it
- **Things without names** in the deepest groves, neither hostile nor friendly, simply ancient

#### Resources

Mikisapi timber is prized throughout Aboyinzu. The wood is dense, rot-resistant, and takes enchantment unusually well—shipbuilders, wandmakers, and artificers pay premium prices for quality cuts. Tenches controls all timber exports through the Grove Council, and cutting without permission is punished by exile at best.

The forest also yields medicinal herbs, rare fungi, and occasionally stranger things—artifacts from older times, exposed by shifting roots or revealed in storm-toppled trees.

#### What It Looks Like

Massive trunks rising like columns in a cathedral, their bark rough and dark, hung with pale lichen. The canopy above is so thick that rain arrives as a delayed drizzle, filtered through layers of leaves. The ground is carpeted with fallen needles and decomposing leaves, soft underfoot and nearly silent to walk on.

Shafts of green-gold light break through gaps in the canopy, illuminating clearings where wildflowers grow in brief, brilliant displays. Streams wind between the trees, their water cold and clear. Birdsong is constant but distant, as if the birds are always somewhere else.

At night, the forest is utterly dark. No moonlight penetrates the canopy. Travelers without light don't travel at all—they stop, wait for dawn, and hope nothing finds them.

### Mumbling Forest

Tags: forest, geography, mysterious

The Mumbling Forest dominates the southwestern coast of Tythikerys, a dense woodland that stretches from Bluesong Bay to the southern reaches of the region. It is named for the constant low sound that pervades it—not quite voices, not quite wind, but something in between that never stops.

#### Geography

The forest covers approximately 60 miles of coastline and extends 20-30 miles inland. The trees are ancient, tall, and densely packed, their canopy blocking most sunlight from the forest floor. The terrain is uneven, with ravines, hidden streams, and sudden clearings that appear without pattern.

The coast where the forest meets Bluesong Bay is rocky and difficult to navigate, with few natural landing spots for ships.

#### The Sound

The "mumbling" that gives the forest its name is audible from the forest's edge and grows louder within. It sounds like distant conversation—multiple voices speaking simultaneously in no language anyone has identified. The sound comes from no particular direction; it simply exists throughout the forest, part of the ambient environment.

Some who have spent time in the forest report that the mumbling occasionally seems to form words—phrases in their native tongue, names, warnings. Whether this is a property of the sound or a product of minds trying to find meaning in noise is unknown.

The sound does not cease at night. Some say it grows louder.

#### Inhabitants

Whatever lives in the Mumbling Forest has never been clearly documented.

**What is known:**
- The Tytheri avoid the forest despite its proximity to their territory
- Animals from the surrounding area do not enter
- Travelers who venture in often become lost despite simple routes
- Some travelers who enter do not return; others emerge with no memory of what they saw

**Speculation:**
- A fae presence of some kind, possibly connected to the darker courts
- Spirits or ghosts from some ancient tragedy
- A form of plant life that has achieved collective consciousness
- Something from another plane, bleeding through
- Nothing at all—the forest is simply strange, and strangeness is its own category

#### Relationship with the Tytheri

The Tytheri blood orcs and the Mumbling Forest have an unspoken arrangement: the orcs do not enter, and whatever lives within does not emerge.

This arrangement has held for as long as anyone remembers. Orc camps stay well clear of the forest's edge. Hunting parties that pursue prey into the trees turn back. Even Ichor-maddened raiders, desperate for violence, find reasons to seek it elsewhere.

Some scholars theorize the forest's presence is why the Tytheri never developed maritime ambitions—the coast is blocked by something they instinctively avoid.

#### Approach

Those who wish to enter the Mumbling Forest should understand that:

1. The sound will become omnipresent and impossible to ignore
2. Navigation will become unreliable—compasses work, but sense of direction does not
3. Time may not pass at the expected rate
4. Something is watching
5. The forest may or may not choose to let you leave

The wisest approach is not to enter at all.

### Nyavminthk Castle

Tags: fortress, poi, ruins, dungeon, mystery

A crumbling fortress at the heart of Echem Yiakraxes, Nyavminthk Castle is the reason the Terrogones are here—or at least, the reason they stay. The massive Chulpe predators that dominate the surrounding plains don't occupy the ruin, don't hunt within its walls, and don't let anyone else approach it. Family groups that spend generations warring over territory cooperate seamlessly when it comes to the castle's perimeter. Whatever's inside, they want it to stay there.

#### The Structure

What remains suggests the castle was never large—more a fortified keep than a sprawling complex. The outer wall, where it still stands, encloses perhaps two acres. A central tower rises four stories, its upper levels collapsed into rubble. Secondary structures cluster around the tower's base, their purposes unclear beneath centuries of weathering and deliberate damage.

The architecture is wrong for the region. The stonework shows techniques associated with the high elves of the Second Eon—precision-cut blocks fitted without mortar, corners aligned to astronomical positions, foundations driven deep into bedrock. But high elves never settled this far into Aboyinzu, and the castle's isolation makes no strategic or economic sense by elven standards.

The name "Nyavminthk" appears in no known elven lexicon. Linguists who've studied the word suggest it might be a corruption or a loanword from something older.

#### What the Terrogones Do

The Terrogones maintain a permanent watch on the castle from a distance of roughly half a mile. Scouts from multiple family groups patrol overlapping routes, ensuring no approach goes unobserved. This cooperation is unprecedented—Terrogones are violently territorial with each other everywhere else in Echem Yiakraxes.

They don't enter the castle. They don't approach the walls. When prey animals flee toward the ruin, Terrogones break off pursuit at an invisible boundary line. When intruders attempt to reach the castle, Terrogones intercept them well before they arrive.

This behavior suggests *instruction*—that at some point, something taught the Terrogones to guard this place and stay out of it. Whether this instruction came from within the castle or from an outside party is unknown.

#### What's Inside

No reliable accounts exist. The few expeditions that penetrated Terrogone territory and reached the castle walls found the gates sealed—not locked, but fused, as if the stone had melted and rehardened. Windows on the lower levels are similarly blocked. The upper tower, accessible in theory via climbing, has collapsed inward, filling potential entry points with debris.

**What's suspected:**

- **A prison.** The sealed entrances, the guards who won't enter, the cooperation between territorial predators—all consistent with containment.
- **A leyline wound.** Some catastrophic magical event that scarred reality. The Terrogones might be protecting travelers *from* the castle rather than protecting something inside.
- **A daemon's anchor.** A binding site for one of the major or minor daemons, with the Terrogones serving as unwitting (or willing) wardens.
- **Something from before.** First Eon artifacts. Pre-human construction. Things that shouldn't exist in the current age.

**What's been observed:**

- The castle produces no light, no sound, no smell.
- Birds don't land on it. Insects don't approach.
- The stone is cold to the touch even in the height of summer.
- Magical detection reveals nothing—either the castle is warded against scrying or there's genuinely nothing inside to detect.

#### Getting There

Reaching Nyavminthk Castle requires crossing miles of Terrogone hunting ground, evading or surviving apex predators who specifically watch for anyone heading in this direction, and then finding a way past sealed entrances designed to stay closed.

Known approaches:

- **Overland from the west**: Follow the Tasqh Evikkris river as far south as possible, then cut east across open savanna. Estimated three days of travel through active Terrogone territory.
- **Through the Forest of Avarice**: Enter the forest from the Deadloop coast and navigate west, emerging onto the plains closer to the castle. Trades Terrogone danger for whatever hunts in the forest.
- **Aerial approach**: Theoretically possible for those with flight magic or tamed flying mounts. The Terrogones can't pursue into the sky—but landing near the castle puts you in the middle of their territory with no easy retreat.

No approach is safe. All have been tried. None have resulted in entry to the castle itself.

#### For Adventurers

Nyavminthk Castle offers:

- **The ultimate dungeon delve**—if you can get in, if there's anything inside, if you can get out
- **A mystery** that's survived for centuries: what's worth this much protection?
- **Terrogone politics** as potential leverage—what would a family group accept in exchange for looking the other way?
- **The sealed doors** as a puzzle: what force could unseal them?
- **The possibility** that the Terrogones are right, and some doors should stay closed

### Ponoigari

Tags: city, capital, settlement

Ponoigari is the capital of Kadroka and one of the most unusual cities in Aboyinzu. It is built around, upon, and into the petrified body of the dragon Melekas, who has ruled from this spot for nearly eight hundred years—unable to move, unable to leave, unable to do anything except think, speak, and occasionally breathe fire.

#### Layout

The city radiates outward from the dragon's immobile form in roughly concentric rings:

**The Dragon District**: The innermost area, comprising the dragon's body itself and the palace complex built into it. Government functions, the treasury, and the quarters of the dragon's closest servants occupy this zone. Access is restricted and heavily guarded by the Stillwatch.

**The Inner City**: Wealthy residential areas, major temples, the homes of naga advisors and prominent human families. Streets are well-maintained, patrols are frequent, and the dragon's presence looms—literally—over everything.

**The Middle City**: Markets, craftsmen's quarters, ordinary residences. This is where most of Ponoigari's population lives and works. The atmosphere is busy but watchful; the dragon's informants are everywhere.

**The Outer City**: Poorer districts, warehouses, the camps of seasonal workers and recent arrivals. Less orderly, less safe, but also less scrutinized.

**The Approaches**: Beyond the walls, roads lead to the surrounding savanna. Fortifications protect against Tytheri raids, though no orc band has seriously threatened Ponoigari in generations—the dragon's fire makes direct assault suicidal.

#### The Palace of the Stillbound

The heart of Ponoigari is the dragon's body.

Melekas's petrified form—several hundred feet from snout to tail—serves as the foundation for the palace complex. The dragon's immobile limbs and torso have been incorporated into the architecture over centuries: audience chambers carved between frozen legs, administrative offices built upon the great stone back, gardens planted in the shadow of wings that will never spread again.

The living portions of the dragon—head, neck, and one foreleg—occupy the palace's central courtyard. The throne room is simply the space before Melekas's face. Petitioners approach across stone scales, watched by an eye the size of a wagon wheel, and speak their business while the dragon's breath warms the air.

Heat radiating from the still-living portions of Melekas is channeled through the palace, warming the complex in cooler weather. Drainage systems redirect the occasional gout of flame (Melekas still sneezes, sometimes). The palace has adapted to its unique occupant over eight centuries of continuous renovation.

#### Population

Ponoigari is the largest city in Kadroka, though exact population figures are uncertain. Estimates range from 30,000 to 50,000, swelling during the dry season when herders and traders come to the capital.

**Humans** form the majority. Farmers, merchants, craftspeople, soldiers—the ordinary population of any thriving city.

**Naga** are disproportionately represented in positions of power. Their ancient connection to dragons gives them privileged access to Melekas, and many naga families have served the Stillbound for generations. Human resentment of this arrangement is a constant undercurrent in city politics.

**Others**: Small populations of elves, dwarves, and other peoples pass through or settle temporarily. Kadroka's position on the mountain trade routes brings diverse visitors.

#### Governance

All power flows from Melekas.

The dragon does not involve itself in day-to-day administration—eight centuries have taught patience, and human affairs move too quickly for constant draconic attention. Instead, Melekas sets broad policy, adjudicates major disputes, and maintains an extensive network of informants who report on anything significant.

Practical governance is handled by a council of advisors, heavily weighted toward naga but including prominent humans. The council interprets the dragon's will, manages taxation, oversees the military, and generally keeps the city running. Their authority derives entirely from Melekas; any advisor who loses the dragon's favor is quickly replaced.

#### The Stillwatch

The city's elite guard serves the dragon directly. Stillwatch members are fanatically loyal—selection involves extensive vetting, and betrayal is punished with creative severity. They guard the Dragon District, protect the approaches to the palace, and serve as Melekas's eyes and hands throughout the city.

In combat, the Stillwatch trains to coordinate with the dragon's fire. They know exactly how far Melekas can reach, exactly how to herd enemies into the kill zone, exactly how to shelter while flame washes over their positions. Attacking Ponoigari means facing soldiers who fight alongside a weapon that cannot be flanked and does not miss.

#### Economy

Ponoigari thrives on:

**Trade**: The city sits at the intersection of routes from the Dalizi Confederation (east, over the mountains) and the forest territories (north). Goods flow through regardless of the Tytheri blockade—just not by sea.

**Administration**: Government salaries, military pay, and the dragon's household expenditures inject substantial currency into the local economy.

**Craftsmanship**: Kadrokan leatherwork and metalwork are renowned. The city's artisans supply both local demand and export markets.

**Dragon Tourism**: A minor but notable industry. Some travelers come simply to see the Stillbound—one of the only paralyzed dragons in the known world, accessible to visitors (for a fee) in a way that mobile dragons never are.

#### Daily Life

Living in Ponoigari means living under the dragon's eye.

Most residents have never spoken to Melekas directly and never will. But everyone knows the dragon is there, always watching, always listening through an army of informants. Major dissent is rare; minor grumbling is constant. People adapt to surveillance—they learn what topics are safe, what criticisms will be tolerated, what ambitions will draw unwanted attention.

The trade-off is genuine security. Tytheri raids that devastate frontier settlements never reach Ponoigari. Crime within the walls is swiftly punished. The streets are orderly. Compared to the chaos of many Aboyinzu settlements, the capital offers stability—at the price of freedom.

#### The Dragon's Condition

Everyone in Ponoigari knows the dragon is dying.

The petrification that trapped Melekas eight hundred years ago continues to spread. Slowly—inches per decade—but visibly. The line where living scale meets dead stone creeps higher each generation. The dragon's neck moves a little less freely than it did a century ago. The one mobile foreleg responds a little more slowly.

Scholars estimate Melekas has four or five centuries before the head goes still. The dragon knows this. The dragon's advisors know this. And everyone wonders what happens to Kadroka when the Stillbound finally becomes the Still.

### Qintas

Tags: state, nation

A coastal state in Central Aboyinzu, home to a significant Amverela high elf population and famous across Alaria for Sondoros wine. Where neighboring Grustos is rugged and complicated, Qintas is refined and deliberate—a place where decisions are made slowly, buildings are built to last centuries, and outsiders are welcomed with patience that can feel like condescension.

The Amverela have lived here for millennia, long enough to have weathered multiple civilizational collapses and rebuilt each time. Their cities were old when human kingdoms were young. Their libraries contain records of eras most scholars consider mythological. They are not immortal, but they live long enough that "long-term planning" means something different to them than to other peoples.

The Light leyline passes through Qintas, continuing from Grustos to the east. The high elves acknowledge its presence but do not worship it as the Kryaaji do—to them, it is simply another feature of the landscape, no more sacred than a river or a hill.

---

#### Geography

##### Freshwater Sound

A large bay or sound dominating the northwestern coast, providing Qintas with access to maritime trade. The waters are calm, protected from ocean storms by the peninsula that curves around from Grustos, making Freshwater Sound one of the safest harbors in Central Aboyinzu.

The Amverela were never great sailors—they prefer the patience of land-based pursuits to the unpredictability of the sea—but they've always been willing to let others do the sailing. Freshwater Sound's ports welcome traders from across Alaria, all eager to purchase Sondoros wine and whatever else the high elves deign to sell.

##### Sothills

A range of gentle hills in the northern region, where the land rises from the coastal plain toward the Torulius Mountains of Grustos. The Sothills are pastoral—sheep, goats, and the occasional dairy operation—producing wool and cheese that never quite achieve the fame of Sondoros wine but remain steady exports.

The hills are dotted with small estates, many owned by Amverela families who have tended the same flocks for generations. The pace of life here is even slower than in coastal Qintas, which some visitors find restful and others find maddening.

---

#### Forests

##### Sondoros

The most famous forest in Qintas—possibly in all of Central Aboyinzu—renowned for the strange grape-like fruit that grows on vines climbing its trees. The wine produced from this fruit is legendary, said to be fit for gods, and is sought after by connoisseurs across Alaria.

The Amverela guard the Sondoros jealously. The vines refuse to grow elsewhere—many have tried transplanting them, all have failed—so the wine can only be produced here. This has made Qintas wealthy and has given the high elves leverage in negotiations that their military strength could never provide.

Harvesting is a precise art, governed by moon phases, weather patterns, and traditions that predate written records. The Amverela claim to know exactly when each vine is ready; outsiders suspect they simply enjoy making the process seem mysterious.

##### Ojos Goros

A southern forest whose name translates to "watching eyes"—a reference to the sensation all visitors report of being observed from within the trees. The forest is not hostile, exactly, but it is unsettling. Animals fall silent when travelers approach. Branches seem to track movement. The feeling of scrutiny never quite fades.

The Amverela avoid Ojos Goros when possible and refuse to discuss it when asked. Local legends speak of something that dwells in the forest's heart—not a creature, exactly, but an awareness. What it watches for, no one knows. What it would do if it saw something concerning is a question best left unanswered.

---

#### Settlements

##### Constancias

The capital of Qintas, a city of white stone and silver filigree built on terraces rising from the coastal plain. Constancias is beautiful in the way that only Amverela construction can be—every building positioned to catch light at optimal angles, every street aligned with sight lines to distant landmarks, every public space designed for contemplation.

The city is old. Not ancient in the way of ruins, but old in the way of living things that have simply continued existing. Buildings erected in ages past still house the same families. Gardens planted by elves long dead still bloom according to their original designs. The Amverela do not change Constancias; they maintain it.

Government is conducted through councils that meet rarely and decide slowly. Urgent matters are handled by delegated officials; truly urgent matters—war, plague, catastrophe—are handled by emergency procedures that have been invoked perhaps twice in living memory. The Amverela approach to crisis is to have planned for it centuries ago.

##### Mataojo

A northern port city on Freshwater Sound, serving as Qintas's primary maritime trade hub. Mataojo is livelier than Constancias—more humans, more visitors, more of the chaos that comes with commercial activity.

The Amverela tolerate this because trade is useful and because concentrating foreign activity in Mataojo keeps it away from the rest of the state. The city's architecture is mixed: elven foundations supporting human additions, elegant stonework adjacent to practical wooden warehouses. The combination works better than it should.

##### Lomas Radiales

A town in the Sothills, serving as the center of Qintas's pastoral economy. Wool markets operate here year-round; cheese aging facilities line the main roads; shepherds from across the hills bring their flocks for sale and breeding.

The town's name—"radial hills"—refers to the way roads spread from its center like spokes on a wheel, connecting scattered hill estates to a central point. The Amverela planned it this way millennia ago. It still works.

##### Piedritas

A town near the Sondoros forest, existing primarily to support the wine industry. During harvest season, Piedritas swells with workers; the rest of the year, it maintains equipment, ages wine in vast cellars, and waits.

The town has developed its own culture, distinct from coastal Qintas—rougher, more practical, defined by the annual rhythm of the harvest. Vineyard workers from across the region gather here, sharing techniques and gossip. Some are human; the Amverela prefer to employ outsiders for the physical labor.

##### Puerto Carmele

A coastal town south of Mataojo, smaller and quieter. Puerto Carmele was once a significant port; silting and shifting currents have reduced its harbor to shallow-draft vessels only. The town persists on fishing and nostalgia.

Some Amverela families maintain estates here specifically because it's unfashionable—a retreat from the sophistication of Constancias and the commerce of Mataojo. The pace of life in Puerto Carmele is slow even by high elf standards.

##### Barro Triste

A village in the eastern region whose name—"sad mud"—reflects its primary characteristic. The ground here is perpetually damp, the weather perpetually overcast, and the mood perpetually melancholic. The village exists because someone has to farm the rich bottomland soils, and the crops grown in sad mud are nutritious if joyless.

Barro Triste has produced several notable Amverela poets, all writing extensively about rain, grey skies, and the weight of existence. Literary scholars consider this a coincidence. No one else does.

##### Soya

A small village in the agricultural interior, unremarkable except for its beans. Soya produces a particular variety of legume that grows nowhere else in Qintas, forming the basis of several traditional dishes. The village is proud of its beans. Visitors are expected to admire them.

##### Valentinas

A village on the southern fringe, near the Ojos Goros forest. Valentinas exists in the forest's shadow—not quite within it, but close enough to feel watched. The villagers have adapted, conducting their lives with the awareness that something might be observing. They don't discuss the forest. They don't enter it. They pretend it isn't there.

This works about as well as might be expected.

---

#### What Makes Qintas Interesting

- **Sondoros wine**: Legendary, irreplaceable, and the source of Qintas's wealth and influence. Everyone wants it; only Qintas has it.
- **Amverela society**: Long-lived elves who plan in centuries. Their patience is an advantage and a vulnerability—they sometimes fail to respond to fast-moving threats.
- **Ojos Goros**: The watching forest. What's in there? The elves won't say.
- **Buffer against Chaal Nazzerox**: If the undead break through Grustos, Qintas is next. The Amverela know this. Their preparations are characteristically long-term and characteristically opaque.
- **Cultural collision**: High elf elegance meets human commercial energy in Mataojo. The friction produces interesting results.

### Ramakemizi Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

The Ramakemizi Mountains form the eastern boundary of Kadroka, separating the dragon-ruled savanna state from the Dalizi Confederation and Chechol beyond. They are Kadroka's lifeline—the only reliable route for external trade—and the reason the state has not been completely isolated by the Tytheri blockade.

#### Geography

The range runs roughly north-south for over 200 miles, with peaks reaching 8,000-12,000 feet. The mountains are rugged but not impassable; several valleys and passes allow transit between Kadroka and the eastern territories.

**Western Slopes (Kadroka side):** Gradual descent into savanna, with foothills that support agriculture and the city of Sukinada.

**Eastern Slopes (Dalizi side):** Steeper, descending into the territories of Chechol and the broader Dalizi Confederation.

#### The Passes

Several routes cross the Ramakemizi:

**The Sukinada Pass:** The primary trade route, connecting the Kadrokan city of Sukinada to Chechol. Wide enough for pack trains, maintained by both sides, and patrolled to discourage bandits. Most Kadrokan external trade flows through here.

**The Lagasuki Route:** A secondary passage following the Lagasuki River valley. Less traveled, more difficult, but useful when the main pass is blocked by weather or politics.

**Smaller Trails:** Numerous goat paths and footways cross the mountains, known primarily to locals, smugglers, and those with reason to avoid official routes.

#### Economic Importance

With Bluesong Bay controlled by the Tytheri, the Ramakemizi passes are Kadroka's only connection to broader trade networks. Everything that enters or leaves the state by legitimate means crosses these mountains.

This gives the eastern cities—particularly Sukinada—disproportionate influence. Control of the passes means control of trade, and control of trade means wealth and power. The relationship between Sukinada's merchant families and the dragon in Ponoigari is complex and occasionally tense.

#### The Dalizi Connection

Beyond the mountains lies the Dalizi Confederation, a massive alliance of city-states that provides Kadroka's primary trading partners. Dalizi merchants are common in Sukinada; Kadrokan goods—particularly leather and cattle—are valued in Dalizi markets.

Chechol, the nearest Dalizi territory, serves as an intermediary for much of this trade. The relationship is mutually beneficial: Kadroka gets access to goods they cannot produce; Dalizi gets products from the isolated western regions.

#### Dangers

The mountains are not safe:

**Weather:** Storms can close passes for days. Winter snows make several routes impassable for months. Sudden temperature drops kill unprepared travelers.

**Wildlife:** Mountain predators, territorial creatures, and things that have wandered up from the lowlands all pose threats. The Morygun mountain goats that plague the northern Morygun range are less common here but not absent.

**Bandits:** The passes attract those who would prey on trade caravans. Kadrokan and Dalizi patrols reduce but do not eliminate the threat.

#### Relationship to Melekas

The dragon Melekas understands the mountains' importance and maintains careful relationships with the powers that control the eastern approaches. The dragon cannot personally enforce anything beyond the foothills, but Kadrokan diplomacy ensures the passes remain open.

Some in Sukinada wonder how long this arrangement will last—and what happens to Kadroka's trade when the dragon finally falls silent.

### Redreed Lake

Tags: lake, geography

Redreed Lake is a terminal lake in southern Tythikerys, fed by the Dutunimako River and ringed by distinctive reddish reeds. It serves as one of the few permanent water sources in the southern reaches of orc territory—and it sits uncomfortably close to the Agony Stones.

#### Geography

The lake occupies a shallow basin approximately 5 miles across, fed by the Dutunimako River from the east. With no outlet, the water is mildly brackish—drinkable but not pleasant.

The signature red reeds grow in dense bands around the shore, reaching heights of 8-10 feet. The coloration may come from mineral content in the water, adaptation to the local soil, or—as some suggest—proximity to the Agony Stones affecting the plant life.

#### Proximity to the Stones

Redreed Lake lies roughly 15 miles north of the Agony Stones—close enough that the sympathy effect can sometimes be felt at the lakeside on bad days.

The orcs report that the sensation is worse during certain seasons, possibly connected to whatever passes for the Dying One's biological rhythms. On these days, camping at the lake becomes unpleasant: headaches, joint pain, and disturbed sleep. The orcs simply move their camps further north and wait for the effect to pass.

This proximity may explain why the lake remains a camping ground rather than developing into anything permanent. Even addicted to the Ichor, the Tytheri don't want to live this close to the source.

#### Tytheri Use

During the driest months, orc bands gather at Redreed Lake—one of the only reliable water sources in southern Tythikerys. The gatherings are not formal; different warbands simply end up in the same area when water becomes scarce elsewhere.

These seasonal concentrations are the closest the Tytheri come to anything resembling a society beyond individual warbands. Disputes are settled. Information is exchanged. Thralls are traded. Tythmasters size up their rivals. Then the rains return, water becomes available elsewhere, and the bands scatter back to their territories.

#### The Water

Despite its proximity to the Agony Stones, the lake water shows no obvious supernatural properties. It doesn't cause sympathy pain when drunk. It doesn't spread the petrification curse. Whatever affects people near the Stones doesn't seem to transmit through the water.

This may be because the Dutunimako River originates far from the Stones, carrying clean water into the basin. Or the lake may simply be far enough away that the effect doesn't reach. Or there may be something about water itself that doesn't carry the Dying One's influence.

The orcs don't question it. They just drink.

### Royko River

Tags: river, geography, waterway

The Royko River is the main drainage of the Kadroka-Tythikerys region, collecting waters from multiple tributaries and flowing southwest through orc territory to Bluesong Bay. It is the lifeline of Tytheri existence and a constant reminder to Kadrokans of what they cannot control.

#### Course

The Royko forms in the Bloodswamp where the Sikuri River and other tributaries converge. From there, it flows southwest through the arid scrubland of Tythikerys for approximately 150 miles before emptying into Bluesong Bay through a marshy delta.

#### Tributaries

**From the North (Kadrokan territory):**
- **Noara River**: The major northern tributary, flowing south through the Kadrokan heartland
- **Molotai River**: Drains the Lonesome Lake region, joining the Royko system via the Hurikono
- **Hurikono**: Stream system feeding the Molotai
- **Sikuri River**: Southern tributary joining at the Bloodswamp

**From the South (Tythikerys):**
- **Dutunimako River**: Flows to Redreed Lake rather than the Royko proper, but part of the same watershed

**From the East:**
- **Lagasuki River**: Drains the Ramakemizi foothills, joining the system through Kadrokan territory

#### Significance

The Royko is the only permanent water source through most of Tythikerys. The orcs cannot survive without it. Their camps cluster along its banks; their movements follow its course; their control of the region depends on controlling the river.

For Kadroka, the Royko represents frustration. The river drains their territory, carries their water, and empties into a bay they cannot use. Every drop that flows past the Bloodswamp benefits the orcs who raid Kadrokan settlements.

Proposals to dam or divert the Royko surface periodically in Kadrokan policy discussions. All have been rejected as impractical—the engineering would be massive, the location would be in contested territory, and the orcs would certainly attack any such project.

#### Navigation

The Royko is navigable by small boats through much of Tythikerys, though no one sane attempts it. The orcs don't build boats, but they watch the river, and any vessel would be an obvious target.

In Kadrokan territory, the upper tributaries support limited boat traffic—primarily for fishing and local transport rather than long-distance trade.

### Safeway Passage

Tags: pass, geography

The only reliable route through the Cowardly Mountains, connecting the western territories to the grasslands and forests of Central Aboyinzu. The name is either optimistic or ironic, depending on who you ask. The passage is safer than the alternatives—which says more about the alternatives than the passage itself.

#### The Route

The Safeway Passage runs roughly twelve miles through the Cowardly Mountains' narrowest point. The path follows a river canyon for the first third, climbs through a series of switchbacks to a high saddle, then descends through rockfall-prone slopes to the eastern foothills above the Minas River.

The passage is wide enough for wagons in most places, though several pinch points require careful navigation. Spring snowmelt makes the canyon section treacherous, and winter snows can close the upper reaches entirely. The optimal travel window runs from late spring through early autumn—roughly five months when the passage is reliably open.

Even in good conditions, the journey takes two to three days. Faster travelers have made it in one hard push, but the terrain punishes haste. Rockslides, washed-out sections, and the simple difficulty of mountain travel claim lives every year.

#### Horan's Hut

The fortress called Horan's Hut guards the eastern approach to the passage. Despite the diminutive name—a joke that stopped being funny generations ago—the fortification is substantial: thick walls, a defensible gate, and enough garrison space for a hundred soldiers. In practice, the garrison runs thirty to fifty depending on the season and the political situation in the surrounding territories.

The fortress serves three purposes:

**Tariff collection**: Every caravan passing through pays for the privilege. The rates are steep but predictable, and the alternative routes are worse. Merchants grumble and pay.

**Passage security**: The garrison maintains the route, clears rockslides, and occasionally escorts high-value caravans through the worst sections. This service costs extra.

**Watching the mountains**: The Cowardly Mountains harbor things that occasionally cause problems. The garrison keeps track of what moves in the heights, maintains relationships with the more approachable inhabitants, and responds when something dangerous comes down from the peaks.

The fortress takes its name from its founder, a Terrenian officer named Horan who established the first fortification here after the fall of his homeland. The original structure was indeed a hut—a timber blockhouse barely large enough for a dozen soldiers. Three centuries of expansion have transformed it into something considerably more impressive, but the name stuck.

#### Why Not the Forest?

Every few years, someone proposes cutting a route through Luendrokrül instead. The forest crossing would be shorter, lower, and avoid the passage tariffs entirely. The proposals always fail.

Survey expeditions don't return, or return without useful information. Workers sent to clear paths abandon the project within weeks. One attempt to establish a waystation in the forest's western edge ended when the entire work crew walked off the job simultaneously, unable to explain why but unanimous in their refusal to continue.

The passage authorities don't discourage these attempts. They've learned that nothing convinces people faster than letting them try. The survivors become the passage's most reliable advocates.

#### Politics

Horan's Hut operates semi-independently, technically owing allegiance to no single power. The garrison recruits from multiple nations and maintains careful neutrality in regional conflicts. This independence survives because everyone benefits from the passage remaining open and because no single power wants their rivals controlling it.

The arrangement is stable but not permanent. Rising powers eye the passage as a strategic asset. Declining powers worry about losing access. The garrison commander—currently a pragmatic veteran named Thessaly Vorn—spends as much time on diplomacy as defense, balancing interests and reminding everyone that a fight over the passage would close it to everyone.

A region inhabited by satyrs in Central Aboyinzu.

### Satyr Wood

Tags: forest, geography, satyr lands

Three hundred miles of dense woodland stretching from Falsehaven Bay to the Fyrsan Al Troikas mountains, and roughly seventy-five miles deep. This is Greater Satyr territory—not merely inhabited by them, but shaped by them over centuries of bloody ritual, caste warfare, and the strange music that echoes through every valley.

#### Character

Satyr Wood is alive in ways that have nothing to do with magic. The forest thrums with activity: war-bands on the move, hunting parties tracking prey (animal and otherwise), pipe-songs drifting between the trees to mark territory and issue challenges. The undergrowth is dense but traversed by countless game trails—satyrs don't build roads, but their hooves have worn paths into the forest floor over generations.

The trees here are old hardwoods, their canopy thick enough to turn midday into twilight. Clearings are rare and significant: ritual grounds, dueling circles, gathering sites for the seasonal ceremonies that structure satyr society. The largest clearings surround the three lakes—Noso, Pirison, and Pythol—where the most important rites occur.

Outsiders who enter Satyr Wood without permission rarely leave. The satyrs don't guard their borders in any organized way, but they don't need to. Every war-band treats intruders as prey, and the pipes carry news faster than any messenger. A human traveler might walk for an hour before realizing they're being followed. They might walk for another hour before understanding they're being herded. What happens after that depends entirely on the mood of whoever finds them.

#### The Greater Satyr

The satyrs who rule this forest are the Greater Satyr—warlike, disciplined, organized into a rigid caste system that determines everything from who leads war-bands to who may challenge whom. They stand a head taller than their lesser cousins, with larger horns and the muscular builds of creatures bred for combat.

For Greater Satyr, war is not a necessity but a celebration. Battle is worship, conquest is joy, and the chaos of combat is the closest thing to religious ecstasy their culture recognizes. Their war-bands move through the forest in constant motion, raiding each other, fighting for territory and status, proving themselves through violence.

The caste system is absolute but not static. A satyr can rise through victory in formal challenges—duels fought with horns and hooves in sacred clearings, witnessed by the war-band and sanctified by pipe-music. A satyr can also fall, stripped of rank for cowardice or failure, demoted to servitor castes or cast out entirely.

The highest caste are the Pipe-Lords, whose music can compel obedience from lesser satyrs and bewitch outsiders entirely. Below them are the Horn-Leaders who command war-bands, then the warriors proper, then the hunters who provide food and track enemies, and finally the servitors who maintain the camps and tend the wounded.

#### The Lesser Satyr

The Lesser Satyr exist at the margins of this society—feral, twitchy creatures who lack the discipline for the caste system and the size to challenge their greater cousins. Some serve as scouts and skirmishers for Greater Satyr war-bands, valued for their speed and their talent for spreading panic. Others have been cast out entirely, surviving in the deep forest or the borderlands where Greater Satyr patrols don't reach.

The relationship between the two groups is complicated. Greater Satyr view their lesser cousins with something between contempt and pity—useful tools at best, embarrassing reminders of what satyrs could become without discipline. Lesser Satyr view their greater cousins with fear, resentment, and occasional desperate loyalty.

In the wilder reaches of Satyr Wood, particularly near Luendrokrül's northern edge, Lesser Satyr bands have established their own territories. These are chaotic, dangerous places where the trickster nature of the lesser satyrs runs unchecked. Greater Satyr war-bands occasionally mount expeditions to cull these populations, but the deep forest always harbors more.

#### The Music

Sound defines Satyr Wood more than sight. Pipe-songs echo between the trees at all hours—territorial markers, warnings, invitations to parley, declarations of war. A trained ear can read the forest's political situation from the music alone: which war-bands are ascendant, which are feuding, where the boundaries lie.

The Pipe-Lords use music as a weapon. Their songs can charm listeners into compliance, compel enemies to dance until they collapse, or drive prey into panicked flight directly toward waiting hunters. The enchanting pipes are the most valued possession a satyr can hold, and the ability to play them marks the difference between a warrior and a lord.

War drums announce formal conflicts—the deep booming that carries for miles, summoning witnesses and warning neighbors that blood will be spilled. When the drums sound, even feuding war-bands observe informal truces to watch the fighting. War is entertainment as much as governance.

#### The Lakes

Three lakes punctuate Satyr Wood, each serving as a ritual center for the surrounding territory:

**Noso Lake** sits near the coast, fed by streams running down from the forest interior. The western shore touches the edge of Falsehaven Bay's coastal wetlands. This is where satyrs who deal with the outside world—rare as that is—conduct their business. The war-bands here are considered slightly tainted by contact with non-satyrs, but also more worldly and better supplied.

**Pirison Lake** lies in the forest's heart, the largest of the three and the site of the great seasonal gatherings. When the moons align properly—roughly twice per year—war-bands from across Satyr Wood converge here for ceremonies that combine worship, politics, and ritualized violence. Challenges between Pipe-Lords are settled at Pirison. Alliances are forged and broken. The lake's shores have seen more satyr blood than any battlefield.

**Pythol Lake** in the south is the oldest ritual site, surrounded by standing stones that predate satyr habitation. The satyrs didn't build these stones, and they don't know who did, but they've incorporated them into their ceremonies regardless. The rites performed at Pythol are darker than those elsewhere—blood sacrifices, communion with things the satyrs don't name openly, rituals that even other satyrs find unsettling.

#### The Rivers

**Bluecras River** flows from the forest interior toward Falsehaven Bay, the primary drainage for the northern woodland. Its valley provides one of the few natural routes through the forest, which makes it simultaneously valuable and dangerous—valuable because it's passable, dangerous because the war-bands know this.

**Veryl Creek** winds through the central forest, connecting Pirison Lake to the Pythol watershed. More a chain of streams and wetlands than a single waterway.

**Pythol River** drains southward from Pythol Lake, eventually leaving satyr territory entirely. The southern reaches of the river mark an approximate boundary—below this point, Greater Satyr patrols thin out, and the forest transitions toward the grasslands beyond.

#### Borders and Enemies

Satyr Wood is bounded by geography as much as by satyr choice. Falsehaven Bay to the west offers nothing worth taking. The Fyrsan Al Troikas mountains to the east are held by Spine Goblins—enemies the satyrs have fought for generations without either side gaining permanent advantage. The goblins can't take the forest; the satyrs can't take the mountains. The border is a bleeding wound that never heals, constant skirmishing that provides both sides with enemies to fight and glory to claim.

To the south, the forest thins into grassland, and the satyrs have little interest in open terrain that doesn't suit their fighting style. To the north lies more forest, eventually connecting to the broader wilderness of Central Aboyinzu. Satyr expansion in that direction has been slow—there's always more fighting to do closer to home.

### Tasqh Evikkris

Tags: river, geography, trade route

A broad, slow-moving river marking the western boundary of Echem Yiakraxes, the Tasqh Evikkris is the only safe passage through the region—and "safe" is relative. The name comes from an indigenous Aboyinzan language, roughly translating to "the watching water" or "water that sees." Locals claim the river has a spirit, and that spirit dislikes the Terrogones.

#### The Lifeline

For caravans, pilgrims, and anyone else who needs to transit the northwestern Deadloop region without crossing Terrogone territory, the Tasqh Evikkris is the only option. The river runs roughly north-south, fed by highland tributaries in the Anna P'Sue region and eventually emptying into the Deadloop's western reaches.

Traffic stays close to the water. Flat-bottomed barges carry goods and passengers, poled along by crews who know the river's moods intimately. Portage points at rapids and shallows see small communities—not quite towns, more like permanent camps—where travelers can resupply, hire guards, or wait for safer conditions.

The crossing from the river's western bank to anywhere east of Echem Yiakraxes requires either a very long detour south or a very dangerous shortcut through Terrogone hunting grounds. Most choose the detour.

#### Why the Terrogones Avoid It

The Terrogones don't hunt the riverbanks. They'll pursue prey to within a hundred yards of the water, then break off. They don't drink from the Tasqh Evikkris when other water sources are available. Family groups whose territories border the river treat it as a hard boundary, not contested ground.

**Theories:**

- **The current.** The Tasqh Evikkris runs deceptively fast beneath its calm surface. Terrogones are powerful but not buoyant; several have drowned attempting to cross.
- **The spirit.** Indigenous peoples have maintained shrines along the river for generations. Some believe an elemental or nature spirit inhabits the water, one with ancient grudges against the Chulpe.
- **Learned behavior.** Something in the river—crocodilian predators, aggressive fish, waterborne parasites—made the Terrogones' ancestors avoid it, and the prohibition passed down.
- **Agreement.** The most unsettling theory: that whatever controls Nyavminthk Castle established the river as a boundary, and the Terrogones obey.

Whatever the reason, the effect is consistent. The Tasqh Evikkris flows through Terrogone territory without being part of it.

#### The River Itself

Murky brown water, fifty to eighty yards wide in most stretches, deepening to thirty feet in the main channel. The current looks gentle from shore but pulls hard once you're in it. The banks are muddy, thick with reeds and low scrub—the only significant vegetation in this part of Echem Yiakraxes.

Wildlife congregates here in stark contrast to the barren plains. Wading birds, small mammals, fish visible in the shallows when the sun hits right. Crocodilian predators (called *krisev* locally) patrol the deeper stretches; they're dangerous but predictable, and the barge crews know how to avoid them.

The smell is mud and green growth—shocking after days in the dry savanna. Sound carries differently near the water; voices and splashes echo off the far bank. At night, the river produces a low, constant susurration that locals claim is the water spirit breathing.

#### River Communities

Permanent settlements are rare—the Terrogone proximity makes large populations unwise. Instead, a network of semi-permanent camps serves travelers:

- **Portage stations** at rapids and sandbars, where goods transfer between barges
- **Wayhouses** offering food, shelter, and local knowledge (for a price)
- **Shrine-keepers** who maintain the old worship sites and claim to speak for the river spirit
- **Guides** who know the territory east of the river, for those foolish enough to hire them

These communities are polyglot, transient, and deeply practical. They don't waste energy on hospitality theater; you pay for what you need, you don't cause trouble, you move on. The river provides, but it doesn't coddle.

#### For Adventurers

The Tasqh Evikkris offers:

- **Safe transit** through otherwise impassable territory, with all the encounters that implies
- **River communities** as sources of information, supplies, and local guides
- **The mystery** of why the Terrogones avoid it—and whether that protection can be extended or exploited
- **The spirit** that locals believe inhabits the water, which may or may not be real, and may or may not be friendly
- **A staging point** for expeditions into Echem Yiakraxes, including attempts on Nyavminthk Castle

### Tenches

Tags: city-state, nation, neutral

A city-state at the heart of Mikisapi Forest, built around an ancient grove that the trees have never reclaimed. Tenches controls the only safe maritime route between Central Aboyinzu and the South Sea, and has parlayed that position into wealth, influence, and careful neutrality.

#### The City

Tenches occupies a natural clearing in the forest's center—roughly two miles across, perfectly circular, with the **Heartwood Grove** at its exact center. The clearing has existed longer than anyone can remember; the trees simply stop at its edge, as if held back by an invisible line.

The city is built in concentric rings around the Heartwood. The innermost ring holds the Grove Council's halls, temples, and the homes of the old families. The middle rings contain merchants, craftsmen, and the prosperous middle class. The outer rings house workers, newcomers, and the three road-gates that connect to the island's harbors.

Population hovers around fifteen thousand, swelling during trade seasons and shrinking in winter. Buildings are constructed from Mikisapi timber and local stone, rarely more than three stories tall—the Grove Council forbids anything that might overshadow the Heartwood. The streets are unpaved but packed hard by centuries of foot traffic, swept clean daily by city workers.

#### The Heartwood Grove

At Tenches' center stands a ring of seven trees so massive they dwarf everything around them. These are the Heartwood—trees that predate the forest itself, their trunks wider than houses, their canopy spreading over the council halls below.

The Grove Council claims to interpret the will of the Heartwood through dreams, omens, and direct communion. Whether the trees actually communicate is debated by outsiders and believed absolutely by locals. What's certain is that decisions attributed to the Heartwood have kept Tenches independent and prosperous for centuries, navigating regional conflicts with uncanny foresight.

The Heartwood Grove is open to visitors during daylight hours. Touching the trees is forbidden. Cutting them, harming them, or even speaking disrespectfully near them results in immediate exile—and possibly worse, depending on what the forest decides.

#### Government

The **Grove Council** rules Tenches absolutely. Seven elders serve for life, chosen through a process that involves isolation in the Heartwood Grove until a new councillor "becomes clear." The council handles all major decisions: trade agreements, timber quotas, diplomatic relations, criminal sentencing.

Day-to-day administration falls to appointed officials who serve at the council's pleasure. The system is efficient, opaque, and resistant to outside influence. Foreign powers have tried to bribe, threaten, and infiltrate the council for centuries. None have succeeded for long—the forest has a way of revealing secrets, and the council has a way of acting on them.

#### Economy

Tenches' wealth comes from three sources:

**Transit tariffs.** Every ship passing through Deadloop pays fees at one of the island's harbors. The rates are reasonable—high enough to profit, low enough that alternatives aren't worth the danger. Captains grumble, but they pay.

**Timber exports.** Mikisapi wood is valuable, and Tenches controls all cutting rights. The Grove Council sets strict quotas, maintaining scarcity and high prices. Attempting to harvest timber without permission results in exile, seizure of goods, and blacklisting from all Tenches trade.

**Sanctuary services.** Tenches is neutral ground. Enemies can meet here safely, negotiations can proceed without fear of ambush, and secrets shared in Tenches stay in Tenches. This service isn't free—the council charges handsomely for hosting sensitive meetings—but it's reliable. No one has successfully violated Tenches' neutrality in living memory.

#### The Neutrality

Tenches refuses to take sides in regional conflicts. The Grove Council hosts negotiations, shelters refugees (for appropriate fees), and maintains diplomatic relations with every power in the region—including those at war with each other.

This neutrality is enforced absolutely. Violence within city limits results in immediate judgment: exile, imprisonment, or death depending on severity. The guilty party's faction is held collectively responsible—if a Chechol soldier starts a fight, Chechol pays reparations. This system has made Tenches one of the safest cities in Aboyinzu.

The council's neutrality extends to information. What's said in Tenches stays in Tenches. The council knows more secrets than any spy network, and they keep them all.

#### What It Looks Like

A city of wood and stone under a circle of open sky, surrounded by endless forest. The buildings are handsome but modest—carved wooden facades, slate roofs, flower boxes in windows. The streets are clean, the people prosperous, the atmosphere calm.

The Heartwood Grove dominates the skyline. The seven great trees are visible from anywhere in the city, their branches spreading over the central district like protective hands. At dawn and dusk, light catches the leaves and turns the grove to gold.

The harbors are busier than the city itself—ships loading and unloading, merchants haggling, sailors spending their wages in dockside taverns. The contrast between the quiet inner city and the rowdy harbors is striking.

#### For Adventurers

Tenches offers:

- **Safe harbor** in a region surrounded by dangers
- **Neutral ground** for meetings that couldn't happen elsewhere
- **Political intrigue** around the Grove Council and its mysterious decision-making
- **Trade connections** to every major power in the region
- **The Heartwood mystery**—do the trees really speak, or is the council playing a centuries-long con?
- **Forest expeditions** into Mikisapi's depths, seeking ruins, spirits, or things older still

### Tythikerys

Tags: plains, region, orc territory

Tythikerys is a vast stretch of arid scrubland in southwestern Central Aboyinzu, homeland of the Tytheri blood orcs. The region is largely empty of permanent settlement—the orcs are raiders and harvesters, not builders—but it serves a crucial strategic purpose: it separates Kadroka from the coast, landlocking the dragon-ruled state and denying it maritime trade.

#### Geography

The terrain transitions from the savanna of Kadroka into increasingly dry, rocky scrubland. Sparse vegetation, seasonal watercourses, and exposed stone characterize most of the region. The land is not truly desert—rain falls, grass grows—but it is harsh and unforgiving.

**Key Features:**
- **Agony Stones**: The cursed region in the south-central area, source of the Ichor that defines Tytheri culture
- **Bluesong Bay**: Western coastline, controlled by the Tytheri but barely used
- **Mumbling Forest**: Southwestern coastal forest, avoided by most orcs
- **Bloodswamp**: Northern border region where multiple rivers converge before entering Tytheri territory
- **Fury Hills**: Southeastern hills bordering Kadroka
- **Redreed Lake**: Terminal lake in the south, fed by the Dutunimako River

#### The Royko River

The Royko River is the region's main water artery, flowing southwest from the Bloodswamp through Tytheri territory to Bluesong Bay. The river and its tributaries (Sikuri, Dutunimako) provide the only reliable year-round water in the region.

Tytheri camps cluster near the river, moving seasonally to follow water and prey. The orcs have no permanent settlements on the Royko—or anywhere else—but certain traditional camping grounds are used generation after generation.

#### The Tytheri Blood Orcs

The Tytheri are not a nation in any conventional sense. They are a raiding culture sustained by addiction.

Generations ago, the orcs discovered the Agony Ichor—the weeping fluid of the Dying One that lies at the heart of the Agony Stones. They learned to harvest it, process it, and consume it in rituals that grant strength, pain resistance, and the bleached-white skin that marks their kind.

But the Ichor exacts a price. Long-term consumption deadens emotion until violence is the only sensation that registers. The orcs raid Kadroka not just for resources but because they *need* to inflict suffering to feel alive. Withdrawal brings the Dying One's agony crashing down on the user—phantom pain with no physical source, lasting until more Ichor is consumed or death provides release.

#### Social Structure

**Tythmasters**: Orcs fed the richest concentrations of Ichor grow to enormous size—ten feet or taller—and lead through raw physical dominance. Each warband follows a Tythmaster, and the Tythmasters loosely coordinate through tradition and mutual self-interest rather than formal hierarchy.

**Harvesters**: Specialized orcs who approach the Agony Stones to collect Ichor. This is dangerous work—the sympathy pain of the Dying One affects even the hardened Tytheri—but it is also prestigious. Harvesters know the safe paths and timing that minimize exposure.

**Raiders**: The majority of Tytheri warriors. They strike Kadrokan settlements, take what they need (cattle, slaves, supplies), and retreat before organized response can arrive.

**Thralls**: Captured slaves from Kadroka and elsewhere. Thrall life is brutal and short. Many are worked to death; some are consumed in Ichor rituals; a few are traded to other peoples for goods the Tytheri cannot make themselves.

#### Raiding Patterns

Tytheri raids follow seasonal patterns:

**Dry Season**: Peak raiding activity. The orcs range far into Kadrokan territory, striking isolated settlements and herding camps. Kadrokan border patrols are spread thin trying to cover all possible approach routes.

**Wet Season**: Reduced activity. Flooding along the Royko and its tributaries makes movement difficult, and the orcs focus on internal matters—Ichor processing, thrall management, resolving disputes between warbands.

**Harvest Periods**: Several times per year, warbands send harvesting parties to the Agony Stones. These are solemn occasions—even addicted orcs fear the Stones—and raiding typically pauses while the harvest is conducted.

#### Why They Hold Empty Land

Outsiders sometimes wonder why the Tytheri control such vast territory when they barely use it. The answer is simple: denial.

As long as the Tytheri hold the coastal approaches and the land around the Agony Stones, Kadroka cannot access the sea and cannot threaten the Ichor supply. The empty scrubland is a buffer zone, a killing ground for any Kadrokan force that tries to push through.

The orcs don't need to build cities. They just need to make sure no one else does either.

#### The Agony Stones

The Agony Stones dominate the southern portion of Tythikerys—forty miles east to west, twenty miles north to south of contorted, branching stone formations. Even the Tytheri approach with caution.

Harvesting parties know specific routes and timing that minimize exposure to the sympathy pain. They collect Ichor from the outer formations only—no orc goes deep into the Stones. The Harvesters have traditional knowledge passed down through generations: which paths are safer, how long you can stay, what signs indicate you've pushed too far.

What lies at the center of the Stones, what the Dying One actually is, the orcs neither know nor particularly care. The Ichor flows. That is enough.

#### Mumbling Forest

The southwestern coast of Tythikerys is dominated by the Mumbling Forest, a dense woodland that most Tytheri avoid. The forest gets its name from the constant low sound that pervades it—not quite voices, not quite wind, but something in between.

Whatever lives in the Mumbling Forest, it does not bother the orcs and the orcs do not bother it. A tacit understanding exists: the forest is not Tytheri territory, regardless of what maps might suggest.

#### Redreed Lake

In the southern reaches of Tythikerys, the Dutunimako River feeds into Redreed Lake—a terminal lake with no outlet. The water is brackish and the reeds that ring it grow with a distinctive reddish tinge (possibly from mineral content, possibly from something else).

The lake is one of the few permanent water sources in southern Tythikerys, and orc camps gather there during the driest months. It is also uncomfortably close to the Agony Stones—close enough that the sympathy effect can sometimes be felt at the lake's edge on bad days.

#### Entering Tythikerys

Outsiders who enter Tytheri territory face three threats:

1. **The Orcs**: Obviously. Small parties will be hunted. Larger parties will be watched and harassed until they leave or die.

2. **The Land**: Harsh terrain with limited water. Navigation is difficult. The orcs know every water source; outsiders do not.

3. **The Stones**: Anyone approaching the Agony Stones faces the same dangers as the orcs—sympathy pain, petrification risk, dream invasion—without the traditional knowledge that makes survival possible.

The safest approach (using that term loosely) is from the sea via Bluesong Bay. The Tytheri have no navy and rarely patrol the coast. But landing safely is only the beginning of the problem.

### Valley of the Witches

Tags: valley, geography, dangerous

The Valley of the Witches is a secluded vale in the Morygun Mountains, east of Korgül and northwest of Phaerhom. Its name is earned: the valley is home to a coven of powerful witches who have claimed it for generations, and they do not welcome visitors.

#### Geography

The valley cuts deep into the Morygun range, accessible only through a narrow pass that is easily defended—or easily concealed. The floor is surprisingly fertile given the altitude, with a small lake, patches of forest, and meadows that remain green when the surrounding peaks are snow-covered.

The climate within the valley is notably milder than the surrounding mountains. Whether this is natural geography or magical manipulation is unclear, but plants grow here that shouldn't survive at this elevation.

#### The Coven

The witches of the Valley are not a unified organization but a loose community of practitioners who share the space and certain traditions. Their magic draws on various sources—some use fae connections, others tap darker powers, a few practice stranger arts that defy classification.

What unites them is territoriality. The Valley is theirs. Anyone who enters uninvited faces consequences ranging from misdirection (being magically guided out) to curses (being turned into something unpleasant) to death (rare, but not unheard of).

The witches maintain relationships with the fairy enclave at Phaerhom to the southeast—not friendly relationships, exactly, but mutually respectful ones. Both communities are magical, territorial, and uninterested in the affairs of the lowland states.

#### Approaching the Valley

Finding the Valley of the Witches is itself a challenge. The entrance pass is hidden by illusion, misdirection, and the natural confusion of mountain terrain. Travelers searching for it often walk in circles for days before giving up or stumbling through by accident.

Those who do find the entrance face a choice: retreat immediately, or proceed and accept whatever consequences the witches impose. The coven has been known to accept certain visitors—those seeking specific knowledge, those willing to pay specific prices, those who amuse them—but the criteria for acceptance are unpredictable.

#### What They Know

The witches of the Valley possess knowledge that cannot be found elsewhere.

Some specialize in curses and their removal. Others know secrets of transformation, prophecy, or death. A few have studied the Agony Stones from afar and understand more about the Dying One than any lowland scholar.

For adventurers desperate enough to seek the Valley, the witches can be invaluable allies—if the price is acceptable. And the price is always terrible.

#### Relationship to Kadroka

The Valley of the Witches lies beyond Kadrokan territory, in the wild mountains where Melekas's authority does not reach. The dragon knows the witches exist but has never attempted to project power into their domain. Whether this is practical recognition of limits or the result of some past negotiation is unknown.

Kadrokan travelers are warned away from the Valley. Most take the warning seriously.

## Wanderlands

### Geography

The Wanderlands form the long southern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a great curved finger of land stretching southward into the South Sea. This diverse region is characterized by rolling plains, scattered forests, and rugged hill country, distinct from both the savannas of Central Aboyinzu to the north and the ancient rainforests of the Elderwilds to the east.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elderwilds peninsula; the South Sea separates them at the southern extent
- **South**: The South Sea
- **West**: Western coastline; the South Sea curves around the peninsula

#### Terrain

The Wanderlands encompass several distinct zones:

**The Cursed North:**
- **Donclik Peninsula**: A windswept finger of land extending into Donclik Sound, uninhabitable due to Donclik's Curse
- **Donclik Sound**: Cursed waters that draw the unwary to drown
- **Grendel Inlet**: A shallow, useless waterway separating the peninsula from the mainland
- **The Troughs**: Tidal gorges on the peninsula's western edge, rich with shipwreck salvage
- **Serisa's Palace**: Ruins of a pirate queen's fortress on the northern islands, guarded by kraken spawn

**The Moors and Hills:**
- **Eshire Moors**: Boggy moorland along the western mainland
- **Karik Hills**: Barren hills east of Grendel Inlet
- **Argum Hills**: Low hills on the Donclik Peninsula's eastern bulge
- **Gray Hills**: Hills in central Grendenheim
- **Snakefoot Hills**: Prominent range south of Grendenheim

**The Pastoral Heart:**
- **Grendenheim**: Open meadowlands—the only relatively safe area, wandered by Wispen halfling nomads
- **Krinea Mikea**: Marshland in the lowlands where Grendel Inlet terminates

**The Dragon's Domain:**
- **Dragonsong**: Ancient forest region covering the eastern Wanderlands
- **Mylowach**: Dense forest in northern Dragonsong
- **Plyrthasnyach**: Highland forest in northeastern Dragonsong
- **Bysal Emmus**: Southern forest, home of the dragon Ziru
- **Sonagrev**: Hills containing Dragon's Gate
- **Dragon's Gate**: A humming stone arch that Ziru guards—possibly a sealed portal

#### Why the Wanderlands Are Empty

The Wanderlands have no permanent settlements for good reason:

- **The North** is cursed. Donclik's Curse prevents anyone from staying on the peninsula or its surrounding waters for more than a few days without being drawn to drown.
- **The West** borders Echem Yiakraxes—Terrogone killing grounds that no sane person crosses.
- **The East** belongs to Ziru and the ancient Dragonsong forests. The dragon tolerates no intrusion near Dragon's Gate.
- **The Center** (Grendenheim) is the only area where extended habitation is possible, and even there, the Wispen halflings choose to wander rather than settle.

#### Relationship to the South Sea

The South Sea lies to the west of the Elderwilds and north of the Wanderlands peninsula. This body of water separates the Wanderlands/Elderwilds region from the eastern Shacklands. The peninsula's position could make it a crucial waypoint for maritime traffic—if not for the curse, the dragon, and the Terrogones.

### Political Climate

There is no political structure in the Wanderlands. No nation claims this territory. The Wispen halflings who wander Grendenheim have no government; they simply avoid the dangerous areas and keep moving. The dragon Ziru is the closest thing to a ruler, and she rules only by threat of death.

### What Makes It Interesting

- **Donclik's Curse** creates a ticking clock for any expedition—stay too long and you become part of the sea
- **Serisa's Palace** offers a flooded dungeon with real treasure and the possibility of breaking the curse
- **The Troughs** provide accessible danger with tidal mechanics and salvage opportunities
- **Dragon's Gate** poses mysteries about draconic origins and sealed portals
- **Ziru** is a dragon who can be negotiated with, for those brave or foolish enough to try

### What Will Go Wrong

- Expeditions that misjudge their timing on the peninsula
- Treasure hunters who delve too deep into the Troughs and lose track of the tide
- Adventurers who think they can sneak past Ziru
- Anyone who tries to settle permanently
- Scholars who find the contract in Serisa's Palace and try to read it without understanding what they're doing

### Donclik Peninsula

Tags: peninsula, geography, cursed, dangerous

A windswept finger of land extending north into Donclik Sound, notable primarily for being uninhabitable. The peninsula and surrounding waters are afflicted by Donclik's Curse—a supernatural compulsion that draws anyone who stays too long into the sea.

#### Geography

The peninsula stretches roughly sixty miles from the mainland, narrowing from a broad base to a rocky point. The terrain is mostly moorland and low hills—the Argum Hills occupy the eastern bulge where the peninsula is widest. The coastline is rocky and treacherous, with few natural harbors.

Grendel Inlet separates the peninsula from the mainland to the east, cutting south from Donclik Sound into the heart of the Wanderlands. The inlet is shallow and choked with sandbars, useless for serious navigation.

#### Donclik's Curse

Three centuries ago, the pirate queen Serisa ruled these waters through a bargain with a kraken-matriarch of the South Sea. When her heir broke that bargain, the dying creature cursed the entire peninsula.

**The Call:** After two or three days on the peninsula, you begin to hear the sea. Not the normal sound of waves—a voice, just below hearing, pulling at your attention. After a week, the pull becomes physical. You find yourself walking toward the water without deciding to. After a month, most people stop resisting. They walk into Donclik Sound and don't come back.

**The Mechanism:** The curse is carried in the water itself. The kraken-matriarch's dying essence seeped into Donclik Sound, and anything that drinks from it, eats fish from it, or simply breathes the salt air long enough becomes marked. The mark draws you toward the water. The sea wants what it was promised.

#### What the Curse Means

- **Short visits are safe.** Treasure hunters and explorers can work the peninsula if they're disciplined about timing. Three days is the rule of thumb. Five days if you're lucky. A week is pushing it.
- **Permanent settlement is impossible.** Every attempt has ended the same way: a thriving community that slowly, inexorably walks into the sea. The ruins of fishing villages dot the coastline—structures perfectly intact, no signs of violence, just empty.
- **The curse can be resisted** with enough willpower, but it never stops. The few people who've lived on the peninsula for extended periods describe it as a constant pressure—like being thirsty and standing next to a well you can't drink from.

#### Breaking the Curse

The original contract between Serisa and the kraken-matriarch still exists, somewhere in the flooded lower levels of Serisa's Palace on the northern islands. Scholars believe the bargain can be fulfilled, renegotiated, or formally nullified—but doing any of those requires reaching the palace, dealing with whatever still lives there, and reading a language no living person understands.

#### What It Looks Like

Empty moorland under gray skies. The grass is coarse and salt-resistant, bending constantly in the wind off Donclik Sound. Rocky outcrops break the monotony, worn smooth by centuries of weather. The coastline is all cliffs and jagged rocks—no beaches, no gentle approaches, just stone meeting water in a constant collision of spray.

The abandoned villages are the worst part. Houses still standing, doors still on hinges, possessions still inside. Meals left half-eaten on tables. Children's toys in yards. Everything waiting for people who walked into the sea and never came back.

The air tastes like salt. Always. Even miles inland, you can taste the sea.

#### For Adventurers

Donclik Peninsula offers:

- **A ticking clock** on every expedition—stay too long and you join the drowned
- **Abandoned settlements** with whatever their inhabitants left behind
- **The Troughs** on the western edge, where tidal gorges offer treasure and danger
- **Serisa's Palace** on the northern islands, if you're brave or foolish enough
- **A curse to break**, if you can find the contract and figure out how to use it

### Donclik Sound

Tags: bay, geography, cursed, water

A large bay on the northern edge of the Wanderlands, bounded by the Donclik Peninsula to the east and the mainland coast to the west. The waters are cursed—anything living that spends too long in contact with them becomes drawn to drown.

#### Geography

Donclik Sound opens to the South Sea in the north, with the mountainous islands of Serisa's Palace marking the boundary. The sound is relatively shallow compared to the open ocean, with depths rarely exceeding a hundred feet except in a few trenches near the islands. Grendel Inlet branches south from the sound's eastern edge, cutting between the peninsula and the mainland.

The western shore is dominated by the Eshire Moors—rolling, boggy terrain that offers no good harbors. The eastern shore belongs to the Donclik Peninsula, equally inhospitable. The only notable feature is the entrance to the Troughs on the peninsula's western edge, where tidal gorges cut into the rock.

#### The Cursed Waters

The waters of Donclik Sound carry Donclik's Curse. Three centuries ago, a dying kraken-matriarch poured her essence into the sound as a final act of vengeance against the humans who had betrayed her. That essence never dissipated.

Drinking the water accelerates the curse's effects. Eating fish from the sound does the same. Even breathing the salt spray for extended periods will mark you. Sailors who must cross the sound do so quickly, with sealed water supplies, eating only preserved food brought from elsewhere.

The fish themselves are affected—they're drawn to the deeper waters near Serisa's Palace, congregating in vast schools around the flooded ruins. Fishermen who've seen them describe the fish as "waiting for something."

#### What It Looks Like

Gray water under gray sky. The sound is rarely calm—wind funnels between the peninsula and the mainland, kicking up choppy waves even on clear days. The water itself looks normal, if a bit darker than the open ocean. There's no obvious sign of the curse, no supernatural glow or unnatural color. It just looks like water.

That's what makes it dangerous. People forget.

The islands to the north are visible on clear days: dark shapes on the horizon, crowned with the broken towers of Serisa's Palace. Seabirds wheel above them constantly. Nothing else lives there anymore.

#### For Adventurers

Donclik Sound offers:

- **A barrier** that must be crossed quickly or not at all
- **The entrance** to the Troughs and Serisa's Palace
- **Cursed waters** that can accelerate or trigger Donclik's Curse
- **Salvage opportunities** for those willing to risk diving in cursed water

### Dragon's Gate

Tags: poi, landmark, dragon, portal

A massive natural stone arch rising from the Sonagrev hills in eastern Dragonsong. The arch spans nearly two hundred feet at its apex and hums with a low, subsonic resonance audible from miles away—the same tone that gives the Dragonsong region its name.

#### The Sealed Passage

Local legends claim the first dragon arrived through Dragon's Gate, stepping from somewhere else entirely. The stone itself vibrates at a frequency that sets teeth on edge and makes campfires gutter. Scholars who've studied it from safe distances believe the arch is a dormant portal—a doorway to somewhere that has been sealed for millennia.

Whatever passage it once offered is closed. But it still hums. Still waits.

#### Ziru's Vigil

The dragon Ziru considers Dragon's Gate sacred and destroys anyone who approaches without her explicit permission. The Sonagrev hills surrounding the arch are littered with the bones of the curious—hence the name, which translates loosely to "song-graves" in Old Aboyinzan.

But Ziru doesn't guard the arch to protect it. She guards it to prevent anything from coming *through*.

Those few who've spoken with Ziru and survived report that she never explains what she's watching for. She simply says the arch "remembers how to open" and leaves the implication hanging.

#### What It Looks Like

The arch is weathered gray stone shot through with veins of something darker—not quite obsidian, not quite void. At certain angles, the dark veins seem to shift, forming patterns that almost resolve into meaning before slipping away. The ground beneath the arch is bare stone, scoured clean of vegetation in a perfect circle. Nothing grows there. Nothing rots there. Bones left within the circle remain pristine for centuries.

The hum is constant but not quite rhythmic—it shifts in pitch and intensity seemingly at random, though some scholars insist it follows patterns too long for mortal observation. Standing beneath the arch for extended periods causes headaches, nosebleeds, and a persistent sensation of being watched from behind.

#### For Adventurers

Dragon's Gate offers:

- **A mystery** at the heart of draconic presence in the region
- **Ziru as gatekeeper**—she can be negotiated with, but the price is always steep
- **The question** that haunts the brave: what is on the other side, and why does it want to come through?
- **Potential planar connections** for campaigns dealing with portals, other realms, or dragon origins

### Gray Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A low range of hills in central Grendenheim, marking the transition between the open meadowlands and the Dragonsong forest to the east.

#### Geography

The Gray Hills rise gradually from the Grendenheim plains, reaching modest heights before descending toward the Kelfretes Lake basin. They're not particularly tall or dramatic—more a rumpled rise in the landscape than true mountains. The hills get their name from the exposed granite that breaks through the thin soil on the higher slopes.

#### Character

Unlike the cursed Donclik Peninsula or the dragon-haunted Dragonsong, the Gray Hills are simply... empty. The soil is poor, the wind constant, and there's nothing here worth settling for. The Wispen halflings who wander Grendenheim occasionally pass through, but they don't linger.

The hills offer good sightlines in all directions—useful for spotting trouble before it spots you. From the higher ridges, you can see the dark line of Dragonsong to the east, the glint of Kelfretes Lake to the northeast, and the open sweep of Grendenheim to the west and south.

#### What It Looks Like

Rounded hills covered in coarse grass, broken by gray granite outcrops. Wind-twisted shrubs grow in the sheltered spots between rocks. The soil is thin and rocky—not the kind of land anyone would farm even if settlement were possible here. In spring, wildflowers briefly color the slopes. The rest of the year, everything is gray and green and the brown of dead grass.

### Grendel Inlet

Tags: inlet, geography, water

A shallow inlet extending south from Donclik Sound, separating the Donclik Peninsula from the Wanderlands mainland. Unlike the strategic straits found elsewhere in Alaria, Grendel Inlet is a dead-end waterway of little practical use.

#### Geography

The inlet cuts roughly thirty miles south from Donclik Sound before tapering into marshy shallows near Krinea Mikea. It's flanked by the Donclik Peninsula to the west (with its Argum Hills) and the mainland to the east (where the Karik Hills rise from the coast).

The water is shallow throughout—rarely more than twenty feet deep, and often less. Sandbars shift with the tides, making navigation hazardous for anything larger than a rowboat. The bottom is silty and treacherous, prone to trapping anchors and hulls alike.

#### Why It Doesn't Matter

In theory, an inlet connecting the sound to the interior could be valuable. In practice, Grendel Inlet offers nothing:

- **No through-passage.** It's a dead end, not a strait. Ships that enter must turn around and leave the same way.
- **No deep water.** The shallows prevent any serious maritime traffic.
- **Cursed waters.** Like the rest of Donclik Sound, the inlet carries the curse. Extended exposure marks you.
- **Nothing at the far end.** The inlet terminates in the marshes of Krinea Mikea—no ports, no settlements, no reason to go there.

Occasionally, ships fleeing storms or pursuit duck into the inlet seeking shelter. Most regret it. The shallow water offers poor anchorage, and every hour spent waiting is an hour closer to hearing the call.

#### What It Looks Like

Murky water between low, treeless shores. The coastline is a mix of rocky outcrops and mudflats, depending on the tide. Reeds and salt-grass grow along the waterline. The Karik Hills rise to the east, bare and wind-scoured. The Argum Hills are visible to the west across the water, equally bleak.

The inlet is quiet. No fishing boats work these waters. No settlements dot the shore. Just empty coastline and the constant sound of wind and waves.

### Serisa's Palace

Tags: ruins, dungeon, cursed, naval, kraken

The crumbling fortress of a pirate queen who made a bargain with the deep—and whose heir broke it.

#### The Pirate Queen

Serisa was a naval warlord who controlled Donclik Sound three centuries ago. Her fleet dominated the waters between Aboyinzu and the South Sea, extracting tribute from every ship that passed. She built her palace on the northern islands to watch the sea lanes and to be close to the source of her power.

That source wasn't her ships. It was something in the deep water.

#### The Bargain

Serisa made a deal with a **kraken-matriarch**—one of the great cephalopods that rule the abyssal trenches of the South Sea. The creature's spawn would wreck any ship Serisa marked for destruction, and in exchange, Serisa would deliver a tithe: one in ten of every crew her fleet captured, thrown living into the deep.

For decades, this arrangement made her untouchable. Rivals who challenged her found their fleets dragged under by things they couldn't fight. Serisa grew wealthy, powerful, and feared across the southern seas.

#### The Breaking

Serisa grew old and her heir refused to continue the tithe. When Serisa died, her daughter Mariselle tried to renegotiate—offering gold, offering ships, offering anything but living flesh. The kraken-matriarch didn't negotiate.

It pulled the palace into the sea, killing everyone inside, and laid a curse on the entire peninsula: anyone who stays too long will belong to the deep. This curse—Donclik's Curse—still affects the region today.

#### The Ruins

The palace didn't sink completely. The upper levels remain above water on the largest of the northern islands: crumbling towers, collapsed halls, and chambers open to the sky where roofs have fallen in. The architecture is maritime in style—built from sea-weathered stone with motifs of waves, ships, and tentacles worked into every surface.

The lower levels are flooded. Seawater fills the basements, vaults, and dungeons, accessible only to those willing to dive. The kraken-matriarch is long dead—they don't live forever—but her spawn still nest in the submerged chambers. They remember the bargain. They're still waiting for payment.

#### What Remains

Serisa's treasury was never recovered:

- **Navigation charts** of the South Sea, including routes to islands that don't appear on modern maps
- **Weapons** designed specifically to fight sea monsters—harpoons, poisons, and stranger things
- **The original contract**—a stone tablet carved in a language that predates human writing, which scholars believe might be the key to breaking Donclik's Curse
- **Mariselle's body**, somewhere in the flooded lower levels, still wearing the crown she inherited and never got to use

#### What It Looks Like

The islands are gray stone and black rock, permanently wet from spray and rain. Seabirds nest in every crevice, and their cries echo off the ruins constantly. The palace walls are thick with barnacles below the waterline and streaked with salt above it. Collapsed sections reveal the bones of the structure—massive stone blocks fitted together without mortar, still holding after centuries.

The flooded levels are dark, cold, and silent except for the occasional shift of something large in the water. Bioluminescent algae provides faint light in some chambers. The walls are covered in carvings that become increasingly alien the deeper you go—Serisa's work above, something else's work below.

The air smells like salt, rotting kelp, and something else: a faint musk that experienced sailors recognize as kraken-scent.

#### For Adventurers

Serisa's Palace offers:

- **A flooded dungeon** with both above-water and underwater sections
- **Kraken spawn** as guardians—not the matriarch herself, but her children and grandchildren
- **The contract** that might break Donclik's Curse, if anyone can read it
- **Treasure** worth dying for, assuming you can reach it and escape
- **A time limit**—the curse means you can't spend long on the peninsula, so every expedition is a race against the clock

### The Troughs

Tags: canyons, geography, tidal, dangerous, treasure

A network of deep gorges cutting through the western Wanderlands peninsula, connecting to the sea and flooding violently with each high tide.

#### Tidal Gorges

The Troughs are narrow canyons—some barely twenty feet wide, others spanning a hundred—carved into the peninsula's rocky western edge. At low tide, they're explorable: winding stone corridors with exposed cave systems, tidal pools, and whatever the South Sea has deposited over centuries. At high tide, they become death traps. Walls of seawater rush through the narrow channels with enough force to pulverize anything caught inside.

The tide tables are life-or-death knowledge here. Experienced scavengers carry watermarked staffs showing safe depths, and they *never* venture deeper than a six-hour round trip allows. The unwary have roughly fifteen minutes between "water's rising" and "water's here."

#### What the Sea Brings In

The Troughs act as a natural filter for everything the South Sea carries: shipwrecks break apart on the rocky approaches and their cargo washes into the gorges. Flotsam from a thousand vessels accumulates in the deeper chambers—trade goods, weapons, coin, and occasionally things better left on the ocean floor.

The most valuable finds come from the **bone caves**: chambers too deep for casual exploration, accessible only during the lowest tides of the year. These caves contain the compressed remains of everything the Troughs have swallowed over millennia. Treasure hunters who've braved them report finding artifacts from civilizations that predate current maps.

Of course, some things wash in alive. Or close enough.

#### The Rhythm of Scavenging

A loose community of scavengers works the Troughs during safe seasons—mostly halflings comfortable with tight spaces and quick escapes, plus the occasional desperate fortune-seeker. They've developed informal rules:

- **Claim stakes** mark active salvage. Violating another's stake invites violence.
- **High chambers** (above the tide line) are communal territory for rest and trade.
- **Storm warnings** are shared freely. Even rivals want witnesses to their deaths.
- **The deep caves** are first-come, first-served. If you can reach them before the tide turns, whatever you find is yours—assuming you make it back.

#### What It Looks Like

Wet stone in a hundred shades of gray and green, slick with algae below the tide line. The walls are carved smooth by millennia of rushing water, occasionally broken by sharp edges where recent storms have cracked new fissures. Pools collect in every depression, some shallow and warm, others deep and cold and home to things that don't surface. The air smells of salt, rot, and ozone. Sound carries strangely—a whisper at one end of a gorge might echo clearly a quarter mile away.

When the tide comes, you hear it before you see it: a building roar that reverberates through the stone, followed by a wind that tastes like the ocean's breath. Then the water.

#### For Adventurers

The Troughs offer:

- **Treasure hunting** with genuine time pressure and environmental danger
- **Tidal mechanics** that reward preparation and punish overconfidence
- **Creatures** that wash in from the South Sea—or that have made the flooded caves their home
- **Access routes** to deeper cave systems that may connect to other underground locations
- **A scavenger community** with its own politics, rivalries, and information to trade

## Elder Wilds

### Geography

The Elder Wilds occupy the entire eastern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a vast region of ancient rainforest, winding rivers, and primordial wilderness. This is one of the oldest and least tamed regions of the known world, where the jungle has grown undisturbed for millennia.

The region earns its name from the **Anchor Trees**—colossal individuals scattered throughout the wilderness, rising hundreds of feet above the canopy. These ancient giants mark the tombs of titans buried by druids in the aftermath of the Ezz Rift, 120 million years ago.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The South Sea and the waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands
- **East**: Eastern coastline facing the Slumbering Abyss
- **South**: The Dalizi Highlands rise to the south
- **West**: The Wanderlands peninsula and the South Sea

#### Terrain

The Elder Wilds are dominated by massive rainforest—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, and countless rivers cutting through the green expanse. The terrain varies dramatically:

- **Northern Peninsula (L'Coth D'hari)**: Dense jungle covering a multi-lobed landmass, controlled by the Gamori elves
- **Central Highlands (Seyiy)**: Rolling hills and dramatic waterfall systems, the highest ground in the region
- **Western Lowlands (Aphenlein)**: Flat, flooded jungle with slow-moving rivers forming moat-like channels between trees
- **Eastern Forests (Bygos Shemazari, Runeglades)**: Rainforest giving way to seasonal floodplains along the coast

#### Why It's Empty

Three points of interest across 340,000 square miles. The Elder Wilds are not frontier waiting for settlement—they are wilderness that refuses habitation.

The beasts here are simply not worth the cost. Forty-foot apes roam the Apelands, territorial and violent. Pterodactyls hunt from the Archfalls. Water hags lurk in the river systems. Brain-eating amoebae infest the pools. Shadow hounds stalk the blue ruins of Everlong. The flooded Aphenlein forests can't support permanent structures—the moats shift seasonally, and anything built sinks.

What settlements exist are either ancient (L'Coth D'hari's hidden Gamori communities), inaccessible (Urzula beneath its waterfalls), or the territory of beings who prefer solitude over company.

#### Relationship to Surrounding Regions

The Elder Wilds form a natural barrier between the Wanderlands to the west and the Dalizi Highlands to the south. The South Sea provides water access to both the Wanderlands and the distant Shacklands across the strait. An astral current crosses the region diagonally, but with no settlements along its route, it sees virtually no traffic.

---

### The Anchor Trees

Scattered throughout the Elder Wilds—from the Apelands in the north to the edges of the Dalizi Highlands in the south—stand the Anchor Trees. These colossal individuals dwarf even the ancient rainforest canopy, rising three hundred feet or more, their trunks so massive that small communities could live within hollowed sections.

#### Origin

When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria with Melera's music 120 million years ago, the titans experienced emotion for the first time. For beings of pure Deoric order, this contact with raw feeling was unbearable agony. Many killed themselves. Others fled to distant planar stacks.

Those who died in the Elder Wilds were buried by the druids—the only beings who could safely handle titan remains while channeling Faesong to bind the cosmic energies. Where druids sang titan corpses into the earth, the Anchor Trees grew. Their roots wrap around titan bones that never decay. Their sap carries traces of Deoric resonance.

#### The Collective

The Anchor Trees are aware. Not individually intelligent—each tree is no more sentient than any ancient oak—but together they form a slow, distributed consciousness. They communicate across decades through root networks and spore dispersal. They remember fragments of the titans they anchor: impressions of an age before emotion, echoes of Deoric speech, the traumatic flood of feeling that ended everything.

Druids can sometimes perceive this collective awareness. Faesong practitioners hear it as a bass note beneath their music—impossibly deep, impossibly slow. Psy-sensitives approaching an Anchor Tree feel the weight of geological time pressing against their minds.

The trees are not hostile. They are patient beyond mortal comprehension. They are waiting—for what, no one knows.

---

### The Shemazari Ruins

Dotted throughout the Elder Wilds are the remnants of an ancient civilization—step pyramids swallowed by jungle, stone faces worn smooth by millennia of rain, processional ways now choked with strangler figs. These are the ruins of the **Shemazari**, a kingdom that flourished during the early Third Eon before vanishing without historical record.

#### What Remains

The Shemazari built in pale stone that the jungle has since stained green and black. Their structures share distinctive features:
- **Stepped pyramids** with flat tops, often partially collapsed, found near river confluences
- **Carved faces** worked into cliff sides and boulder surfaces, expressions serene or anguished
- **Canal systems** now flooded and integrated into the natural waterways
- **Underground chambers** beneath the pyramids, most long since looted or collapsed

The largest concentration of ruins lies in **Bygos Shemazari** ("Old Shemazari" in corrupted local dialect)—the eastern rainforest where the civilization likely centered. But smaller sites appear throughout the region, suggesting the Shemazari controlled far more territory than the jungle has revealed.

#### What Happened

No one knows. The Shemazari left no decipherable writing, no clear descendants, no legend of their fall. Scholars have proposed plague, internal war, ecological collapse, or magical catastrophe. The Gamori of L'Coth D'hari claim the Shemazari "went into the trees"—whether this is metaphor, myth, or literal truth is unclear.

Some adventurers note that the oldest Anchor Trees often stand near Shemazari sites. Whether the Shemazari worshipped the trees, tended them, or were destroyed by them remains a matter of speculation.

---

### L'Coth D'hari

The northern peninsula of the Elder Wilds—a multi-lobed landmass of dense jungle surrounded by the South Sea. L'Coth D'hari is the territory of the **Gamori**, an elven people obsessed with death, transformation, and the sacred hunt.

#### Geography

L'Coth D'hari comprises several forested peninsulas separated by:
- **Breathless Bay**: The western inlet, fog-shrouded and still
- **Paradise Inlet**: The central waterway dividing the main lobes
- **Farthing Inlet**: The southern boundary separating L'Coth D'hari from the Apelands

The entire territory is densely forested with minimal clearings. Outsiders find navigation nearly impossible without guides.

#### The Gamori Republic

L'Coth D'hari functions as a loose republic. Multiple Gamori communities exist throughout the peninsula, each with elected leadership. These leaders gather at **Eriyen** to make decisions affecting the whole territory.

The Gamori are elves who have developed a culture centered on:
- **Death and rebirth cycles** — They view death not as an ending but as transformation
- **Body modification** — Scarification, bone-shaping, implants of natural materials
- **Sacred hunting** — Rituals involving the pursuit and consumption of specific prey

Outsiders are rarely welcome. The Gamori consider the Elder Wilds their hunting grounds and have been known to dismantle settlement attempts south of their borders.

#### Eriyen

The closest thing L'Coth D'hari has to a capital—though "gathering place" is more accurate than "city." Eriyen sits in the western lobe near Breathless Bay. Here the elected leaders convene during significant moments: disputes between communities, external threats, or decisions about outsiders seeking passage.

Eriyen itself is less a permanent settlement than a ceremonial ground with temporary structures that appear and disappear with the political calendar.

#### Thorne

In the interior of L'Coth D'hari, away from the coasts and the Gamori communities, lies **Thorne**—the domain of a druid who has dwelt in the Elder Wilds since before the Gamori arrived.

Thorne (both the place and the being who inhabits it) is not exactly evil, but operates by principles that most mortals find disturbing. The druid Thorne is ancient, immortal in the way of greater elves, and has pursued a path that diverged from traditional Faesong practice long ago. Some whisper of bargains with entities in the Anchor Tree collective. Others speak of experiments with the boundary between life and death—fitting for a neighbor of the death-obsessed Gamori.

The grove called Thorne is not a fortress. It is a place where the forest itself has become alien—where the plants move with too much purpose, where the animals watch with too much intelligence, where visitors find themselves forgetting why they came.

The Gamori give it wide berth. They have an understanding with the druid, the terms of which they do not discuss.

---

### The Apelands

South of L'Coth D'hari, across Farthing Inlet, lies a stretch of rainforest dominated by its most dangerous inhabitants: the great apes.

These are not ordinary primates. The apes of the Apelands stand forty feet tall, covered in dark fur, possessed of terrifying strength and violent territorial instincts. They roam the forest in loose bands, battling each other for dominance, and killing anything they perceive as a threat.

No one has successfully studied them. Expeditions that enter the Apelands either return within days or don't return at all. What little is known comes from observation at the boundaries:
- They are omnivorous but prefer meat
- They communicate through deep vocalizations that carry for miles
- They appear to have some form of social hierarchy, though the specifics are unclear
- They occasionally venture south into Seyiy and Bloodwood, causing devastation

Why apes of this size evolved here—whether natural adaptation or magical intervention—remains unknown. Some scholars note that the Anchor Trees are particularly numerous in and around the Apelands.

---

### Bloodwood

The forest west of the Apelands and north of Seyiy takes its name from its dominant tree species—the bloodwood, a hardwood with deep red heartwood that bleeds crimson sap when cut.

Bloodwood timber is extraordinarily valuable:
- Rot-resistant even in the wettest conditions
- Fire-resistant to temperatures that would char ordinary wood
- Beautiful when finished, with rich red grain patterns

The problem is harvesting it. Bloodwood forest sits between the Apelands to the north and the dangerous Seyiy highlands to the south. Logging expeditions must contend with ape incursions, the beasts of Seyiy, and the forest's own dangers. Most bloodwood that reaches markets comes from the Jungles of Titania in the Shacklands—a longer route but one with fewer forty-foot apes.

---

### Seyiy

The central highlands of the Elder Wilds—a dramatic region of hills, waterfalls, and treacherous terrain. Seyiy rises from the surrounding lowland jungle like a rumpled blanket, its rivers carving deep valleys and plunging over cliff faces.

#### Terrain

Seyiy is defined by its elevation changes. Rolling hills give way to sudden drops. Rivers that flow placidly through the lowlands become rushing torrents here, tumbling over falls and through rocky gorges. The constant mist from so many waterfalls creates a unique microclimate—cooler, wetter, and thick with plant growth that clings to every surface.

#### River Systems

From Seyiy's heights, water drains in three directions:
- **North** — Three major rivers flow north through Bloodwood to empty into Farthing Inlet
- **West** — Numerous rivers descend through North Aphenlein and Aphenlein to Thrumbling Bay
- **East** — The Saploeth River and its tributaries flow through Bygos Shemazari to the eastern coast

These rivers are the only practical highways through the Elder Wilds. Overland travel through the jungle is nearly impossible; the rivers offer routes—difficult and dangerous, but navigable.

#### Archfalls

In the southern reaches of Seyiy lies the Archfalls—a maze of waterfalls, ancient stonework, and death.

Moss-covered stone arches span the cascades, creating a labyrinth of spray and crumbling masonry. The origin of these arches is unknown; they predate the Shemazari and may be titan-era construction. Whatever purpose they once served has been forgotten. Now they serve as perches for pterodactyls, hunting grounds for water hags, and graves for the unwary.

The water here harbors brain-eating amoebae. Quad-winged dove-like creatures drift through the spray—beautiful and apparently harmless, though no one has studied them closely enough to be certain. The combination of dangerous fauna, deadly parasites, slick stone, and sheer drops makes Archfalls one of the most hazardous locations in the Elder Wilds.

#### Urzula

North of the Archfalls, built beneath massive waterfalls, sits the city of Urzula—the only significant settlement in the Elder Wilds outside L'Coth D'hari.

Urzula clings to cliff faces and occupies caves behind the falling water. Climbers hang from ropes, harvesting the plants that grow in the perpetual mist—rare herbs, medicinal mosses, bioluminescent fungi. The city is accessible only by dangerous climbing routes or by navigating the treacherous rivers.

Beneath modern Urzula lie the ruins of an ancient titan city. The current inhabitants know the ruins are there—they occasionally find artifacts, strange inscriptions, chambers of unknown purpose—but they've never fully explored what lies below. The depths are dangerous, and Urzula's people are more interested in surviving the present than excavating the past.

---

### The Aphenlein Forests

West of Seyiy, descending toward Thrumbling Bay, the terrain flattens dramatically. Here the Elder Wilds transform into something different: the Aphenlein forests, where the jungle becomes as much water as land.

#### North Aphenlein

The transitional zone between Seyiy's hills and the true Aphenlein. Rivers from the highlands spread and slow here, beginning the process of flooding that defines the region. The forest is dense but navigable; the water channels are not yet the impassable moats of the southern reaches.

#### Aphenlein

True Aphenlein is flat, flooded jungle. Slow-moving rivers weave between ancient trees, their waters forming moat-like channels that separate islands of raised ground. During the dry season, the moats are chest-deep. During the wet season, they rise overhead.

Travel here is exclusively by canoe or raft. Walking means wading—or swimming. The trees have adapted to permanent flooding: aerial root systems arch above the water, floating seed pods drift on the current, bioluminescent fungi cling to submerged trunks and glow faintly at night.

The danger in Aphenlein is not monsters—it's navigation. The channels shift seasonally. Landmarks submerge. Maps made in dry season become useless when the waters rise. People who enter without guides don't find their way out. They become lost in the endless green maze, paddling in circles until exhaustion or predators claim them.

Freshwater dolphins move through the deeper channels—the same species that swims up into the Runeglades during flood season. Giant salamanders lurk in the murky water. Fish that climb trees watch from branches overhead. It is beautiful and lethal in equal measure.

---

### Bygos Shemazari

The eastern rainforest of the Elder Wilds—"Old Shemazari" in corrupted local usage, and the region where the ancient Shemazari civilization likely centered.

The jungle here is dense but punctuated by ruins. Step pyramids rise from the canopy, visible from the eastern coast. Stone faces peer from cliff sides along the Saploeth River. Underground chambers—most collapsed or flooded—honeycomb the ground beneath the forest floor.

Modern interest in Bygos Shemazari is limited by its inaccessibility. The eastern coast offers few natural harbors. The interior is trackless jungle. And the Runeglades to the south flood annually, cutting off overland approaches for months at a time.

Those who have explored the region report that the ruins feel watched. Not by inhabitants—the Shemazari are long gone—but by the forest itself, or perhaps by the stone faces that stare with worn, serene expressions.

---

### Runeglades

The coastal lowlands southeast of Seyiy, where the Elder Wilds meet the Slumbering Abyss.

The Runeglades flood every year. When the seasonal rains come and the rivers swell, the entire region becomes a shallow inland sea. The jungle here has adapted—trees with stilt roots, floating vegetation mats, wildlife that migrates vertically rather than horizontally.

And the dolphins come.

Swimming up from the ocean, pods of freshwater dolphins navigate the flooded forest, hunting fish driven from the deeper channels. They're more intelligent than they should be—following boats, responding to calls, apparently communicating among themselves with clicks and whistles that carry complex information.

The local name "Runeglades" comes from markings found on certain trees and stones—patterns that might be Shemazari writing, might be natural formations, might be something else entirely. During flood season, some of these marked surfaces glow faintly beneath the water. No one has explained why.

---

### Kidwood

The southern forest, between the Aphenlein system and the Dalizi Highlands. Kidwood is less dramatic than the northern regions—standard rainforest without the flooding of Aphenlein or the hills of Seyiy—but it serves as a transition zone where the Elder Wilds begin to give way to the different character of the Dalizi.

The Frosnos River flows through Kidwood, one of the primary waterways connecting the interior to the southern coast. Small Shemazari ruins dot the forest, but none of the major pyramid sites.

---

### Lemru Nymor

The southeastern hills, between Kidwood and the coast. Lemru Nymor represents the last of the Elder Wilds before the terrain rises toward the Dalizi Highlands. The forest here is thinner, the hills more pronounced, the climate drier.

Anchor Trees are rare in Lemru Nymor—only a handful stand in the hills, suggesting that fewer titans died or were buried in this region.

---

### Minori Ezag

In the northeast of the Elder Wilds, where three Anchor Trees stand in unusual proximity, dwells **Minori Ezag**—an ancient druid of extreme power and questionable sanity.

Minori Ezag climbs between trees like a primate, moving through the canopy with unsettling speed and grace. Their age is unclear but certainly measured in centuries; their gender is ambiguous or perhaps irrelevant. They have lived among the Anchor Trees for so long that some speculate they've become attuned to the collective consciousness—that they hear what the trees remember, perceive what the trees perceive.

What Minori Ezag does in their territory is unknown. They accept no students. They offer no wisdom. Occasionally they're spotted from a distance, moving through the treetops at dusk. Occasionally travelers who pass too close find themselves... redirected. Not attacked—simply turned around, their path subtly altered until they're heading away without remembering when they changed direction.

The three Anchor Trees near Minori Ezag's territory are the only ones in the Elder Wilds that stand so close together. Whether this is why the druid settled here, or whether their presence has caused the trees to grow in unusual proximity, is yet another mystery of the Elder Wilds.

---

### Thrumbling Bay

The bay on the western coast where the rivers of Aphenlein empty into the South Sea. Thrumbling Bay earned its name from the sound—the constant low rumble of water flowing from dozens of river mouths, creating a background noise that visitors describe as both soothing and unsettling.

The bay itself is shallow, the water brown with silt, the coastline a maze of river deltas and mangrove-like vegetation. This is not a natural harbor—ships cannot easily approach, and there's nothing to approach for. Thrumbling Bay marks the edge of the navigable world. Beyond lies only the endless green of the Aphenlein, and beyond that, the hostile heights of Seyiy.

---

### Notable Locations

#### Everlong

Blue ruins, huge crumbling walls, labyrinthine. The stone itself carries a faint azure tint—some mineral in the original construction, or perhaps staining from the blue and black lotus flowers that grow throughout the ruins.

Everlong predates the Shemazari. Its builders are unknown. Its original purpose is lost. What remains are walls that seem to extend forever, turning and twisting in patterns that may once have had meaning. An onyx crystal of significant size and unknown purpose lies somewhere within—multiple expeditions have sought it, few have returned.

The ruins are inhabited by shadow hounds—creatures of Malstaric origin that have somehow established a permanent presence in the material plane. They hunt at night, invisible in darkness, and their bites drain not blood but shadow—leaving victims diminished, faded, less substantial with each wound.

#### Forest of Statues

An ancient, eerily silent expanse of the Elder Wilds where reality bends and time becomes a tangible force. The Forest of Statues is the site of **The Stillness**—a permanent Izzus (time) breach that has existed since the Lost Ages, creating one of the most dangerous and mysterious locations in Alaria.

##### The Stillness: A Temporal Breach

Within the forest, time flows in deeply inconsistent patterns. The breach itself is not localized to a single point but pervades the entire forest region, creating zones of accelerated, decelerated, and frozen time. Those who venture into the forest without understanding its nature face a horrifying fate: they slow down progressively, their movements becoming increasingly sluggish until they effectively become stone-like—frozen in moments that stretch for centuries from the outside world, yet feel like mere seconds from their own distorted perspective.

The statues that give the forest its name are victims of The Stillness—travelers, explorers, and adventurers who became trapped by the temporal anomaly, their bodies hardened and petrified by the strange forces at work. Some are centuries old; others are recent additions to the forest's grim collection.

##### The Time Witches

Over centuries, a society of witches and hags has learned to navigate The Stillness and exploit its power. These **time witches** possess an innate understanding of temporal flow—a gift or curse that allows them to move within the breach as others move through normal space. To outsiders, they appear to move impossibly fast, blurring between moments. They inhabit the forest and guard its secrets jealously.

The time witches have become custodians of a unique form of power: **time stones**—artifacts of concentrated Izzus energy that channel the breach's temporal manipulations. These stones are rare, precious, and tightly controlled by the witch communities. Those who possess them can influence time on localized scales, though the cost of such power is invariably steep.

##### Ciri the Time Witch

Among the time witches, **Ciri** stands out as a legendary figure—ancient, powerful, and possessor of one of the most potent time stones. She is said to have lived through multiple centuries of subjective experience while only decades passed in the outside world. Ciri has been known to accept capable and determined travelers as students, teaching them to navigate The Stillness and understand temporal magic. However, her price is steep: she demands a piece of her student's soul—a literal fragment of their essence—in exchange for knowledge that most could never acquire elsewhere.

Those who have trained under Ciri emerge transformed, bearing subtle marks of temporal affinity and understanding, but forever diminished in some ineffable way.

## Dalizi Region

### Geography

The Dalizi region encompasses two distinct but related areas: the **Dalizi Confederation** (a collection of states) and the **Dalizi Highlands** (a mountainous geographic region). Both are defined by their relationship to **Lake Tonactlet Chipe**, the large central lake that serves as their geographic anchor.

#### The Two Dalizi

##### Dalizi (Confederation)

A massive confederation of states occupying the territory **mostly northwest, and also west/southwest** of Lake Tonactlet Chipe. This is a political entity—a collection of allied or federated states sharing cultural and economic ties. The confederation represents one of the largest political bodies in southern Aboyinzu.

##### Dalizi Highlands

A mountainous highland region positioned **north and northeast** of Lake Tonactlet Chipe. This is a geographic designation referring to the elevated, rugged terrain east of the main confederation. The Highlands are characterized by peaks, valleys, and difficult terrain.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu, the Chechol region, and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elder Wilds peninsula
- **South**: Dragon's Spine mountains
- **West**: Central Aboyinzu and the Morygun Mountains

#### Lake Tonactlet Chipe

The defining geographic feature of the region—a massive freshwater lake roughly 80 miles long and 40 miles wide at its broadest point. The lake serves as the boundary marker between the Dalizi Confederation (to its west/northwest/southwest) and the Dalizi Highlands (to its north/northeast).

Lake Tonactlet Chipe is the economic heart of the Confederation. Its waters teem with fish; its shores produce freshwater pearls; its depths contain mineral deposits that divers harvest at considerable risk. The four Elector states that border the lake—Mpaso, Chilala, Misanda Mulu, and Samani—derive enormous wealth from controlling lakeside ports.

The lake is also sacred to the Lake's Children faith, whose adherents worship it as a living deity. Priests interpret the lake's moods—calm, stormy, murky, clear—as divine messages. Major decisions in lakeshore states are often delayed until the lake "speaks."

Navigation on the lake is treacherous. Sudden storms rise without warning, and the lake floor drops precipitously near certain shores. Skilled pilots command premium fees, and lakeside cities maintain lighthouse networks to guide vessels.

### Political Climate

The Dalizi Confederation is a political entity in name only. In practice, it's forty-plus independent states bound by treaties everyone interprets differently, mutual defense obligations no one trusts, and a tangle of marriages, debts, and grudges that would take a scholar decades to untangle.

**The Current Crisis**: Paramount Makisani III is dying. She's held the Confederation together for thirty-two years through personal relationships and careful diplomacy. Her heir is weak. Three candidates are maneuvering for the succession, and none commands majority support among the Seven Electors.

**The Candidates**:
- **Shundari of Shunde**: Military strongman, wants centralized power
- **Mwenekazi of Chilala**: Ambitious regent-queen of the largest state, wants Chilala dominance
- **Tumaini of Lanwadanzi**: Wealthy merchant-prince, wants stability (and continued trade profits)

The Electors are deadlocked. When Makisani dies—within two years, likely less—the Confederation may enter an interregnum. The last one killed 40,000 people.

**The Five Circles** organize regional politics:
- **Lakeshore Circle**: Wealthy lake states, paralyzed by the Mpaso-Chilala rivalry
- **Highland Circle**: Traders and scholars, nervous about instability
- **Forest Circle**: Independent frontier states, ignoring the succession fight
- **Border Circle**: Vulnerable northern states, desperate for protection
- **South Wall Circle**: Martial cultures, positioning their candidate

**Everyone is scheming**. Assassins are affordable. Mercenary companies are everywhere. The Temple of Names sells genealogical "discoveries" that conveniently support whoever pays most. And underneath all of this, no one is watching the quiet theocracy to the north.

### What Makes It Interesting

**Political Sandbox**: The Confederation is a medieval political simulator. Every state has interests, grievances, and schemes. Players can engage at any level—local city-state politics, Circle maneuvering, Elector-level succession games. There's always someone to help, someone to hinder, and someone to betray.

**Mercenary Culture**: Professional soldiers for hire are everywhere. Players can join companies, found their own, or watch their employers get outbid. Contracts have loopholes. Loyalties are fungible. The line between soldier and criminal depends on who's paying.

**Religious Complexity**: Three faiths—Ancestors' Way, Lake's Children, Old Forest—create cultural fault lines. Religious identity affects who trusts you, who hires you, and who wants you dead. The Temple of Names controls genealogical records crucial for inheritance; their favor is worth killing for.

**The Coming Storm**: The Border Circle is exposed. Chechol's Red Army is building. When Gynor activates his control, these states will burn first—and the Confederation's slow, fractious response may doom them.

**The Succession**: The Paramount's death will trigger a crisis. Players can influence the outcome through diplomacy, blackmail, assassination, or military action. Every candidate offers different adventure opportunities. An interregnum offers more.

**The Dhabisa Grudge**: A former Elector state, stripped of its seat after the War of Broken Oaths, still plots to regain its position. They'd support almost anyone who promises to help—including, potentially, the players.

### What Will Go Wrong

**The Succession Will Break**

Makisani will die. The Electors won't agree. If no candidate secures four votes, the Confederation enters interregnum—no Paramount, no Confederate Army, every state for itself. The last interregnum lasted seven years.

Possible outcomes:
- A weak compromise candidate nobody wanted
- Open civil war between Chilala and Shunde
- Chilala absorbs smaller states under "protection"
- The Confederation fragments into regional blocs

**The Red Army Will Activate**

Gynor the Conqueror has spent two centuries building his weapon. When he activates control over Chechol's Rentar, they'll march south. Turbuni will fall first. The Border Circle will burn. And the Confederation will be too distracted by succession politics to respond.

By the time they mobilize a Confederate Army—if they can mobilize one—the Red Army will be entrenched. The war will be long, bloody, and may permanently reshape the region's politics.

**The Mercenary Problem**

The Painted Shields already seized Kerikos once. Other companies are watching. If the succession crisis weakens central authority enough, mercenary companies may decide that taking cities is more profitable than protecting them. A few successful seizures could trigger a cascade—why defend a city when you could own it?

**Religious Schism**

The Temple of Names has been challenging Lake's Children inheritance claims. Lake's Children priests have been denouncing highland practices. Forest Circle states have expelled missionaries. None of this is violent yet.

In a succession crisis, religious identity becomes political identity. If candidates align with specific faiths, the theological disputes become civil war. The Confederation has survived internal conflicts before, but not religious wars.

**Chilala Gets What It Wants**

Mwenekazi becomes Paramount. Backed by Chilala's resources, she transforms the position from ceremonial to powerful. Smaller states are absorbed. The Diet becomes a rubber stamp. The Confederation becomes the Chilala Empire in all but name.

Some would call this stability. Others would call it conquest. The resistance would be desperate, bloody, and probably futile.

### Notable Locations

#### The Eastern Forest

A massive ancient forest stretches east of the Dalizi Confederation, between the confederation proper and the Elder Wilds. This wilderness is home to numerous leyline intersections and ancient powers.

##### Terwin Lake

A lake within the eastern forest, positioned on a force leyline near where it intersects with a void leyline. The convergence of these two fundamental magical forces creates an area of extreme supernatural power and danger.

###### Cynker's Den

The hidden headquarters of Cynker, a mastermind of dimensional travel who has achieved paragon attunement to force magic. His lair is home to clawed nymph and rusalka-like creatures with adept control over force magic—likely his creations or servants. The convergence of force and void leylines at this location allows Cynker to manipulate dimensional boundaries, enabling him to pull off impossible heists by teleporting objects (and himself) across vast distances or even between planes.

The den itself is protected by spatial distortions and force barriers that make approach nearly impossible for those not specifically invited.

###### Kroikylo's Tomb

Located at the exact intersection of the force and void leylines on Terwin Lake, Kroikylo's Tomb is one of the most dangerous dungeons in Alaria. The burial place of Kroikylo, an ancient mage who mastered both force and void magic, the tomb is filled with lethal traps that combine both disciplines—crushing force fields that appear from nowhere, spatial rifts that tear flesh from bone, and void zones that simply erase matter.

Despite the extreme danger, the tomb draws adventurers seeking the legendary void stones said to be buried with Kroikylo—crystallized fragments of pure void that grant mastery over space and nothingness to those who can wield them without being consumed.

##### Mirror Lake

Deep within the Eastern Forest lies Mirror Lake, a body of water with a surface so perfectly still and reflective that it appears as polished glass. It is believed that if you can find your reflection in the lake's mirrored surface, you will see your true self—and within that reflection, discover your true name. Many seekers have journeyed to Mirror Lake in search of this revelation, though few claim to have succeeded in glimpsing what the waters reveal.

#### Northeastern Forests

The forests in the northeastern reaches of the Dalizi region are known for their strange magical phenomena.

##### Reflection Lakes

A cluster of interconnected lakes scattered throughout the northeastern Dalizi forests. These lakes possess a remarkable property: stepping into one lake can cause you to instantly reemerge from a different lake up to 50 miles away. The teleportation is unpredictable—there is no way to control which destination lake you will emerge from, making the Reflection Lakes both a potential shortcut and a serious hazard.

Travelers have been known to step into a lake seeking to cross a small body of water, only to emerge miles away in hostile territory or completely lost. The lakes reflect each other not just in name but in essence—what happens in one ripples across the network in ways both mundane and magical.

### Banesnap Hills

The **Banesnap Hills** run along the eastern face of the Foggy Mountains, forming a broken barrier of ridges and valleys between the mountain wall and the Shipwreck Coast. The hills take their name from the banesnap beetle, an insect whose bite causes agonizing muscle cramps—the hills are home to the largest known population of these creatures in Alaria.

#### Geography

The Banesnap Hills extend roughly sixty miles north to south, from the Misty Valley to the northern slopes of the Elder Mountains. They're relatively low—most ridges top out under 2,000 feet—but steep and irregular, with numerous small canyons cutting through the terrain. The eastern slopes drop sharply toward the sea, offering dramatic views of the Shipwreck Coast from exposed ridgelines.

The hills are drier than the Foggy Mountains they border, sitting in a rain shadow that leaves them exposed to sun and wind. Vegetation is sparse: tough grasses, thorny shrubs, and the occasional twisted pine that has survived the wind. The soil is thin and rocky, better suited to insects than agriculture.

#### The Banesnap Beetle

The beetle that gives these hills their name is about an inch long, with iridescent black wing covers and powerful mandibles. They nest in rocky crevices and emerge at dusk to hunt smaller insects. Their bite is not venomous in the traditional sense, but it injects a compound that causes severe muscle spasms lasting several hours.

A single bite is painful but not dangerous. Multiple bites can be life-threatening, as the accumulated muscle cramping can affect breathing and the heart. Travelers who camp in the hills quickly learn to check their bedding and boots.

The beetles are most active in warm weather. Winter travel through the Banesnap Hills is safer but presents its own challenges—exposed ridges catch fierce winds, and snow can obscure the already treacherous footing.

#### The Wreck Watchers

A peculiar tradition exists among the shepherds of the nearby Dalizi states: young people seeking to prove their courage will climb to the high points of the Banesnap Hills to watch the Shipwreck Coast. From certain vantage points, the wrecks scattered along the shore and in the shallows are visible on clear days.

These "wreck watchers" compete to identify the most ships, describe the most details, or stay the longest on the exposed ridges. The practice is dangerous—the beetles, the wind, and the unstable terrain claim lives regularly—but it persists as a rite of passage. Some watchers claim to have seen lights on the wrecks at night, or movement among the scattered hulls.

#### Strategic Irrelevance

Despite commanding views of the eastern sea, the Banesnap Hills have no military value. No army could climb them in formation, no supplies could be reliably transported across them, and there's nothing on the far side worth defending. The hills exist as a barrier, nothing more—a final obstacle between the Foggy Mountains and the sea that breaks the coast.

### Cerulean Crests

The **Cerulean Crests** are the southernmost major range of the Dalizi Highlands, a chain of blue-tinged peaks that marks the transition between the highland interior and the lowland Dalizi Confederation. The name refers to the distinctive coloration of the stone—a pale blue-gray that appears almost luminous in certain light conditions.

#### Geography

The Cerulean Crests extend roughly fifty miles from the Toothlar Mountains in the west to the approaches to the Troyan Mountains in the east. The range is lower than the northern highland chains—most peaks fall between 7,000 and 9,000 feet—but compensates with dramatic scenery and relatively accessible terrain.

The blue coloration comes from a high copper content in the rock, which oxidizes to create the distinctive hue. The effect is most striking in early morning and late evening, when angled light brings out the color. At midday, the mountains look merely gray; at dawn and dusk, they glow.

The range is relatively gentle by Dalizi Highland standards. Passes exist at several points, and the slopes, while steep, are generally climbable. The Cerulean Crests are the most accessible mountains in the highlands—which still makes them dangerous, just less so than the alternatives.

#### The River of Petals

The most notable waterway in the Cerulean Crests is the River of Petals, which rises from springs in the central range and flows south toward the Dalizi lowlands. The river gets its name from the flower petals that cover its surface during spring bloom—the copper-rich soils of the Crests support unique alpine flowers that shed their petals into the streams.

The river valley provides the easiest route through the Cerulean Crests, connecting the highland interior to the Dalizi Confederation. This is the primary southern access point to the highlands, less difficult than the Titan Stairs and less dangerous than the Chalaari Valley's proximity to the ogre-infested Troyan Mountains.

#### Hills of Meus

The northern slopes of the Cerulean Crests descend into the Hills of Meus, a transitional zone of lower terrain that separates the Crests from the Jackal Mountains and Hills of False Rubies. The Hills of Meus are relatively gentle—rolling grassland with scattered rock outcrops—and provide the easiest walking in the Dalizi Highlands.

The hills are named for Meus, a legendary Dalizi prospector who allegedly found copper deposits here before vanishing into the mountains. Whether his find was real, whether he died in the Crests, and whether any wealth remains undiscovered are questions that still motivate occasional treasure hunters.

#### Mining History

The Cerulean Crests have been mined intermittently for centuries. The copper that gives the mountains their color is present in extractable quantities, and several Dalizi states have operated mines in the range.

The mining operations have always been marginal. The ore is good quality, but the remote location and difficult terrain make extraction expensive. Mines open, operate for a few decades, and close when the easy deposits are exhausted or when transport costs become unsustainable.

Currently, two small mining operations function in the eastern Crests, both focused on high-grade deposits that justify the logistics. The miners live in seasonal camps, working during summer and descending to the lowlands for winter.

#### The Blue Sickness

Extended exposure to the copper-rich environment of the Cerulean Crests causes health effects collectively known as the Blue Sickness. Symptoms include:

- Bluish discoloration of skin, particularly around the eyes and fingernails
- Metallic taste in the mouth
- Fatigue and weakness
- Liver and kidney problems in severe cases

Miners and long-term visitors are most affected. Short-term travelers rarely stay long enough to develop symptoms. The Dalizi mining companies rotate workers regularly to prevent chronic exposure, but some degree of Blue Sickness is considered an occupational hazard.

The Blue Sickness is treatable if caught early—removing the affected person from the copper-rich environment allows recovery. Left untreated, it can be debilitating or fatal.

### Chalaari River

The **Chalaari River** drains the western Troyan Mountains, cutting a valley that provides the primary route between the central Dalizi Highlands and the lowland states of the Confederation. The river is neither large nor particularly impressive, but its valley is the closest thing to a road through this part of the highlands.

#### Course

The Chalaari rises from snowmelt and springs in the western Troyan Mountains, gathering water from a dozen tributary streams before flowing southwest toward the Dalizi lowlands. The river is perhaps forty feet wide at its largest, shallow enough to ford in most places during summer but prone to dangerous floods during spring melt.

The upper valley is narrow and steep-sided, cutting through the gap between the Troyan Mountains and the Hills of Meus. This stretch is the most difficult—the river often fills the valley floor, forcing travelers to pick their way along narrow ledges above the water. The valley widens as it descends, becoming gentler terrain as it approaches the lowlands.

The Chalaari eventually joins a larger river system in the Dalizi Confederation proper, contributing its water to agricultural irrigation downstream.

#### The Valley Route

The Chalaari Valley is the most practical route through the western Dalizi Highlands. Travelers heading from the lowland states into the central highlands—whether bound for the Chull Lands, the Titan Stairs, or beyond—almost universally use this valley. The alternatives are worse: the Marrow Valley to the east is longer and leads through Moon Goblin territory, while crossing the Troyan Mountains directly is effectively impossible.

The route is not easy. The upper valley requires careful navigation, the river must be crossed several times as it switches banks, and the valley's position between ogre territory and jackal range means both hazards are possible. But it's passable, which in the Dalizi Highlands is high praise.

Travel time from the lowlands to the Chull Lands is approximately five days for a fit party moving at speed. Merchants with loaded pack animals take seven to ten days. Most parties travel in groups for protection.

#### The Chalaari Camps

A series of traditional camping spots mark the valley route, located at roughly one-day intervals. These aren't formal waypoints—there are no structures, no services, no authority—but generations of travelers have identified the same defensible positions with good water access. The camps have names passed down through tradition: First Ford, Ogre Watch, High Shelter, The Bend, and several others.

Travelers who know the route move from camp to camp; those who don't may find themselves spending nights in less defensible positions. The camps are first-come, first-served; conflicts over space are not unknown during busy seasons.

#### Seasonal Variation

The Chalaari Valley is most passable in late summer and early autumn, when the river is low and the weather is stable. Spring melt makes the upper valley dangerous or impassable, with the river filling its banks and flash floods possible after rain in the Troyans. Winter brings snow to the upper valley and ice to the river, making travel difficult but not impossible for prepared parties.

The ogres of the Ogre Hills are most active in autumn; the dire jackals of the Jackal Mountains are most dangerous at dawn and dusk year-round. Travelers time their movements accordingly.

#### Economic Significance

The Chalaari Valley carries most of the traffic between the western Dalizi Highlands and the Confederation proper. This traffic is modest—the highlands produce little that the lowlands need—but it includes:

- **Mineral prospectors** heading to or from the Cerulean Crests and surrounding ranges
- **Hunters** pursuing game in the highlands, particularly the valuable dire jackal pelts
- **Scholars** investigating the mysterious features of the interior highlands
- **Exiles** heading somewhere they won't be followed
- **Fools** convinced they'll find what others missed

The Dalizi states along the lower Chalaari have considered establishing formal control over the valley—waypoints, patrols, tolls—but the traffic has never justified the expense. The valley remains wild.

### Chilala

Tags: state, elector, lakeshore circle

The largest state in the Dalizi Confederation—by population, by territory, by economic output, and by ambition. Chilala controls the eastern shore of Lake Tonactlet Chipe and dominates the Lakeshore Circle's politics. Its ruler, Regent-Queen Mwenekazi, is positioning to become the next Paramount, and everyone knows what that would mean: the end of the Confederation as a loose alliance, and the beginning of Chilala hegemony.

The state stretches from the lake shore into the highlands northeast, encompassing rich fishing grounds, productive farmland, and control of trade routes to the Elder Wilds. Its population exceeds the next three states combined. Its capital, Kisro, rivals Metato as the Confederation's largest city. Its armies—while less professional than Shunde's—can field more soldiers than any other member state.

Chilala's neighbors fear it. Chilala's allies benefit from its protection while resenting its dominance. The Confederation's political structure was designed to prevent any single state from becoming too powerful. Chilala is testing whether that design can hold.

#### Government

**The Regency**

Chilala is technically ruled by **Prince Mukwano**, a boy of thirteen who inherited the throne when his father drowned in Lake Tonactlet Chipe five years ago. In practice, power lies with his mother, **Regent-Queen Mwenekazi**, who governs "until the prince comes of age."

Mwenekazi has shown no indication she plans to surrender power when Mukwano turns eighteen in five years. Court observers note that the prince's education emphasizes philosophy and arts rather than statecraft. His tutors are all Mwenekazi loyalists. His scheduled public appearances are carefully managed. Some whisper that he's being deliberately kept unprepared.

The Regent-Queen herself is brilliant, ruthless, and patient. She's spent five years consolidating control over Chilala's administration, replacing old nobility with her creatures and building a network of informants throughout the Confederation. She's the most dangerous politician in Dalizi, and she knows it.

**The Court**

Chilala's court is a snake pit of competing factions:

- **The Queen's Circle**: Mwenekazi's loyalists, who profit from her rule and will fight to maintain it
- **The Legitimists**: Nobility who want Prince Mukwano to rule in his own right (and who expect to influence him more easily than his mother)
- **The Old Families**: Ancient bloodlines who resent Mwenekazi's lowborn favorites
- **The Temple Faction**: Lake's Children priests who want religious policy to favor their faith

Mwenekazi plays these factions against each other expertly. She gives the Legitimists just enough hope. She bribes the Old Families just enough. She makes public displays of Lake's Children devotion. No faction can unite against her because each believes it might still get what it wants.

#### Culture

**Lake's Children Heartland**

Chilala is the spiritual center of the Lake's Children faith. The lake is a living god; its moods are prophecy; its depths are sacred. Every significant decision—from royal marriages to military campaigns—must be blessed by lake-sign: a particular pattern of waves, a configuration of fish, a dream revealed to the priests.

This gives the Lake's Children priesthood enormous power. The Temple of Waters in Kisro can delay royal edicts by declaring the lake "speaks against it." Mwenekazi has spent years cultivating temple support, and the current High Priest is her creature—but the relationship remains delicate.

**Fisher Culture**

The lake shore is home to thousands of fishing villages, where communities have harvested the waters for generations. These fisherfolk form Chilala's common population—hardworking, superstitious, loyal to the lake and its priests rather than to distant nobility.

Mwenekazi has cultivated fisher support carefully. She's reduced noble fishing monopolies, funded temple schools in coastal villages, and made public visits to even the smallest communities. The fisherfolk adore her. They'll fight for her if she asks.

**Highland Integration**

The highland territories northeast of the lake were conquered two generations ago. Their population—Ancestors' Way followers with highland culture—has never fully integrated. They pay taxes, obey laws, and quietly resent Kisro's rule.

Mwenekazi has tried to win highland loyalty through development projects and religious tolerance. Results are mixed. The highlands remain Chilala's least stable region, and if the state faces serious crisis, highland revolt is possible.

#### The Paramount Campaign

Mwenekazi wants the Paramount seat. She's been campaigning—discreetly—since Paramount Makisani's health began to fail.

**Her Pitch**

To states that fear instability: "The Confederation needs strong leadership. Only Chilala has the resources to provide it."

To states that fear Shunde: "Better me than a military strongman who'll turn the Confederate Army on internal enemies."

To states that want prosperity: "Lake trade benefits everyone. A Chilala Paramount would invest in infrastructure, reduce internal tariffs, grow the economy."

**Her Reality**

Mwenekazi's Paramountcy would transform the Confederation. She'd use Chilala's resources to make the position powerful—building a real Confederate Army under her command, centralizing tax collection, establishing precedents that future Paramounts couldn't undo. The Confederation would become, effectively, a Chilala empire with a thin constitutional veneer.

Some states would benefit—those who ally with Chilala early. Most would lose autonomy. A few would resist and be crushed.

**Her Obstacles**

- **Shunde** will never support her. General Shundari sees her as a threat and has his own ambitions.
- **Lanwadanzi** fears her. A strong Paramount would threaten their trade autonomy.
- **The smaller states** are scared. Chilala dominance means absorption.
- **Kafula** has genealogical grudges against Mwenekazi's bloodline dating back centuries.

Currently, Mwenekazi has one confirmed Elector vote (Chilala itself) and one probable vote (Kafula, whose grudges might flip). She needs four. The campaign continues.

#### Military

Chilala's army is large but uneven. The core is 8,000 professional soldiers—well-equipped, adequately trained, loyal to the Regent-Queen. Beyond that, Chilala can call up 20,000+ militia from the fishing villages and farming communities—enthusiastic but poorly trained.

The state also maintains a small lake fleet: armed fishing boats, really, but effective for patrol and piracy suppression. No other Confederation state has naval capacity.

Mwenekazi has been quietly professionalizing the army, hiring Shunde veterans as trainers and investing in equipment. If civil war comes, Chilala will be ready.

#### Notable Locations

**Kisro (Capital)**

A sprawling city of 80,000 on the eastern lake shore. The royal palace, the Temple of Waters, and the commercial districts cluster near the water; poorer neighborhoods sprawl inland. The city is beautiful, wealthy, and utterly certain of its own importance.

**The Temple of Waters**

The Lake's Children's holiest site—a complex of pools, channels, and meditation chambers where priests interpret the lake's will. Pilgrims come from across the Confederation to seek blessings. The High Priest's pronouncements can move markets and topple governments.

**The River of Petals**

A river flowing into Lake Tonactlet Chipe from the northeast, named for the flowering trees along its banks. The river marks the boundary between core Chilala and the conquered highlands. Crossing it means entering territory that doesn't quite feel like the same state.

#### Player Hooks

**The Regency**

- Prince Mukwano secretly wants to rule. He's smarter than his tutors report. He needs allies outside his mother's network.
- A Legitimist noble hires the party to "educate" the prince—code for breaking Mwenekazi's control over him.
- Mwenekazi suspects a plot against her regency and wants investigators. She pays well and punishes failure.

**The Campaign**

- An Elector state hires the party to find dirt on Mwenekazi—anything that might dissuade voters.
- Mwenekazi hires the party to secure a wavering Elector's vote. Methods are at their discretion.
- Someone is assassinating Mwenekazi's campaign agents. She wants to know who—and she wants them stopped.

**The Highlands**

- Highland rebels contact the party, seeking weapons or mercenaries.
- Mwenekazi wants the highland situation stabilized before the succession. She needs operatives who can work without official backing.
- An Ancestors' Way temple in the highlands has discovered something that could embarrass the Lake's Children—or unite the faiths against a common enemy.

### Chull Lands

The **Chull Lands** occupy a relatively low basin in the western Dalizi Highlands, a pocket of broken terrain surrounded by mountain walls on three sides. The region takes its name from the chulls—large, aggressive crustaceans that infest the wetlands and caves throughout the area. The Chull Lands are the closest thing to accessible terrain in the highland interior, which means they're merely very dangerous rather than impassable.

#### Geography

The Chull Lands form an irregular basin roughly thirty miles east to west and twenty miles north to south, wedged between the Titan Stairs to the west, the Thundering Mountains to the north, and the Jackal Mountains to the east. The southern boundary is less defined, transitioning into the Hills of False Rubies and the northern approaches to the Cerulean Crests.

Elevations range from 3,000 feet in the basin floor to 5,000 feet where the terrain rises toward the surrounding mountains. The landscape is a mix of marshland, rocky outcrops, cave-riddled limestone formations, and scattered patches of stunted forest. Water is abundant—too abundant—with numerous springs, seeps, and small streams that keep much of the basin perpetually wet.

The Rivoleta River drains the eastern portion of the basin, flowing south toward the Cerulean Crests. Several smaller streams join it from the mountains, creating a network of waterways that the chulls have claimed as their own.

#### The Chulls

Chulls are freshwater crustaceans roughly the size of large dogs, with hard-shelled bodies, powerful claws, and an aggressive territorial nature. They're amphibious, equally capable of operating in water or on land, and they're found throughout the Chull Lands wherever moisture is present.

##### Physical Description

An adult chull measures three to four feet long, not counting the claws. The shell is dark gray-green, providing excellent camouflage in the muddy terrain. The claws are disproportionately large—the major claw can be a foot across—and powerful enough to sever limbs or crush armor. The creatures move with unsettling speed despite their bulk.

##### Behavior

Chulls are primarily nocturnal, spending daylight hours in underwater dens or cave systems. At night, they emerge to hunt, taking fish, amphibians, small mammals, and anything else they can catch—including humans. They're not intelligent in any meaningful sense, but they're cunning predators with excellent senses.

Chulls are territorial and will attack anything that enters their claimed areas. Unfortunately, their territories overlap in complex ways, and what seems like empty ground may be a boundary zone where multiple chulls respond to intrusion. Travelers through the Chull Lands learn to move during daylight and to seek high, dry ground before dusk.

##### Reproduction

Chulls reproduce in the cave systems, laying eggs in protected pools. The young are vulnerable for their first year, during which they remain near the spawning caves. Adult chulls become increasingly aggressive during spawning season, which occurs in late spring.

#### Navigation

Crossing the Chull Lands is the most practical route between the Titan Stairs and the central Dalizi Highlands. The alternatives—climbing the Thundering Mountains or pushing through the Jackal range—are worse. But "practical" is relative.

The standard route runs east from the Titan Stairs' Third Step, skirting the wettest areas along slightly higher ground, before descending toward the Rivoleta River and continuing into the hills beyond. The journey takes three to four days for a careful party. The key precautions:

- **Travel by day.** Chulls are less active in sunlight, though not entirely dormant.
- **Avoid water.** The streams and pools are chull territory. Cross quickly when you must.
- **Watch for dens.** Chull burrows look like muddy holes; stepping near one invites attack.
- **Camp high.** Sleep on rocky outcrops above the waterline. Chulls don't climb well.
- **Don't linger.** The longer you're in the Chull Lands, the more likely you are to encounter something.

#### Harvesting

Despite the danger, the Chull Lands attract occasional hunting parties. Chull shells make excellent armor components—light, strong, and resistant to piercing. The claws are valued as trophies. The meat is reportedly edible, though few are willing to risk death for a meal.

Harvesting chulls is specialized work. Professional hunters know the territory, the chull behavior patterns, and the techniques for killing a creature that can survive most wounds. Amateur expeditions occasionally enter the Chull Lands seeking quick profit; some of them return.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Spawning Caves

A cave system in the northwestern Chull Lands where the creatures congregate to breed. The caves are absolutely off-limits during spawning season—hundreds of chulls in close proximity, all aggressive, all defending their young. Outside spawning season, the caves are merely extremely dangerous.

##### The Bone Marsh

A section of wetland in the southern Chull Lands where skeletal remains accumulate. The marsh is a feeding ground; the bones are what's left. Human bones are visible among the animal remains.

##### The Dry Ridge

A limestone ridge running east-west through the central Chull Lands, elevated enough above the waterline that chulls rarely venture there. The ridge is the safest route through the region and the site of the only regular camping spots. Competition for space on the ridge can be fierce during busy travel seasons.

An ancient forest, once home to the Dark Elves. Ancient dragon totems of bone and silver dot the forest. Unbeknownst to many, these totems hold the spirits of powerful dark elves. Rather than go to Celestia, powerful dark elven leaders preferred to remain on the material plane. Like daemons of Celestia, the spirits in these totems still have power. Unlike spirits of Celestia, they will not fade upon being forgotten. Those who find their true names are likely to be showered in power as thanks.

### Deception Creek

**Deception Creek** flows from the Hills of the Moon Goblins through the southern Foggy Mountains before disappearing into a sinkhole system several miles from the Shipwreck Coast. The name refers to the creek's frustrating habit of vanishing underground, reappearing miles away, and generally refusing to behave as water should.

#### Course (Such As It Is)

The creek originates in the Hills of the Moon Goblins, fed by springs that surface in the saddle between those hills and the main mass of the Foggy Mountains. The water is cold and clear at its source, with a faintly mineral taste that some find unpleasant.

From its source, Deception Creek flows southeast toward the coast—for about four miles. Then it vanishes into a limestone sinkhole, dropping into an underground system that riddles the eastern slopes. The creek reappears three miles to the south, surfaces for another two miles, vanishes again, and repeats this pattern at least twice more before its final disappearance into a cave system that presumably empties into the sea.

Travelers who try to follow the creek toward the coast invariably lose it. Those who try to follow it upstream fare no better. The underground stretches are not navigable—the caves flood completely during rain.

#### Why "Deception"?

The Dalizi named this creek after several expeditions attempted to use it as a route to the coast. Each time, the parties followed the water until it vanished, then tried to pick up its trail on the far side of the underground section. Each time, they found themselves somewhere other than where they expected—sometimes miles from where the creek should have resurfaced.

The current theory is that the underground system has multiple outlets, and the creek doesn't always emerge from the same one. Rain, seasonal variation, or underground rockfalls may redirect the flow. Whatever the cause, the creek cannot be trusted for navigation.

There's a Dalizi proverb: *"Trust the creek to find the sea, trust yourself to find the creek."* It means something like "everyone reaches the same destination eventually, but the path will deceive you."

#### The Sinkhole Country

The terrain around Deception Creek is riddled with sinkholes, caves, and sudden drops. The limestone bedrock has been dissolved over millennia into a maze of underground passages, some flooded, some dry, most unexplored. The surface terrain is deceptively solid—grass grows over thin crusts that can collapse under a traveler's weight.

Shepherds avoid this area entirely. The handful of explorers who have investigated the cave systems report extensive passages, underground pools, and evidence of habitation by something that leaves claw marks on the walls.

**GM Information:** The claw marks come from **cave crawlers**—eyeless, amphibious predators that evolved in the flooded cave systems. They're roughly dog-sized, with pale, smooth skin, powerful limbs ending in hooked claws, and jaws full of needle-like teeth. They hunt by vibration and scent, and they're well-adapted to the lightless, flooded tunnels.

Cave crawlers are territorial and aggressive, but they rarely venture far from water. They're the reason Deception Creek seems to vanish into "impassable" caves—the caves are physically navigable, but anything that enters is attacked. The creatures are too numerous and too well-suited to their environment to eliminate; expeditions that tried to push through the caves lost members to attacks from the water, the walls, and above.

The cave crawlers are not connected to the Vetharak civilization or the titan—they're simply ordinary predators that colonized the cave system and thrived. However, their presence may explain why the Moon Goblins don't expand in this direction despite their proximity; even dream-touched goblins don't want to fight cave crawlers in flooded tunnels.

### Elder Mountains

The **Elder Mountains** rise at the southeastern corner of the Dalizi Highlands, a weathered range of ancient stone that connects the Foggy Mountains to the coastal cliffs above the Shipwreck Coast. The mountains take their name from their geological age—these are among the oldest exposed formations in Aboyinzu, predating the upheavals that created the younger ranges to the west.

#### Geography

The Elder Mountains extend roughly forty miles from the Marrow Valley in the northeast to the coastal lowlands in the south. They're lower than the Foggy Mountains to the north—the highest peaks barely exceed 8,000 feet—but compensate with steepness. The slopes are severe, often exceeding 45 degrees, and the rock is fractured and unstable.

The range presents different faces to different directions. The eastern slopes drop sharply toward the Shipwreck Coast, forming the final barrier between the highlands and the sea. The western slopes descend more gradually toward the lowlands of the Dalizi Confederation. The northern face merges with the Foggy Mountains through the narrow passage of the Marrow Valley.

The rock is primarily granite and gneiss, heavily veined with quartz and marked by the distinctive red iron deposits that color the Marrow Creek. Erosion has carved the peaks into jagged profiles—the Elder Mountains look old, worn by time into shapes that younger ranges haven't yet achieved.

#### Character of the Range

The Elder Mountains are neither actively hostile like the Foggy Mountains nor merely inconvenient like the ranges farther west. They're simply empty—vast, quiet, and ancient, with an atmosphere that discourages human presence without any obvious threat.

Game is scarce. Water is limited, found only in scattered seeps and the upper reaches of Marrow Creek. The vegetation is sparse: wind-bent pines on the lower slopes, lichen and moss on the exposed heights, nothing at all on the upper peaks. The silence is notable—travelers report that sound seems to die quickly here, as if the old stone absorbs it.

The mountains are not entirely uninhabited. Something lives in the high places—something large enough to leave tracks in the snow, smart enough to avoid being seen. The bones that wash down Marrow Creek suggest it hunts, or perhaps scavenges. The Dalizi call it "the thing in the heights" and leave it at that.

##### The Truth (GM Information)

See [Marrow Valley](./Marrow%20Valley.md) for details on **the Shepherd**, the ancient creature that inhabits the high Elder Mountains and is responsible for the bones in the creek.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Iron Seeps

The red deposits that color Marrow Creek surface throughout the Elder Mountains, staining the rock in streaks of rust. In several locations, iron-rich water seeps from the rock face, creating pools with a blood-like appearance. The water is mineral-heavy but drinkable.

The Dalizi consider the Iron Seeps unlucky but not actively dangerous. They're used as landmarks by the few who travel this way.

##### The Plateau

The southern Elder Mountains flatten into a high plateau, roughly 4,000 feet in elevation, before dropping to the coastal lowlands. This plateau offers the only significant level ground in the range—a few square miles of exposed rock and thin soil. Nothing grows here; the wind is constant; the view extends to the Shipwreck Coast on clear days.

Someone built here, once. Foundations are visible in the rock, too weathered to identify their original form. The stonework is old—older than the Dalizi Confederation, older than recorded history in this region.

**GM Information:** These ruins are an outpost of the same pre-human civilization that built Vetharak and the other highland structures. This was a watching post—the Elder Mountains' elevation and eastern position made it ideal for observing the Shipwreck Coast and whatever might approach from the sea. The outpost was abandoned when the civilization collapsed, and the Shepherd may have been left here as a guardian, or may have simply moved in afterward.

##### The Eastern Cliffs

Where the Elder Mountains meet the Shipwreck Coast, the range ends in dramatic cliffs plunging hundreds of feet directly into the sea. These cliffs are visible from the coastal waters—the one landmark sailors use when avoiding this treacherous shore. They're called the Elder Teeth in maritime charts, for their jagged profile against the sky.

#### Historical Significance

The Elder Mountains were named by early Dalizi explorers who recognized the geological antiquity of the range. The name stuck, though it's acquired other meanings over time. The mountains feel old in a way that goes beyond mere rock—there's a weight to the silence, a sense that the range has been watching whatever passed through since before memory began.

The ruins on the plateau reinforce this feeling. Something existed here before the Dalizi, before anyone currently living. The mountains remember, even if no one else does.

### Foggy Mountains

The **Foggy Mountains** form the eastern anchor of the Dalizi Highlands' mountain wall, a range perpetually shrouded in mist that has never been fully explored. Rising to over 12,000 feet at their highest peaks, the mountains mark an absolute barrier between the Dalizi Confederation and the Shipwreck Coast—and hide secrets within their fog-wrapped valleys that few have survived to describe.

#### Geography

The Foggy Mountains extend roughly eighty miles east to west, from the Hills of Tharoz and Misty Valley in the northeast to the Marrow Valley in the southwest. The range joins the Elder Mountains at its southern end and connects to the broader Dalizi Highland chain through saddles and ridgelines to the west.

The mountains are steep and rugged, with sharp peaks and deep cirques carved by ancient glaciation. Most elevations exceed 8,000 feet; the highest peaks push past 12,000 feet. Snow persists on the upper slopes year-round, while the lower elevations are blanketed in the fog that gives the range its name.

The fog originates from the interaction between cold mountain air and warm, moist air from the coast. It's thickest along the eastern slopes, where visibility can drop to feet for days at a time. The western slopes are clearer, but fog can roll in without warning anywhere in the range.

#### Exploration History

The Foggy Mountains remain largely unexplored for a simple reason: explorers don't come back. Every expedition sent into the range's interior has either failed to return or emerged with fewer members than it entered with. The survivors report fog so thick they lost companions standing arm's reach away, terrain that seemed to shift overnight, and encounters with things they struggle to describe coherently.

The Dalizi Confederation has officially declared the mountains off-limits three times in recorded history. Each time, the prohibition eroded over decades as memory faded and treasure hunters grew bold. Each time, a new series of disappearances renewed the warnings.

What's known of the interior comes from the handful of survivors and from accounts that may be centuries old. These describe:

- **Hidden valleys** where the fog parts to reveal lush meadows, only to close in again and refuse to reveal the same valley twice
- **Ruins** of worked stone in styles that match no known culture, covered in carvings that hurt to look at directly
- **Sounds** that echo through the fog—voices, music, screaming—with no discernible source
- **Something large** that moves through the upper peaks, glimpsed only as shadows in the mist

**GM Information:** The Foggy Mountains were the heart of the Vetharak civilization's dream-harvesting operation. The interior is riddled with their facilities—refineries, storage vaults, ritual sites, and the infrastructure that channeled dream-energy throughout the highlands.

The phenomena explorers report are all side effects of this abandoned infrastructure:

- **The hidden valleys** are real places, but they exist partially in the titan's dream-space. Their locations shift based on dream-currents, making them impossible to find consistently. The lush meadows are sustained by residual dream-energy that promotes growth.
- **The ruins** are Vetharak facilities. The carvings "hurt to look at" because they're designed to interface with the dream-space—looking at them engages parts of the mind that shouldn't be activated while awake.
- **The sounds** are dream-echoes, moments from the titan's dreams bleeding into the physical world. The voices are the titan's half-formed thoughts; the music is something it remembers from before it slept; the screaming may be the trapped consciousness of Vetharak citizens who didn't escape the collapse.
- **The something large** is a dream-construct—a manifestation of the titan's sleeping awareness, given temporary physical form by the concentrated dream-energy. It's not truly alive, but it can interact with the physical world. It may be hostile, curious, or simply confused.

**The Fog Itself:** The perpetual fog isn't natural weather—it's a byproduct of the dream-energy concentration, manifesting as persistent moisture because the titan associates sleep with darkness and obscured vision. The fog is, in a sense, the titan's closed eyelids projected onto reality.

#### Hills of the Moon Goblins

A distinct range of hills rises within the southern Foggy Mountains, forming a saddle between the main peaks and the approaches to the Elder Mountains. These are the **Hills of the Moon Goblins**, named for their inhabitants.

The Moon Goblins are a subrace distinct from other goblin populations in Alaria. They're pale, nearly colorless, with oversized eyes adapted to the perpetual twilight of their foggy domain. They hunt by sound and smell rather than sight, and they're said to see perfectly well in conditions where humans are effectively blind.

The goblins claim the hills and the surrounding fog-shrouded slopes, raiding downhill into the valleys during certain seasons. They take livestock, supplies, and occasionally people—the latter presumably for labor, food, or worse. Relations with the Dalizi range from tense standoff to open warfare, depending on the year and the boldness of particular goblin bands.

Moon Goblins do not trade. They do not negotiate. Attempts at communication have universally failed, though whether this reflects inability to communicate or simple refusal remains debated.

#### Notable Features

##### Deception Creek

A waterway that rises in the Hills of the Moon Goblins and flows southeast toward the coast, vanishing underground repeatedly before presumably reaching the sea.

##### The Fog Line

An altitude—roughly 2,500 feet on the eastern slopes—above which fog coverage becomes nearly constant. Below the fog line, the mountains are merely difficult. Above it, they're actively hostile.

##### The Singing Peaks

Several of the highest peaks produce sounds in high winds—deep, resonant tones that carry for miles. The Dalizi call these the singing peaks and consider them ill-omened. Some scholars believe the sounds are natural, produced by wind moving through rock formations. Others note that the "singing" sometimes occurs on calm days.

### Fool's Pass

**Fool's Pass** is the only known crossing through the Thundering Mountains, a treacherous route that connects the Dalizi Highlands to the Wanderlands beyond. The name is simultaneously warning and description—only fools use this pass, but sometimes fools have no choice.

#### Geography

The pass cuts through the western Thundering Mountains, roughly twenty miles east of where the range meets the Titan Stairs. The route climbs from approximately 5,000 feet on the highland side to nearly 11,000 feet at the summit before descending to about 4,000 feet in the Wanderlands.

The pass is narrow throughout—rarely more than a hundred feet wide, often less. Sheer walls rise on both sides, channeling wind and funneling avalanches onto the route. The trail, such as it is, switchbacks up exposed faces, crosses unstable snowfields, and threads between rock formations that provide neither shelter nor stable footing.

The total distance is roughly twenty miles, but the terrain makes this a three to four day journey for fit travelers. Camp sites are limited to a few protected ledges; spending nights exposed on the route is dangerous.

#### Conditions

Fool's Pass is passable only during a brief summer window—roughly sixty days from mid-summer to early autumn. Outside this window, snow depth, avalanche risk, and extreme cold make the crossing effectively impossible.

Even during the passable season, conditions are severe:

- **Altitude.** The summit at 11,000 feet challenges unacclimated travelers with thin air and rapid exhaustion.
- **Weather.** Storms can develop without warning, reducing visibility to feet and making the already-difficult route deadly.
- **Avalanche.** Fresh snow on the surrounding peaks threatens to bury the route. Major avalanches have swept the pass clean, taking everything with them.
- **Rockfall.** The walls shed debris regularly. Travelers learn to listen for the sound of stone on stone above them.

The route has no water sources. Travelers must carry everything they need or melt snow.

#### Why "Fool's Pass"?

The name dates to the earliest Dalizi exploration of the range. The expedition that discovered the route lost half its members to the crossing. The survivors reported that only a fool would attempt it—and only a fool would need to.

The name stuck because it accurately describes who uses the pass:

- **Fugitives** — People fleeing justice, debts, or enemies who would rather face the mountains than what pursues them
- **Exiles** — Those expelled from Dalizi territory who have nowhere else to go
- **Adventurers** — Treasure hunters and glory seekers convinced that the Wanderlands hold something worth dying for
- **Scholars** — Researchers investigating the Dragonsong, the Dragon's Gate, or other Wanderlands mysteries
- **The desperate** — People with reasons they don't discuss

Commercial traffic is essentially nonexistent. There's nothing in the Wanderlands worth the cost and risk of the crossing. The few who use the pass are traveling for personal reasons, not profit.

#### What Awaits

Those who survive Fool's Pass emerge in the southern Wanderlands, specifically the approaches to the Dragonsong forest. This is not an improvement in safety.

The Dragonsong is the domain of the dragon Ziru, who tolerates no intrusion near the Dragon's Gate. The Wanderlands beyond are cursed, empty, and dangerous. There are no settlements, no supplies, no help.

Travelers who cross Fool's Pass had better have a plan for what comes next, because there's nothing waiting for them except more wilderness and the dragon's attention.

#### The Guardians

Several ruined structures stand at the highland approach to Fool's Pass, apparently the remains of guard posts or waypoints. The architecture is old and unfamiliar—not Dalizi construction. Someone once maintained a presence here, controlling access to the pass.

The ruins are empty now. Whatever authority once guarded the pass is long gone. The stones remain, slowly crumbling, a reminder that someone once thought this route worth protecting—or worth blocking.

**GM Information:** These structures were the Vetharak civilization's primary border fortification against whatever lay north of the mountains. The builders knew the Wanderlands were dangerous—possibly they knew about the dragon, possibly about something worse—and maintained a permanent garrison here.

The garrison's purpose was not to stop travelers from leaving (though they tracked departures) but to stop things from entering. The fortifications are designed to defend against something coming *down* the pass, not up it. This implies the Vetharak civilization feared intrusion from the north more than anything in their own territory.

What they feared may have been the dragon's predecessor, or it may have been something else entirely—something the Dragon's Gate was built to contain. The dragon Ziru guards the Gate now; perhaps the Vetharak civilization guarded it before, and these ruins are the southern anchor of that defense.

#### Statistics

Crossing rates are not officially tracked, but estimates suggest:

- Roughly 20-30 individuals attempt the pass each year during the summer window
- Approximately half complete the crossing successfully
- Of those who fail, some turn back; others die
- Very few who cross ever return through the pass

The Dalizi Confederation maintains no presence at the pass. Anyone who wants to use it is free to try. Anyone who dies in the attempt is left where they fall.

### Hills of False Rubies

The **Hills of False Rubies** rise at the western edge of the Jackal Mountains, a cluster of red-tinted terrain that has attracted and ruined treasure hunters for generations. The hills are named for their abundance of crystals that look remarkably like rubies—and are worth nothing.

#### Geography

The Hills of False Rubies occupy roughly fifteen square miles at the point where the Jackal Mountains descend toward the Chull Lands. The terrain is lower than the main peaks—most elevations fall between 4,000 and 6,000 feet—but still rugged, with steep ravines and exposed rock faces.

The distinctive red coloration comes from iron oxides in the bedrock, which stain the soil and rock surfaces in shades ranging from rust to deep crimson. In certain light, the entire hillside seems to glow red. Crystals of various sizes protrude from exposed rock faces, catching the light in ways that look remarkably valuable.

The crystals are quartz, colored by iron impurities. They're attractive enough for jewelry but worthless as gemstones. A trained eye can spot the difference immediately; untrained eyes have been fooled often enough to give the hills their name.

#### History of Exploitation

The Hills of False Rubies have attracted would-be miners since the Dalizi Confederation first expanded into the region. The first expeditions returned with carts full of "rubies" and tales of wealth beyond imagining. The subsequent collapse, when merchants examined the haul and pronounced it worthless, bankrupted several prominent families.

Each generation, it seems, must learn the lesson again. Someone discovers the hills, sees the crystals, and becomes convinced that the previous failures must have missed the real deposits. They organize an expedition, invest heavily, and return with the same worthless quartz. The hills don't contain rubies. They never did.

The most recent significant venture was the Kerikos Mining Company's 3,341 SD expedition, which spent three years systematically excavating the hills. They found iron deposits (too remote to be profitable), copper traces (too scattered to mine), and hundreds of pounds of false rubies. The company dissolved; its investors lost everything.

#### Current Status

The hills are effectively abandoned. The mining attempts left scars on the landscape—abandoned shafts, rusting equipment, collapsed tunnels—but nature is slowly reclaiming them. The few travelers who pass through the hills do so on their way somewhere else.

Locals use the false rubies for decoration, since the crystals are attractive even if valueless. Children in the nearby Dalizi states sometimes collect them as curiosities. Merchants in distant markets occasionally encounter "Dalizi rubies" being sold to the gullible—the scam is old enough that most buyers know better.

#### The Persistence of Hope

Despite the well-documented failures, someone always believes. Perhaps the previous expeditions looked in the wrong places. Perhaps real rubies lie just below where the false ones surface. Perhaps the stories of worthlessness are deliberate misdirection, spread by those who want to keep the real wealth hidden.

The hills attract occasional prospectors even now, individuals convinced they'll succeed where companies failed. Most leave disappointed. Some don't leave at all—the hills are home to dire jackals ranging from the Jackal Mountains, and the terrain offers plenty of places to fall or become lost.

#### The Hills of Meus

Southwest of the False Rubies, the terrain transitions into the Hills of Meus, a somewhat gentler landscape that marks the boundary between the Jackal Mountains system and the Cerulean Crests. The Hills of Meus are unremarkable—grassy slopes with occasional rock outcrops—but they offer the easiest passage between the central highlands and the Rivoleta River valley.

### Hills of Meus

The **Hills of Meus** are a transitional zone between the Cerulean Crests and the central Dalizi Highlands, a region of rolling terrain that provides the easiest walking in an otherwise difficult landscape. The hills are named for Meus, a legendary Dalizi prospector whose fate became a cautionary tale about highland wealth.

#### Geography

The Hills of Meus cover roughly forty square miles between the northern Cerulean Crests and the southern slopes of the Jackal Mountains. The terrain is gentler than anywhere else in the highlands—rolling grassland with scattered rock outcrops, elevations between 4,000 and 6,000 feet, and slopes manageable without climbing.

The Rivoleta River cuts through the eastern hills, providing reliable water along a corridor that sees most of the traffic through the region. The western hills are drier, with water available only from scattered springs.

The vegetation is primarily grass and low shrubs, with occasional stands of pine in protected valleys. The soil is thin but present—a luxury in the rocky highlands. During summer, the hills are almost pleasant: green grass, moderate temperatures, and visibility that extends for miles.

#### The Legend of Meus

According to Dalizi tradition, Meus was a prospector from the lowland state of Kagoro who explored the Cerulean Crests three centuries ago. He allegedly found a deposit of pure copper—not ore requiring smelting, but native copper in sheets and nuggets, easily extracted and immensely valuable.

Meus returned to the lowlands with samples and organized an expedition to exploit his find. The expedition entered the hills that now bear his name and was never seen again. Subsequent searches found no trace of Meus, his party, or the copper deposit.

Theories about Meus's fate include:

- **Lost in the highlands** — The expedition died of exposure, starvation, or accident, and the bodies were never found
- **Killed by rivals** — Someone learned of the find and eliminated the competition
- **Killed by something else** — The highlands have many dangers; Meus may have encountered one
- **The deposit was cursed** — Some Dalizi believe Meus found something he shouldn't have

The legend has inspired centuries of prospectors to search the Hills of Meus and the surrounding Cerulean Crests. None have found Meus's deposit. Many have found their own graves.

**GM Information:** Meus was real, and he did find a copper deposit—but it wasn't natural copper. He stumbled upon one of the Vetharak civilization's abandoned mining sites, where they had extracted copper for their dream-channeling infrastructure. The "sheets and nuggets" he found were refined copper left behind when the site was abandoned.

The site is real and still exists, buried under centuries of sediment in a narrow canyon in the eastern Cerulean Crests. What Meus didn't realize—and what killed his expedition—is that the site is also a dream-node, and the refined copper is saturated with the titan's dream-energy. Extended exposure causes vivid hallucinations, disorientation, and eventually a waking dream-state from which victims don't return. Meus and his expedition are still there, in a sense—their bodies died of exposure while their minds wandered the titan's dreams.

**Plot hook:** Finding the Meus deposit would give access to dream-touched copper, which could be valuable for certain magical applications—or could be used to deliberately enter the titan's dream-space. The deposit is also evidence of the Vetharak civilization's presence, potentially leading to Vetharak proper.

#### Current Status

The Hills of Meus are technically unclaimed, like most of the Dalizi Highlands. No state has extended formal authority here, and no permanent population exists. The hills are used by:

- **Travelers** — Anyone moving between the Chull Lands, the Cerulean Crests, and the eastern highlands
- **Shepherds** — Occasional grazing during summer months, though the distance from the lowlands limits this
- **Prospectors** — Optimists still searching for Meus's copper
- **Hunters** — The hills support modest game populations

The lack of major hazards makes the Hills of Meus a relative haven. There are no chulls (too dry), no Moon Goblins (too far from the Foggy Mountains), and no ogres (too distant from the Troyan range). Dire jackals range through occasionally, and the usual highland hazards—weather, terrain, isolation—apply, but the hills are safer than most highland areas.

#### Strategic Value

The Hills of Meus occupy a central position in the western Dalizi Highlands, providing relatively easy movement between the major terrain features. Control of the hills would allow monitoring of traffic between the Titan Stairs, the Chull Lands, the Cerulean Crests, and the approaches to the Jackal Mountains.

No one has bothered. The traffic isn't valuable enough to justify establishing a presence, and maintaining any outpost in the highlands would be expensive. The hills remain a through-route, not a destination.

Several Dalizi states have discussed building a waystation in the Hills of Meus—a protected stopping point for highland travelers. The proposals never advance far. The cost would be shared among many states, the benefit would accrue mainly to merchants and adventurers, and the political complexities of joint ventures in unclaimed territory make negotiation difficult.

### Hills of Tharoz

The **Hills of Tharoz** mark the northeastern approach to the Foggy Mountains, a rumpled expanse of wind-scoured ridges and shallow valleys that separates the Dragonsong forests of the Wanderlands from the higher peaks to the south. The hills take their name from Tharoz the Unbowed, a Dalizi war-chief who led a doomed expedition into the Wanderlands three centuries ago and was last seen alive crossing these heights.

#### Geography

The Hills of Tharoz occupy roughly forty miles of transitional terrain between the forested lowlands of the Wanderlands and the perpetually fog-shrouded slopes of the Foggy Mountains. The hills themselves are granite-cored, with thin soil supporting sparse grass and hardy shrubs. Exposed rock is common, weathered into strange shapes by the constant winds that funnel between the Dragonsong and the mountain wall.

Elevations range from 800 feet in the northern valleys to over 3,000 feet where the hills merge with the Foggy Mountains proper. The terrain is not technically difficult—no cliffs, few truly steep slopes—but the lack of landmarks and the persistent wind make navigation challenging. Travelers report that distances seem longer here than they should be.

#### The Winds

The hills channel wind from the Wanderlands plains into the gap between the Dragonsong forest and the mountains. This creates a near-constant airflow that varies from a stiff breeze to genuinely dangerous gusts. The wind carries sound unpredictably—sometimes voices carry for miles, sometimes they're swallowed within feet.

Old shepherds claim the wind "talks" in the Hills of Tharoz. Most attribute this to the sound of air moving through rock formations, but the phenomenon is unsettling regardless. The wind occasionally carries the scent of the Dragonsong—pine, old growth, and something else that makes horses nervous.

#### The Expedition of Tharoz

In the year 3,071 SD, the war-chief Tharoz of the Dalizi state of Kagoro assembled a force of three hundred warriors to cross the highlands and investigate reports of rich hunting grounds beyond. The expedition was meant to establish whether expansion north was feasible.

They crossed the hills that now bear Tharoz's name in early summer. A runner returned two weeks later, half-mad with thirst, reporting that the force had entered the Wanderlands and encountered "something in the forest that sang." No other survivors emerged.

The Dalizi made no further attempts to expand north. The hills became a boundary marker—the point beyond which sensible people do not go.

#### Current Status

The Hills of Tharoz remain unclaimed by any Dalizi state. Shepherds from Kagoro and neighboring states occasionally graze flocks in the southern reaches during summer months, but none stay overnight. The northern hills, closest to the Wanderlands, are avoided entirely.

The hills serve primarily as a landmark—visible from much of the eastern Dalizi Highlands, they mark the edge of known territory. Travelers heading east toward the Misty Valley or Banesnap Hills use them for navigation, though none approach closely.

### Hills of the Moon Goblins

The **Hills of the Moon Goblins** occupy a saddle within the southern Foggy Mountains, a territory claimed by one of Alaria's most reclusive and hostile goblin subraces. The hills mark the only relatively accessible terrain within the Foggy Mountains—which makes them the only place the Moon Goblins regularly encounter outsiders, always violently.

#### Geography

The hills form a distinct subrange within the larger Foggy Mountains, covering roughly thirty square miles between the main peaks and the approaches to the Elder Mountains. Elevations range from 3,000 to 5,000 feet—lower than the surrounding mountains but still firmly within the fog line that blankets the range.

The terrain is broken and irregular, with numerous narrow valleys, box canyons, and dead-end ravines. Rocky outcrops and cave systems riddle the hills, providing natural shelter and concealment. Visibility is poor even by Foggy Mountains standards; the hills seem to trap fog in pockets that never fully clear.

Deception Creek rises from springs in the eastern hills, gathering water before beginning its unreliable journey toward the coast.

#### The Moon Goblins

The inhabitants of these hills are a goblin subrace found nowhere else in Alaria. They're smaller than most goblins, rarely exceeding three feet in height, with pale skin that appears almost translucent in certain light. Their eyes are enormous—black pools that take up much of their faces—adapted to the perpetual dimness of their fog-shrouded home.

Moon Goblins hunt primarily by sound and scent. They move through fog that would blind a human as easily as clear terrain, and they can track prey by the sound of breathing from dozens of yards away. Their hearing is acute enough to detect a heartbeat in a quiet space.

##### Behavior

Moon Goblins do not trade, negotiate, or communicate meaningfully with outsiders. Whether they possess language at all remains unknown—they make sounds, clicks and whistles and keening calls, but no pattern has been decoded. Attempts to establish contact have resulted in dead emissaries.

They raid downhill into the Marrow Valley and surrounding lowlands during what the Dalizi call the "goblin seasons"—periods of several weeks, roughly twice per year, when Moon Goblin activity surges. They take livestock, pack animals, supplies, and occasionally people. Captives are not seen again.

The raids appear organized, suggesting some form of social structure, but no one has observed Moon Goblin society directly. Survivors of encounters describe groups of a dozen or fewer acting in apparent coordination, using the fog for concealment and striking from multiple directions simultaneously.

##### Defenses

The Moon Goblins have made their hills effectively impassable. The cave systems throughout the terrain are trapped and guarded. The approaches are studded with alarm devices—bones and shells strung on cord, triggers that release rockfalls, hollows that amplify footsteps. Moving through Moon Goblin territory undetected appears to be impossible.

Whether the goblins are defending territory, protecting something specific, or simply hostile by nature remains unclear. The few expeditions that pushed into the hills despite resistance found nothing but death.

#### The Deeper Questions

Scholars have long debated the Moon Goblins' origins. They share some physical characteristics with other goblin subraces but differ in significant ways—their coloration, their apparent lack of speech, their extreme hostility.

**GM Information:** The Moon Goblins are the descendants of a goblin tribe that was enslaved by the Vetharak civilization to work in the fog-shrouded mountains. The Vetharak used them as laborers in areas too dangerous or uncomfortable for their own people—specifically, in the high-altitude facilities where dream-energy was harvested and processed.

Generations of exposure to concentrated dream-energy transformed the goblins. Their eyes enlarged to navigate the perpetual twilight; their skin paled as they spent decades underground; their language atrophied as they communicated increasingly through the shared dream-space rather than speech. By the time the Vetharak civilization collapsed, the Moon Goblins were no longer capable of living in normal conditions.

When their masters vanished, the Moon Goblins claimed the hills as their own. They still maintain some of the old facilities—the trapped cave systems and alarm devices aren't goblin innovation; they're maintained Vetharak security systems the goblins inherited. The goblins may not understand the systems fully, but they know how to use them.

**What are they guarding?** The Moon Goblins' extreme hostility isn't random—they're protecting a dream-harvest station in the deepest part of their territory. The station still functions, drawing power from the titan's dreams and concentrating it in crystallized form. The goblins consume small amounts of these dream-crystals, which is what allows them to share consciousness and coordinate without speech. They attack intruders to prevent anyone from discovering (and potentially disrupting) their supply.

**Plot hook:** Dream-crystals would be immensely valuable to certain magical practitioners. The Moon Goblins can potentially be negotiated with if someone figures out their communication method (shared dreaming), but they'll defend the harvest station to the death.

### Jackal Mountains

The **Jackal Mountains** form the central spine of the Dalizi Highlands, a vast wall of stone that separates the eastern ranges from the western approaches to the Dalizi Confederation. Named for the packs of dire jackals that hunt the lower slopes, the mountains are the largest single range in the highlands and the primary reason no roads cross from east to west.

#### Geography

The Jackal Mountains stretch roughly one hundred miles from the Foggy Mountains in the east to the Titan Stairs in the west, with an average width of thirty miles. The range runs roughly east-west, forming an almost continuous barrier of peaks exceeding 10,000 feet. The highest summit—unnamed on any map—reaches approximately 14,000 feet.

The mountains are young by geological standards, their peaks still sharp and unweathered. The slopes are steep and unstable, prone to rockfall in summer and avalanche in winter. Snow covers the upper elevations year-round; glaciers occupy the highest cirques. The rock is primarily granite, dark gray and iron-hard.

The range has no passes. Travelers who need to cross the Dalizi Highlands must go around the Jackal Mountains, either through the Marrow Valley to the east or through the Chull Lands and Titan Stairs to the west. Both routes add days to any journey; both are dangerous for their own reasons.

#### The Dire Jackals

The mountains' namesake inhabitants are significantly larger than common jackals—adults stand three feet at the shoulder and can weigh over a hundred pounds. They hunt in coordinated packs of ten to twenty individuals, using tactics that suggest unsettling intelligence.

Dire jackals prey primarily on the mountain goats and deer that graze the lower slopes, but they're opportunistic. They'll take livestock, pack animals, or humans if the opportunity presents itself. They've learned to ambush travelers at narrow points along game trails, cutting off retreat while the pack closes in.

The jackals are most active at dawn and dusk, their yipping calls echoing through the valleys. Experienced travelers know to be inside shelter by dusk and to wait until full light before moving. The space between is jackal time.

#### Interior Terrain

Few have penetrated deep into the Jackal Mountains, and those who have describe a landscape of vertical rock and hidden valleys. The range is riddled with box canyons that lead nowhere, cliffs that appear climbable until halfway up, and slopes that look gentle from a distance but prove impassable up close.

Water is scarce on the surface but abundant underground. Springs emerge from the rock at scattered points, their locations known only to those who've explored extensively. The vegetation is alpine meadow in the lower valleys, bare rock and ice above.

##### The Rattlespit Hills

A cluster of lower hills rises within the northern Jackal Mountains, forming a transitional zone between the main peaks and the approaches to the Thundering Mountains. These are the Rattlespit Hills, named for the venomous rattlespit serpents that infest the rocky terrain.

##### The Hills of False Rubies

At the western edge of the Jackal Mountains, a cluster of red-tinted hills has attracted and disappointed treasure hunters for generations. The hills are rich in red crystals that look remarkably like rubies—until examination reveals them as worthless quartz colored by iron impurities.

#### The Central Mystery

The heart of the Jackal Mountains has never been mapped. The few expeditions that pushed past the outer slopes and the jackal packs reported finding strange features: carved stone that predates any known civilization, cave mouths that exhale warm air, valleys where the snow melts despite the altitude.

One expedition—the Muyinba Survey of 3,287 SD—claimed to have found a city built into the mountainside, its windows glowing with light despite apparent abandonment. The expedition returned with three survivors out of twelve, none of whom could lead anyone back to what they'd seen. Subsequent expeditions found nothing.

The Dalizi don't explore the Jackal Mountains. They go around them, and they encourage others to do the same.

##### The Truth (GM Information)

The glowing city is real. It's called **Vetharak**, and it was built by the same civilization that constructed the ruins throughout the Dalizi Highlands—a pre-human culture that understood the titan sleeping beneath the Thundering Mountains and built their society around managing its dreams.

Vetharak still functions because it's powered by the titan's dream-energy, channeled through leyline conduits that the builders installed. The city maintains itself: lights glow, doors open and close, mechanisms operate. But no living inhabitants remain. The original population either died, fled, or transformed into something else when their civilization collapsed.

**What happened to them (choose one or combine):**
- **The Hollow Ones**: The inhabitants didn't die—they became the city. Their consciousness merged with Vetharak's systems during a magical catastrophe, and they now exist as the city's animating intelligence. They're not hostile, but they're no longer human in any meaningful sense. The city "remembers" visitors and may try to absorb them into itself.
- **The Ascended**: The inhabitants achieved a form of transcendence, shedding physical form to exist as pure thought within the titan's dream. They're still there, in a sense, but they've forgotten how to interact with material beings.
- **The Fled**: The inhabitants saw what was coming—some catastrophe, some prophecy—and abandoned Vetharak before it arrived. The city runs on automatic, waiting for masters who will never return. The catastrophe they fled may still be pending.

**Why can't anyone find it twice?** The city exists partially within the titan's dream-space. Its location shifts based on the titan's sleeping thoughts. To find Vetharak reliably, one would need to understand the titan's dream-patterns—or enter the dream directly.

The warm cave mouths and snowless valleys are side effects of Vetharak's power systems, venting heat from processes that have run continuously for millennia.

### Marrow Valley

The **Marrow Valley** cuts through the southwestern Foggy Mountains, a narrow defile that connects the Elder Mountains to the central highlands. The valley takes its name from Marrow Creek, which runs red with iron-rich sediment during spring melt—and from the bones that occasionally wash down with the seasonal floods.

#### Geography

The Marrow Valley runs roughly northeast to southwest for thirty miles, connecting the Elder Mountains plateau to the gap between the Foggy Mountains and Jackal Mountains. The valley floor is narrow—rarely more than a mile wide—with steep walls rising 2,000 to 3,000 feet on either side.

Marrow Creek occupies the valley bottom, a fast-moving stream that drops nearly 1,500 feet over its course. The creek has carved the valley deeper over millennia, leaving a V-shaped profile with unstable slopes prone to rockfall. The valley floor is boulder-strewn, the debris of countless slides.

Vegetation is sparse. The valley walls are too steep for most plants to gain purchase, and the valley floor floods too regularly for trees to establish. Scrub grass and hardy moss cling to the rocks; little else survives.

#### The Red Water

Marrow Creek runs clear for most of the year, but during spring snowmelt, the water turns a deep rust-red. The color comes from iron-rich deposits in the Elder Mountains—natural erosion, nothing more—but the effect is striking. From a distance, the creek appears to be running with blood.

The red water carries a slightly metallic taste but is safe to drink. Local shepherds have known this for generations, but travelers often refuse to trust water that looks so unnatural. Some maintain the red color is a warning, that the water carries contamination from something in the Elder Mountains. The shepherds find this superstition amusing.

#### The Bones

More concerning than the water's color is its occasional cargo. Spring floods in the Marrow Valley carry debris down from the Elder Mountains—rocks, sediment, uprooted vegetation, and bones. Animal bones, mostly: mountain goats, deer, the occasional predator. But also, unmistakably, human bones.

No one lives in the Elder Mountains. No one claims to, at least. Yet bones appear in the creek every few years, tumbled smooth by their journey down the rapids, bleached by sun and water. Most are fragmentary—a femur here, a skull there—but occasionally more complete remains appear.

The Dalizi have theories. Some blame the Moon Goblins, suggesting the goblins dump their dead (or their meals) into the creek's headwaters. Others point to travelers who disappeared in the mountains, their remains only now washing free. A few speak of older inhabitants, of something in the Elder Mountains that predates human memory.

The bones are generally left where they're found. Disturbing them is considered bad luck.

##### The Truth (GM Information)

The bones come from **the Shepherd**—a massive, ancient creature that lairs in the high Elder Mountains. The Shepherd is a remnant of the Second Eon, possibly related to the sleeping titan beneath the Thundering Mountains. It resembles a vast, gaunt humanoid with elongated limbs, standing perhaps forty feet tall, with skin like weatherite stone and eyes that reflect no light.

The Shepherd is not aggressive by nature. It's a scavenger and opportunistic predator that has survived by being patient and avoiding notice. It hunts by waiting—sometimes for years—until prey wanders close enough to catch. It doesn't pursue; it simply exists in the high places, and eventually something dies near it.

The bones in Marrow Creek are the Shepherd's refuse. It drags kills back to its lair, consumes what it wants, and discards the rest into the creek's headwaters. The human bones are from travelers who ventured too high—explorers, lost shepherds, the occasional fugitive seeking refuge in the mountains. The Shepherd didn't hunt them specifically; they simply came within reach.

**The Shepherd's behavior:**
- It moves primarily at night or during storms, when visibility is poor
- It can remain motionless for weeks, resembling a rock formation
- It's intelligent enough to recognize threats and avoid them
- It has no interest in descending to lower elevations where humans are common
- It may have some connection to the titan's dreams, explaining its unnatural longevity

**Plot hooks:** The Shepherd could be a threat if players venture into the high Elder Mountains, a source of Second Eon lore if approached carefully, or evidence of something larger—perhaps it serves a purpose, standing watch over something in the mountains that must not be disturbed.

#### Travel and Use

The Marrow Valley is the most practical route between the eastern and western sections of the Dalizi Highlands—which is to say, it's merely difficult rather than impossible. The terrain is challenging but passable for determined travelers on foot. Pack animals can manage with care, though rockfall is always a risk.

No permanent trail exists. The seasonal floods rearrange the boulder fields regularly, and what was a clear path one year may be blocked the next. Travelers through the valley typically take two to three days, camping on high ground away from the creek.

The valley sees light traffic: the occasional merchant shortcutting between Dalizi states, hunters pursuing game into the highlands, and scholars investigating the bone mystery. No one lingers.

### Misty Valley

The **Misty Valley** occupies a low-lying basin at the northeastern corner of the Dalizi Highlands, where the Foggy Mountains give way to the sea. Fed by the Strangle River and perpetually shrouded in fog that spills down from the heights, the valley is the only place along the Shipwreck Coast where the terrain permits anything resembling level ground—though no one has been fool enough to settle it.

#### Geography

The valley stretches roughly twenty miles inland from the coast, wedged between the Hills of Tharoz to the north and the Banesnap Hills to the south. At its widest, the valley floor spans perhaps five miles; at its narrowest, where the Strangle River cuts through to the sea, less than half a mile.

The terrain is low and wet. The Strangle River meanders through the center, its course choked with the strangling vines that give it its name, while countless smaller streams and seeps drain the surrounding slopes. Standing water is common after rain. The soil—where soil exists rather than waterlogged peat—is dark and organic, built up over millennia from decaying vegetation.

Elevation rises gradually from the coastal cliffs (roughly 200 feet) to the valley's western end (roughly 800 feet), where the terrain steepens sharply into the Foggy Mountains proper.

#### The Fog

The valley earns its name honestly. Cold air draining from the Foggy Mountains meets warm, moisture-laden air from the sea, producing fog that blankets the basin on roughly two hundred days per year. The fog is thickest in morning and evening but can persist throughout the day during certain seasons.

Visibility in heavy fog drops to twenty feet or less. The fog muffles sound, making distance difficult to judge. Navigation without landmarks—and there are few—becomes nearly impossible. Travelers who enter the valley in clear weather may find themselves trapped when fog rolls in.

The fog has a distinctive smell: wet vegetation, salt from the sea, and something faintly organic that longtime visitors attribute to the peat bogs.

#### Why No One Lives Here

The Misty Valley offers level ground, fresh water, apparently fertile soil, and access to the sea. By every practical measure, it should support settlement. It does not, for three reasons:

**The floods.** Heavy rain in the Foggy Mountains sends water cascading down into the valley faster than the Strangle can drain it. Flash floods scour the valley floor several times per year, carrying away anything not anchored to bedrock.

**The isolation.** The valley connects to nothing. The Banesnap Hills block the route south. The Hills of Tharoz guard the north, with the dragon-haunted Wanderlands beyond. The Foggy Mountains wall off the west. The only exit is the sea—and the Shipwreck Coast makes that exit theoretical.

**The things in the fog.** Travelers report encounters in the fog—shapes that move wrong, sounds that have no source, the sensation of being followed by something that stays just out of sight.

**GM Information:** The encounters are real, and they're caused by three distinct sources:

1. **Moon Goblin scouts** do range down from the Foggy Mountains occasionally, following the fog that gives them cover. They observe but rarely attack in the valley—it's too far from their territory, and the terrain doesn't favor their ambush tactics.

2. **Dream-echoes** from the Foggy Mountains bleed into the valley when the fog is thick. These are harmless but unsettling—shapes that aren't quite there, sounds from dreams that aren't the observer's. The proximity of the titan's dream-space creates these phenomena.

3. **A small population of bog spirits** inhabits the peat marshes. These are minor fey creatures—not powerful, but territorial about their wetlands. They create illusions to lead travelers astray, steal small objects, and generally make themselves nuisances. They're not dangerous unless someone tries to drain or settle their marsh.

The combination of all three creates the valley's reputation. On any given foggy day, a traveler might encounter one, two, or all three phenomena without ever being sure what's real.

#### The Drowned Road

Old maps show a trail called the Drowned Road running the length of the valley, connecting the coast to a pass into the Foggy Mountains. The trail may have existed once; no trace remains now. Floods have erased any worked stone or graded path that might have marked the route.

Some scholars argue the Drowned Road never existed—that it was a cartographer's fantasy or a deliberate deception to lure settlers into a death trap. Others believe it represents a route from an earlier age, before the climate shifted or the Strangle River changed its course.

Treasure hunters occasionally search for the Road, reasoning that any trail worth mapping must have led somewhere worth reaching.

**GM Information:** The Drowned Road was real, and it was built by the Vetharak civilization as a supply route to a now-submerged coastal facility. The facility was constructed to observe (and possibly interact with) whatever lies beneath the Shipwreck Coast—the Vetharak believed something significant rested on the seafloor, and they built this road to access it.

The road was deliberately destroyed during the civilization's collapse, its stones scattered and its route flooded. This wasn't erosion; it was demolition. Whatever the coastal facility was monitoring, the Vetharak decided it was better that no one reach it.

**Plot hook:** The coastal facility still exists, partially submerged at the base of the sea cliffs. It contains records of what the Vetharak were watching—and possibly a way to reach it. The something in the sea may be connected to the titan, to the Dragon's Gate, or to something else entirely.

### Nikpato

Tags: state, elector, border circle

The most anxious state in the Dalizi Confederation. Nikpato sits at the northern frontier, directly in the path of every invasion, raid, and refugee wave from Central Aboyinzu. It's been conquered three times in the last century. Its borders have shifted with every generation. Its people have learned that survival means backing the winning side—and they're terrified of backing the loser in the coming succession.

Nikpato holds an Elector seat, which gives it influence wildly disproportionate to its actual power. Every succession crisis sees the other Electors courting Nikpato's vote with promises of protection, aid, and favorable treaties. Nikpato's rulers have learned to extract maximum concessions for their support—and to be very, very careful about who they commit to.

The current ruler, **Prince-Elector Ndaba**, is a nervous man in his fifties who has spent his entire reign preparing for catastrophe. He's fortified every town, stockpiled every granary, maintained diplomatic ties with every potential ally. He knows the next crisis is coming. He just doesn't know from which direction.

He should be looking north.

#### Geography

Nikpato occupies the northwestern Dalizi Confederation, where the savanna of Central Aboyinzu transitions into the Dalizi highlands. The terrain is rolling grassland—good for farming, terrible for defense. No mountains, no major rivers, no natural barriers to slow an invading army.

The state's only geographic advantage is its central position within the Border Circle. Invasions from the north must pass through Nikpato to reach the Confederation's heart—which means the other states have strong incentives to help defend it. At least in theory.

In practice, Confederate "help" arrives late, underfunded, and often comes with political strings. Nikpato has learned not to rely on allies.

#### History of Vulnerability

**The First Conquest** (3289 SD)

A Terrenia warlord swept south with 8,000 cavalry, smashing Nikpato's army in open battle and occupying the capital for two years. Confederate forces eventually drove him out, but Nikpato's population had already been subjected to occupation, taxation, and "recruitment" that left a generation of young men dead in Terrenia's internal wars.

**The Second Conquest** (3341 SD)

A coalition of Central Aboyinzu states invaded during a Confederate succession crisis. No help came—the Confederation was too busy fighting itself. Nikpato surrendered after six months of siege, paid ruinous tribute for five years, and emerged impoverished and traumatized.

**The Third Conquest** (3358 SD)

Raiders from the Deadloop region—pirates turned land-army—swept through Nikpato's western territories, burning towns and taking slaves. The Confederate response was adequate this time, but arrived too late to prevent significant damage.

These experiences have shaped Nikpato's character. The state expects catastrophe. It plans for catastrophe. It sees potential threats everywhere—and it's right to.

#### Government

**The Prince-Elector**

Nikpato's ruler holds the title Prince-Elector, emphasizing the state's voting power in Confederate politics. The current Prince-Elector, **Ndaba the Cautious**, earned his epithet honestly. He's survived thirty years of rule by never committing to anything until the outcome was certain.

Ndaba's court is dominated by military advisors and spymasters. The state's limited resources go first to defense, second to intelligence, third to diplomatic gifts. Culture, education, and public works receive whatever's left—which isn't much.

**The Border Council**

A body of regional governors responsible for the state's extensive frontier. Each governor maintains local militia, watches for threats, and reports to the capital. The system works well for detecting and responding to raids. It would be insufficient against a real army.

#### Culture

**Survivor Mentality**

Nikpato's people expect hard times. They stockpile food, maintain family escape plans, and teach their children to hide when strangers come. Optimism is considered naive; pessimism is considered prudent. The most respected members of society are those who've survived previous catastrophes and can teach others how to do the same.

This culture produces excellent soldiers—patient, disciplined, accustomed to hardship—but terrible morale in peacetime. Nikpato's population is smaller than it should be; young people leave for states where the future feels less grim.

**The Ancestors' Way**

Nikpato follows the Ancestors' Way faith, with particular emphasis on protective spirits. Every household maintains elaborate ancestor shrines, consulted before any significant decision. The state's military traditions include extensive pre-battle rituals asking ancestral guidance and protection.

The Temple of Names maintains a significant presence here, keeping genealogical records that help families prove claims after conquest and occupation scatter populations. The Temple's local branch is pragmatic rather than theological—they've learned that their primary value is helping people put their lives back together.

**Hospitality Protocols**

Nikpato's frequent invasions have produced elaborate hospitality customs. Visitors must be fed and housed, but also identified, questioned, and reported to local authorities. Innkeepers serve as informal intelligence officers. Travelers find Nikpato simultaneously welcoming and suspicious.

#### The Succession Vote

Prince-Elector Ndaba controls one of seven votes that will choose the next Paramount. He's being courted aggressively by all three candidates, and he hates every minute of it.

**What Ndaba Wants**

A Paramount who will:
- Strengthen Confederate defense commitments
- Position forces to protect the Border Circle
- Provide military aid without political strings
- Not use Nikpato as a pawn in larger conflicts

**What the Candidates Offer**

**Shundari of Shunde**: Promises a rebuilt Confederate Army with northern garrisons. Sounds good, but Ndaba doesn't trust military strongmen—they tend to use buffer states as expendable resources.

**Mwenekazi of Chilala**: Promises economic development and infrastructure investment. Sounds good, but Chilala's interests lie south, not north. Would she actually defend Nikpato, or just express sympathy?

**Tumaini of Lanwadanzi**: Promises the status quo, which means continued vulnerability. At least he's honest about it.

**Ndaba's Dilemma**

Backing the winner means protection. Backing the loser means being remembered as an obstacle when the new Paramount distributes favors—or punishments.

Ndaba has been "neutral" for three years, extracting promises from all sides while committing to none. He can't maintain neutrality forever. When Makisani dies, he'll have to choose.

#### Military

Nikpato maintains disproportionate military forces for its population—roughly 5,000 professional soldiers plus 10,000 trained militia. Quality is high; quantity is insufficient against serious threats.

The state's defensive doctrine emphasizes:
- **Early warning**: Extensive patrol networks and signal towers
- **Fortification**: Every town has walls; every village has a defensible position
- **Scorched earth**: If invasion is certain, deny the enemy resources
- **Guerrilla resistance**: If occupation is inevitable, make it costly

This doctrine has limited invasions' damage but hasn't prevented them. Against a determined enemy with sufficient forces, Nikpato falls. It always falls.

#### The Threat They Don't See

Prince-Elector Ndaba watches the north obsessively. He has agents in Terrenia, contacts in Central Aboyinzu, informants along the Deadloop. He would know about any conventional military threat months before it materialized.

Chechol isn't on his radar.

Chechol is a quiet theocracy that exports grain and summoners. It has no army worth mentioning. Its Rentar population is religious, not martial. Ndaba's intelligence network reports nothing concerning—the Rentar have grown more devout, but that's not threatening.

He doesn't know about Gynor. He doesn't know about the Red Army. He doesn't know that the quiet state to the northeast is about to become the greatest threat Nikpato has ever faced.

When the Red Army marches, Nikpato's early warning system will detect movement within hours. They'll mobilize their forces, send riders to the Confederate capital, prepare for defense. And then they'll realize that 10,000 Rentar warriors are coming—zealots who believe they're doing divine work, who won't negotiate, who won't accept surrender, who will march straight through Nikpato toward whatever objective Gynor has given them.

The state will fall. Again.

#### Notable Locations

**Kampaga (Capital)**

A fortified city of 20,000, bristling with walls, towers, and siege preparations. The palace is more bunker than residence—designed to withstand months of siege if necessary. The city's atmosphere is tense even in peacetime; visitors feel like they're intruding on military operations.

**The Signal Towers**

A network of watch posts across Nikpato's northern border, connected by fire-signals and messenger relays. The towers can transmit warnings from the frontier to the capital within hours. They're Nikpato's eyes—and they're looking the wrong direction.

**The Old Conquests**

Ruins dot Nikpato's landscape—burned towns from previous invasions, monuments to failed defenses, mass graves from occupations. These sites are maintained as memorials and training locations. Every soldier visits them. Every citizen knows their lessons: the Confederation cannot be trusted; only Nikpato defends Nikpato.

#### Player Hooks

**The Vote**

- A candidate's agents approach the party with a simple job: convince Prince-Elector Ndaba to support their employer. Methods are negotiable.
- Ndaba himself hires the party to assess the candidates—provide unbiased intelligence on what each would actually do as Paramount.
- Someone is assassinating Ndaba's advisors, trying to isolate him before the succession. He needs protection and investigation.

**The Coming Storm**

- A Nikpato border patrol has disappeared near the Chechol frontier. Routine mission, routine area—but they haven't reported in three days.
- A Chechol merchant brings disturbing news: Rentar monasteries are emptying, with populations relocating to "spiritual retreats" the merchant couldn't find on any map.
- A Rentar defector—one of the Pyramid Keepers who suspects the truth—arrives in Kampaga seeking help. She has pieces of the puzzle but not enough to convince skeptical authorities.

**The Aftermath**

- The Red Army has passed through. Nikpato's government has collapsed. The party must help survivors organize resistance, evacuate civilians, or find someone capable of leading a counterattack.
- Ndaba survived, barely, but his state is shattered. He'll support anyone who can defeat the Rentar—including options he would never have considered before.

### Ogre Hills

The **Ogre Hills** occupy the eastern Troyan Mountains, a region of broken terrain that supports the largest concentration of ogres in the Dalizi Highlands. The hills are named bluntly for their inhabitants—the Dalizi see no reason for poetry when describing monster territory.

#### Geography

The Ogre Hills cover roughly fifty square miles of broken terrain where the Troyan Mountains descend toward the approaches to the Elder Mountains. Elevations range from 4,000 to 7,000 feet—lower than the main Troyan peaks but still rugged. The terrain is a maze of narrow valleys, rocky ridges, and cave-studded hillsides that provide ideal habitat for creatures that prefer cover and ambush.

The vegetation is denser here than in the higher mountains: scrub oak, pine stands, and thick underbrush in the valleys. Water is relatively abundant, with several streams feeding down toward the Dalizi lowlands. The combination of cover, water, and proximity to raiding targets makes the hills prime ogre territory.

#### The Ogre Clans

The Ogre Hills support an estimated 800 to 1,200 ogres, divided among five to eight clans depending on how one counts seasonal splits and mergers. The clans are territorial, claiming specific valleys and hillsides, but territories shift with the fortunes of war and the availability of food.

Dalizi ogres are of the Groyza subtype—heavier-built than their plains-dwelling Silzar cousins, with mottled gray-green skin that blends into the rocky terrain. They stand eight to ten feet tall, with powerful builds suited to climbing and grappling. They're not particularly intelligent, but they're cunning in their environment and have long memories for grudges.

##### Social Structure

Ogre clans are organized around dominant males who maintain their position through violence. Clan membership is fluid; ogres will switch allegiance after defeats or when better opportunities appear elsewhere. Females and young travel with the clans but don't participate in raids.

The clans raid the Dalizi lowlands opportunistically, taking livestock, stored food, and occasionally people. Raids are most common in late autumn when the clans are building reserves for winter. Human captives are sometimes ransomed; more often they become food.

##### Inter-Clan Relations

The clans fight each other as often as they raid humans. Territorial disputes, theft, and personal grudges spark conflicts that can escalate into small wars. The Dalizi have learned to exploit this—encouraging inter-clan conflict when possible reduces pressure on the lowlands.

A unified Ogre Hills would be a serious threat to the nearby Dalizi states. Fortunately, ogre unity is rare and brief. The longest recorded alliance, in 3,298 SD, lasted three months before collapsing into a four-way war over division of spoils.

#### Dalizi Response

The Dalizi states closest to the Ogre Hills maintain defensive measures: fortified villages, armed patrols, and early warning systems. When ogre raids become too frequent or too damaging, the affected states organize punitive expeditions that push into the hills, burn ogre camps, and kill whatever they can find.

These expeditions don't eliminate the ogre problem—the terrain makes comprehensive operations impossible—but they reduce pressure for a few years. The ogres learn to associate human aggression with their own overreach, which moderates their behavior. The cycle repeats.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Blood Caves

A cave system in the central Ogre Hills used by multiple clans as a meeting place during the rare periods of alliance. The caves get their name from the bloodstains on the walls and floors, evidence of the rituals—or murders—that accompany ogre gatherings.

##### Skull Ridge

A ridge line in the eastern hills decorated with the skulls of ogre enemies—both human and ogre. The skulls are a territorial marker, warning that this area is claimed. New skulls appear regularly; old ones weather and fall.

##### The Trampled Valley

A valley in the southern hills where regular clan warfare has destroyed most vegetation. The ground is torn up, the trees are broken, and the stream that runs through is regularly fouled with blood and waste. Nothing lives here except the ogres who fight over it.

### Rattlespit Hills

The **Rattlespit Hills** occupy a transitional zone within the northern Jackal Mountains, a cluster of lower terrain wedged between the main peaks and the wall of the Thundering Mountains. The hills take their name from the rattlespit serpent, a venomous snake whose distinctive threat display—a rattling tail followed by a spray of caustic venom—makes it one of the highland's most recognizable hazards.

#### Geography

The Rattlespit Hills extend roughly twenty miles east to west and ten miles north to south, filling the saddle between the Jackal Mountains proper and the Thundering Mountains. Elevations range from 5,000 feet in the lower valleys to 8,000 feet at the highest points—significant terrain, but modest compared to the peaks that bracket them.

The hills are rocky and dry, covered in loose scree and boulder fields with thin soil between. Vegetation is sparse: tough grasses, thorny shrubs, and scattered stands of wind-bent pine that somehow survive the harsh conditions. The terrain is broken and irregular, with countless small ravines, box canyons, and hidden hollows.

The Marrow Creek's headwaters rise somewhere in these hills before flowing southeast toward the Jackal Mountains' eastern slopes.

#### The Rattlespit Serpent

The snake that gives these hills their name is a pit viper roughly three to four feet long, with sandy-brown scales that blend perfectly with the rocky terrain. Its rattle is similar to other rattlesnakes, but its venom delivery is unique: rather than injecting through fangs, the rattlespit can spray caustic venom up to eight feet when threatened.

The venom causes intense burning on contact with skin and can cause permanent blindness if it reaches the eyes. It's not typically fatal to healthy adults, but it incapacitates effectively, leaving victims vulnerable to other hazards—exposure, dehydration, or the snakes themselves, which will bite once their prey is sufficiently weakened.

Rattlespits are most active in warm weather, basking on rocks during the day and hunting small mammals at night. They're well-camouflaged and often motionless until disturbed. Travelers through the hills learn to watch where they step and never reach blindly into rock crevices.

#### Strategic Position

The Rattlespit Hills occupy the only relatively accessible terrain between the Jackal and Thundering Mountains. Anyone attempting to cross the highlands from northwest to southeast—or vice versa—must pass through this snake-infested corridor unless they're willing to climb 14,000-foot peaks or descend all the way to the lowlands.

The Dalizi have occasionally discussed fortifying the hills to control highland traffic, but the proposals never advance far. The terrain is too broken to defend effectively, the snakes make garrisoning troops impractical, and there's simply not enough traffic to justify the expense. The hills remain wild.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Bone Wash

A ravine in the eastern hills where seasonal floods regularly expose skeletal remains—apparently a mass grave of some kind, though the bones are too old and scattered to identify. Some appear human; others do not. The bones wash down toward the Marrow Valley in heavy rains, contributing to that creek's unsettling cargo.

##### Old Cairns

Scattered throughout the hills are stone cairns of uncertain origin, some still standing, others collapsed into rubble. They're too regular to be natural, but they don't match Dalizi construction techniques. Their purpose is unknown—they might be waymarkers, boundary stones, or something else entirely. The Dalizi leave them alone.

### River of Petals

The **River of Petals** flows through the heart of the Cerulean Crests, draining the copper-rich highlands before descending to the Dalizi lowlands. The river takes its name from the carpet of flower petals that covers its surface during spring and early summer—a phenomenon unique to these mountains and visible nowhere else in Alaria.

#### Course

The River of Petals rises from springs high in the central Cerulean Crests, fed by snowmelt and groundwater filtering through copper-bearing rock. The headwaters are cold, clear, and tinted faintly green from dissolved minerals.

The upper river flows northeast through a high valley, gathering tributaries including the Rivoleta from the Chull Lands. The valley is one of the gentler landscapes in the Dalizi Highlands—steep-sided but with a relatively flat floor, passable for travelers and even small wagons in good weather.

Below the Rivoleta confluence, the river turns south, cutting through a gap in the Cerulean Crests before descending toward the Dalizi lowlands. This lower section drops more steeply, with several small waterfalls and rapids that make the river unnavigable.

The total course is approximately forty miles from source to the point where it leaves the highlands.

#### The Petals

For roughly sixty days each year, from late spring through early summer, the River of Petals earns its name. The copper-rich soils of the Cerulean Crests support unique alpine flowers—species found nowhere else—that bloom in profusion during this window. When the blooms fade, the petals fall into the streams and rivers, accumulating until the water itself appears to be flowing color.

The effect is most dramatic on the main river, where countless tributary streams contribute their petal loads. At peak bloom, the river surface is completely obscured by floating petals in shades of blue, purple, white, and occasionally pink. The petals drift downstream, gradually waterlogging and sinking, creating a shifting carpet that moves with the current.

The flower species responsible are adapted to the copper-rich soil that would kill most plants. They've evolved to incorporate copper into their tissues, which contributes to their unusual coloration. The petals are mildly toxic if eaten in quantity, though a few won't cause harm.

#### The Petal Trade

The flowers of the Cerulean Crests have modest commercial value. Dried petals are used as dye, producing colors difficult to achieve with other materials. The whole flowers, properly preserved, are prized by collectors and used in certain alchemical preparations.

Harvesting is labor-intensive. The flowers bloom in remote, high-altitude locations accessible only during the brief summer window. Gatherers must climb into the mountains, collect the blooms before they fall, and transport them down before they wilt. It's seasonal work for specialists willing to make the journey.

The river itself sometimes delivers petals to the lowlands, though waterlogged petals are less valuable than fresh ones. Enterprising merchants have attempted to collect floating petals near the river's exit from the highlands, with mixed success.

#### Travel Route

The River of Petals valley is the primary southern route into the Dalizi Highlands. The terrain is gentler than the alternatives, the water supply is reliable, and the scenery—especially during petal season—is spectacular by highland standards.

The route connects to:
- **North**: The Chull Lands via the Rivoleta confluence
- **East**: The Troyan Mountains via the Hills of Meus
- **West**: The Toothlar Mountains (impassable, but visible)
- **South**: The Dalizi lowlands and the Confederation proper

Travel time from the lowlands to the Rivoleta confluence is approximately three days. The route is passable for pack animals and, in good conditions, for wheeled vehicles, making it the closest thing to a proper road in the highlands.

#### The Blue Water Effect

Below the Rivoleta confluence, the River of Petals takes on a distinctive blue-green color from accumulated copper minerals. This "blue water" persists well into the lowlands, marking the river's course across the Dalizi plains.

The blue water is drinkable but has a pronounced metallic taste. Long-term consumption contributes to the Blue Sickness that affects miners in the Cerulean Crests, though the concentration is lower than in the mountains themselves. Lowland communities along the river usually have alternative water sources.

Crops irrigated with blue water show elevated copper levels. This is beneficial in small amounts—the crops are slightly more resistant to certain pests—but excessive irrigation can poison the soil.

### Rivoleta River

The **Rivoleta River** drains the eastern Chull Lands, flowing south through the Hills of Meus before joining the River of Petals in the northern Cerulean Crests. The name means "little violent one" in an old Dalizi dialect, referring to the river's unpredictable and occasionally dangerous character.

#### Course

The Rivoleta rises from numerous springs and seeps in the eastern Chull Lands, gathering water from the wetlands before finding a definite channel at the basin's southern edge. The upper river is slow and meandering, spreading across multiple channels through marshy ground—chull territory, dangerous to approach.

As the river enters the Hills of Meus, the gradient increases and the water picks up speed. This middle section is the most treacherous: the riverbed is rocky and irregular, with sudden drops, unexpected rapids, and logjams that redirect flow without warning. The "violent" in the river's name refers primarily to this stretch.

The lower Rivoleta calms as it approaches the Cerulean Crests, settling into a definite channel before joining the River of Petals. This confluence occurs in a small valley that marks one of the easier passes through the northern Crests.

#### Character

The Rivoleta is not a large river—perhaps sixty feet wide at its broadest, twenty feet in the narrow stretches. But it's energetic, fed by abundant water from the Chull Lands and dropping significantly over its twenty-five mile course.

The water carries sediment from the Chull Lands, giving it a murky brown color for most of its length. This sediment includes copper from the Cerulean Crests watershed, which gradually gives the lower river a greenish tint. The water is drinkable but has a mineral taste.

Fish are present but not abundant—the chulls in the upper river reduce prey populations, and the copper content in the lower river limits what can survive. The few fish that do thrive here are tough, oily species that most people won't eat unless they have no choice.

#### Crossings

The Rivoleta must be crossed by anyone traveling between the Chull Lands and the southern highlands. This is less straightforward than it sounds.

The upper river is too spread out across wetlands to cross easily, and the wetlands are chull territory. The middle river is fast and rocky, with few points where fording is safe. The lower river is more manageable, but it's also farther from most travel routes.

Most travelers cross at **Stone Ford**, a natural rock formation in the middle section where the river spreads shallow over a flat stone shelf. The crossing is manageable in summer when the water is low; in spring melt, it's dangerous or impossible. There are no bridges—the traffic doesn't justify construction, and floods would destroy any structure eventually.

#### The Violent Season

Spring melt transforms the Rivoleta from a difficult river to a dangerous one. The water rises several feet, the current accelerates dramatically, and debris from the melting Chull Lands—including dead chulls, animal carcasses, and uprooted vegetation—chokes the channel.

During the violent season, the river cannot be crossed at Stone Ford. Travelers must either wait for the waters to recede (typically several weeks) or detour far downstream to the River of Petals confluence. The detour adds days to any journey.

The violent season also deposits debris throughout the river corridor, including the occasional valuable item swept from upstream. After the waters recede, locals pick through the deposits looking for anything worthwhile. They find tools, weapons, and sometimes human remains—evidence of travelers who didn't survive the Chull Lands.

### Shipwreck Coast

The **Shipwreck Coast** stretches nearly three hundred miles along the eastern margin of the Dalizi Highlands, from the Misty Valley in the north to the coastal plains south of the Elder Mountains. No permanent settlements exist along its length. No ports. No fishing villages. The coast earns its name honestly—the seafloor here is a graveyard of broken hulls, and the cliffs are studded with the rusted remnants of vessels that never made landing.

#### Geography

The coast presents an almost uniformly hostile face to the sea. Sheer cliffs rise two hundred to four hundred feet directly from the water along most of the northern and central stretches, carved by millennia of wave action into overhangs, sea caves, and treacherous undercuts. Where the cliffs relent—primarily in the south near the Elder Mountains—the beaches are narrow strips of dark volcanic sand backed by unstable scree slopes.

The continental shelf drops away sharply within a mile of shore, creating a zone where deep-water swells suddenly encounter shallow rock. Combined with unpredictable currents that sweep down from the northern Wanderlands waters, this produces wave patterns that can swamp even experienced sailors. The waters remain cold year-round, fed by currents from the cursed Donclik Sound to the north.

#### Why Ships Die Here

Three factors combine to make the Shipwreck Coast lethal:

**The Fog Bank.** The Foggy Mountains to the west earn their name from constant moisture-laden air that spills down their eastern slopes. This fog blankets the coast most mornings and many evenings, reducing visibility to ship-lengths. Vessels often don't see the cliffs until they hear the waves breaking against them.

**The Undertow.** Currents along this coast run parallel to shore in complex, shifting patterns. A ship fighting to stay off the rocks may find itself pulled inexorably sideways toward a headland it thought was safely to port. Local sailors—the few who exist, working out of distant ports—call this phenomenon "the gathering."

**No Safe Harbor.** Even if a vessel successfully navigates the fog and currents, there is simply nowhere to land. The few coves that exist are choked with rocks, their entrances too narrow for anything larger than a rowboat. Ships in distress have no refuge.

#### The Wrecks

Centuries of maritime traffic between the southern Aboyinzu coast and the Elder Wilds have left their mark. Merchant vessels, exploratory expeditions, refugee flotillas, and the occasional warship—all have contributed to the underwater detritus. Local legend claims you can walk from one wreck to the next without touching natural stone for miles in certain stretches.

Salvage operations are technically possible but rarely profitable. The cliffs make overland access to the wrecks nearly impossible, while the same currents that killed the ships make diving treacherous. A few determined salvagers work the southern stretches where beach access exists, but they speak of the work in terms of survival rather than profit.

Some wrecks are visible from the cliff tops—masts protruding from the water, hulls wedged into sea caves, the occasional vessel impaled on rocks close enough to shore that its decay can be watched over years. The Dalizi have names for the most prominent ones, passed down through generations of shepherds who graze the Banesnap Hills above.

#### Why It Remains Empty

The Dalizi Confederation's eastern frontier ends at the Cerulean Crests and Jackal Mountains. No state claims the highlands beyond, and none claim the coast. This isn't oversight—it's policy born of hard experience.

The coast offers nothing. No arable land backs the cliffs. No timber worth harvesting survives the salt spray. The fishing would require establishing communities in an area with no fresh water and no safe anchorage. Every generation or so, some enterprising merchant proposes establishing a lighthouse or rescue station; every generation, the proposal dies when the cost becomes clear.

The highlands above the coast are monster territory—Moon Goblins, ogres, and worse. Any coastal settlement would need to be supplied entirely by sea, through waters that kill ships, while simultaneously defending against raids from above.

The Dalizi have a saying: *"The sea takes what comes, and the mountains take what stays."*

#### Navigation Warnings

Sailors with business in eastern Aboyinzu waters know to stay well offshore when passing the Shipwreck Coast—twenty miles minimum in clear weather, more in fog. The currents extend far from shore, and the fog can roll out unexpectedly. Ships that must approach do so only in full daylight, during the brief window between morning fog and evening fog, with crew watching the water constantly for the telltale color change that indicates shallowing.

There are no reliable charts of the underwater hazards. The seafloor here is a maze of rocks, wrecks, and sudden depth changes. Attempts to map it have added to the wreck count.

### Strangle River

The **Strangle River** drains the northern Foggy Mountains through the Misty Valley before emptying into the sea along the Shipwreck Coast. Despite its ominous name, the river itself is not particularly dangerous—the name refers to the dense vegetation that chokes its lower reaches, creating a green tunnel so thick that the water becomes invisible from above.

#### Course

The Strangle rises from dozens of small springs and seeps in the northern Foggy Mountains, where the persistent fog condenses on cold stone and runs downhill. These trickles gather into a proper stream within the first ten miles, then cut northeast through a gap in the coastal hills to reach the Misty Valley.

In the valley, the river slows and widens, meandering through bottomland thick with willows, water plants, and the strangling vines that give the river its name. The vegetation is so dense in places that the river effectively disappears—travelers can stand on the bank and hear water flowing without seeing it.

The final stretch drops steeply through a gorge to the sea. Here the river regains its energy, cutting through the coastal cliffs in a narrow canyon that ends in a waterfall directly into the ocean. There is no beach access; the river meets the sea at the cliff face.

#### The Strangling Vines

The vine species that dominates the lower Strangle is found nowhere else in the Dalizi Highlands. It's an aggressive climber with dark green leaves and rope-like stems that can reach six inches in diameter. The vines grow over everything—trees, rocks, each other—creating a continuous canopy above the water.

The vines are not carnivorous or animated, despite occasional rumors. They're simply very successful plants in a very wet environment. However, the density of growth does make the river corridor impassable in many places. Anyone trying to follow the river on foot must hack through vegetation or wade in the water itself.

Local herbalists prize the vine's sap, which has mild numbing properties when applied to wounds. Harvesting is labor-intensive enough that the sap commands high prices in Dalizi markets.

#### Navigation

The Strangle is not navigable by boat. The upper reaches are too shallow and rocky; the lower reaches are choked with vegetation and end in a waterfall. The river serves primarily as a water source for the Misty Valley and as a landmark for travelers.

The sound of the river is audible throughout much of the valley, even when the water cannot be seen. This makes it useful for orientation in the fog that frequently blankets the area.

### Thundering Mountains

The **Thundering Mountains** form the great northern wall of the Dalizi Highlands, a massive range that separates the highland interior from the Wanderlands to the north. The mountains earn their name from the constant rumble of avalanches, rockfalls, and—according to some—sounds that have no natural explanation. This is the highest and most formidable range in the Dalizi Highlands, and it has only one known crossing.

#### Geography

The Thundering Mountains extend over one hundred and fifty miles from the Dragonsong forests in the east to the Titan Stairs in the west. The range is immense—thirty to forty miles wide in most places—and uniformly high. Average elevations exceed 12,000 feet; the highest peaks push past 16,000 feet. Permanent snow and ice cover everything above 10,000 feet.

The range presents a continuous barrier. Unlike most mountain chains, the Thundering Mountains have no gaps, no lower saddles, no gradual descents. The northern face drops steeply toward the Wanderlands; the southern face descends equally steeply toward the highland interior. Travelers must cross the full height of the range or not cross at all.

#### The Thundering

The range's distinctive sound is audible from miles away—a constant, low rumble punctuated by louder crashes and booms. The obvious explanation is avalanche activity. The steep slopes and heavy snow load create ideal conditions for slides, and avalanches do occur regularly.

But the sounds don't always correlate with visible avalanches. Sometimes the rumbling continues for hours with no sign of snow movement. Sometimes booms echo from peaks that haven't had fresh snow in weeks. The Dalizi call these unexplained sounds "the voice of the mountains" and consider them ill-omened.

Theories about the sound's source include seismic activity, wind resonance, or magical presence. The Dalizi have no consensus.

##### The Truth (GM Information)

The Thundering Mountains sit atop an ancient titan's corpse—one of the beings that shaped the world in the Second Eon, killed during the conflicts that preceded human dominance. The titan is not truly dead; it exists in a state between life and death, its heartbeat slowed to once per century, its breathing measured in decades.

The thundering is the titan stirring in its sleep.

The "voice of the mountains" that occurs without visible avalanches is the titan's dreaming—half-conscious attempts to move limbs that have become stone, to speak with a throat filled with earth. The unexplained phenomena reported by explorers (compasses spinning, the sensation of being watched, terrain that seems to shift) are caused by the titan's dream-logic bleeding into reality.

The titan cannot wake fully—the weight of the mountains pins it, and its vital processes have slowed beyond recovery. But it dreams, and its dreams have power. The ruins scattered throughout the highlands (the watchtowers on the Titan Stairs, the empty temples in the Troyans, the guardian structures at Fool's Pass) were built by a civilization that knew the titan was there and either worshipped it or worked to keep it sleeping.

**Alternative option:** If a sleeping titan feels too significant, the thundering can instead be explained by a massive colony of earth elementals that migrated here during a leyline surge centuries ago. They've hollowed portions of the mountains into a vast hive, and the sounds are their constant excavation and movement. The "voice" is their collective vibration when they synchronize activity.

#### The South Wall

The southern face of the Thundering Mountains—the wall visible from the highland interior—is particularly dramatic. For most of its length, the rock rises nearly vertical from the highland floor, a cliff thousands of feet high with no obvious route up. This feature is called the South Wall, and it defines the northern boundary of practical highland travel.

The South Wall has been climbed in a few places by determined mountaineers. None found anything worth the effort—only more snow, more rock, and more dangerous terrain beyond the wall's lip.

#### Fool's Pass

One route crosses the Thundering Mountains: **Fool's Pass**, a narrow defile in the western portion of the range. The pass is dangerous, difficult, and leads into territory claimed by the dragon Ziru. It's called Fool's Pass because only a fool would use it—but sometimes fools have reasons.

The pass climbs to approximately 11,000 feet at its highest point, threading between peaks that rise several thousand feet higher on either side. The route is narrow, exposed to weather and avalanche, and passable only during summer months. Even in good conditions, the crossing takes three to four days and claims lives regularly.

Those who survive the pass emerge in the southern Wanderlands, specifically the Dragonsong region. From there, travel options are limited: the cursed Donclik Peninsula to the west, the dragon's domain to the north and east, or back through the pass. Most who cross are running from something worse than what awaits.

#### Exploration Attempts

The Dalizi Confederation has sponsored several expeditions into the Thundering Mountains over the centuries. All have failed. The range defends itself with altitude, weather, terrain, and the unexplained phenomena that make even survivors reluctant to discuss their experiences.

The most recent significant attempt—the Confederation Survey of 3,312 SD—spent two years mapping the southern approaches and made three attempts on the range itself. The first attempt was turned back by weather; the second lost four climbers to an avalanche; the third reached the ridgeline before retreating in the face of "conditions that made further progress inadvisable." The survey report's vagueness on this point has inspired considerable speculation.

### Titan Stairs

The **Titan Stairs** are the western gateway to the Dalizi Highlands, a dramatic stepped formation where the land rises from the lowland Dalizi Confederation toward the mountain wall in a series of massive terraces. Each "step" is a plateau tens of miles across, separated by cliffs and escarpments that must be climbed or circumvented. The name refers to the scale—the formation looks like stairs built for beings far larger than humans.

#### Geography

The Titan Stairs occupy roughly eighty square miles at the western edge of the Dalizi Highlands, where the Thundering Mountains and Jackal Mountains give way to lower terrain. The formation consists of four distinct plateaus, each roughly 1,000 feet higher than the previous one:

- **First Step** (1,500-2,500 feet): Rolling hills and grassland at the base, still influenced by the Dalizi lowlands
- **Second Step** (2,500-3,500 feet): Drier terrain with scattered forest, accessible from the Chull Lands
- **Third Step** (3,500-4,500 feet): Rocky highlands, sparse vegetation, approaching the Thundering Mountains
- **Fourth Step** (4,500-5,500 feet): Barren plateau merging with the approaches to Fool's Pass

The escarpments between steps range from 500 to 1,000 feet of near-vertical cliff. Ancient paths wind up through gaps and switchbacks, but the climbs are never easy.

#### Origin Theories

The Titan Stairs are geologically unusual. Nothing else in the Dalizi Highlands shows this stepped pattern. Scholars have proposed several explanations:

**Faulting.** The steps represent ancient fault lines where massive blocks of stone shifted upward relative to their neighbors over millennia. This is the most conventional explanation, though it doesn't fully account for the regularity of the formation.

**Erosion.** Differential erosion of layered rock created the terraces, with harder stone forming the plateaus and softer material eroding away to create the escarpments. This theory struggles to explain why the erosion occurred so uniformly.

**Construction.** The stairs were built, shaped by beings with the power to move mountains. Proponents point to the formation's name, arguing that the ancient Dalizi recognized the artificial nature of the terrain. Critics note that no evidence of tool marks or construction techniques has been found.

The Dalizi themselves offer no traditional explanation. The stairs have always been there; the stairs will always be there; the stairs are what they are.

#### The Climb

Traveling up the Titan Stairs is the primary route into the western Dalizi Highlands. Each escarpment requires a half-day's climb on the established paths, more if conditions are poor or the traveler is burdened. The entire ascent from the lowlands to the Fourth Step takes two to three days.

The paths are not maintained in any formal sense, but they're well-worn from centuries of use. The most dangerous sections have rope handholds installed by unknown hands—some ancient, some relatively recent. Falls are possible but rare for those who pay attention.

Descending is faster but requires more care. The temptation to hurry has killed climbers who rushed switchbacks or trusted their footing on loose stone.

#### The Chull Lands Access

The Second and Third Steps connect to the Chull Lands through relatively gentle slopes, making this the easiest access point between the lowlands and the highland interior. Most traffic through the Titan Stairs is heading to or from the Chull Lands, using the stairs to bypass the impassable Toothlar Mountains to the south.

#### Points of Interest

##### Giant's Rest

A flat area on the Third Step where a massive stone slab—roughly fifty feet long and twenty feet wide—lies at an angle that resembles a reclining figure. Legend claims this is where a titan stopped to rest during the stairs' construction and was turned to stone. The stone shows no tool marks or carved features; it's just a slab that happens to look somewhat humanoid from certain angles.

##### The Watchtowers

Ruined structures on the Fourth Step, positioned to overlook both the Chull Lands and the approaches to Fool's Pass. Three towers survive as partial walls; foundations suggest at least two more once existed. The architecture is unfamiliar, the age uncertain. Someone wanted to watch the western highlands, once.

**GM Information:** These towers were built by the Vetharak civilization to monitor traffic through the Titan Stairs—specifically, to watch for anything emerging from Fool's Pass. The builders knew the dragon (or the dragon's predecessor) controlled the northern side and maintained these posts as early warning stations. The towers were staffed until the civilization's collapse; they've stood empty for millennia since.

##### The Counting Stones

A series of carved marks on the escarpment between the First and Second Steps, apparently counting something. The marks number over two thousand and continue up the cliff face higher than any casual reach. Their meaning is unknown; their age is estimated at several centuries minimum.

**GM Information:** The marks count heartbeats—specifically, the titan's heartbeats. The Vetharak civilization developed methods to detect the titan's century-slow pulse and carved a mark for each beat, using the count to predict dream-cycles and plan their rituals accordingly. The marks continue above human reach because the carvers used scaffolding or magic; the project was eventually abandoned when the correlation between heartbeats and dream-intensity proved unreliable. There are 2,347 marks, representing approximately 234,700 years of monitoring.

### Toothlar Mountains

The **Toothlar Mountains** form the southwestern boundary of the Dalizi Highlands, a jagged wall of peaks that separates the highland interior from the lowland approaches. The name refers to the range's profile—from the Dalizi plains, the peaks look like a row of broken teeth against the sky, sharp and irregular and vaguely threatening.

#### Geography

The Toothlar Mountains extend roughly forty miles from the western edge of the Titan Stairs to the Cerulean Crests in the east. The range is narrow—rarely more than fifteen miles wide—but tall enough to block easy passage, with most peaks exceeding 9,000 feet and the highest reaching nearly 12,000 feet.

The distinctive "tooth" profile comes from the range's geology. The rock is heavily fractured, with vertical jointing that promotes the formation of isolated spires and pinnacles. Erosion has sharpened these features over millennia, creating a skyline of pointed peaks separated by deep notches.

The slopes are steep and unstable. Rockfall is common; the slopes are littered with debris from past collapses. Snow accumulates in the higher notches year-round, feeding small glaciers that add ice hazards to the already treacherous terrain.

#### Impassability

The Toothlar Mountains have no passes. Every attempt to find a route through the range has failed. The notches between peaks look promising from a distance but invariably dead-end at vertical walls or unstable ice. The slopes themselves are too steep and loose for safe climbing.

This impassability shapes traffic patterns throughout the western Dalizi Highlands. Anyone traveling from the lowlands to the highland interior must go around the Toothlars—either north through the Titan Stairs and Chull Lands, or south through the Cerulean Crests and the Chalaari River valley. The mountains effectively split the western approaches in two.

#### Why So Difficult?

The Toothlar Mountains present unusual difficulty even by highland standards. Other ranges in the Dalizi Highlands are passable, if dangerous. The Toothlars are simply not.

Several factors contribute:

**Geology.** The fractured rock creates a landscape of vertical features with no gradual slopes. Climbing is the only option, and the rock is too unstable for reliable climbing.

**Ice.** Snow and ice persist in the high notches year-round, blocking the most promising routes with unstable glaciers and ice falls.

**Weather.** The Toothlars generate their own weather patterns, with sudden storms that appear from clear skies. Climbers caught on exposed faces have no shelter.

**Something else.** Survivors of failed crossings report phenomena difficult to explain—compasses behaving erratically, the sensation of being watched from above, sounds from peaks that shouldn't echo. These reports are dismissed by most as stress-induced hallucinations, but they're consistent enough to suggest something unusual about the range.

#### The Southern Face

The Toothlars' southern face overlooks the Dalizi lowlands, visible from numerous settlements as a wall of broken stone. The proximity of this impassable barrier to civilized territory has inspired legends, mostly concerning what might live in the inaccessible upper peaks.

The most persistent story involves the Tooth-Dwellers—beings of some kind that inhabit the high pinnacles. No one has seen them clearly; the reports describe movements on peaks too steep for humans to reach, lights in notches at night, occasional sounds that might be voices.

**GM Information:** The Tooth-Dwellers are real. They're **harpies**—a colony of approximately forty individuals that claimed the Toothlar peaks centuries ago. They're intelligent, territorial, and hostile to intruders, which explains why the mountains remain impassable despite appearing to have navigable notches.

The harpies nest in the high pinnacles and use the notches as hunting grounds, waiting for climbers or animals to enter the narrow spaces before attacking from above. They're responsible for the compass anomalies (they collect metal objects, which they hoard in their nests, creating localized magnetic interference), the sensation of being watched (because intruders *are* being watched), and the unexplained sounds (harpy calls, distorted by echoes).

The harpies have no interest in negotiation. They view the mountains as their territory and everything that enters as either threat or prey. However, they rarely descend below the snow line—the lowland Dalizi are safe as long as they don't climb.

**Alternative option:** If harpies feel too mundane, the Tooth-Dwellers could instead be **gargoyles**—stone creatures that were created (or awakened) by the Vetharak civilization to guard this approach. They've outlived their creators and continue their function mindlessly, attacking anything that attempts to cross. Their stone nature explains why they're impossible to see clearly—they look like rock formations until they move.

#### Economic Impact

The Toothlar Mountains' impassability increases travel costs throughout the western Dalizi Highlands. Merchants and travelers must add days to their journeys, going around rather than through. Several Dalizi states have invested in improving the alternate routes, reasoning that they can't make the Toothlars passable but can at least make the detours less painful.

The mountains also provide a natural defensive barrier for the lowland states. Any threat emerging from the highland interior must approach through predictable routes; the Toothlars cannot be crossed by armies any more than by individuals.

### Troyan Mountains

The **Troyan Mountains** form the southern wall of the Dalizi Highlands, a range of broken peaks and deep valleys that separates the highland interior from the lowlands of the Dalizi Confederation. Named for an ancient Dalizi hero who allegedly died fighting giants in these peaks, the mountains are best known today for the ogre clans that make the Ogre Hills their home.

#### Geography

The Troyan Mountains extend roughly sixty miles from the Chalaari River in the west to the approaches to the Elder Mountains in the east. The range is lower than the Jackal Mountains to the north—most peaks fall between 8,000 and 10,000 feet—but covers more area, sprawling across a width of twenty to thirty miles.

The terrain is complex: multiple parallel ridges separated by deep valleys, with numerous side canyons and box ends. Unlike the relatively uniform Jackal range, the Troyans are a maze. Travelers who enter without guides rarely find their way out by the route they intended.

The southern slopes descend gradually toward the Dalizi lowlands, becoming progressively more hospitable. The northern face is steeper, dropping sharply into the valleys that separate the Troyans from the Jackal Mountains.

#### The Legend of Troyan

According to Dalizi legend, Troyan was a warrior-chief who lived in the early days of the Confederation, when the highland ranges were home to giants rather than the scattered monsters of today. The giants raided the lowland settlements regularly, taking cattle, crops, and people.

Troyan organized a coalition of Dalizi states to push into the mountains and break the giants' power. The campaign lasted three years and cost thousands of lives, but it succeeded—the giants were driven from the southern ranges, their strongholds destroyed, their numbers reduced to scattered survivors.

Troyan himself died in the final battle, fighting a giant chieftain on a peak that still bears no name. His body was never recovered. The Dalizi named the entire range for him, though they lost track of which specific mountain saw his end.

Whether the legend is accurate remains debated. Giants certainly existed—their bones occasionally surface in the mountains—but whether they were organized enough to conduct raids, or whether a single campaign broke their power, is less certain.

#### The Ogre Hills

The eastern Troyan Mountains contain a distinct subrange of lower hills occupied by ogre clans. These are the Ogre Hills, home to perhaps a thousand ogres divided among several competing groups.

The ogres are not the giants of legend—they're smaller, less powerful, and considerably less organized. They raid the lowlands occasionally, but their attacks are opportunistic rather than systematic. The Dalizi have learned to coexist with them through a combination of armed patrols, fortified villages, and the occasional punitive expedition.

The ogres prefer the broken terrain of the hills, where their strength and knowledge of the ground give them advantages. They don't venture into the higher Troyans, possibly due to territorial disputes with whatever occupies those peaks.

#### Current Status

The Troyan Mountains mark the practical northern boundary of Dalizi settlement. The lowland states extend to the mountain's southern slopes; the peaks themselves are empty wilderness. Shepherds graze flocks in the lower valleys during summer; hunters pursue game as high as they dare; no one stays year-round.

The mountains are crossed by the Chalaari River valley to the west, which offers a route into the central highlands. This is the most traveled path through the Troyans, though "traveled" is relative—perhaps a dozen parties per month in good weather.

#### Points of Interest

##### Ogre Hills

A distinct region of broken, lower terrain in the eastern Troyans, home to the ogre clans. See the dedicated entry for details.

##### Giant's Fall

A cliff in the central Troyans where, according to legend, Troyan slew a giant by pushing it off the edge. The cliff drops nearly a thousand feet to a boulder field below. Giant bones have been found in the area, though whether this confirms the legend or merely indicates that giants lived here is disputed.

##### The Empty Temples

Several structures in the high Troyans appear to be temples of some kind—stone buildings with pillared entrances and interior chambers. They're empty now, stripped of any contents, with no indication of who built them or what was worshipped. The architectural style doesn't match any known Dalizi or giant construction.

**GM Information:** These temples were built by the Vetharak civilization as dream-shrines—places where priests could enter the titan's dream-space and attempt to guide its sleeping thoughts. Each temple sits above a node in the leyline network that channels the titan's dream-energy, and the interior chambers were designed to induce trance states.

The temples are empty because the civilization stripped them before fleeing (if they fled) or because the dream-connection preserved the spaces from the decay that claimed everything else. The interiors still function as entry points to the titan's dream—anyone who sleeps in the inner chambers may find themselves dreaming the titan's dreams, experiencing fragmentary visions of a consciousness older than human memory. This is not safe. The titan's dreams can be overwhelming, addictive, or maddening, and some dreamers don't wake up at all.

### Tswili Lake

### Turbuni

Tags: city-state, border circle

A prosperous city-state on the northern border of the Dalizi Confederation, positioned where the savanna of Central Aboyinzu begins to rise into the Dalizi highlands. Turbuni shares jurisdiction over the School of Summoning with Chechol—a arrangement that has made it wealthy, cosmopolitan, and completely blind to the danger building next door.

The city sits on a low bluff overlooking fertile farmland, with the distant gleam of Lake Ntsa visible to the northwest. Roads run north to Chechol's river valleys, south into the Dalizi heartland, and west toward the other Border Circle states. Merchants, pilgrims, and students pass through constantly, making Turbuni feel more worldly than its size suggests.

#### Character

Turbuni thinks of itself as a gateway—between the Confederation and Central Aboyinzu, between secular government and magical learning, between mundane commerce and supernatural power. The city profits from all of these connections without fully belonging to any of them.

The population (~12,000) includes a significant minority of foreigners: Chechol humans, Rentar pilgrims, scholars from across Aboyinzu, and merchants seeking the Northern Corridor trade route. This diversity gives Turbuni an open, tolerant atmosphere—unusual in the Confederation, where religious and regional identities usually run deeper.

The city's wealth comes from three sources:
- **School fees**: The School of Summoning pays taxes to both Turbuni and Chechol, and the city profits from housing students, selling supplies, and providing entertainment
- **Northern trade**: Goods moving between the Confederation and Central Aboyinzu pass through Turbuni's markets
- **Lake Ntsa fishing**: The city controls the southern shore of Lake Ntsa, though the fishing is modest compared to Lake Tonactlet Chipe

#### Government

Turbuni is ruled by the **Council of Factors**—a body of twelve wealthy merchants who buy their seats and govern the city as a commercial enterprise. The current First Factor is **Pemba Ashani**, a shrewd negotiator in her sixties who has held her position for twenty years.

The Council's primary concern is profit. They maintain good relations with Chechol because trade requires it. They participate in Border Circle politics because isolation would be dangerous. They pay minimal attention to the Dalizi succession crisis because it doesn't affect their bottom line.

This pragmatism has served Turbuni well. The city has avoided wars, maintained neutrality in Confederate disputes, and grown steadily wealthier. It has also left them catastrophically unprepared for a threat that doesn't care about trade relationships.

#### The School Connection

The School of Summoning sits on a ridge overlooking Lake Ntsa, technically on territory claimed by both Turbuni and Chechol. Neither state has ever resolved the jurisdictional dispute—the ambiguity serves everyone's interests. The School answers to no single authority, Turbuni and Chechol both collect partial taxes, and everyone pretends this is a deliberate arrangement rather than centuries of failed negotiations.

Turbuni provides the School with:
- Student housing (the School's campus is cramped)
- Entertainment and amenities students can't find on campus
- Market access for faculty seeking exotic components
- A neutral ground for meetings the School prefers to hold off-campus

In return, the School provides Turbuni with:
- Tax revenue
- Magical consultation services
- Prestige by association
- A constant flow of visitors who spend money

This relationship has shaped Turbuni's culture. The city is comfortable with magic in ways that unsettle visitors from the conservative South Wall states. Summoners walk the streets openly. Shops sell ritual components without discretion. The Council of Factors includes two members with formal magical training.

#### The Blind Spot

Turbuni's merchants have noticed oddities from Chechol. Rentar visitors have grown more confident, more certain, more prone to long silences when asked direct questions. Human merchants from the Riki Valley seem uneasy about things they won't discuss. The School has mentioned "psychic anomalies" in private conversations.

None of this has coalesced into concern. Turbuni's culture prizes pragmatism over speculation. The Rentar have always been religious; perhaps they're having a revival. The humans have always been quiet; perhaps they're just tired. The School is always detecting anomalies; that's what magical researchers do.

First Factor Pemba has more immediate worries: the succession crisis, the Border Circle's vulnerability, the possibility that a new Paramount might impose unfavorable trade policies. Chechol is stable. Chechol is profitable. Chechol is the last thing she needs to worry about.

She's wrong.

#### What Comes Next

When the Red Army activates, Turbuni will have perhaps two days' warning—if that. Rentar visitors will leave suddenly. The roads north will go quiet. Then columns of minotaur warriors will appear on the horizon, marching with the terrible certainty of divine purpose.

The Council of Factors will try to negotiate. They always negotiate. It won't work—Gynor's soldiers don't want trade agreements. They want conquest.

Turbuni's walls are adequate against bandits, not armies. The city guard numbers 500, trained for peacekeeping, not war. The School of Summoning might help, but its faculty will be dealing with their own crisis—realizing that their communion techniques spawned this catastrophe.

The city will fall. The question is whether anyone escapes to warn the Confederation—and whether the Confederation, paralyzed by succession politics, can respond in time.

#### Notable Locations

**The Factor's Hall**

The Council's meeting place and Turbuni's administrative center. A practical stone building decorated with trade goods from across Aboyinzu—more museum than palace. The Council meets weekly to review accounts, resolve disputes, and congratulate themselves on their prosperity.

**The Scholar's Quarter**

A district of boarding houses, taverns, and shops catering to School students and faculty. More chaotic than the rest of Turbuni—magical mishaps are common, and the city guard has learned not to investigate strange noises too closely.

**Lake Ntsa Shore**

The fishing docks and associated warehouses. Modest compared to the lakeside cities, but the source of fresh fish and a pleasant recreational area for wealthy residents.

**The Northern Gate**

The road to Chechol passes through here. The gate is larger than necessary—built optimistically during a period when the Council hoped to become a major trading hub. Now it mostly processes pilgrims heading to the School or the Pyramid of Five Sides.

When the Red Army comes, this is where they'll enter.

## Dragon's Spine Coast

### Geography

Dragon's Spine is the long, misty, snow-covered mountain range that runs east-west across the entire southern edge of Aboyinzu. This is a cold, dramatic landscape—a stark contrast to the tropical and savanna regions to the north. The mountains eventually fragment into an archipelago stretching eastward, culminating in the Pindolin Islands.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dalizi Highlands and Dalizi Confederation; the Morygun Mountains connect from the northwest
- **East**: The range transitions into archipelago, extending to the Pindolin Islands
- **South**: The Crimson Coast lies below the mountains; beyond that, open southern ocean
- **West**: The southwestern coastline of Aboyinzu

#### Climate

Dragon's Spine is substantially colder than the rest of Aboyinzu, especially in its southernmost reaches. The high altitude and southern latitude combine to create a misty, often snow-covered environment. The peaks are frequently shrouded in cloud and fog, making navigation treacherous.

#### The Mountain-to-Archipelago Transition

As Dragon's Spine extends eastward, the continuous mountain range gradually breaks apart. The peaks become islands, the ridges become straits, until the mountains have fully transformed into the island chains of the eastern archipelago. The Pindolin Islands represent the farthest extent of this transition—the final fragments of Dragon's Spine scattered across the sea.

#### The Pindolin Islands

A large archipelago stretching east and then curving north into the ocean. These islands are the seaward continuation of the Dragon's Spine range, maintaining much of the cold, misty character of the mainland mountains.

### Political Climate

The Dragon's Spine is defined by three powers who mostly ignore each other:

**Kanzekill** rules the surface and sky of the western mountains—a Force dragon consumed by her four-century hunt for Mountainveil, a hidden fortress that holds her stolen true name. She doesn't demand tribute or terrorize for sport; she barely notices the surface kingdoms anymore. Her existence has narrowed to a single obsession. The locals have learned her patterns, built shelters for her rages, and developed expertise in predicting her movements. She's become predictable in her unpredictability.

**The Nydor of Emblydium** rule the deep places—dark dwarves who forge chains and instruments of oppression in lightless halls. They don't interact with Kanzekill; she can't reach their tunnels, and they have nothing she wants. They consider the dragon a convenient surface hazard that discourages rescue missions and invasion attempts. Their slave raids emerge from hidden mountain entrances, take what they need, and vanish back into the dark.

**The Surface Kingdoms** survive through adaptation and moral compromise. Dhabisa, Shunde, and Kaftaulo have learned to read dragon-sign, avoid Nydor territory, and maintain a culture of silence about Mountainveil. They don't rescue escaped slaves—doing so would draw Nydor attention. They don't speak of the hidden fortress—doing so might reach Kanzekill's ears. They've made their peace with evil to survive.

#### The Tribute System

The surface states don't pay formal tribute to either threat, but they've developed informal accommodations:

**With Kanzekill**: They stay out of her way. When she hunts, they shelter. When she rages, they rebuild. They share information about her movements freely across political boundaries, because everyone benefits from knowing where the dragon is. No one sells information about Mountainveil—not because they're noble, but because they know their neighbors would kill them before Kanzekill arrived.

**With the Nydor**: They maintain silence. They don't guide surface armies to Emblydium's entrances. They don't harbor escaped slaves conspicuously. They pretend the dark dwarves don't exist, and in exchange, the slave raids take from travelers and frontier villages rather than established settlements. It's an unspoken bargain that everyone hates and no one breaks.

#### The Hidden Players

**Mountainveil**: Somewhere in the mountains, eight hundred Vaelish descendants hide behind Force-magic misdirection, guarding the dragon's true name and waiting for... something. They've been waiting for four centuries. They have no plan beyond survival.

**The Kingdom of Vael**: Once controlled the western passes. Destroyed by Kanzekill five centuries ago. Its survivors built Mountainveil; its legacy haunts the region.

### What Makes It Interesting

The Dragon's Spine offers multiple scales of conflict:

**Personal**: A Vaelish defector with failing mind-blocks. A slave who escaped Emblydium and knows too much. A scholar who thinks they can reconstruct the name-stealing ritual.

**Regional**: The Force leyline is shifting; Mountainveil's protections are weakening. A faction inside the fortress wants to use the dragon's name as a weapon. Someone has found a map.

**Continental**: What happens when Kanzekill finds Mountainveil? What happens if someone speaks her name? What would the Nydor do with a bound dragon?

The region's stability is an illusion. Everyone is waiting for the equilibrium to break.

### What Will Go Wrong

**The Leyline Shift**: The Force leyline that protects Mountainveil has been drifting for centuries. The oldest Vaelish mages can feel the difference. The veil requires constant recalibration, and eventually, it will fail.

**Kanzekill's Patience**: Four centuries is a long time, even for a dragon. She's growing desperate, her searches more erratic, her rages more frequent. Something will break—either she finds the fortress, or she decides to start extracting information from the surface kingdoms by force.

**The Name-Speakers**: A faction within Mountainveil believes they should use the true name, bind Kanzekill, and reclaim their ancestral lands. They're gaining support. The Keepers of the Name are losing ground.

**Nydor Expansion**: The dark dwarves have been content with occasional raids, but their forges are always hungry for labor. If they decide the surface kingdoms have grown complacent, if they decide to take rather than raid, the careful balance collapses.

**The Map**: Rumors persist that a map to Mountainveil exists—created by a defector, stolen from the Council of Ash, sold to someone who doesn't understand what they have. If that map reaches Kanzekill, four centuries of hiding end in fire.

### Azanfrain

Tags: fortress, poi, gondurak, frostwatch, military

The southernmost permanent Fengruk installation, built into a spur of volcanic rock overlooking the northern Shrapnel Strait. Azanfrain exists for one purpose: watching the Pale Peaks and stopping what comes from them. For four thousand years, this fortress has been the first line of defense against frostwalkers, ice wyrms, and the possibility of something worse.

The fortress is not comfortable, not welcoming, and not meant to be. It's a military installation in the most literal sense—every design choice prioritizes function over form, defense over aesthetics, survival over anything else.

#### Location and Construction

Azanfrain perches on a promontory at the southeastern edge of the Bellowing Mountains, where the volcanic stone gives way to the frozen approaches of the Shrapnel Strait. The location was chosen for sight lines: from the highest watchtowers, observers can see the entire northern coastline of the Pale Peaks, track ice formation on the strait, and spot movement on the southern slopes.

The fortress is built primarily underground, following Fengruk architectural tradition, but here the reasons are military rather than cultural. Surface structures present targets; underground chambers don't. The visible portions of Azanfrain are limited to watchtowers, weapon emplacements, and the heavily-fortified main gate.

The stone is volcanic basalt, naturally insulated against cold and reinforced with titan-era metalwork salvaged from deeper installations. The walls are fifteen feet thick in most places, angled to deflect both physical impacts and the cold auras of frostwalkers. The architecture assumes hostile conditions and designs around them.

Geothermal vents provide heating—carefully channeled through the fortress's interior to maintain temperatures that Fengruk can work in while remaining cool enough that the outer defenses don't create thermal signatures that attract predators. The balance is precise and constantly monitored.

#### The Frostwatch Garrison

Approximately six hundred Fengruk serve in the Frostwatch at any given time—the professional military force that operates Azanfrain year-round. Garrison duty rotates every six months; longer deployments cause psychological effects the Fengruk call "ice-sight," a progressive detachment and obsessive focus on the southern horizon that makes soldiers unreliable.

The Frostwatch ranks:

**Watchers** form the basic rank—soldiers trained in observation, patrol, and basic frostwalker engagement. Most of the six hundred fall into this category.

**Hunters** specialize in ice wyrm response—harpoon crews, thermal lance operators, and the scouts who track wyrm movement through ice-ripples. Roughly sixty Fengruk hold this rank.

**Priests** maintain the spiritual and psychological health of the garrison, conduct the vigils that monitor for signs of the Cold That Hungers, and perform the memorial rites for fallen soldiers. Twenty priests serve at any time.

**The Commander** holds overall authority, reporting directly to the Council of Embers in Sildraz. The current commander is **Threkk Irontemper** (male, 180 years), a veteran of three major frostwalker incursions who is widely respected but increasingly withdrawn.

Command rotates every three years. Longer terms tend to produce commanders who see threats everywhere and nowhere, who become so focused on the watch that they forget what they're watching for.

#### Defenses

Azanfrain's defensive systems have evolved over millennia, refined by each generation based on what worked and what didn't:

**The Watchtowers** rise from the fortress's highest points, staffed continuously in rotating shifts. Each tower maintains signal fires, observation equipment, and emergency weapons. The towers can communicate with each other and with the main fortress through a system of mirrors, flags, and—in emergencies—the fortress bells.

**The Fire Lines** are trenches filled with alchemical compounds that can be ignited on command, creating barriers of flame across likely approach routes. Frostwalkers avoid fire instinctively; the lines channel them toward killing grounds where the garrison can engage effectively.

**The Harpoon Batteries** line the outer walls—heavy weapons designed to anchor ice wyrms above the ice before they can submerge. Each battery requires a crew of four and can fire three harpoons before reloading. The fortress maintains thirty operational batteries.

**The Thermal Lances** are the garrison's primary anti-frostwalker weapons—devices that project concentrated heat at effective ranges of about fifty feet. Each lance requires expensive alchemical fuel and burns out after roughly ten minutes of continuous use. The fortress maintains several hundred in reserve.

**Vibration Dampening** protects the fortress floors and surrounding ice from transmitting the footfall signatures that attract ice wyrms. The dampening uses a combination of suspended flooring, absorbent materials, and careful movement discipline.

**The Ice-Breaker Stores** contain alchemical compounds designed to prevent the strait from freezing solid or to shatter ice bridges that form despite prevention efforts. These are the garrison's most precious resource—running out means accepting whatever the frozen strait permits to cross.

#### Daily Life

Life in Azanfrain follows rigid routines designed to maintain alertness without exhausting the garrison:

**Watch Rotation** operates on four-hour shifts, ensuring fresh eyes on the approaches at all times. Off-duty soldiers train, maintain equipment, or rest in the barracks. Recreation is limited—the fortress has no tavern, no market, no entertainment beyond what soldiers bring themselves.

**Training** occurs daily, focusing on frostwalker engagement, ice wyrm response, and cold-weather survival. Every soldier must maintain proficiency with multiple weapons and demonstrate ability to function in extreme conditions.

**Maintenance** consumes significant time. The cold degrades equipment; the isolation prevents easy resupply. Soldiers learn to repair their own gear, manage fuel supplies, and improvise when standard materials aren't available.

**The Vigils** are religious observances conducted by the priests—rituals that supposedly detect disturbances in the Pale Peaks' spiritual atmosphere. Whether the vigils actually detect anything is debated; the priests insist they do, and the garrison has no way to prove otherwise.

**Food** comes from Sildraz via the supply route—preserved meats, dried vegetables, and dense breads designed for long storage. Fresh food is rare; hunting near the fortress is forbidden because the activity might attract predators.

#### The Psychological Toll

Service at Azanfrain is difficult in ways that go beyond physical hardship. The isolation, the constant vigilance, the knowledge that something terrible might emerge from the south at any moment—these pressures accumulate.

**Ice-sight** is the most common affliction: soldiers who've served too long begin to see frostwalker movement in every shadow, hear the Cold That Hungers in every wind. They become obsessive, checking the horizon constantly, unable to sleep, certain that the end is coming. Treatment requires removal from the fortress and extended recovery in warmer, more populated environments.

**The Dreams** trouble many soldiers—nightmares of the Pale Peaks, of endless cold, of watching something vast rise from the horizon. The priests say these dreams are normal, a product of anxiety and environment. Some soldiers believe they're something more.

**Casualty Management** adds another burden. When soldiers die—to frostwalker cold, ice wyrm attacks, or accidents in the harsh environment—the garrison handles their own dead. Bodies are cremated in the forge-heated chamber; ashes are eventually returned to family in the forge cities. There's no time for elaborate mourning.

The Frostwatch considers six months the maximum safe deployment before ice-sight risk becomes significant. Some soldiers request extensions anyway, unwilling to leave the watch to others. The command usually refuses.

#### The Warning System

Azanfrain's primary function is observation and warning. When threats are detected, the fortress activates a communication chain that reaches all of Gondurak within hours:

**Signal Fires** on the watchtowers can be seen from relay stations in the Bellowing Mountains proper. Different patterns indicate different threats: single fire for isolated frostwalkers, double fire for group movement, triple fire for ice wyrm activity, and the rarely-used full conflagration signal for mass incursion.

**Runners** carry detailed reports through the mountain passes to Sildraz when signal fires provide insufficient information. The run takes roughly eighteen hours in good conditions; the fortress maintains trained couriers specifically for this purpose.

**The Bells** are a last resort—massive bronze instruments that can be heard for miles, warning anyone in range that something has gone catastrophically wrong. The bells have been rung three times in recorded history.

#### Notable Features

**The Frozen Hall** is a chamber in the fortress's lower levels where captured frostwalkers are contained for study. The chamber is deliberately kept cold, which keeps the frostwalkers dormant. Scholars occasionally visit to examine specimens; the garrison considers the entire arrangement distasteful but useful.

**The Vorukar Chapel** is a small shrine where soldiers pay respects to the titan who died defending this land. The chapel contains no images or relics—just carved stone walls bearing fragments of the stonescripts that describe his final battle. Soldiers visit before and after dangerous deployments.

**The Memorial Wall** bears the names of every Frostwatch soldier killed in the line of duty—over four thousand names spanning four millennia. New names are added with solemn ceremony; the wall has been expanded three times as the list has grown.

**The Commander's Observatory** crowns the highest tower, equipped with Fengruk optical instruments that can resolve detail on the Pale Peaks slopes. The commander maintains personal watch here during critical periods.

#### Hooks

**The Captured Wyrm**: A small ice wyrm has been successfully harpoon-anchored and contained in a specially-constructed ice-pit. The commander wants to use it to study wyrm behavior; some of the garrison want to kill it before it escapes or attracts others.

**The New Commander**: Threkk Irontemper's term ends in three months, and the Council hasn't announced his replacement. Rumors suggest the leading candidate has controversial views about proactive expeditions into the Pale Peaks. The garrison is divided.

**The Broken Seal**: One of the detection stakes has gone silent—not removed, just stopped transmitting vibrations. Something destroyed it under the ice, and no one saw what. The garrison is debating whether to investigate or reinforce.

**Ice-Sight Prophecy**: A soldier deep in ice-sight has begun drawing pictures before her episodes—detailed images of the Pale Peaks that include structures no one has documented. Either she's hallucinating or she's seeing something the watchtowers can't.

**The Smuggler**: Someone in the garrison is selling information to traders—patrol schedules, defense positions, supply inventories. The commander doesn't know who, and the investigation is damaging morale at exactly the wrong time.

### Barren Hills

### Bellowing Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, gondurak, fengruk

A harsh range of peaks in the eastern Dragon's Spine, rising between the Hills of Sarrow to the north and the Pale Peaks to the south. The Bellowing Mountains are perpetually cold—snow blankets the upper slopes year-round, and the valleys rarely see temperatures above freezing even in summer. This is Gondurak, homeland of the Fengruk dwarves and site of the three great forges.

#### The Sound

The mountains earned their name from the noise they make. On still days, a deep rhythmic rumbling echoes through the valleys—not thunder, not earthquakes, but the collective hammering of the Fengruk forges reverberating through the stone. The titans built these mountains hollow, riddling them with forge-chambers and ventilation shafts that carry sound for miles. When the forges are at full operation, the entire range seems to breathe with each hammer stroke.

The effect is disorienting for first-time visitors. The sound comes from everywhere and nowhere, rising and falling in patterns that seem almost musical. Fengruk children learn the rhythms—they can identify which forge is operating, how many smiths are working, sometimes even what they're making, all from the quality of the echoes.

During the rare periods when all three forges fall silent simultaneously—for holy days or emergencies—the quiet is described as oppressive. The mountains feel wrong without their voice.

#### Geography

The Bellowing Mountains are geologically distinct from the surrounding Dragon's Spine. Where the Pale Peaks are ice-wrapped granite and the Silver Slopes are metal-veined sedimentary stone, the Bellowing Mountains are primarily volcanic—ancient basalt and pumice shot through with veins of exotic minerals. The titans chose this location deliberately; the volcanic activity provides natural heat for the deep forges, and the mineral deposits include materials found nowhere else on Alaria.

Three major peaks anchor the range: Sildraz's Crown in the center (where the World Forge burns), Durkarn's Fang to the northwest, and Morgrun's Pillar to the northeast. Between them spread lesser peaks, glacier-filled valleys, and the entrances to the dwarven cities that honeycomb the stone.

The southern slopes descend toward the Shrapnel Strait, cut by numerous streams that eventually feed into the eastern channels. The northern slopes give way to the Hills of Sarrow, a gradual transition from frozen peaks to windswept grassland. The eastern reaches extend toward the Shirik River headwaters before giving way to territories beyond Fengruk control.

#### Climate

The Bellowing Mountains sit far enough south that winter darkness lasts for months, and summer brings only a few hours of twilight rather than true night. The cold is relentless—exposed skin freezes in minutes during deep winter, and even summer temperatures hover near freezing at the lower elevations.

The Fengruk have adapted thoroughly. Their cities are almost entirely underground, warmed by forge-heat and geothermal vents. Surface structures are limited to observation posts, watchtowers, and the heavily-insulated gates that control access to the interior. Visitors who arrive expecting dwarven architecture on display find only ice-crusted rock and carefully hidden doorways.

#### The Forge Cities

**Sildraz** crowns the central peak, built around the World Forge—a titan-constructed facility capable of casting metal in quantities no other forge can match. The city is the largest Fengruk settlement, home to roughly fifteen thousand dwarves and the seat of Gondurak's government.

**Durkarn** occupies the northwestern peak, built on an ancient dragon graveyard. The forges here specialize in incorporating dragon bone and scale into metalwork, producing weapons and armor with properties that pure metal can't achieve. The city is smaller than Sildraz but arguably more influential in martial circles.

**Morgrundar** rises from the northeastern peak, built on massive deposits of Malstaric ash. The forges here work with this otherworldly material, creating items with subtle connections to the shadow plane. The work is dangerous and the results unpredictable, but demand from collectors and practitioners of dark arts keeps the forges busy.

#### Trade Routes

The primary route into Gondurak follows the eastern valleys from the Dalizi lowlands, skirting the Hills of Sarrow before ascending through a series of switchbacks to Sildraz's main gate. This route is passable most of the year, though winter storms can close it for weeks at a time.

A secondary route connects to Sweivyon and the Silver Slopes via mountain passes—shorter but steeper, used primarily by traders bringing raw silver to the Fengruk smiths. This route closes entirely during winter.

No maintained route leads south toward the Pale Peaks. The Fengruk have deliberately not built one.

#### Azanfrain

The fortress of Azanfrain sits at the southern edge of Fengruk territory, built into a spur of rock overlooking the northern Shrapnel Strait. From here, watchers monitor the ice conditions, track creature movements on the Pale Peaks slopes, and coordinate responses when frostwalkers or ice wyrms attempt to migrate north.

Azanfrain is not a comfortable posting. The garrison rotates every six months—longer deployments tend to produce psychological effects the Fengruk euphemistically call "ice-sight." But the work is necessary. Without Azanfrain, threats from the peaks would reach the forge cities unchallenged.

#### What Lies Beneath

The titan-era tunnel systems extend far deeper than the Fengruk currently occupy. The forges themselves are relatively shallow—built for titan convenience rather than dwarven preference—but shafts descend into darkness that no one has fully explored. The Fengruk have sealed most of these lower passages, not from fear of what might be down there, but from respect for whatever the titans were keeping separate from the working levels.

Occasionally, sounds rise from the sealed depths. Not forge-sounds—something else. The Fengruk don't discuss this publicly. The mountains bellow, they say. That's all.

### Findra, the Glassy Eyed

Tags: dragon, force, pindolin-islands

A Force dragon who lairs in the northeastern Pindolin Islands, on the small island northwest of Tidewatcher's Perch. Findra lost her eyes three centuries ago and replaced them with something better.

#### The Blinding

Findra doesn't discuss what happened. The few survivors of her encounters who've tried to ask received only silence—and then death, when they pressed further.

What scholars have pieced together: she fought something in the deep water between the Pindolins and the Abyssal shelf. Something that targeted her eyes specifically. She won—probably—but crawled onto her current island blind, bleeding, and furious.

She should have died. Dragons don't recover well from sensory loss; their hunting, their magic, their entire predatory existence depends on perception. A blind dragon is a dead dragon.

Findra disagreed.

#### The Eyes

She spent decades in her lair, experimenting. The Force leyline that runs through the northeastern Pindolins gave her the raw material. She harvested crystalline formations from the island's volcanic glass deposits—obsidian shot through with leyline energy, already half-attuned to kinetic forces.

The first attempts failed. The second attempts failed worse. She destroyed miles of coastline in her rages.

The eyes she eventually created aren't eyes at all. They're resonance spheres—fist-sized orbs of Force-crystallized glass that sit in her empty sockets and vibrate in response to motion. Every footfall within two miles registers. Every heartbeat. Every breath. The rhythm of waves, the settling of stone, the minute tremors of a mouse crossing rock a thousand feet below.

She doesn't see. She *feels* the world move.

#### What She Perceives

Findra's senses are simultaneously more and less than sight:

**More**: She cannot be surprised. Hidden creatures register by their heartbeats. Invisible beings still displace air. Illusions have no weight, no vibration—she ignores them entirely. In absolute darkness, in fog thick as clay, in the blinding light of noon, her perception remains unchanged.

**Less**: She has no color. No fine detail. No reading. The world comes to her as a constant wash of kinetic information—shapes defined by movement, structures revealed by the vibrations they carry. Beautiful things and ugly things feel the same. She hasn't seen a sunset in three hundred years.

The tradeoff has made her strange. Other dragons hoard gold for its gleam; Findra hoards *movement*. Her lair contains clockwork mechanisms salvaged from ships, pendulums that never stop swinging, waterfalls she's diverted through caverns just to feel the constant vibration. She keeps prisoners sometimes—not for torture, but because living things move in ways that dead things don't, and she finds the rhythm of heartbeats soothing.

#### The Obsession

Findra wants more eyes.

Her current pair works. But she's convinced better crystalline formations exist—purer Force-attuned glass, more sensitive resonance structures. She's particularly interested in the Shattering Stones of Emblydium (the Nydor won't trade with her), the Chime Crystals of the Triton deep cities (too far, too wet), and persistent rumors of a titan-era construct somewhere in the Dragon's Spine that could perceive through solid stone.

She sends servants—rarely willing ones—to investigate these leads. Most don't return. The ones who do bring fragments, samples, sometimes just descriptions. She evaluates each with obsessive attention, compares them to her current eyes, and usually finds them wanting.

The servants who bring genuinely promising samples are rewarded. The ones who waste her time are killed. The ones who try to steal her current eyes are killed slowly.

#### Hunting

Findra hunts by stillness.

She settles onto a rocky prominence and goes completely motionless—no breath, no heartbeat that she doesn't suppress, nothing but the slow cooling of stone. Then she waits. Her perception extends outward, feeling for anything that moves: ships passing through the strait, creatures crawling on distant beaches, the vibration patterns of schools of fish.

When she identifies prey worth taking, she moves in a single explosive motion—stone to sky to strike in seconds. Victims report (the few who survived initial contact) that she appeared from nowhere, from *nothing*, a shape they'd mistaken for a rock formation suddenly revealing itself as death.

She prefers prey that struggles. The vibrations of panic are more interesting than the stillness of acceptance.

#### The Lair

Findra's island has no name on any chart. Sailors call it Glassback for the obsidian formations that ridge its eastern shore, but no one lands there by choice.

The lair itself is a complex of sea-caves and volcanic tubes, extensively modified over three centuries. The entrance is underwater at high tide—visitors must time their approach or drown. Inside, the caves branch into:

**The Resonance Chamber**: A natural cavern she's enhanced with hanging crystals, taut cables, and strategic water channels. Everything in here vibrates, hums, or chimes. She spends most of her time here, surrounded by motion.

**The Collection**: A smaller cave containing her crystalline samples—hundreds of fragments from across Alaria, organized by resonance properties. Some still pulse with leyline energy. Some are just pretty rocks she can't bring herself to discard.

**The Pen**: Where she keeps living things. Currently empty. Previously held two sailors, a scholar who came seeking her voluntarily, and something she pulled from the Abyssal deep that she eventually killed because its heartbeat was irregular and the rhythm annoyed her.

#### Dealing With Findra

Findra can be bargained with, but the terms are narrow:

**She wants**: Crystalline samples with unusual resonance properties. Information about titan-era perception technology. Living prey delivered to her island (she's bored of fish). News from the surface world, which she finds entertaining in small doses.

**She won't trade**: Her current eyes, obviously. Information about what blinded her. Access to her lair for "research purposes."

**Approach carefully**: She knows you're coming before you know you're there. Attempting stealth is pointless and insults her intelligence. Attempting overwhelming force is suicide—she's been fighting for eight hundred years and hasn't lost since the blinding. Your best approach is visible, respectful, and bearing gifts.

**The eyes are a weakness**: If someone destroyed or stole her resonance spheres, she'd be blind again. Truly blind. She knows this. She has killed fourteen people who she believed were thinking about it too seriously. Whether she could create new eyes is unknown—she did it once, but she's older now, and the leyline composition has shifted.

#### What She Knows

Findra has lived in the Pindolins for three centuries and perceived more of them than any surface creature alive. She knows:

- Where Oboros, the Cunning lairs (she can feel his movement through the water leyline)
- Where Elebria sleeps (the constant volcanic tremors are unmistakable)
- The location of Tidewatcher's Perch and what happens to people who sit too long
- The migration patterns of kraken-spawn through the deep channels
- The exact rhythm of the Force leyline's pulse, which has been changing for the past decade in ways she doesn't like

She shares this information rarely and unpredictably. Sometimes she's generous with knowledge; sometimes she kills people for asking. The pattern, if there is one, relates to the resonance of the asker's heartbeat. Calm hearts get answers. Frightened hearts get eaten.

### Hills of Sarrow

Tags: hills, geography, history

Low, windswept hills stretching north of the Bellowing Mountains, marking the transition between Gondurak's territory and the broader Dragon's Spine. The Fengruk call them the Hills of Sarrow—an old word meaning grief-that-endures—and they do not settle there, though the land could support them.

#### The Famine Hills

Before the Sundering, before the Shrapnel Strait existed, the hills were called something else. Fengruk records are unclear on the original name; it was deliberately stricken from the stonescripts. What the records do preserve is the account of what happened when the titans fell.

The World Forge in Sildraz required fuel, labor, and food in quantities that a small dwarven population couldn't provide alone. During the titan era, thousands of workers from other races—humans, halflings, goblinkin, others now forgotten—lived in settlements throughout what are now the Hills of Sarrow, farming the valleys and herding the slopes to feed the forge-workers. The titans organized this system and, in their way, protected it.

When Vorukar fell and the other titans retreated, withdrew, or died, the forge-system collapsed. The Fengruk, never numerous, couldn't maintain the scale of operations the titans had demanded. They retreated to the mountain cities. The support settlements in the hills were abandoned.

What followed was slow starvation. The support populations had been organized around the forge economy—they didn't know how to survive without it. Refugees fled north toward the Dalizi highlands, but the journey was long and the hills offered little sustenance. Thousands died where they walked. The Fengruk, struggling to keep their own cities alive, offered what aid they could. It wasn't enough.

The Fengruk remember this as their great shame. They'd benefited from the titan system; they'd failed those who'd served alongside them when it ended. The name "Sarrow" is their penance—a reminder carved into every map that something unforgivable happened here.

#### The Boneyards

Mass graves dot the hills, most unmarked, some maintained by Fengruk priests who make pilgrimage from Gondurak. The largest concentration lies along the old road to the Dalizi—a route the refugees followed until they couldn't walk anymore. Fengruk tradition forbids disturbing these sites, but enforcement is difficult across such a wide area.

Grave robbers work the hills occasionally, seeking whatever valuables the dead were carrying when they collapsed. They face spiritual rather than legal consequences—the Fengruk consider the hills cursed, and superstition holds that anything taken from the boneyards brings misfortune. Whether this is actual supernatural effect or simply bad luck finding people who make poor decisions is debated.

Undead are rare but not unknown. The concentration of death, the lingering grief, and the proximity to whatever Force energies still pulse beneath the Shrapnel Strait occasionally animate corpses or spawn spectral manifestations. Fengruk patrols from the northern settlements deal with these when reported, though "dealing with" often means containment rather than destruction. The dead, they say, have suffered enough.

#### The Shirik River

The Shirik River rises in the eastern Hills of Sarrow, fed by snowmelt from the Bellowing Mountains. It flows northeast toward territories beyond Gondurak's borders, eventually reaching the sea through lands the Fengruk don't control.

The river is named for Shirik, a Fengruk priestess who walked the hills for forty years after the famine, recording the locations of the dead and performing funeral rites for those she found. Her journals, preserved in Sildraz, contain the most complete account of the disaster's scope. The river she followed during her wanderings took her name after her death.

#### Modern Use

The hills remain largely empty. A few herding families run goats through the western slopes, avoiding the known gravesites. Travelers crossing between Gondurak and the north pass through quickly, camping in designated safe zones that Fengruk patrols maintain. Trade caravans prefer the longer route through the mountain passes rather than risk the hills' reputation.

Occasionally, scholars or treasure hunters petition Gondurak for permission to excavate specific sites—usually seeking artifacts from the titan-era support settlements rather than the later refugees. The Fengruk typically refuse, though exceptions have been made for projects with clear historical value and appropriate ritual observance.

The hills are not forbidden, exactly. They're simply sad. And the Fengruk prefer to let them grieve in peace.

The dwarves of this era were master engineers of Vimlus energy, using controlled implosions to delicately extract ore from the mountain without destabilizing the surrounding rock. Their techniques were precise—decades of accumulated knowledge allowed them to harness the force leyline's fluctuations for mining with surgical accuracy.

Everything changed around 20,000 BSD when catastrophe struck. **The Collapse**—a sudden and catastrophic destabilization of the Vimlus leyline beneath the city—shattered the delicate balance the dwarves had maintained. The force leyline breached violently, and in seconds, the entire civilization was annihilated. An entire mountain range folded inward upon itself, transforming into a massive crater of impossible destruction.

The ruins of the Implosion Mines remain trapped in a state of warped physics. Gravity itself pulls inward from all directions toward the center of the crater, as if the Collapse left behind a permanent wound in the natural order. Within the ruins, **Crushers** and **Gravity Wells** drift through the devastation—artifacts and creatures born from the residual Vimlus energy, moving in strange patterns as gravity warps around them. The site is simultaneously a monument to dwarven ingenuity and a grave marker for their hubris.

Most believe everyone died in the Collapse. Most believe this.

### Kanzekill

Tags: dragon, landmark

The lair of Kanzekill, a rust-orange Force dragon who has hunted the hidden fortress of Mountainveil for over four centuries. The lair sits in the southern Dragon's Spine, near the village that bears a corruption of the dragon's name, along the Force leyline she cannot fully master.

The area around the lair experiences constant low-level tremors. Locals have learned to read these vibrations—when they intensify, Kanzekill is hunting; when they turn violent, she's lost the trail again and the mountains will shake with her fury.

For full details on the dragon herself, see [Kanzekill](../../bestiary/dragons/Kanzekill.md).

### Miramar Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography

The westernmost mountains overlooking the Shrapnel Strait, named in an old Vaelish dialect for their commanding views of the sea. The Miramar Peaks lack the mineral wealth of the Silver Slopes to the east or the forges of the Bellowing Mountains, but they control something equally valuable: sight lines.

#### The Watchposts

From the highest Miramar summits, observers can see weather systems approaching from the southern ocean, ship movements throughout the western strait, and smoke signals from as far as the Dalizi highlands to the north. Before the fall of Vael, the kingdom maintained a chain of signal towers along the Miramar ridge, capable of relaying messages across hundreds of miles in under an hour.

Most of those towers are ruins now. Kanzekill's rages have knocked down what five centuries of weather didn't, and the surface kingdoms lack the resources—or the desire to attract attention—to rebuild them. But the foundations remain, and a few of the lower towers still function as informal waypoints for travelers crossing the western Dragon's Spine.

The village of Kanzekill, perched in the eastern Miramar foothills, maintains the last operational signal tower. They use it primarily to warn neighboring settlements when the dragon is hunting, though the system has degraded to simple fire signals rather than the complex flag codes the Vaelish once employed.

#### The Slickrun Headwaters

The Slickrun originates high in the Miramar Peaks, fed by glacial melt from the permanent snowfields near the summits. The upper river is too steep and rocky for navigation, but the meltwater pools in several alpine lakes before beginning its descent to the strait. These lakes—cold, clear, and largely inaccessible—support isolated communities of herders and trappers who trade with the lowlands only a few times per year.

The largest of these lakes, Mirror Tarn, sits in a natural amphitheater at about eight thousand feet. Local tradition holds that the tarn's surface can show glimpses of distant places under the right conditions—a claim that has attracted occasional visits from scholars interested in scrying magic. None have documented verifiable results, but the legend persists.

#### Crossing the Miramar

Two viable passes cut through the Miramar range. The Slickrun Gap follows the river valley down to the strait coast, requiring no climbing but considerable care on the polished stone. The High Shoulder crosses the ridge at about six thousand feet, offering a faster route but demanding real mountaineering skill.

Neither route is safe during Kanzekill's active hunting periods. The dragon uses the Miramar thermals for altitude, and she's been known to snatch travelers from exposed positions. Locals time their crossings around her patterns, watching for the warning signals from the towers that still function.

### Mountainveil

Tags: fortress, hidden, force-leyline, vael

A hidden fortress in the southern Dragon's Spine, built four centuries ago by survivors of the Kingdom of Vael after Kanzekill destroyed their realm. Mountainveil uses the Force leyline to render itself unfindable—not invisible, but *unreachable*, surrounded by subtle misdirections that turn away anyone who draws near.

#### The Veil

Mountainveil doesn't hide behind walls or illusions. It hides behind *redirection*.

The Force leyline runs directly beneath the fortress, and Vael's mages learned to tap it in ways no one has replicated since. The effect is subtle: travelers approaching Mountainveil find their attention wandering. The path they were following seems less promising. Another route looks better. They turn aside, confident in their decision, never realizing they've been pushed.

The effect intensifies with proximity. Those who resist the initial misdirection find stronger compulsions—sudden exhaustion, disorientation, the unshakeable sense that they've already searched this area and found nothing. Even dragons aren't immune. Kanzekill has passed within a mile of Mountainveil dozens of times, her Force-attuned senses screaming that something is *there*, but the veil turns her aside every time.

The cruelest refinement: the fortress uses Kanzekill's own element against her. Her attunement to Force magic, which should help her detect the leyline's manipulation, instead makes her more susceptible. She can feel the wrongness but cannot pinpoint it. The veil speaks her language and lies in it.

#### The Fortress

Mountainveil itself is unremarkable—a stone fortress built into a cliffside, large enough to house perhaps a thousand people, supplied by mountain streams and terraced gardens hidden in the surrounding peaks. It was constructed in haste by refugees who expected pursuit, and it shows: functional architecture, minimal ornamentation, everything designed for concealment and defense.

What makes Mountainveil extraordinary is what it contains:

**The Survivors of Vael**: Descendants of the kingdom Kanzekill destroyed, now five centuries removed from the original refugees. They've maintained their identity, their rituals, and their purpose: keep the dragon's name hidden, keep the fortress secret, wait for... something. The original plan, if there was one, has been lost to time. Now they simply endure.

**The Enumerable Riches**: The treasure Kanzekill seeks isn't gold—it's the accumulated knowledge of Vael, including the ritual that stole her true name. Books, artifacts, magical implements salvaged during the flight. And somewhere among them, the vessel containing the name itself.

**The Weapon**: Anyone who holds Kanzekill's true name could theoretically command her. The Vaelish have never used this power—speaking the name would reveal the fortress's existence—but they've maintained the capability for four hundred years. If the dragon ever finds them, they have one final defense.

#### The People

The Vaelish number perhaps eight hundred, descended from the few thousand who survived Vael's destruction. They're insular by necessity, suspicious of outsiders, and bound by traditions that have calcified over centuries of isolation.

Life in Mountainveil is structured around secrecy. Children learn never to speak of the fortress to strangers. Trade with the outside world happens through intermediaries who don't know where their Vaelish contacts live. The few who leave—and some do, unable to bear the isolation—are given rituals to forget the fortress's location, mental blocks that activate if anyone tries to extract the information.

The Keepers of the Name are a hereditary priesthood who maintain the vessel containing Kanzekill's true name. They alone know how to speak it, how to command the dragon, how to destroy the name if the fortress falls. They've never used this knowledge. They hope they never will.

Leadership falls to the Council of Ash—seven elders who make decisions for the community. They're conservative, cautious, and terrified of change. For four hundred years, their strategy has been simple: hide, wait, survive. They have no plan for what comes next.

#### What Will Go Wrong

Mountainveil is stable but stagnant. Several pressures threaten to shatter the equilibrium:

**The Leyline Shifts**: Force leylines aren't permanent. They drift over centuries, and the one beneath Mountainveil has been moving—slowly, imperceptibly, but the oldest mages can feel the difference. The veil requires constant adjustment. Eventually, the leyline may shift enough that the fortress's protections fail entirely.

**Generational Drift**: The younger Vaelish didn't choose this life. They were born into hiding, raised on stories of a kingdom destroyed before their great-great-grandparents were born, taught to fear a dragon they've never seen. Some question the purpose. Some want to leave. Some wonder if Kanzekill even still hunts them.

**The Name's Temptation**: Controlling a dragon would mean power beyond imagining. Not everyone in Mountainveil believes that power should remain unused. Factions have formed—those who want to speak the name, bind Kanzekill, and use her as a weapon to reclaim their ancestral lands. The Keepers resist, but the pressure grows.

**Outside Discovery**: The surface kingdoms know Mountainveil exists as rumor. If someone found proof—a map, a captured Vaelish, a lucky guess—and sold that information to Kanzekill, four centuries of hiding would end in fire and thunder.

#### Hooks

- **The Defector**: A young Vaelish has fled Mountainveil, their mind-blocks failing. They know where the fortress is—or they know enough to lead someone close. Kanzekill would pay anything for this information. The Vaelish would kill to prevent its spread.

- **The Shifting Leyline**: The Force leyline has moved enough that Mountainveil's protections are weakening. The Council needs outside help—a mage who understands leylines, someone who can recalibrate the veil. But bringing an outsider inside means trusting them with everything.

- **The Name-Speakers**: A faction within Mountainveil has decided to use the name. They'll bind Kanzekill and send her against their enemies—the Nydor, perhaps, or a surface kingdom that wronged them. The Keepers are trying to stop them, but they're outnumbered.

- **Kanzekill's Ultimatum**: The dragon has captured someone who claims to know where Mountainveil is. She offers a trade: bring her proof of the fortress's location, and she'll spare the region. Refuse, and she begins systematic destruction until someone talks.

#### Location

Mountainveil lies somewhere in the southern Dragon's Spine, within a day's flight of Kanzekill's lair. The exact location is unknown to everyone outside the fortress—and to most inside, who have never left and couldn't retrace the route if they tried.

The Force leyline passes directly beneath it, continuing east toward the city-state that bears the fortress's name: Mountainveil the city, which has no connection to Mountainveil the fortress beyond an ironic coincidence of naming.

### Pale Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography, frontier

The southernmost mountains of the Dragon's Spine, rising beyond the Shrapnel Strait in a wall of ice-sheathed stone. The Pale Peaks mark the edge of the known world in this region—beyond them lies only the southern polar waste, a frozen expanse that no expedition has successfully crossed. The Fengruk of Azanfrain watch these mountains constantly, because what lives in them occasionally decides to come north.

#### The Color of Death

The peaks earned their name from the quality of light that reflects off their ice-fields. The glaciers here are ancient, compressed over millennia into ice so dense it absorbs most color, reflecting back only a cold, gray-white pallor. Even in full sunlight, the Pale Peaks look drained, as if something has leached the warmth from the stone itself.

Fengruk geologists attribute this to the ice composition—high mineral content creates optical effects unlike normal glaciers. Local superstition offers a different explanation: the peaks are pale because they're dead. Whatever vital force animates the rest of the world doesn't reach this far south. The mountains are corpses, and corpses don't hold color.

#### The Frozen Frontier

The Pale Peaks are technically traversable during summer months, when the ice retreats enough to expose passes through the range. Explorers have documented routes leading south, mapped the near glaciers, and catalogued the wildlife—mostly arctic-adapted predators and the herds of ice-dwelling ungulates they hunt.

No one has returned from attempting to cross the polar waste beyond. Expeditions that venture more than a hundred miles south of the peaks simply vanish. The Fengruk stopped sending exploratory parties three centuries ago after losing four in succession. They've concluded that whatever lies beyond the Pale Peaks doesn't want to be found.

#### The Threats

Azanfrain exists because the Pale Peaks occasionally disgorge creatures that don't belong in the warmer north. The Fengruk classify these threats into two broad categories:

**Frostwalkers** are humanoid figures of animated ice and frozen flesh—not undead in the traditional sense, but not alive either. They appear during deep winter, crossing the frozen strait in groups of three to twelve, and seem drawn toward heat sources. A frostwalker that reaches a settlement will attempt to extinguish every fire, kill every warm-blooded creature, and freeze every building before moving on to the next target. They don't communicate, don't negotiate, and don't retreat.

The Fengruk believe frostwalkers are corpses animated by the polar cold itself—bodies of explorers and animals that died in the southern waste, somehow preserved and mobilized by whatever force rules there. This theory is unproven but widely accepted.

**Ice wyrms** are serpentine creatures ranging from twenty to over a hundred feet in length, capable of swimming through ice as easily as fish swim through water. They're not dragons—they have no wings, no breath weapons, no apparent intelligence—but they're large enough and dangerous enough that the distinction matters little when one surfaces beneath a village.

Ice wyrms hunt by vibration, targeting the movement of feet on frozen ground. They surface, strike, and submerge in seconds. Azanfrain's fortifications include vibration-dampening floors and specialized harpoons designed to anchor in ice-wyrm hide before the creature can retreat.

#### What Killed Vorukar

Fengruk mythology holds that the titan Vorukar fell fighting something that emerged from the Pale Peaks during an ancient winter—something far larger and more terrible than the frostwalkers and ice wyrms that occasionally trouble the modern era. The stonescripts don't name this enemy; they describe it only as "the Cold That Hungers."

Whether this entity still exists, whether it's connected to the ongoing threats from the peaks, and whether the Sundering somehow wounded or contained it—these questions have occupied Fengruk scholars for millennia. The priests of Azanfrain maintain vigil partly in case the answer is yes. They watch for signs of something worse than frostwalkers. They hope they never see them.

#### The Ice Bridge

During the coldest winters, the Shrapnel Strait freezes solid enough to walk on. This creates a temporary land bridge between the Pale Peaks and the rest of the Dragon's Spine—a bridge that frostwalkers and occasionally ice wyrms use to migrate north.

Azanfrain's garrison doubles during freeze periods, and the fortress maintains stocks of alchemical fire specifically for breaking ice bridges before they fully form. The goal is to maintain enough open water that creatures from the peaks can't simply walk north. This works most years. Some years, the cold comes too fast.

#### The Bleached Ruins

Several structures dot the northern slopes of the Pale Peaks—walls, foundations, the remains of towers. They're clearly artificial, clearly ancient, and clearly built by something other than Fengruk. The stonework is too large, the architecture too alien. The structures are thoroughly frozen, covered in permanent ice that no summer thaw has ever removed.

The Fengruk don't know who built them or why. They don't investigate. Some doors, they say, are better left frozen shut.

### Pindolin Islands

Tags: island, geography, pindolin-islands

A sprawling archipelago stretching roughly 800 miles east-to-west and 500 miles north-to-south off the Dragon's Spine Coast, where the mountain range fragments into the sea and eventually dissolves into the Abyssal Ocean. The Pindolins are cold, misty, dragon-haunted, and almost entirely uninhabited by anything that wants to stay that way.

#### Geography

The islands are the drowned peaks of the Dragon's Spine—the same volcanic mountain range that dominates southern Aboyinzu, here broken apart by ancient seismic activity and scattered across hundreds of miles of ocean. Individual islands range from massive (some over a hundred miles long) to barely-rocks poking above the waves.

**The Western Pindolins**: Larger islands, closer to the mainland, connected by relatively navigable straits. This is where the few human settlements attempted to establish themselves before the dragons made that impractical.

**The Central Pindolins**: The densest cluster, a maze of channels, hidden coves, and fog-shrouded passages. Three leylines converge here—Water, Force, and the combined Earth-Fire line that runs south. Navigation is treacherous even without the dragons.

**The Eastern Pindolins (Nazish)**: The far reaches, where islands become sparse and the Abyssal shelf drops away into true oceanic depth. Local sailors call this region "Nazish"—an old word meaning roughly "where the map ends." Few return from deep exploration here.

#### Climate

Cold and wet. The Pindolins sit in a permanent collision zone between the warm Abyssal currents and the cold air masses that sweep down from the Dragon's Spine. The result is fog—thick, persistent fog that can reduce visibility to arm's length for days at a time.

The fog isn't always natural. Near leyline convergences, it thickens into something almost solid, resistant to wind, occasionally dense enough to suffocate. Locals call these patches "choke-banks" and navigate around them by sound and instinct. Visitors blunder in and sometimes don't blunder out.

Rain is constant but rarely heavy—a perpetual drizzle that soaks everything without the drama of actual storms. When real storms do hit, they're violent enough to reshape coastlines. The islands are riddled with sea-caves carved by millennia of wave action.

#### The Three Dragons

The Pindolins are claimed by three dragons who mostly ignore each other's existence:

**Findra, the Glassy Eyed** holds the northeastern islands, near where the Force leyline runs strongest. A blind dragon who sees through crystalline resonance spheres, perceiving motion and vibration rather than light. She's been here three centuries and considers the region her laboratory for sensory experimentation.

**Oboros, the Cunning** lairs in the central islands along the Water leyline. A blue-scaled dragon associated with currents, depths, and the manipulation of liquid. He's the oldest of the three, the most patient, and the most likely to bargain rather than attack—though his bargains tend to favor him significantly.

**Elebria** claims the southwestern islands where the Earth and Fire leylines intersect—a region of volcanic activity, thermal vents, and lava that occasionally reaches the surface. She's a lava dragon, her scales shifting between black stone and molten orange depending on her temperature. The most territorial of the three; entering her claimed waters is effectively suicide.

The dragons have established an informal truce through mutual disinterest. Their territories don't overlap meaningfully, their hunting grounds are distinct, and none of them wants what the others have. This could change if circumstances shifted—a new dragon arriving, a leyline moving, or external pressure forcing cooperation or conflict.

#### The Leylines

Three elemental leylines cross the Pindolins:

**The Force Leyline** enters from the Dragon's Spine mainland and runs through the northeastern islands before dissipating into the Abyssal Ocean. Effects include gravitational anomalies (objects weighing more or less than they should), kinetic storage (things that should fall staying suspended), and occasional spontaneous acceleration of loose objects.

**The Water Leyline** runs roughly north-south through the central islands. Effects include current manipulation (water moving against wind and tide), temperature instability (freezing patches in warm water, boiling spots in cold), and the enhancement of water-based magic. Oboros has learned to ride this leyline like a highway.

**The Earth-Fire Convergence** enters from the south and intensifies as the two leylines approach intersection in Elebria's territory. Effects include volcanic activity, thermal vents, occasional lava flows, and the creation of obsite—a glass-like volcanic stone that holds heat indefinitely.

Where leylines cross or approach each other, effects compound unpredictably. The central Pindolins contain at least three major convergence zones, all of which are considered impassable by sane navigators.

#### Creatures

The Pindolins host an ecosystem adapted to cold, fog, and magical instability:

**Fog-Stalkers**: Colonial organisms that exist as distributed awareness through fog banks. They're not intelligent individually, but a sufficiently large fog-stalker colony can coordinate hunting behavior across miles of mist. Prey enters the fog; the fog notices; tendrils of denser vapor guide the prey toward the colony's digestive core. Most victims never see what kills them.

**Kraken-Spawn**: The Abyssal Ocean hosts kraken-matriarchs in its deepest trenches. Their offspring—smaller, stupider, but still building-sized—drift into Pindolin waters following warm currents. A kraken-spawn can capsize a ship by accident; they can destroy one deliberately when hungry or territorial.

**Thermoclaws**: Crustaceans adapted to the volcanic southern islands, ranging from crab-sized to horse-sized. Their shells incorporate obsite, retaining heat from thermal vents. A large thermoclaw can crack steel with its pincers and survives being submerged in freezing water by simply radiating stored heat until the water around it boils.

**Glass Eels**: Found near Force leyline concentrations, these transparent eels are effectively invisible in water. They hunt by kinetic sense, detecting the vibrations of swimming prey. A school can strip a whale to bones in minutes. Findra considers them pests and kills them when she notices them, which isn't often enough.

**Silt-Singers**: Bottom-dwelling creatures in the deeper channels that produce low-frequency sounds as part of their mating displays. The sounds travel through water and stone, sometimes resonating with leyline energies to produce hallucinations in surface-dwellers. Sailors who hear silt-singers for too long report seeing phantom ships, lost loved ones, or "the thing that waits below."

#### Why Anyone Comes Here

The Pindolins are not a destination. They're a place people end up through desperation, greed, or terrible navigation:

**Hiding**: The islands are effectively lawless and nearly impossible to search systematically. Fugitives, pirates, and people fleeing worse fates than dragons occasionally establish temporary camps. Most don't survive long, but some do, and the Pindolins don't ask questions.

**Hunting**: The three dragons represent enormous bounties to anyone capable of claiming them. Dragon-hunters occasionally mount expeditions, usually funded by mainland lords with more money than sense. Success rate is approximately zero.

**Harvesting**: The islands produce rare materials unavailable anywhere else. Force-crystallized obsidian from Findra's territory. Obsite from the volcanic south. Kraken-bone from spawn that wash up dead. Fog-stalker cores, if you can kill one without being digested. The profit margins are extraordinary for anyone who survives.

**Consulting Korvo**: Tidewatcher's Perch holds a man with perfect navigational knowledge of every sea in Alaria. Reaching him requires surviving the journey. Getting information requires resisting the urge to sit down.

#### Navigation

The Pindolins are not charted in any meaningful sense. The fog makes visual navigation impossible for days at a time. Currents shift with leyline fluctuations. Islands occasionally sink or rise as volcanic activity reshapes the seabed.

Successful navigation requires:
- **Local knowledge**: Guides who've survived the islands long enough to learn their patterns (rare and expensive)
- **Magical assistance**: Water mages can read currents; Force mages can sense the leyline; anyone with fog-penetrating senses has an advantage
- **Luck**: Honestly, mostly luck

The safest approach is to skirt the edges—the western islands are survivable with caution. Going deep into the archipelago is a commitment. Going into Nazish is a death wish unless you have a very specific reason and the means to survive it.

#### Nazish (The Eastern Reaches)

The far eastern Pindolins, where islands become scattered and the Abyssal shelf drops away into true oceanic depth. Local sailors named it "Nazish"—an archaic term for the edge of the known world.

Nazish is where the Pindolins stop pretending to be survivable:

**The Abyssal Shelf**: The ocean floor drops from hundreds of feet to thousands over the span of a few miles. Things live in that depth that don't come up to the shallows. When they do come up, it's rarely good.

**The Fog Wall**: A permanent bank of fog marks the approximate boundary of Nazish, possibly a fog-stalker super-colony or a leyline effect no one has successfully studied. Ships that enter don't always emerge.

**The Empty Islands**: Nazish contains islands. Some are large enough to support ecosystems. All of them are uninhabited by anything visible. Expeditions that land report finding signs of habitation—fire pits, cleared paths, structures—but never occupants. Where the builders went is unclear. That they left quickly is obvious.

#### History

The Pindolins have been continuously dangerous for as long as anyone has tried to settle them:

**The Vaelish Expansion** (~600 years ago): When Vael controlled the Dragon's Spine passes, they attempted to establish trading posts in the western Pindolins. Most failed within a decade. The survivors fled when Kanzekill began her rampage on the mainland.

**The Dragon Settlement** (~300-500 years ago): Elebria was first, claiming the volcanic south. Oboros arrived perhaps a century later, taking the central waters. Findra is the newest, establishing herself after whatever blinded her drove her to these shores.

**The Present**: The Pindolins exist in a stable state of danger. No nations claim them. No powers contest them. The dragons ignore each other, the creatures hunt what they can, and the islands wait for anyone foolish enough to visit.

### Rivers of the Shrapnel Coast

Tags: rivers, geography

Three major rivers drain the central Dragon's Spine into the Shrapnel Strait, each with distinct character shaped by the terrain it traverses. The Fengruk name them collectively the "Three Veins of Vorukar," claiming they follow channels carved by the titan's blood as it poured from the Sundering wound.

#### Slickrun

The westernmost river descends from the Miramar Peaks through a channel of metamorphic stone polished to an almost glassy smoothness by millennia of meltwater. The Slickrun earns its name from this stone—and from the speed of the current, which moves far faster than its placid surface suggests.

Travelers who attempt to ford the Slickrun often don't survive the experience. The smooth riverbed offers no purchase, and what looks like knee-deep water can sweep a person off their feet and carry them half a mile before depositing them against a rock or into the strait. Local guides mark safe crossing points with cairns, but the markers shift seasonally as the river's channel migrates.

The Slickrun's mouth opens into a relatively calm bay on the western edge of the strait, where the fishing village of Polished Stone has grown up around the pilot trade. The villagers have developed a unique method of "skating" the river using flat-bottomed sledges, riding the current down from the mountains in a fraction of the time it takes to climb back up.

#### Sunbeam River

The central river flows down from the Silver Slopes, and its name requires no explanation to anyone who sees it at midday. The riverbed is dense with mica, pyrite, and actual silver flake—runoff from the mining operations around Sweivyon. When the sun hits the water at the right angle, the entire river blazes with reflected light, visible for miles.

Sweivyon has built its economy partly on controlling Sunbeam River access. The city-state operates a series of sluice gates and settling pools upstream, capturing the heavier metals before they wash out to sea. What escapes the sluices supports a secondary economy of "glitter-panners"—independent prospectors who work the lower river and strait-mouth, recovering what Sweivyon's filters miss.

The Sunbeam is navigable for shallow-draft vessels up to about fifteen miles inland, where rapids begin. A portage road connects the navigable lower river to Sweivyon proper, facilitating the silver trade. The river-mouth settlement of Glintwater serves as Sweivyon's de facto port.

#### River of Blades

The easternmost river has earned its grim name honestly. It flows through the Glass Fields—a stretch of volcanic obsidian that the Sundering exposed and subsequent eruptions expanded. The riverbed is littered with natural glass shards ranging from pebble-sized splinters to blade-length fragments, all edges keen enough to slice leather.

No one boats the River of Blades. The glass would shred any hull within minutes. Fording is possible only at specific points where the Fengruk have laid down iron grates, and even then, a fall means cuts that take weeks to fully heal. The river runs red after storms, not from mineral content but from the blood of animals foolish enough to drink from its banks.

Despite—or because of—its dangers, the River of Blades attracts a specific clientele. Weaponsmiths prize volcanic obsidian for certain ritual blades, and the Glass Fields produce some of the finest natural specimens in Alaria. Collection expeditions from Durkarn make the journey several times a year, harvesting glass under the protection of heavily armored handlers. The obsidian trade is small but lucrative.

The river empties into the strait through a delta of black sand—pulverized glass worn down by the current. The delta settlement, if it can be called that, is a seasonal camp of obsidian traders and the few pilots willing to navigate the eastern strait channels. They call the place Blackmouth, and it has no permanent structures.

#### The Confluence Myth

Local legend holds that the three rivers once met underground before emerging as a single waterway, and that the Sundering split them apart along with the mountain. Some Fengruk scholars believe the titans built something at the original confluence point—a structure now buried beneath the strait or hidden in the subterranean channels that still connect the river systems.

Expeditions to find this theoretical "Confluence Hall" have produced nothing conclusive, though cave systems beneath all three river valleys do show signs of ancient worked stone. Whether this represents titan construction or merely Fengruk ancestors remains disputed.

### Shrapnel Strait

Tags: strait, geography, force-leyline

A violent gash of water separating the central Dragon's Spine from the Pale Peaks to the south. The strait earned its name from the thousands of rock fragments—some the size of houses, others large enough to support small fishing villages—that litter the waterway like debris from an explosion. Which, according to the Fengruk, is exactly what they are.

#### The Sundering

The Fengruk of Gondurak maintain records dating to the Second Eon, when titans still walked the mountains. According to their stonescribes, the Shrapnel Strait didn't exist until the titan Vorukar—a Force-attuned colossus who helped build the World Forge—fell in battle against something that came from the Pale Peaks. The killing blow triggered a catastrophic release of Force energy that shattered the mountain range, punching a wound through the Dragon's Spine that the sea rushed in to fill.

Whether this account is literally true or Fengruk mythology dressed as history, the physical evidence supports a violent origin. The coastline is impossibly jagged, as if the land was broken rather than eroded. The rock fragments throughout the strait show stress fractures consistent with explosive force. And the Force leyline that runs through this region passes directly beneath the deepest point of the strait—a coincidence that seems too precise to be accidental.

#### Navigation

Sailors call the Shrapnel Strait "the Splinter Sea" and approach it with justified caution. The scattered rock formations create a maze of channels, some navigable, many not, and the configuration shifts with storms and tides. Experienced pilots can thread the main passages, but taking a wrong turn can leave a ship trapped in a dead-end cove or gutted on submerged stone teeth.

Three rivers empty into the strait from the north: the Slickrun in the west, the Sunbeam River in the center, and the River of Blades in the east. Each river mouth has developed its own small harbor culture—fisherfolk and traders who know the local channels and guide vessels through for a fee.

The strait freezes in deep winter, creating a temporary land bridge to the Pale Peaks. The Fengruk of Azanfrain watch these freeze-periods carefully. Things cross when the ice is thick enough.

#### The Splinter Villages

Dozens of inhabited rock formations dot the strait, ranging from single-family fishing platforms to settlements of several hundred. These "splinter villages" are technically independent, owing allegiance to no state, though Sweivyon in the Silver Slopes claims loose authority over the northern clusters. The villagers are insular, superstitious, and excellent swimmers—they raise children who can navigate the underwater maze of submerged rock as easily as surface channels.

The largest splinter village, Vorukar's Tooth, sits on a pillar of stone that rises nearly two hundred feet above the waterline. Local tradition holds that this was once the titan's actual tooth, expelled during the Sundering. The stone is unusually dense and resonates faintly when struck—properties the villagers have learned to exploit, using the tooth as a fog-bell that can be heard for miles.

#### What Lies Below

The deepest point of the strait—called the Sundering Hole by pilots, the Wound by the Fengruk—drops over a thousand feet straight down. No one has successfully mapped it. Divers who descend past three hundred feet report hearing sounds: rhythmic pulses that might be water currents or might be something breathing. The Force leyline passes directly through this depth.

The Fengruk believe Vorukar's remains lie at the bottom. They don't mount expeditions to find out. Some things, they say, are better left buried.

### Silver Slopes

Tags: mountains, geography, mining

A mineral-rich stretch of the central Dragon's Spine where silver veins run so thick that exposed rock faces gleam in sunlight. The Silver Slopes have attracted miners for as long as anyone can remember, and the city-state of Sweivyon has grown wealthy controlling access to the richest deposits.

#### The Silver Seams

The geology here differs from the surrounding Dragon's Spine. Whatever forces created the Shrapnel Strait—the Fengruk blame the titan Vorukar's death—also heaved deep mineral deposits to the surface. Silver is the most abundant, but the slopes also yield lead, zinc, and occasional pockets of raw gemstones. The Sunbeam River carries so much mineral runoff that its bed glitters.

Mining operations dot the slopes at various elevations, from small family claims worked with picks and baskets to industrial excavations employing hundreds. Sweivyon regulates the larger operations through a licensing system, collecting fees and mandating safety standards that are routinely ignored. Smaller claims operate in a legal gray zone—technically requiring permits, practically too numerous and remote to police.

The highest-quality silver comes from the deep mines near Sweivyon itself, where the veins run pure enough to require minimal refining. This "slope silver" commands premium prices in markets across Alaria, prized by jewelers and alchemists for its purity. The city-state guards its reputation jealously, assaying all exports and branding approved ingots with the Sweivyon stamp.

#### Working the Slopes

Mining the Silver Slopes is dangerous work. The rock is unstable—riddled with the same fractures that characterize the Shrapnel Strait coastline—and cave-ins claim lives every season. The altitude brings harsh weather, and the remoter claims can be cut off by snow for months at a time. Bandits prey on ore shipments, and the occasional monster wanders up from the deeper tunnels.

Despite this, the slopes attract a steady stream of fortune-seekers. A good strike can set a family up for generations. A mediocre strike can still fund a comfortable retirement. Even a poor strike usually produces enough to pay off debts and try again somewhere else. The mathematics of hope keeps the camps populated.

The mining camps have developed their own rough culture: claims courts that settle disputes, mutual aid societies that care for injured miners, informal militias that patrol the roads. Sweivyon provides oversight in theory, but the city-state's authority diminishes rapidly with distance from its walls.

#### The Sunbeam Catchment

Sweivyon has constructed an elaborate system of sluices and settling pools along the upper Sunbeam River, capturing mineral wealth that would otherwise wash down to the strait. The catchment system employs hundreds—dredgers, sluice operators, refiners, guards—and produces a significant fraction of the city-state's income.

The catchment also serves a political function. By controlling what reaches the lower river, Sweivyon limits the opportunities for independent prospectors to profit from runoff. This has created tension with the glitter-panners who work the river mouth, and occasional conflicts over water rights have escalated to violence.

#### Relation to Neighbors

The Silver Slopes sit between the Miramar Peaks to the west and the Bellowing Mountains to the east. Sweivyon maintains cordial trade relations with Gondurak—Fengruk metalwork complements slope silver nicely—while keeping a wary distance from the Miramar region and its dragon problems. Kanzekill has never shown interest in the slopes' mineral wealth, but Sweivyon's leaders prefer not to test that indifference.

### Sweivyon

Tags: city-state, settlement, silver-slopes

A city-state of approximately twelve thousand occupying a defensible shelf between two peaks in the Silver Slopes. The city controls the region's richest silver deposits and dominates the precious metal trade throughout the southern Dragon's Spine.

#### Location

Sweivyon sits at roughly 6,500 feet elevation, accessible only through a handful of mountain passes that ice over completely during winter months. The Sunbeam River originates in glaciers above the city and flows south toward the Shrapnel Strait, carrying mineral runoff that the city captures through an elaborate catchment system.

The city's de facto port is Glintwater, a smaller settlement at the Sunbeam's mouth where the river becomes navigable. A portage road connects the two.

#### Character

Sweivyon smells like money and sulfur—the refineries run constantly, and the wealth shows in silver-inlaid architecture, ostentatious markets, and the calculating demeanor of a population raised to think in terms of investments and returns.

### Tidewatcher's Perch

Tags: poi, pindolin-islands, curse

A wooden platform on the highest point of an unnamed island in the central Pindolins, where a man has been watching the tides for eleven hundred years because he won a bet and can't stop.

#### The Wager

His name was Korvo Maelish, and he was a navigator. A good one—possibly the best of his generation, definitely the most arrogant. He could read currents, predict storms, and calculate tidal patterns with uncanny accuracy. He bragged about it constantly.

Something heard him.

The stories don't agree on what. Some say a kraken-matriarch surfaced alongside his ship and spoke in a voice like grinding coral. Others claim it was something older, something that lived in the tidal patterns themselves. One account says it was just a stranger in a port tavern, a woman with eyes like still water who smiled when Korvo boasted.

Whatever it was, it made him an offer: predict the tides correctly for one hundred years, and receive a navigator's perfect knowledge—every current, every storm, every safe passage in every sea. Fail once, and belong to the deep forever.

Korvo accepted. He was that certain.

#### The Victory

He won.

For one hundred years, Korvo sat on this island and predicted every tide. High tide, low tide, neap tide, spring tide—the exact minute, the exact height, accounting for storms and earthquakes and the gravitational pull of both moons. He built the platform himself in the first year. He carved tally marks into the wood. He watched.

By year thirty, his crew had abandoned him. By year fifty, everyone who knew his name was dead. By year eighty, he'd stopped speaking aloud because there was no one to hear. But he kept predicting. He kept *winning*.

On the final day of the hundredth year, the tide came in exactly as he'd said it would: seventeen minutes past the fourth hour, three feet above the median line, carrying the corpse of a whale that had died somewhere in the Abyssal current. The bet was over. He'd won.

The prize never came.

#### The Terms

Korvo had been so focused on winning that he hadn't considered what "navigator's perfect knowledge" actually meant. He'd assumed it was something that would be *given* to him—a gift, a blessing, knowledge poured into his mind.

Instead, he discovered he couldn't stop.

The knowledge was there. He could feel it—every current in every sea, every tide that would ever rise or fall. But accessing it required *watching*. The moment he looked away from the water, the moment he stopped predicting, the knowledge began to fade. And the terms of the bet hadn't included an ending clause.

He'd won the right to perfect knowledge. He hadn't won the right to stop having it.

#### The Perch Today

Korvo Maelish is still there.

He sits on a wooden platform that shouldn't have survived a century of salt air, let alone eleven of them. The wood is gray and smooth, worn by wind rather than rot. The chair is simple—he built it himself, and he's rebuilt it several times when storms took it, always in the same design because changing anything feels wrong now.

He doesn't eat. He doesn't sleep. He doesn't die. These things require looking away from the water, and he can't look away from the water.

Visitors describe him as thin but not skeletal, weathered but not decayed. His eyes are open and focused on the horizon. His lips move constantly, mouthing numbers and predictions in a language that stopped being spoken eight centuries ago. If you get close enough, you can hear him: *"Seven minutes, two feet four inches, eastward current at four knots carrying debris from the Shallows..."*

He's aware of visitors. Sometimes.

#### Interaction

Approaching the Perch is safe. Korvo doesn't attack, doesn't threaten, doesn't even seem to notice most people. He's watching the tides.

Speaking to him occasionally produces responses. He'll answer questions about navigation, currents, and safe passages with perfect accuracy—but only if you can get his attention between predictions, which means waiting for a moment of calm water (rare in the Pindolins) and speaking quickly before the next tide shift captures him.

**The danger is sitting down.**

The chair holds one person. Korvo sits in it. But sometimes, when visitors come, he shifts slightly—just enough to make room. An invitation, or an accident, or a reflex he doesn't control anymore.

People who sit with him start watching the tides. Just for a moment, they tell themselves. Just to see what he sees. The knowledge is *there*, right there, every current in every sea—

Three visitors have sat down in recorded history. None have stood up. They're part of the Perch now, still watching, still predicting, pressed against Korvo on a chair that somehow has room for all of them.

#### What He Knows

Korvo Maelish has perfect navigational knowledge of every sea in Alaria. He knows:

- Safe passages through the Abyssal currents that no living navigator has discovered
- The movement patterns of every kraken-matriarch in the southern oceans
- Where the Seafloor Giants walk and when they surface
- Exactly when and where the next major storm will strike any coastline
- The location of every ship that's sunk in Pindolin waters for the past eleven centuries

Getting this information out of him is the challenge. He can't write it down—that would require looking away. He can barely speak it—the predictions take priority. The most successful method involves asking very specific questions during the brief calm periods and transcribing his mumbled answers quickly.

Some navigators make the journey specifically to consult him. Most don't survive the Pindolins long enough to reach the Perch. The ones who do, and who resist the urge to sit, sometimes come away with knowledge worth the trip.

#### The Question No One Asks

Whatever made the bet with Korvo is still out there. It got what it wanted—a perfect navigator, watching forever, bound to the tides it perhaps embodies or controls.

But the bet had terms. Korvo won. The prize was promised.

Some scholars theorize that the entity *can't* give the prize until Korvo stops watching—creating an impossible loop. Others suggest the knowledge itself was always the trap, and the entity never intended to offer anything else. A few believe Korvo could break free if he simply chose to look away, accepting the loss of knowledge he's spent eleven centuries accumulating.

Korvo has never tried. He won the bet. He's not giving up now.

## Crimson Coast

The Crimson Coast earns its name honestly. This is a land stained by centuries of bloodshed—ancient regicides, fractured kingdoms, and the slow grinding violence of elven civil war. South of the Dragon's Spine mountains, three states cling to existence in a region where the very rivers remember old murders and the forests harbor things that predate the elves themselves.

### Geography

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dragon's Spine mountains form an impassable barrier, their southern faces dropping into the Hag Hills and the headwaters of the region's rivers
- **East**: The Dragon's Spine Coast, where Thraken Lake marks the transition to different political realities
- **South**: The Void—the great purple-dark ocean that bounds all of southern Aboyinzu
- **West**: The coastline curves around Tangiern's western reaches, past the Pools of Tragedy

The region occupies the southwestern tip of Aboyinzu, isolated from the continent's larger powers by the Dragon's Spine. This geographic isolation has allowed the Crimson Coast's internal conflicts to fester without outside intervention—or resolution.

#### Terrain

The Crimson Coast is dominated by vast conifer forests broken by river valleys and coastal hills. Moving west to east:

**Western Forests**: The enormous Fragenstor Mielthøn covers most of Tangiern, a seemingly endless expanse of dark pine and spruce. Hilda's Forest occupies the northwestern corner, older and stranger than its neighbor.

**Central Hills**: The Suftos Hills run north-south through the region's heart, forming the contested border between Klevnaf and Istora. The Hulry Hills anchor the northwest.

**Eastern Woodlands**: Whitewood (in Klevnaf) and Winterwood (in Istora) are smaller but no less significant—sacred groves to the Winter Elves who once ruled the entire region.

**Waterways**: Rivers carve through the landscape in patterns that mirror political divisions. The River of Wights flows from haunted sources in the northwest. Murder Creek divides what remains of the old elven kingdom. The Sova Chyda sustains Istora's settlements. The Rabbit River provides Tangiern's primary trade route to the sea.

#### Climate

Cold maritime conditions prevail. Winters are long and bitter, with snow lingering in the forests from late autumn through early spring. Summers are brief and cool, with frequent fog rolling in from the Void. The Dragon's Spine creates a rain shadow that makes the eastern reaches slightly drier than the perpetually damp western forests.

### States

Three nations control the Crimson Coast, each shaped by the region's bloody history:

#### Tangiern

The largest state by territory, Tangiern is a human kingdom occupying the western two-thirds of the region. Its people—hardy foresters and hunters—have carved settlements from the vast Fragenstor Mielthøn over generations. Capital: **Nøsen**.

*See: [Tangiern](./Tangiern.md)*

#### Klevnaf

A Winter Elf kingdom controlling the central coastal strip. Klevnaf claims legitimacy through Prince Taoinor, uncle to the murdered King Istor XXVI. They hold Murder Creek and the cursed ground where ancient King Ghy fell. Capital: **Svedlind**.

*See: [Klevnaf](./Klevnaf.md)*

#### Istora

The eastern Winter Elf kingdom, ruled by Queen Lamenrae—daughter of the murdered Istor XXVI. The Istori consider Klevnaf traitors and usurpers. Their realm follows the Sova Chyda river from the Suftos Hills to the sea. Capital: **Tuur**.

*See: [Istora](./Istora.md)*

### Political Climate

The Crimson Coast exists in a state of cold war that periodically turns hot.

**The Succession Crisis**: When Istor XXVI was murdered, his daughter Lamenrae accused her uncle Taoinor of the crime and refused him the throne. Taoinor's supporters—primarily those in the western territories—rejected her authority. The kingdom split along Murder Creek, with each faction claiming to be the true continuation of the Winter Elf realm.

**Tangiern's Position**: The human kingdom watches the elven civil war with calculated interest. They've historically paid tribute to the unified elven crown; now both Klevnaf and Istora demand that tribute, and Tangiern pays neither. This cannot last. Whichever elven faction wins will turn its attention west—and Tangiern's King Halvard knows it.

**The Suftos Buffer**: The hills between Klevnaf and Istora have become a depopulated no-man's-land. Villages were evacuated or destroyed in the first years of the split. Now it's patrol territory—elven rangers from both sides hunting each other through the rocks and scrub.

### What Makes It Interesting

**A War With No Good Guys**: Lamenrae may be right that Taoinor murdered her father—but Taoinor may be right that a queen is an unacceptable break with tradition. Players can support either claim without being obviously wrong.

**Cursed Geography**: Murder Creek, the Pools of Tragedy, the River of Wights—the land itself remembers violence. This creates supernatural hazards alongside political ones. Drinking from the wrong stream might show you visions of an ancient assassination.

**The Third Player**: Tangiern has survived by staying out of elven politics. But with the succession crisis dragging on, they're being forced to choose sides—or make a bid for regional dominance themselves.

**Ancient Secrets**: Hilda's Forest and the ruins of Hildaneir predate even the Winter Elves. The Fragenstor Mielthøn hides things that remember when this land had different masters.

### What Will Go Wrong

**Escalation**: The cold war is heating up. Border skirmishes are becoming more frequent. One major incident—an assassination, a massacre, a perceived betrayal—could trigger open warfare.

**Tangiern's Choice**: King Halvard can't stay neutral forever. When he picks a side, the other elven faction will consider it an act of war. And if he tries to play both sides, eventually both will realize it.

**The Curse Spreads**: Murder Creek's waters are spreading their influence. Wells near the creek are going dark. People are having visions they shouldn't have. Something is using the old curse for new purposes.

**Dragon's Spine Stirring**: The mountains to the north have been quiet for generations. That's changing. Refugees from the Dragon's Spine Coast bring stories of increased activity—and whatever's waking up there will eventually look south.

### Rivers

#### River of Wights

Flows from the northwestern highlands past the Pools of Tragedy and into the Void. The name is earned—the river's upper reaches are genuinely haunted, and bodies dumped in the river don't always stay down. Fishermen along its lower stretches learn quickly which stretches to avoid after dark.

#### Murder Creek

The most infamous waterway in the Crimson Coast. This river runs through the heart of Klevnaf, its waters permanently darkened by an ancient curse. King Ghy the Elder—the last ruler of the unified Winter Elves—was murdered on its banks over a thousand years ago. The creek remembers. Those who drink from it experience vivid hallucinations of the assassination, seeing it from different perspectives each time. The elves consider the water sacred and profane simultaneously.

#### Sova Chyda

Istora's lifeline. This clear river flows from springs in the Suftos Hills through the Winterwood and past Tuur to the sea. The Istori have built their civilization along its banks—it provides drinking water, irrigation, and transport. Unlike Murder Creek, its waters are pure. The elves say this proves their faction's righteousness.

#### Rabbit River

Tangiern's primary trade artery. Rising in the southern Fragenstor Mielthøn, it flows south through the kingdom's heartland past Nøsen and into the Void. Named for the abundance of snowshoe hares along its banks, though locals claim the name actually references how quickly it floods—here one moment, everywhere the next.

#### Magrask

A mountain-fed river descending from the Dragon's Spine into northeastern Tangiern. Cold, fast, and prone to flash floods during snowmelt. The Magrask valley provides one of the few routes through the northern mountains, though "route" is generous—it's more a series of treacherous scrambles alongside waterfalls.

#### Mercy Falls

Not a river but a spectacular waterfall where the Suftos Hills drop toward the coast. Water from the highland streams plunges several hundred feet into a mist-shrouded pool. The name is bitterly ironic—during the early years of the elven civil war, prisoners were thrown from the falls rather than fed through winter.

### Lakes

#### Pools of Tragedy

A cluster of dark lakes in the northwestern Crimson Coast, fed by the River of Wights. Local legend holds that each pool marks where a great sorrow occurred—a massacre, a suicide, a betrayal. The water is safe to drink but tastes of grief. Travelers who camp near the pools report dreams of losses they've never experienced, mourning people they've never known.

#### Lake of Rainbows

A surprisingly beautiful lake in western Tangiern, its waters producing prismatic effects in the morning light due to mineral content from surrounding springs. The cheerful name feels incongruous in the Crimson Coast—locals say the lake predates the region's troubles, a remnant of when this land was something other than what it's become.

#### Thraken Lake

Technically in the Dragon's Spine Coast region to the east, but visible from Istora's highlands. A large mountain lake that marks the boundary between regions. The Istori consider it the edge of their world—beyond Thraken, different powers hold sway.

### Hills

#### Hulry Hills

Rolling highlands in the northwestern Crimson Coast, between Hilda's Forest and the Dragon's Spine foothills. Sheep and goat herding country, sparsely populated. The hills provide early warning of anything coming down from the mountains.

#### Suftos Hills

The contested spine of the region, running north-south between Klevnaf and Istora. Rocky, scrub-covered terrain broken by sudden ravines and hidden valleys. Before the split, this was hunting ground for the Winter Elf nobility. Now it's a war zone—depopulated, dangerous, and haunted by the ghosts of the conflict's early casualties.

#### Hag Hills

Foothills of the Dragon's Spine in the northeast, marking the transition from Crimson Coast to Dragon's Spine Coast. Named for the old women who supposedly live there, dispensing prophecy and curses in equal measure. Whether these hags are real, metaphorical, or something else entirely depends on who you ask.

### Forests

#### Fragenstor Mielthøn

The great forest of Tangiern—hundreds of square miles of dark conifer woodland covering most of the kingdom's territory. The name is Old Tangier for "Forest of a Thousand Thoughts," referencing the forest's reputation for inducing strange mental states in those who travel too deep. Most of Tangiern's population lives at its edges or along river clearings; the deep forest remains largely unexplored and is said to contain ruins from before human settlement.

#### Hilda's Forest

An ancient woodland in the northwest, smaller but older than the Fragenstor Mielthøn. The forest takes its name from a legendary figure—Hilda the Wanderer, who supposedly lived here before the Winter Elves arrived. The ruins of Hildaneir lie within, though what Hildaneir was remains debated. The elves avoided this forest even when they ruled the entire region.

#### Whitewood

A silver-barked forest in Klevnaf, sacred to the Winter Elves. The trees here are pale as bone, their leaves producing a distinctive rustling that the elves interpret as ancestral voices. Logging is forbidden; the forest is maintained as a shrine to the old ways. Taoinor's faction draws spiritual legitimacy from their control of Whitewood.

#### Winterwood

Istora's sacred forest, a dense evergreen woodland along the Sova Chyda's middle reaches. Unlike Whitewood's pale trees, Winterwood is dark and thick—a forest of shadows even at midday. The Istori believe their ancestors' spirits dwell here between incarnations. Queen Lamenrae's coronation took place within Winterwood, defying tradition that demanded the ceremony occur in the now-Klevnaf-controlled ancestral capital.

### Points of Interest

#### Hildaneir

Ruins within Hilda's Forest, marked on maps but rarely visited. The structures predate elven settlement—their architecture matches nothing else in the region. Some scholars believe Hildaneir was a temple; others think it was a prison. The Winter Elves have legends about something being "kept" here before their arrival. Whatever it was, it's gone now. Probably.

#### Feycreek

A small stream in western Tangiern where fey activity is unusually high. Travelers report encounters with sprites, will-o'-wisps, and stranger things. The creek itself seems to move—maps disagree about its location, and locals claim it flows to different places on different days.

### Fragenstor Mielthøn

Tags: forest, tangiern, crimson-coast

The great forest of Tangiern—hundreds of square miles of dark conifer woodland covering most of the human kingdom's territory. The name is Old Tangier for "Forest of a Thousand Thoughts," and the forest earns it. Those who travel too deep report strange mental states: vivid dreams, borrowed memories, conversations with people who aren't there.

#### Character

Fragenstor Mielthøn is oppressively vast. Standing at its edge, the trees stretch to the horizon in every direction except behind you. Dark pines and spruces crowd together, blocking sunlight even at midday. The forest floor is a carpet of needles, centuries deep, that muffles footsteps and makes tracking difficult.

The silence is the first thing travelers notice. Then the sounds that break it—distant calls that might be birds or might be something else, the creak of wood that sounds almost like speech, the rustle of movement where nothing visible moves.

#### The Thousand Thoughts

The forest's name references its documented psychological effects. Extended time in the deep forest produces:

- **Vivid dreams** featuring locations the dreamer has never visited
- **Intrusive thoughts** that feel like someone else's memories
- **Conversations** with absent people, remembered perfectly despite never happening
- **Temporal confusion** about how long one has been traveling

These effects are harmless in short exposure—a few days produces interesting dreams and nothing more. Longer stays produce more intense symptoms. The foresters who work the deep woods rotate out regularly; those who don't eventually stop making sense.

The Tangier people consider these effects natural, like altitude sickness in mountains. Outsiders suspect something more deliberate—the forest testing intruders, or remembering them, or preparing something.

#### Settlements

Most of Tangiern's population lives at the forest's edges or along river clearings. The deep interior is effectively uninhabited—work parties enter for specific tasks and leave. Permanent settlement in the deep forest is theoretically possible but practically foolish.

**Nøsen**, the capital, sits where the Rabbit River provides a natural clearing. **Aspenthar** and the other logging towns occupy similar river valleys. The forest allows these intrusions but doesn't encourage them.

#### What Lies Within

The foresters tell stories of things in the deep forest:

- **Ruins** that don't match any known civilization, overgrown but not quite consumed
- **Clearings** where nothing grows, the soil black and the air cold
- **Structures** glimpsed between trees that vanish when approached directly
- **Creatures** that might be animals or might be something wearing animal shapes

Nobody has mapped the deep forest comprehensively. Expeditions that venture too far don't always return, and those that do report contradictory geography—as if the forest rearranges itself between visits.

#### Logging

Tangiern's economy depends on timber from the Fragenstor Mielthøn. The kingdom has developed sustainable harvesting practices that avoid the deep forest entirely—working the edges, replanting aggressively, treating the forest as a resource to be managed rather than conquered.

This approach has worked for centuries. The forest tolerates the edge-harvesting; it hasn't tolerated deeper incursions. Three major attempts to establish logging operations in the interior ended badly enough that nobody has tried since.

#### Relation to Hilda's Forest

The northwestern corner of the Crimson Coast contains a separate, older forest—Hilda's Forest, which predates the Fragenstor Mielthøn and operates by different rules. The two forests don't quite touch; a narrow strip of cleared land separates them. The Tangier people maintain this buffer carefully, though they can't articulate exactly why.

### Hilda's Forest

Tags: forest, crimson-coast, ancient

An ancient woodland in the northwestern Crimson Coast, smaller but far older than the neighboring Fragenstor Mielthøn. The forest takes its name from a legendary figure—Hilda the Wanderer, who supposedly lived here before the Winter Elves arrived, before humans crossed the Dragon's Spine, before recorded history began.

#### Character

Where the Fragenstor Mielthøn is oppressive in its vastness, Hilda's Forest is oppressive in its intensity. The trees are older here—gnarled oaks and twisted pines that look like they've been growing since the world was young. The canopy blocks almost all light; the undergrowth is thick and tangled; the paths (such as they are) seem to shift between visits.

The forest feels *aware* in a way the Fragenstor doesn't. Travelers report being watched, being followed, being *considered* by something that decides whether to let them pass. Most are let pass. Some aren't.

#### Hilda the Wanderer

Tangier legends describe Hilda as:
- A woman who lived alone in the forest for centuries before humans arrived
- A fey creature who guarded the woodland against outsiders
- A prisoner kept in the forest by ancient powers
- Something that merely wore the shape of a woman

The legends don't agree on details, but they agree on this: Hilda was here first, and the forest belongs to her. Even now, centuries or millennia after her disappearance (if she ever existed), locals leave offerings at the forest edge—bread, honey, small coins—before entering.

#### The Elven Avoidance

The Winter Elves avoided Hilda's Forest entirely. They claimed the rest of the Crimson Coast, built settlements, extracted tribute, shaped the land to their purposes—but never touched this forest. Their records mention it only to note its existence and warn against entry.

This restraint is remarkable. The elves had the power to clear the forest, the need for its timber, the curiosity to explore its mysteries. They did none of these things. Either they knew something about Hilda's Forest that made leaving it alone worth the cost, or they tried to claim it and failed badly enough that no record survives.

#### Hildaneir

The ruins of Hildaneir lie within the forest, perhaps a day's travel from the edge for those who can find the way. The ruins predate the forest—or rather, the forest grew up around them, consuming what was once cleared land. See [Hildaneir](./Hildaneir.md) for details.

#### Current Status

Hilda's Forest is technically within Tangiern's borders but functionally independent. The Tangier people don't log here, don't hunt here, don't claim to control it. They maintain a respectful distance, and in return the forest doesn't expand into their territories or produce threats that require response.

This arrangement has held for centuries. Whether it will continue holding depends on factors no one fully understands.

#### Entering the Forest

Those who enter Hilda's Forest report:
- **Disorientation**: Compasses spin; the sun seems to move too fast or too slow; landmarks appear in the wrong places
- **Observation**: The constant sense of being watched by something intelligent
- **Testing**: Small challenges—paths that lead in circles, obstacles that require specific solutions, moments where giving up would be the easy choice
- **Judgment**: Those who pass the tests may proceed; those who don't find themselves back at the forest edge with no memory of the journey

The forest seems to evaluate visitors and decide whether they deserve passage. The criteria are unclear; worthy visitors have included scholars, criminals, children, and at least one war party that entered seeking conquest and emerged seeking peace.

#### Adventure Hooks

- The offerings at the forest edge have been disappearing—not consumed, not scattered, simply gone. Someone or something is collecting them.
- A child entered the forest three days ago and hasn't returned. The forest usually sends children back immediately; this time it hasn't.
- A scholar claims to have found evidence that Hilda wasn't a person but a title—and that the position has been vacant for too long.

### Hildaneir

Tags: ruins, poi, hilda's-forest, crimson-coast

Ruins within Hilda's Forest, marked on maps but rarely visited. The structures predate elven settlement—their architecture matches nothing else in the region. Some scholars believe Hildaneir was a temple; others think it was a prison. The Winter Elves have legends about something being "kept" here before their arrival. Whatever it was, it's gone now.

Probably.

#### The Ruins

Hildaneir consists of several stone structures arranged in a pattern that becomes clear only from above—a spiral, or possibly a coil, with a central building surrounded by progressively smaller outlying structures. The architecture is unlike anything else in Alaria: no right angles, no straight walls, everything curved and flowing.

The stone itself is unusual—a dark material that doesn't match local geology, cold to the touch even in summer, and marked with symbols that no one has successfully translated. The symbols aren't decorative; they're too deliberately placed, too consistently spaced. They mean something. What they mean is unknown.

#### History (What Little Is Known)

The ruins predate the Winter Elves' arrival on the Crimson Coast—at minimum several thousand years old, possibly far older. Elven records mention Hildaneir with unusual caution, describing it as a "place of keeping" without specifying what was kept.

**Hilda herself** appears in Tangier legends as a wanderer who lived in the forest before humans arrived—possibly a fey entity, possibly something stranger. The ruins bear her name, but the connection is unclear. Did she build them? Guard them? Escape from them?

The elves left Hildaneir alone. They controlled the rest of the Crimson Coast but established no settlements in Hilda's Forest, built no roads through it, conducted no logging or hunting within its bounds. This was unusual enough that historians have noted it—a forest untouched by a civilization that touched everything else.

#### Current State

Hildaneir has been explored perhaps a dozen times in recorded history. Each expedition has produced different findings:

- A 3rd century SD party found the central building sealed and the outlying structures empty
- A 27th century SD expedition found the central building open but couldn't enter—the interior was "wrong" in ways they couldn't describe
- The most recent expedition (early 34th century SD) found evidence of recent activity—cleared paths, disturbed dust—despite no one admitting to having visited

The ruins are generally considered dangerous without being specifically threatening. No expedition has been attacked; several have simply... failed, their members returning confused, their notes incomplete, their memories uncertain.

#### What The Symbols Say

Multiple scholars have attempted to translate the Hildaneir symbols. Their conclusions are contradictory:

- **Binding formulae** for containing something powerful
- **Warning text** describing what happens to trespassers
- **Instructions** for operating the site as some kind of device
- **Names**—hundreds of them, listed in spiral patterns that mirror the building arrangement

The truth may include all of these. Or none of them. The symbols resist magical analysis; divination directed at them produces headaches and nosebleeds rather than information.

#### Adventure Hooks

- The ruins have become active—lights visible at night, sounds audible from the forest edge. Someone or something is using Hildaneir for the first time in millennia.

### Istora

Tags: state, nation, winter-elf, istori

The eastern successor to the unified Winter Elf kingdom, Istora is ruled by Queen Lamenrae—daughter of the murdered Istor XXVI and the first woman to claim the elven throne. Her realm follows the Sova Chyda river from the Suftos Hills to the sea, with the sacred Winterwood as its spiritual heart. The Istori were once known for regal calm; the succession crisis has made them something harder.

#### Geography

Istora occupies the eastern portion of the Crimson Coast, bounded by the contested Suftos Hills to the west, the Dragon's Spine Coast to the east, and the Void to the south. The kingdom is defined by the Sova Chyda river system—settlements cluster along its banks, and the sacred Winterwood straddles its middle reaches.

**Key Features:**
- **Sova Chyda River**: Clean water and the kingdom's lifeline
- **Winterwood**: Sacred evergreen forest, home to ancestral spirits
- **Suftos Hills (eastern slopes)**: Contested borderland with Klevnaf
- **Hag Hills (southern reaches)**: Wild highlands on the Dragon's Spine border
- **Thraken Lake**: Mountain lake marking the eastern boundary

#### Settlements

##### Tuur (Capital)

Population: ~3,000

The capital sits where the Sova Chyda emerges from the Winterwood, commanding both the river trade and access to the sacred forest. Tuur is older than the split—it served as the summer residence of the unified kingdom's monarchs, who wintered in what is now Klevnaf-controlled territory. That history makes Istora's claim to legitimacy complicated; they hold the summer palace but lost the ancestral seat.

Queen Lamenrae rules from the Palace of Seasons, a graceful complex of white stone towers connected by covered bridges. The architecture reflects centuries of wealth and peace now interrupted. Recent construction—walls reinforced, towers converted to watchtowers—shows the war's impact.

Tuur's population has swelled with refugees from the contested hills and elves who chose Lamenrae's faction when the kingdom split. Housing is tight; tempers are short.

##### Bejakørn (Town)

Population: ~600

A highland town in the eastern reaches, positioned where the Sova Chyda descends from its mountain sources. Bejakørn serves as Istora's gateway to the Dragon's Spine Coast—limited trade still flows through here, and the town's inns host travelers heading east or west.

The town also houses Istora's armories and training grounds, positioned far from the front lines where they can operate without interruption. Young elves from across the kingdom come here to learn the warrior's arts before deployment to the Suftos line.

##### Asgrael (Village)

Population: ~250

A village along the Sova Chyda's middle reaches, within sight of the Winterwood's edge. Asgrael serves pilgrims traveling to the sacred forest and foresters who harvest timber from the woodland's outer edges. (Unlike Klevnaf's total prohibition on logging, Istora permits sustainable harvesting from Winterwood's periphery—a theological difference that both sides consider evidence of the other's corruption.)

##### Bjornheim (Village)

Population: ~200

A frontier village in the southern reaches, positioned to watch the wild country between Istora and the Dragon's Spine Coast. Bjornheim's residents are hardened—the village has been raided by bandits, monsters from the mountains, and (once) a Klevnaf war party that got lost. They trust no one who isn't family.

#### Economy

Istora's economy is better positioned than Klevnaf's, though "better" is relative during wartime. The Sova Chyda provides irrigation for limited agriculture, the Winterwood offers sustainable timber, and the eastern trade routes to the Dragon's Spine Coast remain open.

The kingdom exports carved woodwork—Istori craftsmen are renowned for their detailed work with Winterwood timber—and imports food, metal goods, and weapons. The war has made these imports more expensive, but they still flow.

Fishing provides protein; the Sova Chyda and the coastal waters support significant catches. The elves have developed preservation techniques that allow fish to last through the long winters.

#### Politics

**Queen Lamenrae** is the first woman to rule the Winter Elves—a break with tradition that her supporters call necessary evolution and her opponents call unforgivable deviation. She's young for an elf (perhaps two centuries), sharp-minded, and angry. Her father was murdered, her uncle stole half her kingdom, and tradition demands she be grateful for what remains.

Her court is divided differently than Taoinor's:

- **Progressives**: Those who see the succession crisis as an opportunity to reform elven society
- **Revanchists**: Those focused entirely on defeating Klevnaf and reunifying the kingdom
- **Pragmatists**: Those who want to stabilize what they have before worrying about what they've lost

Lamenrae herself is a revanchist wrapped in progressive rhetoric. She speaks of reform but spends most of her energy on the war effort. Her advisors worry she's so focused on vengeance that she's neglecting governance.

**The Accusation**: Lamenrae believes absolutely that Taoinor murdered her father. She has witnesses—servants who saw Taoinor near the king's chambers that night, a cupbearer who noticed something strange about the wine. But none of it is conclusive, and Taoinor's supporters dismiss the witnesses as bought or coerced. The truth may never be established to everyone's satisfaction. Lamenrae has moved past caring about proving her case; she just wants Taoinor dead.

#### Culture

Istora represents the reformist wing of Winter Elf society—by necessity if not conviction. A queen requires new theology; new alliances require new customs; survival requires adaptation. The elves here have begun questioning traditions that Klevnaf holds sacred.

The Winterwood remains central to their spirituality, but Istori interpretation has shifted. Where Klevnaf sees the ancestral voices as commands to be obeyed, Istora increasingly treats them as guidance to be considered. The dead advise; the living decide. This theological innovation horrifies Klevnaf's traditionalists.

Foxes and snowy owls still serve as companions—this tradition crosses factional lines—but Istora has begun training hawks and wolves as well. Practical needs override ancestral preferences.

The Istori have "become much nastier" since the split, as outsiders describe it. Centuries of regal calm have given way to siege mentality. Strangers are suspected; questions are threats; mercy is weakness. A people who once prided themselves on composure now pride themselves on survival.

#### Military

Istora fields roughly 1,000 trained soldiers—slightly larger than Klevnaf's force, reflecting their larger population and better supply situation. Their strength lies in discipline and equipment: the Bejakørn training grounds produce skilled warriors, and the eastern trade routes keep weapons and armor flowing.

Their weakness is terrain. Attacking across the Suftos Hills means advancing uphill into prepared defenses. The war has settled into stalemate because neither side can project force effectively into the other's territory.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Palace of Seasons

Tuur's royal complex, built over centuries to house the Winter Elf monarchy during summer months. Four wings correspond to the quarters of the year, each with distinct architecture and gardens. The Winter Wing was never completed—construction halted when the split occurred, and the scaffolding still stands, a monument to interrupted ambition.

##### The Coronation Grove

A clearing in Winterwood where Lamenrae was crowned, breaking tradition that demanded the ceremony occur in the ancestral capital (now in Klevnaf). The grove has become a pilgrimage site for Istora's loyalists—they come to see where their queen claimed power in defiance of those who would deny her.

##### The Shrine of Reflections

A temple along the Sova Chyda where elves come to contemplate the river's clear waters. The shrine predates the split and was traditionally used for meditation and prophecy. Since the war began, its priests have reported darker visions—death, fire, a figure in the mist who might be Ghy or might be Istor XXVI or might be someone yet to die.

### Klevnaf

Tags: state, nation, winter-elf, istori

The western remnant of the once-unified Winter Elf kingdom, Klevnaf claims legitimacy through Prince Taoinor—uncle to the murdered King Istor XXVI. They control Murder Creek and the sacred Whitewood, drawing spiritual authority from their possession of the land where the ancient kings fell. But legitimacy built on cursed ground comes at a cost.

#### Geography

Klevnaf occupies the central coastal strip of the Crimson Coast, wedged between Tangiern to the west and the contested Suftos Hills to the east. The realm follows Murder Creek from its highland sources to the sea, with the sacred Whitewood anchoring its southern territory.

**Key Features:**
- **Murder Creek**: The cursed river that defines and divides the realm
- **Whitewood**: Sacred silver-barked forest, spiritual heart of the kingdom
- **Suftos Hills (western slopes)**: Contested borderland with Istora
- **Mercy Falls**: Waterfall at the Suftos escarpment, site of wartime atrocities

#### Settlements

##### Svedlind (Capital)

Population: ~2,500

Built directly on Murder Creek's banks, Svedlind is a city defined by its proximity to cursed water. The Winter Elves here have learned to live with the visions—children are warned not to drink directly from the creek, and the city draws its water from wells fed by cleaner tributaries. But the curse seeps. Long-term residents report dreams of King Ghy's assassination even without drinking the water.

The royal palace—such as it is—occupies an island in the creek, connected to both banks by graceful bridges. Prince Taoinor rules from here, though he rarely appears in public. His advisors handle most governance while he broods over maps and reports from the eastern front.

Svedlind's architecture reflects elven aesthetics modified by centuries in this harsh climate: elegant curves in thick-walled stone, windows oriented to catch the brief summer sun, gardens that bloom in defiance of the perpetual grey.

##### Wurnfleur (Town)

Population: ~700

A coastal town south of Svedlind, serving as Klevnaf's primary connection to the sea. Wurnfleur's harbor is better protected than Tangiern's rocky coast, and in peacetime the town would thrive on fishing and trade. The civil war has reduced traffic to a trickle—no merchant wants to be caught between elven factions.

The town maintains a small fleet of war-galleys, crewed by elves trained in naval combat. If Istora ever threatens from the sea, Wurnfleur would be the first defense.

##### Snøvgar (Village)

Population: ~200

A fishing village north of Svedlind, clinging to the coast where Murder Creek empties into the Void. The villagers are hardened by proximity to both cursed water and open sea. They catch silverfin in waters other fishermen avoid, claiming the fish here taste better—touched by the creek's strange power without being poisoned by it.

##### Avuul (Village)

Population: ~180

A highland village in the Suftos Hills, positioned to watch the eastern approaches. Avuul has been evacuated and resettled three times during the civil war as the front lines shifted. The current residents are mostly soldiers and their families—civilians who can handle themselves in a fight.

#### Economy

Klevnaf's economy is strangled by war. The kingdom traditionally relied on trade with Istora (before the split), tribute from Tangiern (now suspended), and the harvest of the Whitewood's unique timber (sacred, not for sale). What remains is subsistence fishing, limited agriculture in cleared lowlands, and whatever can be looted or salvaged from border skirmishes.

The Whitewood could fund the war effort—its silver-barked trees are valuable beyond measure—but Taoinor has forbidden logging in the sacred forest. This decision is popular with traditionalists but increasingly resented by soldiers who see their equipment wearing out while priceless trees stand untouched.

#### Politics

**Prince Taoinor** rules Klevnaf, though "rules" may be generous. He's an aging elf who expected to live out his days as a respected elder, not fight a civil war for a throne he's not certain he wanted. His court is divided between:

- **Hawks**: Military officers who want to push east, crush Istora, and reunify the kingdom by force
- **Doves**: Counselors who believe the war is unwinnable and seek negotiated settlement
- **Traditionalists**: Those focused on maintaining elven customs regardless of the war's outcome

Taoinor vacillates between factions, making decisions slowly and often reversing them. This frustrates everyone but may be intentional—a leader who commits to nothing can't be blamed for failure.

**The Accusation**: Lamenrae claims Taoinor murdered her father. Taoinor denies it. The truth is genuinely uncertain—there were witnesses to Istor XXVI's death, but their accounts conflict, and murder by poison leaves few traces. What's clear is that Taoinor benefited from the death and that Lamenrae had every reason to blame him regardless of guilt. Justice may be impossible; the war will likely end through exhaustion or extinction rather than resolution.

#### Culture

Klevnaf represents the conservative wing of Winter Elf society. They venerate the old ways: the sacred forests, the ancestral spirits, the traditions that predate human contact. The Whitewood is the physical manifestation of these values—a forest where the ancestors' voices can still be heard in rustling leaves.

The curse of Murder Creek has become woven into this traditionalism. Rather than flee the cursed land, Klevnaf's elves have embraced it. They see the visions as sacred—painful connections to their murdered king. Some deliberately drink from the creek before battle, seeking Ghy's guidance through hallucination.

Foxes and snowy owls serve as companions and messengers, a tradition shared with Istora that predates the split. The animals don't understand the civil war; they still carry messages between factions when their masters aren't paying attention.

#### Military

Klevnaf fields perhaps 800 trained soldiers—a significant force for a small kingdom but not enough to decisively defeat Istora. Their strength lies in defensive terrain: Murder Creek provides a natural barrier, and the Whitewood offers endless opportunities for ambush.

Their weakness is supply. The war has dragged on long enough that equipment is wearing out, stockpiles are depleted, and young elves who should be training are instead farming or fishing to keep the kingdom fed.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Mercy Falls

The waterfall where the Suftos Hills drop toward the coast has become a monument to wartime atrocity. During the first winter of the split, when the front lines were fluid and mercy was in short supply, both factions threw prisoners from the falls rather than feed them through the cold months. The practice has stopped, but the falls are now considered cursed—another stain on a region that collects them.

##### The Listening Grove

A clearing in Whitewood where the ancestral voices are said to be clearest. Elves come here to commune with the dead, seeking guidance or simply comfort. Since the split, the grove has been off-limits to non-Klevnaf elves—a source of bitter resentment for Istora's traditionalists, who consider it their heritage too.

### Tangiern

Tags: state, nation, human

The largest state on the Crimson Coast by territory, Tangiern is a human kingdom that has carved civilization from the vast Fragenstor Mielthøn forest over centuries. While their elven neighbors tear themselves apart in civil war, the Tangier people watch and wait—knowing their survival depends on choosing the right moment to act.

#### Geography

Tangiern occupies the western two-thirds of the Crimson Coast, bounded by the Dragon's Spine to the north, the Void to the south, and the elven territories to the east. The landscape is dominated by the enormous Fragenstor Mielthøn—a dark conifer forest covering most of the kingdom. Settlements cluster along rivers and the southern coast, with the deep forest interior remaining largely unexplored.

**Key Features:**
- **Fragenstor Mielthøn**: The great forest, covering most of the kingdom
- **Hilda's Forest**: Ancient woodland in the northwest, avoided even by locals
- **Hulry Hills**: Northern highlands used for grazing
- **Rabbit River**: Primary trade route from the interior to the coast
- **Magrask River**: Mountain-fed tributary from the Dragon's Spine
- **Lake of Rainbows**: Western lake known for prismatic morning effects
- **Pools of Tragedy**: Haunted lakes in the northwest

#### Settlements

##### Nøsen (Capital)

Population: ~4,000

The capital sits at the junction of the Rabbit River and its primary tributary, controlling both the main north-south trade route and access to the eastern forest roads. Nøsen began as a logging camp and still feels like one—wooden construction predominates, streets are muddy half the year and frozen the other half, and the smell of pine resin permeates everything.

The royal seat is the Timberhall, a massive lodge constructed from the largest trees ever felled in the Fragenstor Mielthøn. King Halvard holds court here, though "court" is generous—Tangier governance is practical rather than ceremonial.

##### Frostrien (Town)

Population: ~1,200

A fortified town on the eastern road, Frostrien marks the edge of settled Tangiern territory. Beyond it lies increasingly wild forest, then the contested borderlands with the elven realms. The town maintains a permanent garrison and serves as the staging point for any military action eastward.

##### Aspenthar (Town)

Population: ~900

A logging town along the Rabbit River's middle reaches. Aspenthar processes timber from the surrounding forest and ships it downstream to Nøsen. The town's sawmills run constantly during the brief summer months, stockpiling lumber against the long winter.

##### Tirenthar (Town)

Population: ~800

The southernmost town of significance, Tirenthar sits near the coast where the Rabbit River empties into the Void. It functions as Tangiern's primary port—though "port" oversells it. The coastline is rocky and treacherous, and most trade still moves overland.

##### Mornigster (Village)

Population: ~300

An isolated village in the northeastern forest, positioned along the Magrask River valley. Mornigster exists primarily to monitor the mountain passes and provide early warning of anything coming down from the Dragon's Spine. It's a hardship posting; residents rotate out after a few years.

##### Favind (Village)

Population: ~250

A small settlement east of Nøsen, on the road toward Frostrien. Favind serves travelers and maintains the road through an otherwise uninhabited stretch of forest. The village has an inn, a blacksmith, and little else.

#### Economy

Tangiern's economy is built on timber, furs, and survival. The Fragenstor Mielthøn provides seemingly endless lumber, and the kingdom exports processed wood to markets around the Void's shores. Hunting and trapping supplement the timber trade—Tangier furs are prized for their quality.

Agriculture is limited by climate and terrain. The growing season is short, the soil is acidic from pine needles, and cleared land tends to revert to forest within a generation if not constantly maintained. Most food is imported or hunted.

#### Politics

King Halvard III rules Tangiern, the latest in a dynasty that has held power for six generations. His position is more chief-among-equals than absolute monarch—the jarls who control the major towns retain significant autonomy, and the king's authority extends mainly to military matters and foreign relations.

**The Elven Question**: Tangiern historically paid tribute to the unified Winter Elf crown in exchange for being left alone. The elven civil war has freed them from this obligation—neither Klevnaf nor Istora can enforce tribute collection while fighting each other. But Halvard knows this freedom is temporary. When the elves reunify (or when one side decisively wins), they'll want their tribute back. His choices are:
1. Pick a side now, helping one faction win and hoping for gratitude
2. Stay neutral and prepare to fight whoever emerges victorious
3. Use the chaos to expand Tangier territory while the elves are distracted

He's currently pursuing option 2 while keeping options 1 and 3 available.

#### Culture

The Tangier people are practical, suspicious of outsiders, and deeply connected to their forest. They worship a mix of nature spirits and ancestor veneration, with little interest in the formal religions of other lands. Their festivals mark the seasons—the return of light in spring, the hunt in autumn, the long darkness of winter.

They view the elves with a mixture of resentment (for centuries of tribute extraction) and respect (for their obvious power). The elven civil war has shifted this toward cautious optimism—maybe the elves will destroy each other and leave Tangiern free.

#### Points of Interest

##### Hildaneir

Ruins in the northwest, within Hilda's Forest. The Tangier people avoid this place; their grandparents' grandparents told stories about why it should be left alone, though the specific reasons have been lost. Occasionally adventurers or scholars investigate. Most return changed; some don't return at all.
