# Aboyinzu

Aboyinzu stretches like a hooked tail along the southwestern edge of the known world. Temperate states in the northwest give way to vast savannas, humid jungles, and the cold, mist-shrouded Dragon's Spine mountains in the far south. Multiple mountain chains—the Crystal Mountains, the Morygun range, and the Dalizi Highlands—carve the continent into distinct biomes, while the Deadloop inner sea cuts deep into its heart. To the east, the South Sea separates Aboyinzu from the Shacklands, and to the west the Wanderlands peninsula reaches toward distant horizons.

## Featured Regions

- **Terrenia** – Northwestern coastal states and gateways to the continent.
- **Central Aboyinzu** – The savanna heartlands surrounding the Deadloop and the Crystal Mountains.
- **Wanderlands** – A long southern peninsula of plains and rugged hill country.
- **Elder Wilds** – The ancient rainforest that dominates the eastern peninsula.
- **Dalizi Confederation** – Allied states ringing Lake Tonactlet Chitle and the Dalizi Highlands.
- **Dragon's Spine Coast** – Misty southern mountains and the Pindolin archipelago.
- **Crimson Coast** – Haunted southern shores south of the Dragon's Spine.

## Terrenia

### Geography

Terrenia occupies the northwestern reaches of Aboyinzu, a region of temperate states stretching from the coast down to the Crystal Mountains. This is the gateway to the continent—the first landfall for ships crossing from the Shacklands or Free Isles, and the most "civilized" portion of Aboyinzu.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Coastal waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands; the Free Isles lie further west
- **East**: Transitions into Central Aboyinzu and the vast interior
- **South**: Bordered by the Crystal Mountains, which separate Terrenia from the southern regions
- **West**: Western coastline facing the open ocean

#### States (North to South)

- **Aal Salma**: The northwesternmost state of Terrenia
- **Windor**: South of Aal Salma
- **Green Mountains**: A small mountain range separating Windor from Poum Titch
- **Poum Titch**: South of the Green Mountains
- **Chaal Nazaerox**: A massive state stretching from the east coast all the way to the west coast, positioned north of the Crystal Mountains. This is one of the largest political entities in Aboyinzu.

#### Connection to Central Aboyinzu

East of Chaal Nazaerox lie Grustos and Quintas, two more states that serve as the transition zone between Terrenia and the interior regions around the Deadloop inner sea.

##### Strait of Curses

The waters south of Xabraedia and north of Hagswood are known as the Strait of Curses, named for the hags who prowl these treacherous waters. The strait is also inhabited by large, nasty serpents known as Silkwurms—creatures that can wrap entire ships in silk and knot them to the seafloor, dragging vessels and crews to their doom. The hags of Hagswood maintain an uneasy alliance with these serpents, communicating with them and occasionally working together to claim victims.

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills south of Poum Titch, east of Aal Salma, and north of Chaal Nazzerox that have ceaselessly billowed smoke and ash for decades. The cause remains a mystery—theories range from massive forges inside the hills (operated by dwarves, goblins, or cyclops) to ongoing volcanic activity.

The hills are inhabited by the Firesworn, who have adapted to life amid the constant smoke and heat. The perpetual haze makes the region dangerous to navigate, and the true nature of what produces the endless smoke remains unknown.

## Central Aboyinzu

### Geography

Central Aboyinzu is the vast interior of the continent—a general term encompassing the savanna heartlands, the Deadloop inner sea, and the territories between the major mountain ranges. The terrain is a mix of tan and light green, characteristic of vast savanna and dry grassland. Think of the African Serengeti—endless golden grass beneath wide skies, punctuated by scattered trees and watering holes.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Terrenia and the states of Chaal Nazaerox, Grustos, and Quintas
- **East**: The Elderwilds peninsula and South Sea
- **South**: The Morygun Mountains and Dragon's Spine range
- **West**: Korgül forest, the Mumbling Forest, and largely uncharted wilderness of grassland and forest

#### Major Geographic Features

##### The Deadloop (Inner Sea)

A large inland sea cutting into the continental interior. Key features around the Deadloop:
- **Echem Yiakraxes**: Large plains in the northwestern portion of the Deadloop
- **Donclik Sound**: Body of water due east of Echem Yiakraxes
- **Mikisapi Forest**: An island/peninsula within the Deadloop, encircled by the waterway
- **Tenches**: A city-state on Mikisapi Forest

##### The Crystal Mountains

A major mountain range running southwest to northeast across central Aboyinzu. At their southwestern point, they connect to the Morygun Mountains. At their northeastern extent, they overlap with the mountains of Grustos. Chaal Nazaerox lies to their north.

##### The Morygun Mountains

Running northwest to southeast, these mountains connect the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region (home to satyr).

#### States and Territories

- **Chaal Nazaerox**: The massive northern state (shared with Terrenia)
- **Grustos & Quintas**: Eastern states near the Crystal Mountains
- **Kadroka**: Southern territory
- **Chechol**: Eastern territory, south of the Deadloop and northwest of Dalizi
- **Korgül**: Western forest region, home to satyr

### Notable Locations

#### Frogsong River

Inhabited by extremely poisonous frogs.

#### Crystal Mountains

##### Blinding Mines

Located deep within the Crystal Mountains at the intersection of void and air leylines, the Blinding Mines are filled with crystals of pure light that illuminate the tunnels with blinding intensity. However, the mines are extremely dangerous—the intersection of void and air leylines causes unpredictable teleportation throughout the tunnels, leading miners to become hopelessly lost or teleported into solid rock.

Despite these hazards, the mines contain valuable crystals and magical resources, drawing prospectors willing to risk the supernatural dangers. Many elves have died attempting to exploit the mines' riches.

#### Morygun Mountains

A major mountain range running northwest to southeast, connecting the southern tip of the Crystal Mountains to the northwestern edge of Dragon's Spine. West of the Morygun Mountains lies uncharted wilderness—grasslands, forests, and the Korgül region. The southern reaches of the Morygun Mountains connect to the Remakemizi Mountains north of Kadroka state.

The mountains are home to the fearsome Morygun mountain goats—thunderous ram-centaur creatures attuned to both air and earth magic. These vicious predators are violently territorial, charging at intruders with devastating force and using their elemental attunement to cause rockslides and wind blasts. Traversing the Morygun range means risking an encounter with these deadly guardians of the peaks.

##### Phaerhom

A hidden valley deep in the far southern Morygun Mountains, southeast of the Korgül forest region. This secluded vale is home to Dead Claws—dangerous predators that have adapted to the mountain environment—and a small enclave of fairies and pixies who have claimed the valley as their sanctuary.

The fairy enclave guards the valley fiercely, using illusion magic to hide the entrance and nature magic to make the surrounding mountains nearly impassable. Few outsiders even know Phaerhom exists, and those who stumble upon it are usually led astray by fairy glamours before they can find their way in.

## Wanderlands

### Geography

The Wanderlands form the long southern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a great curved finger of land stretching southward into the South Sea. This diverse region is characterized by rolling plains, scattered forests, and rugged hill country, distinct from both the savannas of Central Aboyinzu to the north and the ancient rainforests of the Elderwilds to the east.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elderwilds peninsula; the South Sea separates them at the southern extent
- **South**: The South Sea
- **West**: Western coastline; the South Sea curves around the peninsula

#### Terrain

The Wanderlands encompass:
- **Dragonsong**: Mystical region with ancient forests
- **Grendenheim**: Pastoral meadows
- **Donclik Peninsula**: Windswept promontory extending into the Donclik Sound
- **The Troughs**: Deep canyons cutting through the landscape
- **Krinea Mikea**: Marshland in the lowlands
- Various hill ranges and moorlands (Karik Hills, Snakefoot Hills, Argum Hills, Eshire Moors)

#### Relationship to the South Sea

The South Sea lies to the west of the Elderwilds and north of the Wanderlands peninsula. This body of water separates the Wanderlands/Elderwilds region from the eastern Shacklands (Kyagos and surrounding areas). The peninsula's position makes it a crucial waypoint for maritime traffic between Aboyinzu and the slave-trading ports to the east.

## Elder Wilds

### Geography

The Elder Wilds occupy the entire eastern peninsula of Aboyinzu—a vast region of ancient rainforest, winding rivers, and primordial wilderness. This is one of the oldest and least tamed regions of the known world, where the jungle has grown undisturbed for millennia.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The South Sea and the waters separating Aboyinzu from the Shacklands
- **East**: Eastern coastline facing the Slumbering Abyss
- **South**: The Dalizi Highlands rise to the south
- **West**: The Wanderlands peninsula and the South Sea

#### Terrain

The Elder Wilds are dominated by massive rainforest—dense canopy, tangled undergrowth, and countless rivers cutting through the green expanse. The terrain is ancient and wild, with towering trees that predate human civilization. Notable features include:
- Extensive river systems threading through the jungle
- Ancient ruins hidden beneath the canopy
- Varied terrain from coastal lowlands to interior highlands

#### Relationship to Surrounding Regions

The Elder Wilds form a natural barrier between the Wanderlands to the west and the Dalizi Highlands/Dalizi confederation to the south. The South Sea provides water access to both the Wanderlands and the distant Shacklands across the strait.

### Political Climate

### Notable Locations

#### Everlong

Blue ruins, huge crumbling walls, labyrinthine. Blue/black lotus flowers grow throughout, inhabited by shadow hounds. Onyx crystal somewhere in the ruins.

#### Forest of Statues

An ancient, eerily silent expanse of the Elder Wilds where reality bends and time becomes a tangible force. The Forest of Statues is the site of **The Stillness**—a permanent Izzus (time) breach that has existed since the Lost Ages, creating one of the most dangerous and mysterious locations in Alaria.

##### The Stillness: A Temporal Breach

Within the forest, time flows in deeply inconsistent patterns. The breach itself is not localized to a single point but pervades the entire forest region, creating zones of accelerated, decelerated, and frozen time. Those who venture into the forest without understanding its nature face a horrifying fate: they slow down progressively, their movements becoming increasingly sluggish until they effectively become stone-like—frozen in moments that stretch for centuries from the outside world, yet feel like mere seconds from their own distorted perspective.

The statues that give the forest its name are victims of The Stillness—travelers, explorers, and adventurers who became trapped by the temporal anomaly, their bodies hardened and petrified by the strange forces at work. Some are centuries old; others are recent additions to the forest's grim collection.

##### The Time Witches

Over centuries, a society of witches and hags has learned to navigate The Stillness and exploit its power. These **time witches** possess an innate understanding of temporal flow—a gift or curse that allows them to move within the breach as others move through normal space. To outsiders, they appear to move impossibly fast, blurring between moments. They inhabit the forest and guard its secrets jealously.

The time witches have become custodians of a unique form of power: **time stones**—artifacts of concentrated Izzus energy that channel the breach's temporal manipulations. These stones are rare, precious, and tightly controlled by the witch communities. Those who possess them can influence time on localized scales, though the cost of such power is invariably steep.

##### Ciri the Time Witch

Among the time witches, **Ciri** stands out as a legendary figure—ancient, powerful, and possessor of one of the most potent time stones. She is said to have lived through multiple centuries of subjective experience while only decades passed in the outside world. Ciri has been known to accept capable and determined travelers as students, teaching them to navigate The Stillness and understand temporal magic. However, her price is steep: she demands a piece of her student's soul—a literal fragment of their essence—in exchange for knowledge that most could never acquire elsewhere.

Those who have trained under Ciri emerge transformed, bearing subtle marks of temporal affinity and understanding, but forever diminished in some ineffable way.

#### Seyiy

A centrally located hilly region within the Elder Wilds, notable for its dramatic terrain and treacherous waterways.

##### Archfalls

Moss-covered stone arches span throughout this waterfall-laden region, creating a maze of cascading water and ancient stonework. The slightest misstep sends travelers tumbling toward the abyss below. The water harbors brain-eating amoebae, and water hags lurk in the pools and mists.

The area teems with unusual wildlife—quad-winged dove-like creatures drift through the spray, while pterodactyls nest on the higher arches and hunt in the updrafts. The combination of dangerous fauna, deadly parasites, and treacherous footing makes Archfalls one of the most hazardous locations in the Elder Wilds.

## Dalizi Region

### Geography

The Dalizi region encompasses two distinct but related areas: the **Dalizi Confederation** (a collection of states) and the **Dalizi Highlands** (a mountainous geographic region). Both are defined by their relationship to **Lake Tonactlet Chitle**, the large central lake that serves as their geographic anchor.

#### The Two Dalizi

##### Dalizi (Confederation)

A massive confederation of states occupying the territory **mostly northwest, and also west/southwest** of Lake Tonactlet Chitle. This is a political entity—a collection of allied or federated states sharing cultural and economic ties. The confederation represents one of the largest political bodies in southern Aboyinzu.

##### Dalizi Highlands

A mountainous highland region positioned **north and northeast** of Lake Tonactlet Chitle. This is a geographic designation referring to the elevated, rugged terrain east of the main confederation. The Highlands are characterized by peaks, valleys, and difficult terrain.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Central Aboyinzu, the Chechol region, and the interior savanna
- **East**: The Elder Wilds peninsula
- **South**: Dragon's Spine mountains
- **West**: Central Aboyinzu and the Morygun Mountains

#### Lake Tonactlet Chitle

The defining geographic feature of the region—a large lake that serves as the boundary marker between the Dalizi Confederation (to its west/northwest/southwest) and the Dalizi Highlands (to its north/northeast). The lake and its surrounding territories form the cultural and economic heart of the Dalizi peoples.

### Political Climate

### What Makes It Interesting

TODO

### Notable Locations

#### The Eastern Forest

A massive ancient forest stretches east of the Dalizi Confederation, between the confederation proper and the Elder Wilds. This wilderness is home to numerous leyline intersections and ancient powers.

##### Terwin Lake

A lake within the eastern forest, positioned on a force leyline near where it intersects with a void leyline. The convergence of these two fundamental magical forces creates an area of extreme supernatural power and danger.

###### Cynker's Den

The hidden headquarters of Cynker, a mastermind of dimensional travel who has achieved paragon attunement to force magic. His lair is home to clawed nymph and rusalka-like creatures with adept control over force magic—likely his creations or servants. The convergence of force and void leylines at this location allows Cynker to manipulate dimensional boundaries, enabling him to pull off impossible heists by teleporting objects (and himself) across vast distances or even between planes.

The den itself is protected by spatial distortions and force barriers that make approach nearly impossible for those not specifically invited.

###### Kroikylo's Tomb

Located at the exact intersection of the force and void leylines on Terwin Lake, Kroikylo's Tomb is one of the most dangerous dungeons in Alaria. The burial place of Kroikylo, an ancient mage who mastered both force and void magic, the tomb is filled with lethal traps that combine both disciplines—crushing force fields that appear from nowhere, spatial rifts that tear flesh from bone, and void zones that simply erase matter.

Despite the extreme danger, the tomb draws adventurers seeking the legendary void stones said to be buried with Kroikylo—crystallized fragments of pure void that grant mastery over space and nothingness to those who can wield them without being consumed.

##### Mirror Lake

Deep within the Eastern Forest lies Mirror Lake, a body of water with a surface so perfectly still and reflective that it appears as polished glass. It is believed that if you can find your reflection in the lake's mirrored surface, you will see your true self—and within that reflection, discover your true name. Many seekers have journeyed to Mirror Lake in search of this revelation, though few claim to have succeeded in glimpsing what the waters reveal.

#### Northeastern Forests

The forests in the northeastern reaches of the Dalizi region are known for their strange magical phenomena.

##### Reflection Lakes

A cluster of interconnected lakes scattered throughout the northeastern Dalizi forests. These lakes possess a remarkable property: stepping into one lake can cause you to instantly reemerge from a different lake up to 50 miles away. The teleportation is unpredictable—there is no way to control which destination lake you will emerge from, making the Reflection Lakes both a potential shortcut and a serious hazard.

Travelers have been known to step into a lake seeking to cross a small body of water, only to emerge miles away in hostile territory or completely lost. The lakes reflect each other not just in name but in essence—what happens in one ripples across the network in ways both mundane and magical.

Rather than go to Celestia, powerful dark elven leaders preferred to remain on the material plane. Like daemons of Celestia, the spirits in these totems still have power. Unlike spirits of Celestia, they will not fade upon being forgotten. Those who find their true names are likely to be showered in power as thanks.

Within the forest live the Luma, crystaline and irridescent pixies that live among the upper reaches of the forest, and the Shyoka Saseidi, gnomish caretakers of the forest.

### Nykotheryx Amberylika

Tags: forest, geography

A large ancient forest region in the Dalizi Wildlands, positioned north of the Dragon's Spine mountains and east of the Dalizi Confederation proper. The forest is known for its dream-attuned magical properties and otherworldly phenomena.

#### Real Forest

The Real Forest lies in the northern reaches of Nykotheryx Amberylika, notorious for its reality-warping properties. During fall, the pollen from the trees causes dreams and reality to intermingle—travelers cannot tell if they are awake or asleep. The disorientation is so complete that people can wander for days convinced they are dreaming when they are awake, or vice versa.

The forest is home to the Pine Jester, a wild, mischievous spirit that delights in tormenting confused travelers. The Pine Jester is unkillable so long as the forest itself lives—it is bound to the forest's essence and will regenerate from any harm.

#### Dreamlake

North of the main Nykotheryx Amberylika forest, just south of the Real Forest, lies Dreamlake—a body of water with profound magical properties. Drinking from the lake allows you to interact far more vividly with your dreams, experiencing them with perfect clarity and control. More remarkably, those who drink the water can enter and interact with other people's dreams, creating shared dreamscapes or invading the private dreams of others.

Dream-mages and mystics make pilgrimages to Dreamlake to enhance their oneiromantic abilities, though the power comes with risks—some who drink too deeply find themselves unable to distinguish waking from dreaming even after the water's effects should have faded.

## Dragon's Spine Coast

### Geography

Dragon's Spine is the long, misty, snow-covered mountain range that runs east-west across the entire southern edge of Aboyinzu. This is a cold, dramatic landscape—a stark contrast to the tropical and savanna regions to the north. The mountains eventually fragment into an archipelago stretching eastward, culminating in the Pindolin Islands.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dalizi Highlands and Dalizi Confederation; the Morygun Mountains connect from the northwest
- **East**: The range transitions into archipelago, extending to the Pindolin Islands
- **South**: The Crimson Coast lies below the mountains; beyond that, open southern ocean
- **West**: The southwestern coastline of Aboyinzu

#### Climate

Dragon's Spine is substantially colder than the rest of Aboyinzu, especially in its southernmost reaches. The high altitude and southern latitude combine to create a misty, often snow-covered environment. The peaks are frequently shrouded in cloud and fog, making navigation treacherous.

#### The Mountain-to-Archipelago Transition

As Dragon's Spine extends eastward, the continuous mountain range gradually breaks apart. The peaks become islands, the ridges become straits, until the mountains have fully transformed into the island chains of the eastern archipelago. The Pindolin Islands represent the farthest extent of this transition—the final fragments of Dragon's Spine scattered across the sea.

#### The Pindolin Islands

A large archipelago stretching east and then curving north into the ocean. These islands are the seaward continuation of the Dragon's Spine range, maintaining much of the cold, misty character of the mainland mountains.

### Implosion Mines

Tags: fortress, poi, mines, vimlus, the-collapse

The Implosion Mines are the ruins of an ancient dwarven civilization built around the manipulation of force leylines. The dwarves of this era were master engineers of Vimlus energy, using controlled implosions to delicately extract ore from the mountain without destabilizing the surrounding rock. Their techniques were precise—decades of accumulated knowledge allowed them to harness the force leyline's fluctuations for mining with surgical accuracy.

Everything changed around 20,000 BSD when catastrophe struck. **The Collapse**—a sudden and catastrophic destabilization of the Vimlus leyline beneath the city—shattered the delicate balance the dwarves had maintained. The force leyline breached violently, and in seconds, the entire civilization was annihilated. An entire mountain range folded inward upon itself, transforming into a massive crater of impossible destruction.

The ruins of the Implosion Mines remain trapped in a state of warped physics. Gravity itself pulls inward from all directions toward the center of the crater, as if the Collapse left behind a permanent wound in the natural order. Within the ruins, **Crushers** and **Gravity Wells** drift through the devastation—artifacts and creatures born from the residual Vimlus energy, moving in strange patterns as gravity warps around them. The site is simultaneously a monument to dwarven ingenuity and a grave marker for their hubris.

Most believe everyone died in the Collapse. Most believe this.

## Crimson Coast

### Geography

The Crimson Coast is the southernmost coastal region of Aboyinzu, positioned south of the Dragon's Spine mountains. This is a haunted land—marked by cursed waterways, mystical forests, and a dark history that permeates the very landscape.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Dragon's Spine mountains form an imposing barrier
- **East**: Eastern coastline
- **South**: Southern ocean
- **West**: Western coastline, wrapping around the southwestern tip of Aboyinzu

#### Character

The Crimson Coast takes its name from the dark history that stains the region. The River of Wights and the Pools of Tragedy speak to ancient tragedies and ongoing supernatural threats. Hilda's Forest contains the mysterious Hildaneir, and the entire region carries an atmosphere of foreboding.

#### Terrain

The coast features:
- Haunted waterways and cursed rivers
- Mystical forests with dangerous inhabitants
- Rolling hills
- Coastal territories divided among competing states

#### States

Several states control portions of the Crimson Coast:
- **Tangiern**
- **Klevnaf**
- **Istora**

These states maintain an uneasy existence in the shadow of Dragon's Spine, navigating both the supernatural threats of their homeland and the political pressures from the larger powers to the north.

### Notable Locations

#### Klevnaf

An elven kingdom on the Crimson Coast, positioned west of Istora (another elven kingdom). Klevnaf is divided by ancient conflict and civil war.

##### Murder Creek

A river that runs down the center of Klevnaf, dividing the kingdom in two. The creek is named after the murder of Ghy the Elder, the last king of the unified Winter Elves. Upon his death at this site, the country fractured into two rival kingdoms that have been locked in bitter conflict for centuries.

The creek itself is said to be cursed—the water runs dark, and those who drink from it are haunted by visions of Ghy's assassination. The kingdoms on either side of Murder Creek maintain fortified positions along its banks, ensuring that the geographic division mirrors the political one. Peace talks always fail when they reach the question of who controls the creek where their last unified king fell.
