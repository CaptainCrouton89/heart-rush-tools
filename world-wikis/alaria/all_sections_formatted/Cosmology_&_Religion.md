### About Alaria

The Alarian Planar Stack, also commonly known as Alaria, is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several planes, stacked on top of each other. 

### Geography of the Planes


### Material Plane

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies Celesté: the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

#### Celesté

Celesté was created when the Alarian Planar Stack fragmented and Ezz poured in from beyond. The material plane peeled apart and a new plane of conceptual existence was born. Emotion, free will, and thought poured into Alaria. Celesté is made of the coalescense  of thought/emotion/etc on the material plane. Where there is thought, there is a counterpart to the material planes.

### Astral Plane

"Above" the Material Plane is the Astral Plane. Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Aurus, living pawns of his will.

#### Astraeva

On the flip side of the Astral Plane is Astraeva. Astraeva mirrors the Astral Plane but is devoid of souls. Aurus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

### Malstaris

"Below" the Material Plane is Malstaris—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. The spirit cannot naturally survive here, but creatures exist here—just with weaker free will. They are agents of Nydus, living pawns of his will.

#### Eindumor

On its flip side of Malstaris is Eindumor. Eindumor mirrors Malstaris but is devoid of shadows. Nydus has no power here—spirits are weaker here—it is nearly barren except for a few notable points of interest. Psyic energy still exists here, but it is weak.

### Elemental Planes

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the elemental planes, each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

### Ethereal and Nethereal Planes

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the Ethereal and Nethereal Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

### Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry. 

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in Celesté. 

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of Malstaris would take you to Eindumor. 

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or Malstaris requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other planes is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the elemental planes, and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal Planes, none can sustain spirit, soul, or shadow.

### Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of Alaria. It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the planar stack. Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform magic on Alaria.

## Astral Plane

### Geography

The Astral Plane consists of a massive sea with floating islands, consisting of a special stone-like material that floats in Astral solution. Like icebergs, larger islands are cliff-edged, and tower into the sky, while smaller islands ride much lower. Huge disasters occur when an island rolls over due to the massiver earthquakes they deal with (due to structural instability). These quakes can cause astral stone to break free, showering down on the earth. 

The Astral Sea is filled with beautiful shining lights, which are the stars on the material plane. These lights were created by the titans. The Astral Sea is nearly opaque, which is why the giant islands high in the sky are not visible. The Astral Plane is lit up from above by Aurus, the White Sun, which illuminates all souls on the Astral Plane, but cannot penetrate down to the material plane through the Astral Sea.

No maps chart these lands, as the islands, as their locations are constantly changing.

Massive cities are built in these islands. 

#### The Astral Sea

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo mountain shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea. 

### The Soul

The soul is slightly influenced by astral currents in the astral sea, and good ship captains can sense them to navigate astral currents well.

The Astral Plane is illuminated by the Aurus, the White Sun (counterpart to Nydus, the Black Sun). Souls are illuminated in its light.

All souls of the living go to the Astral Plane upon death. The Astral Plane is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. *** is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the Astral Plane vie for his position.

### Fauna

##### Astral Sentinels
In the Astral Plane, massive ethereal creatures known as Astral Sentinels roam the islands. These creatures, remnants of forgotten celestial battles, are attracted to disturbances in psychic energy. They serve as both protectors and dangers to astral travelers.

##### Symbiots
Some inhabitants of the Astral Plane have developed a symbiotic relationship with astral creatures. These beings, known as Astral Weavers, use the threads of psychic energy to weave protective barriers or manipulate the weakened free will of other astral entities.

## Aurus, the White Sun

Tags: sun

Aurus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Nydus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, bright white spirit. He became the White Sun, up above the Astral Plane.

What the soul is made of.

Very slowly bobs around the sky above the Astral Plane. Its positive energy makes material plane warmer or cooler.

## Celesté

Tags: planes

The core of Celesté was created long before the entire plane was made. A pocket dimension was solidified as a safe haven from Nydus and Aurus, the titan gods. It is a plane that the titan Celesté created by sacrificing herself (titans normally can't die). This created a new dimension of her own. She swore that as long as the titans remembered her sacrifice, they would survive. And thus they did, because she granted them power from her plane. None of the titans could ever enter the plane unless they died, which no one else was willing to do. However she still protected them.

After the Ezz Rift, Ezz accumulated around Celesté, as it was the only location that resonated with Melera's song.

Celesté is the home of daemons. It is a reflection of the world but lacking any of the typical life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know Deoric, are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called daemons. 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the daemons who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a spirit—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your spirit. Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your true name and pray to you. Upon death, your spirit sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your shadow and soul behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your spirit, making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

Deoric does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane. 

Celesté is made of the the thoughts and beliefs of those who are alive. The world is shaped by the livings' understanding of it. You can faintly alter your own existence depending on your followers, though you are largely stuck at the whims of the living followers of the Material Plane.

## Elemental Planes

Tags: planes

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material planes (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial planes (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material planes. The layers closer to the material planes are more accessible to those on the material planes, whereas the elemental layers closer to Celesté and the other immaterial planes are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

Leylines are cracks in the planes where individual elemental planes spill through much closer to the material plane. Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental magic performed on leylines is always more fantastic.

Those layers are:

- Yolus (Fire)
- Sulus (Air)
- Golus (Earth)
- Pelus (Water)
- Vulus (Darkness)
- Kunus (Light)
- Nilus (Void)
- Izzus (Time)

Along certain lines across the land, these elemental planes bend much closer to the Material Plane. Those lines on which they bend closer are known as Leylines, and are locations where elemental magic relying on the corresponding element will be much more potent.

## Ethereal Plane

Tags: plane

A thin plane that overlays over all other planes within Alaria. Counterpart to the Nethereal Plane.

Within the Ethereal Plane, echoes of events from the Material Plane linger as ethereal imprints. Skilled individuals can access these echoes to witness glimpses of the past or gain insights into the future, creating a unique form of divination.

## Instruxofinum

Tags: planes, planar stack

Instruxofinum consists of billions of planes jammed tightly together, nearly perfectly frozen in time. Almost anything can be found there with enough searching.

## Life and Death

Tags: cosmology

A creature’s life is dictated by the health and union of their soul, shadow, and spirit. At the center of their being is their spirit, which is the spark of free will and personality that defines who they are. Wrapped on either side are the soul and shadow, the astral and malstaric counterbalances of the spirit, which together give life and movement to the spirit they are bound to. While still critical to life, they do not define who the person is.

#### The Soul

The soul is made of pure positive energy from Aurus, the White Sun. A long, faint strand of it stretches all the way back to the sun. It was created by Aurus. Only Alarian creatures are energized with a soul.

#### The Shadow

The shadow is made of pure negative energy from Nydus, the Black Sun. A long, faint strand of it stretches all the way back to the sun. It was created by Nydus. Only Alarian creatures are energized with a shadow.

#### The Spirit

One's spirit is made of pure ezz, pulled from the swirling mass throughout the planes. Living things with both thought and emotion all have some spirit-like core consisting mainly of ezz. Life-like things from other planar stacks may not have emotion, and will be "powered" by something other than a soul and shadow. For example, some life on other planar stacks is powered with Aether.

### Astral & Malstaric Thread

Binding the soul and shadow to the spirit is a creature’s astral and malstaric thread. If this thread is broken, the creature dies, and their newly freed soul and shadow float up and sink down to the Astral Plane and Malstaris respectively, while their spirit fades to Celesté.

If the thread is not broken but still damaged, it can nevertheless have serious effects on the life of that being. It can make one weaker to effects that would dominate ones spirit, and having part of the thread break completely could cause your soul or shadow to leave completely, sapping one of most of their life and energy. 

If a creature is missing its soul or shadow, its defenses against Deoric magic are drastically weakened, and makes it susceptible to death, mind control, or anything else the caster desires.

### Beings In Between

Various names are given to the creatures with different combinations of soul, shadow, and spirit. 

- Revenants
- Ghosts
- Shades
- Undead
- Specters
- Liches

## Malstaris

Tags: plane

Malstaric Rivers go through the land, which can sweep your shadow away.

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate Malstaris. There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in Malstaris, and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

Malstaris is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in Malstaris can cause strange interactions, as your soul is so far away, and your shadow so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made Malstaris their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids. 

High above Malstaris is Nydus, the Black Sun, spilling heavy darkness across the land.

## Material Plane

Tags: planes

The Material Plane is enormous, and consists of several different layers. On the top half is Belagria, consisting of the Surfacelands and the Underrealms. The surface lands are where most of "life" occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. The Underrealms, on the other hand, are a 200 mile thick crust of stone crisscrossed with tunnels and caves, and filled with mysteries and monsters.

As you travel deeper into the Underrealms, the downward pressure keeping your boots pressed to the ground grows weaker and weaker until you eventually reach Emphathum—a 100 mile stretch of weightlessness, filled with floating stones and absolute darkness.

If you down even further, your weight returns, but in the opposite direction from before. Now, you would be heading up, and would be in the second, lower half of the Material Plane—Phlethageros. Phlethageros is dominated by a Zylogmus Eternus, a massive maze, which eventually ends at the lower surface known as the Wastes—the Phlethagoran counterpart to the Surfacelands.


#### Emphathum

A region with zero gravity, massive floating rocks similar to asteroids, and almost no life. Few have ever crossed this. It is the space between the Underrealms and Zylogmus Eternus.

#### Phlethageros

The world on the underside of Belagria. Cruel, corrupted, and horrible, it is a brutal world.

##### Zylogmus Eternus

Millions of miles of labrythine passages stretching across the entire plane, for the entire 200 miles beneath the Wastes and Emphathum.

##### The Wastes

The barren, lava covered, poison-gas filled, tornado ridden surface of Phethageros. Nothing gets past this—a barrier between the demons above, and the prisoners of Zylogmus Eternus below. 

##### Stalactites of Geth

Massive, low hanging stalactites constantly pour forth lava from above the Wastes. Hundreds of thousands of demons live in these stalactites.

#### The Edges of the World

**North/South/East/West**: if you walk far enough in any of the cardinal direction, eventually you will wrap around the side of the world and into Celesté.

**Up**: Although it is difficult, by traveling directly up far enough, you eventually reach the Astral Sea, and then the Astral Plane itself. 

**Down**: Reaching Malstaris by foot is by all practical means—impossible. Instead, those who wish to journey there travel via Deoric magic.

## Nethereal Plane

Tags: plane

A thin plane that overlays over all other planes within Alaria. Counterpart to the Ethereal Plane.

Within the Nethereal Plane, echoes of events from the Material Plane linger as ethereal imprints. Skilled individuals can access these echoes to witness glimpses of the past or gain insights into the future, creating a unique form of divination.

## Nydus, the Black Sun

Tags: sun

Nydus is a still-living, titan god. Along with his brother Aurus, he was the first titan created. As a titan god, he could not be truly killed by the Ezz Rift. Instead, he dissolved, leaving nothing behind but his brilliant, dark spirit. It  He became the Black Sun, up above Malstaris.

The black sun that illuminates all of malstaris. Like Aurus, Nydus never sets. The light cast from Nydus is a dark illumination that barely illuminates one's shadow. Many things lie hidden in the dark. 

What one's shadow is made of.

## Planar Stack

Tags: cosmology

A planar stack is a collection of tightly grouped planes, usually holding strong connections to each other. 

A planar stack consists of a series of planes, clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, magic, and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a planar stack, to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.

### Major Planar Stacks

- Alaria
- Epyphiozath
- Instruxofinum

### Glyssen

Glyssen is a spherical ocean of whispers and insanity. Aberrant creatures roam across both the currents and time itself. No one has returned with their sanity intact.

### Klokas

Klokas is a vast void of empty space filled with huge demonic creatures floating through the skies. 

### Narglon

Completely dark, nothing can be seen in Narglon. Those who have returned have come back infected with the darkness itself. Like a horrible, infective liquid of nothingness.

## Planes

Tags: cosmology

Planes are scattered throughout the universe, in clumps called "Planar Stacks". Planes can be physically connected, but usually have differen't physics. Planes can sometimes have an inverse side. In reality, this is just a different plane. However, when the other plane holds a strong connection with one other plane, sometimes they are refered to as two sides of the same plane—with one being the "positive" side, and the other being "negative". test

## Specter

Tags: cosmology

When a soul and Spirit) and Spirit) or shadow is prevented from leaving the ethereal and nethereal planes—generally by necromatic magic, they become specters and undead. Lacking free will or much substance, they are slaves to their masters.

## Stars

Tags: cosmology

Built by the titans to illuminate the darkness of the world. The sun did not exist yet. No night and day yet, just eternal stars. Consist of glowing orbs, containing incredibly rare celestial glass, which emits lots of light. Taken care of by the Starborn, who live within the stars, tending to the magical cores.

Most famous among the Starborn is Koras, tender of the sun. Lives and maintains the star that is the sun, propelled by Bryn across the sky each day. Immune to the extreme heat from the sun. 

Above the star live Sarakiel civilizations—huge towers, usually not more than one per star, filled with Sarakiel. Some stars have gone out due to Xaphkiel smashing their cores, and taking them over. Also, among the stars lie super-high density sky-stones, which float incredibly high up.

## Suns

Tags: sun

There are three suns within Alaria, each over a different layer of the planar stack.

### List of Suns

- Nydus, the Black Sun
- Aurus, the White Sun
- Bryn

## Time and Seasons

Tags: sun, moon, stars

Sun passes around center strip every day, all year. No Tilt. 

Three moons pass over at various times throughout month.

Seasons come and go when followers convince Bryn to traverse a different trail across Alaria.

Stars are viewports for the gods. They can look down upon their subjects. Usually located above some place of importance to them.

Moon cycles: Two main moons, one has 11 day cycles, is used to tell what day of the week it is. Full moon once a week, on the start of the week. The other goes through a 23 day cycle, meaning about once every year there is one double full moon, and one moonless night, each important holidays. The year is 200 days long, split into eight, 25 day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice (no summer v winter with two hemispheres). 2 quarters spring, 2 quarters summer, 2 quarters fall, 2 quarters winter. When solstice (new year) coincides with a double full moon, or a double empty, it signals the beginning of a new age, occurring once every 25,300 years (~18,000 Earth Years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years. 

Moon phase is determined by location of Aurus and Nydus, the light and dark suns respectively. Moons tied to magic of Malstaric and Astral planes.  

Third, rogue moon, known as the Killing Moon. Looking upon it kills you. Comes up once every 8,000 years or so, but isn't consistent. Remains up for same duration, so can mean ~8,000 years of death. 

Years counted forward from 0 to 25,300, and then back down again. The suffix F or B stands for if time is going forward or backward. At 0 there is a double new moon during the northern-summer solstice/southern-winter solstice. At 25,300, there is a double full moon on new-year. Each marks the beginning of a new age. 

Moons aligning represents cycle of magic, whereas new year is cycle of nature. Moon elf, and other cultures who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidays—every 253 days on dual full moon, etc. 

Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to magic and more so to nature. Celebrations on first day of spring, new-year/solstice, last week of fall, and other solstice. Both are celebrated, though winter ones are more about trying to be cheerful in the face of winter.

Moon and Magic divinely intertwined.

#### 11 days of the week, starting at new moon, going to full, then waning again:

1. Cautious (new moon): Don't go out at night
2. Wakeday (waxing crescent): Made it to next week, can come out now
3. Patrons' Day: Thank your daemon
4. Moil
5. Marketday: Trading happens
6. Merrynight: Full moon, time to stay up late
7. Brightlove: More full moon, time for joy
8. Lazyday
9. Farewell: People leave to return home
10. Gather: Prepare (for fireday and cautious, but also just in general)
11. Fireday (waning crescent): Burn candles during hte night
