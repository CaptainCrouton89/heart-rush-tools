## Church of Margia

Tags: church

Leading church of Hephake. Very important to its people. Sister churches Church of Agril and Church of Nocci.

## Druids

Tags: race

The Druids are the forefathers of elves, and are also known as "greater elves". They do not die of natural causes, though they can still be killed from extreme injury. They are far more powerful, have pointier, longer ears. They were alive, and survived through the time of titans. They were alive before gaea, and still survive today (though in vastly fewer numbers).

Everything about them is grace. Merely looking at one causes shivers to go down one's spine. They are the epitome of beauty, wisdom, and grace. Looking into a druid's eyes results in being charmed.

Have pain walker companions.

## Elves of the Gray Order

Tags: faction

Worshippers of Hykravones. They believe his return is needed to reset society. 

Consists of Amverela elves, who believe that humans and the rabble need to be put down, even at great cost.

Have been searching for the Gray Prince for eons.

## First Brotherhood

Tags: faction

The First Brotherhood is the name given to the first dwarves, and the coalition they formed. At a time when the world was far more dangerous, even dwarves who left the clan to form their own settlement had to remain part of the brotherhood—sworn to the preservation of dwarves and the dwarven way.

Now, the First Brotherood is more nominal than anything else. It's like the dwarven world union—in support of dwarves everywhere, but requiring membership fees, and sometimes not with everone's best interests in mind. And, citizens of the three city states of Üod, Blvnird, and Melaia are the only ones allowed to be leaders of the union.

## House of the Second Sun

Tags: city

The House of the Second Sun is a towering city built around the two massive pillars holding up the enormous glowing orb over the Astral Sea, which appears as a second, smaller sun. The palace is home to Gihatti, the king of the Astral Plane.

## Pain Priests

Tags: faction

Traveling priests. 

Take people's pain away for them. It doesn't heal, but it easers their journy towards death. They are highly devout.

## Pity Knights

Tags: order

An ancient order of lich hunters. They had questionable means of fighting liches (using Deoric themselves—see the Whispering Isles), but they were very successful. 

THe order collapsed when one of the members used the deep knowledge of fighting liches to become a powerful and even more death-resistant lich themselves. This man is Xynoth Azkonor

## Soldiers of the Third Eye

The order seeks to maintain the systems and people involved in the transferral of slaves to be sacrificed for Deoric magic. Members incldue the Sylke queen, various merchants of Bonnetaz, and several dragons, among others.

## The Way Watchers

## Way Watchers

Tags: faction

A group of archers committed entirely to bettering their abilities in archery through "hunt" and "sport". This results in them tracking and killing powerful foes that they feel are largely unchallenged or too intimidating for others to fight as well as seeking out renouned archers that they can recruit or at least learn from. A Way Watcher on their would be considered slightly above or bellow the power of a hero or experienced adventurer but in a group their competency soars to frightening heights.
