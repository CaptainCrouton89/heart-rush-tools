## Church of Margia

Tags: church

Leading church of Hephake. Very important to its people. Sister churches Church of Agril and Church of Nocci.

## Druids

Tags: race

The Druids are the forefathers of elves, and are also known as "greater elves". They do not die of natural causes, though they can still be killed from extreme injury. They are far more powerful, have pointier, longer ears. They were alive, and survived through the time of titans. They were alive before gaea, and still survive today (though in vastly fewer numbers).

Everything about them is grace. Merely looking at one causes shivers to go down one's spine. They are the epitome of beauty, wisdom, and grace. Looking into a druid's eyes results in being charmed.

Have pain walker companions.

## Elves of the Gray Order

Tags: faction

Worshippers of Hykravones. They believe his return is needed to reset society. 

Consists of Amverela elves, who believe that humans and the rabble need to be put down, even at great cost.

Have been searching for the Gray Prince for eons.

## First Brotherhood

Tags: faction

The First Brotherhood is the name given to the first dwarves, and the coalition they formed. At a time when the world was far more dangerous, even dwarves who left the clan to form their own settlement had to remain part of the brotherhood—sworn to the preservation of dwarves and the dwarven way.

Now, the First Brotherood is more nominal than anything else. It's like the dwarven world union—in support of dwarves everywhere, but requiring membership fees, and sometimes not with everone's best interests in mind. And, citizens of the three city states of Üod, Blvnird, and Melaia are the only ones allowed to be leaders of the union.

## House of the Second Sun

Tags: city

The House of the Second Sun is a towering city built around the two massive pillars holding up the enormous glowing orb over the Astral Sea, which appears as a second, smaller sun. The palace is home to Gihatti, the king of the Astral Plane.

## The Moonwatchers

Tags: cult, lunar, killing moon, apocalyptic

The Moonwatchers—sometimes called Lunarchs in their own liturgy—are a secretive cult dedicated to the Killing Moon. They believe the Third Moon was real, that it was unjustly destroyed or banished, and that its return will transform Alaria forever.

### Beliefs

The cult's core doctrine holds that the Third Moon still exists somewhere beyond the planar stack, damaged but not destroyed. The destabilization periods that plague Alaria every several thousand years are not random cosmic events—they are the Third Moon trying to return home. Each time, it gets a little closer. Each time, it is pushed back.

Most Moonwatchers believe the Third Moon's eventual return will bring a great cleansing—the weak will die, the corrupt will be scoured away, and those who remained faithful will inherit a purified world. Some sects interpret this more mystically: the Third Moon's return will dissolve the boundaries between planes entirely, allowing mortals to ascend to a higher form of existence.

A minority faction within the cult believes the Third Moon doesn't want to return at all—it is *hiding*, and the destabilization periods are its death throes as it slowly expires in the void. These Moonwatchers seek to find and heal the Third Moon, not summon it.

### Practices

**The Blindfold Covenant:** Many Moonwatchers keep one eye permanently covered—bandaged, patched, or ritually blinded. The covered eye is "saved" for the Third Moon's return, preserved to witness what no mortal has seen in millennia. Senior cultists sometimes blind both eyes entirely, claiming to see more clearly through faith.

**Crescent Scarification:** Initiates receive ritual scars in crescent patterns—typically on the forearm, shoulder blade, or scalp. The number and arrangement of crescents indicates rank and sect affiliation.

**Hollownight Gatherings:** The cult's most important rituals occur on Hollownight, when both Auris and Nyxara are absent from the sky. On these darkest of nights, Moonwatchers gather in high places to "call" the Third Moon back, chanting prayers toward the empty sky. Orthodox doctrine holds that the Third Moon can only return when enough faithful call for it simultaneously.

**Moonstone Veneration:** Moonwatchers collect and trade fragments they believe fell from the original Third Moon. These "moonstones" vary wildly—some are clearly ordinary rocks, others are strange meteorites, and a few are genuinely anomalous materials that scholars cannot identify. The most prized moonstones glow faintly on Hollownight or cause unease in those who hold them.

### Organization

The Moonwatchers have no central leadership. Individual cells operate independently, connected by traveling preachers called **Heralds** who carry news, doctrine, and moonstones between groups. This decentralization makes the cult nearly impossible to stamp out—destroying one cell does nothing to the others.

**Sects** differ in their interpretation of what the Third Moon's return will mean:
- **The Cleansed** believe in purifying apocalypse
- **The Transcendent** believe in planar dissolution and ascension
- **The Mourners** believe the Third Moon is dying and must be saved
- **The Wrathful** believe the Third Moon was murdered and demands vengeance on those responsible (they disagree on who that might be)

### The Deadmoon Connection

The Deadmoon Tribe of Moonwood may be connected to the Moonwatchers—either as the cult's original founders who grew disillusioned, or as survivors of a Killing Moon period who rejected worship of what killed their ancestors. The relationship is unclear, and both groups refuse to discuss it.

### Threat Assessment

Most governments consider the Moonwatchers a nuisance rather than a genuine threat. Their apocalyptic beliefs seem delusional, their rituals harmless, their membership small.

However, the cult has been implicated in several concerning incidents:
- Assassination of astronomers who publicly denied the Third Moon's existence
- Sabotage of observatories and destruction of celestial records
- Attempted rituals involving mass sacrifice "to feed the returning moon"
- Theft of genuine anomalous artifacts that may actually be fragments of something

The Moonwatchers believe absolutely in what they're doing. That makes them unpredictable—and in the wrong circumstances, dangerous.

### For Players

Moonwatcher NPCs might serve as:
- Informants on obscure celestial lore
- Antagonists pursuing dangerous rituals
- Unlikely allies against threats to "their" moon
- Sources of genuine moonstones with strange properties
- Madmen, true believers, or something in between

A Moonwatcher PC would be unusual but playable—someone who believes the world is ending (eventually) and has complicated feelings about it.

## Pain Priests

Tags: faction

Traveling priests. 

Take people's pain away for them. It doesn't heal, but it easers their journy towards death. They are highly devout.

## Pity Knights

Tags: order

An ancient order of lich hunters. They had questionable means of fighting liches (using Deoric themselves—see the Whispering Isles), but they were very successful. 

THe order collapsed when one of the members used the deep knowledge of fighting liches to become a powerful and even more death-resistant lich themselves. This man is Xynoth Azkonor

## Soldiers of the Third Eye

Tags: faction

Tattoo of the eye on ack of hand. All time attuned, very powerful mercaneries. Can foresee strategic outcomes, nasty opponents. Are neutral.

## The Ivory Hand

Tags: faction

The Ivory Hand is an incredibly secretive, and equally powerful organization of people who pull many of the strings behind the scenes across the world. The order seeks to maintain the systems and people involved in the transferral of slaves to be sacrificed for Deoric magic. Members incldue the Sylke queen, various merchants of Bonnetaz, and several dragons, among others.

## The Way Watchers

Tags: poi

## Way Watchers

Tags: faction

A group of archers committed entirely to bettering their abilities in archery through "hunt" and "sport". This results in them tracking and killing powerful foes that they feel are largely unchallenged or too intimidating for others to fight as well as seeking out renouned archers that they can recruit or at least learn from. A Way Watcher on their would be considered slightly above or bellow the power of a hero or experienced adventurer but in a group their competency soars to frightening heights.
