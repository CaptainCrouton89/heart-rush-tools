### Mournful Wood

Extremely hazardous forest. You cry during the night, and your eyes seal shut as the tears solidify. People come out with tear stains crystalized down their fronts. Horrifying.

### Hagswood

A dark forest at the southwest tip of Chaal Nazzerox, home to a coven of hags who terrorize the surrounding waters.

#### Nightport

Hags from Hagswood leave from this eternally darkness-shrouded harbor. They venture out into the Strait of Curses when looking for prey or to communicate with the serpents that live there.

#### Strait of Curses

The waters south of Xabraedia and north of Hagswood are known as the Strait of Curses, named for the hags who prowl these treacherous waters. The strait is also inhabited by large, nasty serpents known as Silkwurms—creatures that can wrap entire ships in silk and knot them to the seafloor, dragging vessels and crews to their doom. The hags of Hagswood maintain an uneasy alliance with these serpents, communicating with them and occasionally working together to claim victims.

### Grayfang Mountains

Home to the Grayfang Goblins, goblins who use stone attunement to augment various teeth in their mouths to enormous size. Although many choose to enlarge their incisors, there is a wide range of teeth chosen, including versions where one's two front teeth are combined into a single, very large fang.

### Throatslit Mountains

Home to the Throatslit Murder Clan, a clan descendent from a single goblin. The clan has ruled the area around the mountains for ages due to their extreme skill and viciousness with simple knives.

## Secret Mountains

Tags: mountains

A small range of mountains south of Windor, where a halfling infamously kept secret a massive goldmine in the hills for nearly a decade. The gold has long been mined out and the mines abandoned, but the story remains legend.

## Smokey Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A range of hills south of Poum Titch, east of Aal Salma, and north of Chaal Nazzerox that have ceaselessly billowed smoke and ash for decades. The cause remains a mystery—theories range from massive forges inside the hills (operated by dwarves, goblins, or cyclops) to ongoing volcanic activity.

The hills are inhabited by the Firesworn, who have adapted to life amid the constant smoke and heat. The perpetual haze makes the region dangerous to navigate, and the true nature of what produces the endless smoke remains unknown.
